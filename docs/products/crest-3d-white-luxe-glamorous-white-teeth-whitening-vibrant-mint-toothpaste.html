            <li>Gives a very nice shade boost and has an exceptionally good flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very strong taste of something chemical!</li>

            <li>I use this every 2 or so days, keeps my teeth bright.</li>
            <li>This is a good toothpaste.</li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>But they had a really good coupon</li>
            <li>Is good</li>
            <li>Try it or buy it for a loved one</li>
            <li>will say that this stuff has good flavor.  </li>
            <li>Good quality and as it showen in the picture</li>
            <li>This keeps my teeth fairly clean-looking.</li>
            <li>I get this about every two months from Amazon and good price.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and there were sooo many great views</li>
            <li>It has a great refreshing taste.</li>
            <li>I havebeen very satisfied with Crest</li>
            <li>LOVE this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Target has a better price!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>man they are soooo much better!  </li>
            <li>(strips every 8 months or so) and I love them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have used this!</li>
            <li>This works better than the strips, no joke!</li>
            <li>Always love this product!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is amazing.</li>
            <li>so this is an amazing alternative .</li>
            <li>I liked the price too.</li>
            <li>The combination seems to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Honest...</li>
            <li>My teeth look whiter since I use it and it has a nice flavour</li>
            <li>Nice taste, and doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth.</li>
            <li>I would imagine that any effective teeth whitening formula could erode tooth enamel eventually.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how this product removed 90% of my surface stains in just 5 days.</li>
            <li>Great taste, not too sweet or too minty.</li>
            <li>Good tooth paste, but the whitening power is not as strong as I would like.</li>
            <li>PERFECT AND FAST DELIVERY :)</li>
            <li>flavor isnt very good, but I don&#x27;t really care about the flavor of my toothpaste...</li>
            <li>Great fresh minty flavor.</li>
            <li>As far as whitening goes this product is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if you used this along with the strips, you&#x27;d get amazing results.</li>
            <li>I love love love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>It tastes fine, and really does an excellent cleaning job.</li>
            <li>Great taste, really works!  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste has a very fresh, vibrant and delicious taste.  </li>
            <li>The taste is pleasant, and it does a good job with cleaning my teeth, but any old toothpaste can do that.</li>
            <li>If your teeth are yellow, it may not be the best option for whitening.  </li>
            <li>This is great toothpaste and it really works.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it tastes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed all the Crest 3D Whitening Products.</li>
            <li>and they are so so so cheap!</li>
            <li>My husband also uses this tooth paste and it is still able to remove the stains off his teeth event through he smokes and drinks coffee.</li>
            <li>Gradual whitening, love this product.</li>
            <li>This makes me brush my teeth way more than I ever have....</li>
            <li>I like this better than the one that removes 80% of stains.</li>
            <li>I love it and we will continue using it in this house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this toothpaste shows results with even ONE use, so I&#x27;m glad my dentist gave me a sample to try</li>
            <li>I use it in the mornings and then use Crest&#x27;s Pro-Health toothpaste in the evenings for healthy gums.  </li>
            <li>Okay-</li>
            <li>About 5 yesterday afternoon my top lip started to swell.</li>
            <li>Keep your smile bright and this is way to go</li>
            <li>i love it ....</li>
            <li>i will order more...</li>
            <li>Google it if you want to be sure...</li>
            <li>works great removes stains as stated and plus the taste is really fresh and light</li>
            <li>i will buy again :)</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I love the taste and seems to whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still impressed and will continue using it so they don&#x27;t go back to the way they were.</li>
            <li>I really love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The whole family loves this toothpaste, my daughter isn&#x27;t a fan of anything mint but loves this toothpaste because of how great her teeth feel after.</li>
            <li>But after a news report today and more research online the discovery that polyethelene is used as &amp;#34;decorative&amp;#34;  dots inside the paste has given me recourse to stop usage immediately.  </li>
            <li>And will save a lot more money and my mouth.</li>
            <li>After months of coffee, this product was able to noticably whiten my teeth by a shade in about two weeks.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it until I find something that works better.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I bought it:)</li>
            <li>just love the way my teeth feel after I brush with this tooth paste</li>
            <li>her breath has me asking for more.</li>
            <li>We love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Love this tooth paste.</li>
            <li>It works even better when used with the mouthwash</li>
            <li>Most whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this, and after about 5 days, my teeth were looking better.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>I always buy it and am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I dont believe they make the toothpaste safe to use.</li>
            <li>I just started using it so, I&#x27;m not 100% sure how to take it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; type of person.</li>
            <li>The colored polyethylene (PE) specks used in our oral care products are safe, FDA approved food additives.</li>
            <li>Read more at http://www.snopes.com/medical/drugs/crest.asp#1kBajIeMIIEyWVyQ.99    </li>
            <li>Hope this helps others gain a better perspective on this product line.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on my teeth when I use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I can just use the whitening tooth paste and it seems to be able to help maintain the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best to change it up before in the long run</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m switching back to my Arm &amp; Hammer which I honestly always felt great using.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter, and after brushing in the morning my teeth feel clean all day!</li>
            <li>My teeth are clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sweet....</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed the fact you can &amp;#34;clip a coupon&amp;#34; on Amazon and enjoy the additional discounts.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job without making my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>It didnt whiten as much as I would like but its a good toothpaste.</li>
            <li>After a little bit of research, I can say that it would be best to stay away from these products until they are removed and replaced with better, \\&quot;safer\\&quot; alternatives.</li>
            <li>Not bad for a woman that smoked for over 20 years!</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a whitening product but wasn&#x27;t too keen on painting on gel or mouth guards or strips or anything having to sit in my mouth, I knew if it wasn&#x27;t easy, I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>Even so, I love the way my teeth feel so clean when I do use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the advanced seal white strips and they work incredibly well in terms of whitening, but they make my teeth hurt for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This leaves a strong residue on my tooth brush if there is any trace of paste not washed off.</li>
            <li>Strongly reccomend for customers.</li>
            <li>It has a strong minty/menthol taste.</li>
            <li>This Product is great and works very well, and this is the product I&#x27;ve been looking for, for the right price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Toothpaste seems fine</li>
            <li>I now a fan and will be a loyal customer to this product!</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li>In five days I could see a huge difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>it also has a great mint flavor and a gritty texture.</li>
            <li>After you eat and drink stains will come back, however this is great toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re \\&quot;white\\&quot; enough for my taste, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity while using this.</li>
            <li>Regardless, this product does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>I have tried several whitening toothpastes but haven&#x27;t really been impressed with them.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know if the results will be as good as the strips, but so far it&#x27;s a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, my mouth feels fresh and clean when I&#x27;m done brushing.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say if it was the combination of changes, or one of the parts in particular that caused the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made my teeth clean, whiter and my breath very fresh.</li>
            <li>It showed a significant difference in my smile within 5 or 6 days!  </li>
            <li>there is a significant effect</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any significant difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>It helps to whiten my teeth, and makes my breath feel fresh!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read warnings and reviews stating that consistent use of this  abrasive product might be damaging to enamel, but for now I will continue to use it until I am satisfied with the whitening results.</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth with a clean, fresh feeling that lasts!</li>
            <li>It leaves our mouths feeling nice and clean better than most other toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I have tried the strips and do love them but honestly think that using the tooth paste alone is enough.</li>
            <li>For a daily toothpaste, I have found that Crest 3D Glamorous toothpaste is the best that I have used thus far.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth refreshed and clean feeling... something I expect in a toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel as clean as a cleaning at the dentist office.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>my teeth feel clean and i like the taste.</li>
            <li>Love procter&#x27;s products, nice breath and 3d white works.</li>
            <li>Gets your teeth clean but can&#x27;t say it made mine any whiter.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste on its own works great when used at least twice a day.</li>
            <li>wow, i love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>Ask the special lady in my life.</li>
            <li>Whitening effect is very good, brush a few days</li>
            <li>Within a week my teeth are bright white.</li>
            <li>Yes this works, you&#x27;ll see the difference real quick and its very tasty</li>
            <li>Overall, good buy.</li>
            <li>But now that I&#x27;m kind of an adult I&#x27;ve learned that fluoride, which is pretty much the reason to use toothpaste, needs to stay on your teeth to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t make your teeth bright white like the strips do, but good daily alternative.</li>
            <li>see immediate results and have the super dentist clean feeling without the leftover grit from there cleaning paste.</li>
            <li>super clean teeth and whiter, too.</li>
            <li>Important to not swallow the toothpaste and to rinse your mouth out with fresh water afterwards.  </li>
            <li>And it said it whitens in just 1 day, but I don&#x27;t find that true.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Good for whitening as well as overall health of teeth.</li>
            <li>This is one of those rare moments when I&#x27;m not disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The taste is very fresh and clean and it really does whiten!  </li>
            <li>Taste was fine and it did exactly what it was proclaimed to do.</li>
            <li>Now I have no pains or anything and still a clean smile.</li>
            <li>ahhhh fresh and clean</li>
            <li>The next best thing to white strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Schmoe</li>
            <li>While I am sure they are somewhat whiter than before, they are not &amp;#34;glamorous white.&amp;#34;  Overall, I am satisfied with the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Great really made my teeth white!</li>
            <li>If I use another toothpaste, they start getting more and more yellow, so yes, it works!!!</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how quickly this worked.</li>
            <li>I am super anal about the whiteness of my teeth</li>
            <li>I have pretty light teeth</li>
            <li>It costs more than twice as much as normal toothpaste, yet people still rave that they bought it \\&quot;on sale!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would live up to all it claimed to do</li>
            <li>I think the chemicals in this toothpaste are much too strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously the first step was a good teeth whitening toothpaste but the second step was using a spin brush!!!  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste really works!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, works fine as just toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Worth it,</li>
            <li>I have noticed that this helps make my smile brighter and whiter.  </li>
            <li>I think buying this product is worth the price differential vs. the Crest product that whitens up to 80%.  </li>
            <li>Just... Fresh.</li>
            <li>Doesnt seem like worth the price</li>
            <li>Its worth a try for the price.</li>
            <li>the toothpaste fixed 99.999% of the stains on my bottom set and 50% on the top set</li>
            <li>This item is as the same as I expected and with a great value also!</li>
            <li>It does make your mouth feel fresh too.  </li>
            <li>but I saw it for sale for 3.99 and bought it because I thought four dollars was worth the risk.</li>
            <li>I rarely drink coffee, but did during a week away from home because I was attending a conference.  </li>
            <li>I kind of went on a mission to get rid of my plaque and whiten my teeth in a short time frame before I flew home to see my family.  </li>
            <li>It is worth its money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this daily for exactly three weeks, and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It helps remove surface stains and keeps your teeth nice and white.</li>
            <li>feels good but not really whitened...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>I like the taste and how fresh it smells.</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth not only whiter but also very clean!</li>
            <li>And it leaves an awesome smell in the mouth for several hours as well.&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended over the other brands like Colgate, Aquafresh and AZ</li>
            <li>This stuff DOES whiten and brighten and it really makes my teeth feel dentist office fresh!  </li>
            <li>two days after using both products I have a much whiter smile!  </li>
            <li>takes off coffee stains if used right away.</li>
            <li>but I could see a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>And she was right about it.</li>
            <li>It tastes very minty, cool, and has a fresh sensation after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I had several people mention how nice my teeth looked, and I didn&#x27;t buy it the first time specifically to whiten my teeth but because it was on sale.</li>
            <li>I normally use the Crest 3D in Radiant Mint, but thought Vibrant Mint would be more powerful.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be good to try a new toothpaste for whitening, and was hoping to maybe get a tiny bit of plaque off...</li>
            <li>Great whitening with very little effort.</li>
            <li>On top of that I love the fresh flavor the toothpaste leaves after brushing and it lasts for quite a few hours.</li>
            <li>This is the only whitening toothpaste that actually works and is a great value for that.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers a reasonable price and I love the subscribe and save shipping.</li>
            <li>I bought the cheapest Oral B spin brush on here &amp; extra brushes so my whole family has their own brush to stick on the toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I felt as though my breath stayed fresher for longer, leading to an increase in love from my better half!</li>
            <li>I am very particular about my toothpaste, it has to really make my teeth feel clean</li>
            <li>like it very much.</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li>Keeps my pearlie whites pearlie white :)</li>
            <li>Works after the first day.</li>
            <li>I use it with hydrogen peroxide which really kicks it up a notch!</li>
            <li>I believe once your body gets used to something consistent</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t see consistent results.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I think the best whitening is done at the dentist or with those expensive teeth whitening kits.</li>
            <li>Does an excellent job and doesn&#x27;t taste weird.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands of toothpaste before and this one is one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I immediately noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>My husband smokes and this was the first toothpaste that removed the yellowness from it</li>
            <li>This is my first review</li>
            <li>Really does whiten your within a week, without irritation!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone interested in it.</li>
            <li>I first sampled this toothpaste when my dentist gave me a sample to take home after my cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about the noticeable whitening in 5 days, but I was thoroughly impressed with the results!</li>
            <li>Today was my first time using the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>However, this brand whitened just after my first use.</li>
            <li>After using this consistently, I noticed that the side of my chin</li>
            <li>My skin only got better when I switched toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews but decided to write my first on this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>so much that I have my fiance using it too!</li>
            <li>works really well!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also want to point out that the Advanced Vivid is NOT discontinued (at time of this post anyway) and is easily found in any local pharmacy, amazon, and ebay!</li>
            <li>especially when it does such a good job whitening.</li>
            <li>I used it first when I got for 5-6 days straight morning and night and my teeth and gums started to become sensative</li>
            <li>I think this is affective so long as you do your part of sipping coffee with a straw to avoid contact with your teeth and so on, if you dont do those things to save your teeth then you will need to use these products more often.</li>
            <li>This will remove pretty much any surface stains that you may have from food, coffee, wine, etc., but it won&#x27;t do miracles.  </li>
            <li>Its great if you want to white your theeth a little bit,its certainly works!..</li>
            <li>The Rembrandt was pretty poor in my opinion, despite great reviews.  </li>
            <li>you can handle strong tooth paste and a wicked mint flavor, this is definitely the toothpaste to add to your oral regime!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only going to be in school for probably sub 2 years, and this will probably last me most of those years!</li>
            <li>Not to much whiter</li>
            <li>It cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>It really does feel like my teeth have just been cleaned.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really abrasive either--it doesn&#x27;t scratch or hurt my gums at all.  </li>
            <li>Just used 1 whole tube but didn&#x27;t notice any difference in whitening.</li>
            <li>my teeth brushing leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>I really saw results fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for 3 days and my whole mouth hurts.</li>
            <li>My husband will try it now, that will be the real test.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste ...</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t expect the paste to chap my lips so much.</li>
            <li>Fast and got on time as they promised.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ll have to see after time if this product really does make our teeth whiter.</li>
            <li>I try to avoid plastic as much as I can...</li>
            <li>Yes it does work really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a few family members to switch to this product after they started noticing my brighter smile. :)</li>
            <li>When compared to a normal toothpaste it is fine, but I used the entire bottle and saw no improvement on whitening of teeth.</li>
            <li>Most other tubes of toothpaste I&#x27;ve used have this.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is a staple in my white clean teeth arsenal.</li>
            <li>I like to save it to use before heading out on a date or a special event instead of my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>FEEL this clean after brushing, other than right after a dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and can barely tell a difference in the whiteness of my smile.</li>
            <li>First use, I noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;The 1 star reviews saying their teeth hurt scared me, but maybe they have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Really thorough in terms of the protections offered and excellent daily use toothpaste you can&#x27;t go wrong with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Check out my full review of Crest 3D white products here:&lt;br /&gt;[...</li>
            <li>Third morning i swiped my toothbrush around and it felt like I had amouth full of battery acid.</li>
            <li>I bought the smaller size for school, as I&#x27;m moving onto my campus dorm and don&#x27;t want to lug around a full sized tube.</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;ve used Vivid White for so long and have spread the good word across the globe about how white it has kept my teeth and now it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s because i&#x27;ve been using some natural toothpaste for a few months, but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your teeth super unbelievably white</li>
            <li>I love the 3d line of crest products, I use this with the white strips and always get compliments on how white my teeth are!</li>
            <li>I am a full time smoker, drink hot coffee till the pot is empty, iced coffee, iced tea and sodas the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste next to Rembrandt and Amazon subscribe and save is cheaper than my local stores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Opalescence was decent.  </li>
            <li>product contains silica, so is more gritty then regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>After some inquiry, she discovered they were from toothpaste, mainly those used for \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; purposes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this over whitening strips.</li>
            <li>highly recommend using a spin brush along with this toothpaste for optimal results.</li>
            <li>I would love to try other items in the line as well to see if I can get my teeth even whiter without having to pay for a professional treatment.</li>
            <li>Went on Ebay and bought a case of tried and true Vivid White!</li>
            <li>I like the minty flavor, and it keeps my mouth and breath feeling fresh and clean for a few hours.    </li>
            <li>I bought this to maintain my white smile.</li>
            <li>I normally throw these away but read the box and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Yes, whitening indeed just like magic in a few days , within a week or so.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey for daily toothpaste, though, But to me it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>The biggest concern by dental hygienists is the fact that these particles can get stuck in the small pockets of your gums and create living grounds for many very harmful bacteria.  </li>
            <li>Love white teeth and this product along with other Crest products, works very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t live up to its claims.</li>
            <li>I had two new brown line-like stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li>The Council will continue to monitor and evaluate new scientific information on this issue as it becomes available.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>In addition, we have decided not to introduce microplastic beads into any new product category.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>So far my glamorousness has not improved, though it was already quite high to begin with.</li>
            <li>After the first week, a much bigger difference!  </li>
            <li>So this evening I brushed with it (remember its my first day using it)</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean as with other toothpastes</li>
            <li>so it seems to depend on if you get old or new inventory</li>
            <li>Noticed changes within the first day - of course not dramatic changes - but you feel optimistic regarding the results, if it works within the 2nd time you brushed your teeth, you know after a week they will get a noticeable change!</li>
            <li>Despite strong doses of benadryl, pred, and epi, the swelling stayed firm.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want super white teeth, but I don&#x27;t want stained, yellow teeth either.</li>
            <li>Many of the toothpastes feels hard for the teeth to brush upon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did seem to whiten my teeth better than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s not worth this misery!!!  </li>
            <li>I do worry about the sensitivity concerns, so I brush with this 2 x a day and with my Crest sensitive gum, acid erosion prevention toothpaste once a day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that using this with my electric tooth brush has lead to quite an improvement over my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any considerable whitening of my teeth from using this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Toothpaste can only do so much for whitening.</li>
            <li>I am not a heavy smoker or coffee drinker, but I do on occasion.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much so far as teeth whitening.  </li>
            <li>The last brand I tried was Rembrandt intense stain.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>but, wow the numer 3 on the box was like</li>
            <li>No replacement for professional dental teeth whitening.</li>
            <li>And not cause them to be sensitive like the whiten strips.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use crest white strips so much anymore.</li>
            <li>After that I tried Pearl Drops, which was recommended by my dental professional.</li>
            <li>The stain lightened from Pearl Drops, but hasn&#x27;t completely gone away after maybe 8 uses.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most commonly known plastics and is not biodegradable.  </li>
            <li>This tooth paste really does take off stains just by brushing daily.  </li>
            <li>Both of my children said wow mom</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive teeth than you should stay away from the product.</li>
            <li>fact, this is actually a blend-a-med product http://www.oralb-blendamed.de/de-DE/3Dwhite-zahnaufhellungs-zahnpasta that goes very well with the oral-b electric</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste, but I have yet to blind anyone with my smile yet.</li>
            <li>When I took this out of the package I was excited to brighten up my teeth a little bit.</li>
            <li>The results were good, but left my teeth VERY sensitive, like so sensitive that sucking air into my mouth wrong sent singing pain through my front teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is the first and only whitening toothpaste that I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>I am a smoker and a big coffee/tea drinker and I highly recommend product.</li>
            <li>my new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use the toothpaste even though I&#x27;ve finished the white strips.  </li>
            <li>I bought a second tube and took a look at the new reviews.</li>
            <li>According to Snopes:  \\&quot;Procter &amp; Gamble (the corporate parent of the Crest brand) asserted, in response to our inquiry, that their use of polyethylene (PE) in Crest brand toothpaste was harmless and that they would not be adding the substance to any new brands:    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a coffee lover and occasional red wine drinker and this has really helped brighten my teeth and improved my confidence.</li>
            <li>Nothing but strips and professional whitening will do that, however this paste should show an improvement and even keep teeth white once a professional whitening has been done.</li>
            <li>I do recommend it for effectiveness, as long as one is aware of the possible erosion of tooth enamel.</li>
            <li>Also, I haven&#x27;t really noticed my teeth getting white, as the product claims and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 5 weeks now.</li>
            <li>It keeps my breath feeling clean for a long time, compared to the other tooth pastes I use.</li>
            <li>My teeth actually got whiter after using the toothpaste, but there are so many different kinds, I am not sure which one to choose sometimes..</li>
            <li>I cannot find Vivid White anywhere</li>
            <li>So far, I see no difference, but it&#x27;s only be a couple of months.  </li>
            <li>I use it along with the crest white professional strips and it has made a difference in my teeth</li>
            <li>If you have even slightly sensitive teeth or occasionally get canker sores, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>+ year old teeth still look just as yellow (esp.</li>
            <li>Procter &amp; Gamble have planned to remove the plastic from their products in the next six months, and to completely get rid of the plastic beads from their products by March 2016.    </li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what surface stains are, but this toothpaste works quickly with major impact.</li>
            <li>Dear Crest, give us Vivid White back!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in my teeth since using this for the past several months.</li>
            <li>I have always preferred Crest to any other brand and I really like this whitening one with the mint</li>
            <li>Wow, finally I found a whitening toothpaste that actually whitens my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The tube is slightly smaller than a standard tube, which surprised me when I got it in the mail, but it&#x27;s not like they lied about the tube size, I just hadn&#x27;t paid attention, and was jarred by the difference in size between my husband&#x27;s tube of crest and</li>
            <li>But highly recommended, just be careful if you begin to feel irritation or sensativity in your teeth...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent toothpaste, but I wanted to note that this dried out my skin (which does sound a little strange</li>
            <li>it keeps my teeth clear, even though, it has been a long time I used CREST whitening strips.</li>
            <li>Tried this product for the first time just a few days ago.</li>
            <li>As I continued to use it I was dedicated to brush for at least a minute for the full effect.</li>
            <li>There are other Crest whitening toothpastes out there, including one that says it removes up to 80% and is called Vibrant Mint</li>
            <li>The fist time I rinsed too quickly, I came back and found the bristles as hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t exactly comment on the whitening ability of this toothpaste because I&#x27;ve always had pale, but not yellow teeth!  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it cleans like normal</li>
            <li>What I have noticed from Crest 3D is that you always have little blue bits in your teeth after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I use to rinse my mouth very thoroughly with tap water...</li>

            <li> Target has a better price!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> man they are soooo much better!  </li>
            <li> (strips every 8 months or so) and I love them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have used this!</li>
            <li> This works better than the strips, no joke!</li>
            <li> Always love this product!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is amazing.</li>
            <li> so this is an amazing alternative .</li>
            <li> I liked the price too.</li>
            <li> The combination seems to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Honest...</li>
            <li> My teeth look whiter since I use it and it has a nice flavour</li>
            <li> Nice taste, and doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth.</li>
            <li> I would imagine that any effective teeth whitening formula could erode tooth enamel eventually.  </li>
            <li> I really liked how this product removed 90% of my surface stains in just 5 days.</li>
            <li> Great taste, not too sweet or too minty.</li>
            <li> Good tooth paste, but the whitening power is not as strong as I would like.</li>
            <li> PERFECT AND FAST DELIVERY :)</li>
            <li> flavor isnt very good, but I don&#x27;t really care about the flavor of my toothpaste...</li>
            <li> Great fresh minty flavor.</li>
            <li> As far as whitening goes this product is awesome.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if you used this along with the strips, you&#x27;d get amazing results.</li>
            <li> I love love love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> It tastes fine, and really does an excellent cleaning job.</li>
            <li> Great taste, really works!  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste has a very fresh, vibrant and delicious taste.  </li>
            <li> The taste is pleasant, and it does a good job with cleaning my teeth, but any old toothpaste can do that.</li>
            <li> If your teeth are yellow, it may not be the best option for whitening.  </li>
            <li> This is great toothpaste and it really works.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it tastes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed all the Crest 3D Whitening Products.</li>
            <li> and they are so so so cheap!</li>
            <li> My husband also uses this tooth paste and it is still able to remove the stains off his teeth event through he smokes and drinks coffee.</li>
            <li> Gradual whitening, love this product.</li>
            <li> This makes me brush my teeth way more than I ever have....</li>
            <li> I like this better than the one that removes 80% of stains.</li>
            <li> I love it and we will continue using it in this house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this toothpaste shows results with even ONE use, so I&#x27;m glad my dentist gave me a sample to try</li>
            <li> I use it in the mornings and then use Crest&#x27;s Pro-Health toothpaste in the evenings for healthy gums.  </li>
            <li> Okay-</li>
            <li> About 5 yesterday afternoon my top lip started to swell.</li>
            <li> Keep your smile bright and this is way to go</li>
            <li> i love it ....</li>
            <li> i will order more...</li>
            <li> Google it if you want to be sure...</li>
            <li> works great removes stains as stated and plus the taste is really fresh and light</li>
            <li> i will buy again :)</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I love the taste and seems to whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still impressed and will continue using it so they don&#x27;t go back to the way they were.</li>
            <li> I really love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The whole family loves this toothpaste, my daughter isn&#x27;t a fan of anything mint but loves this toothpaste because of how great her teeth feel after.</li>
            <li> But after a news report today and more research online the discovery that polyethelene is used as &amp;#34;decorative&amp;#34;  dots inside the paste has given me recourse to stop usage immediately.  </li>
            <li> And will save a lot more money and my mouth.</li>
            <li> After months of coffee, this product was able to noticably whiten my teeth by a shade in about two weeks.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it until I find something that works better.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I bought it:)</li>
            <li> just love the way my teeth feel after I brush with this tooth paste</li>
            <li> her breath has me asking for more.</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Love this tooth paste.</li>
            <li> It works even better when used with the mouthwash</li>
            <li> Most whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this, and after about 5 days, my teeth were looking better.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I always buy it and am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I dont believe they make the toothpaste safe to use.</li>
            <li> I just started using it so, I&#x27;m not 100% sure how to take it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; type of person.</li>
            <li> The colored polyethylene (PE) specks used in our oral care products are safe, FDA approved food additives.</li>

            <li> Hope this helps others gain a better perspective on this product line.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on my teeth when I use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I can just use the whitening tooth paste and it seems to be able to help maintain the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best to change it up before in the long run</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m switching back to my Arm &amp; Hammer which I honestly always felt great using.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter, and after brushing in the morning my teeth feel clean all day!</li>
            <li> My teeth are clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sweet....</li>
            <li> I also enjoyed the fact you can &amp;#34;clip a coupon&amp;#34; on Amazon and enjoy the additional discounts.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job without making my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> It didnt whiten as much as I would like but its a good toothpaste.</li>
            <li> After a little bit of research, I can say that it would be best to stay away from these products until they are removed and replaced with better, \\&quot;safer\\&quot; alternatives.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a woman that smoked for over 20 years!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a whitening product but wasn&#x27;t too keen on painting on gel or mouth guards or strips or anything having to sit in my mouth, I knew if it wasn&#x27;t easy, I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Even so, I love the way my teeth feel so clean when I do use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the advanced seal white strips and they work incredibly well in terms of whitening, but they make my teeth hurt for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This leaves a strong residue on my tooth brush if there is any trace of paste not washed off.</li>
            <li> Strongly reccomend for customers.</li>
            <li> It has a strong minty/menthol taste.</li>
            <li> This Product is great and works very well, and this is the product I&#x27;ve been looking for, for the right price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Toothpaste seems fine</li>
            <li> I now a fan and will be a loyal customer to this product!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li> In five days I could see a huge difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> it also has a great mint flavor and a gritty texture.</li>
            <li> After you eat and drink stains will come back, however this is great toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re \\&quot;white\\&quot; enough for my taste, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity while using this.</li>
            <li> Regardless, this product does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> I have tried several whitening toothpastes but haven&#x27;t really been impressed with them.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know if the results will be as good as the strips, but so far it&#x27;s a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, my mouth feels fresh and clean when I&#x27;m done brushing.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say if it was the combination of changes, or one of the parts in particular that caused the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made my teeth clean, whiter and my breath very fresh.</li>
            <li> It showed a significant difference in my smile within 5 or 6 days!  </li>
            <li> there is a significant effect</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any significant difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> It helps to whiten my teeth, and makes my breath feel fresh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read warnings and reviews stating that consistent use of this  abrasive product might be damaging to enamel, but for now I will continue to use it until I am satisfied with the whitening results.</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth with a clean, fresh feeling that lasts!</li>
            <li> It leaves our mouths feeling nice and clean better than most other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have tried the strips and do love them but honestly think that using the tooth paste alone is enough.</li>
            <li> For a daily toothpaste, I have found that Crest 3D Glamorous toothpaste is the best that I have used thus far.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth refreshed and clean feeling... something I expect in a toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel as clean as a cleaning at the dentist office.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> my teeth feel clean and i like the taste.</li>
            <li> Love procter&#x27;s products, nice breath and 3d white works.</li>
            <li> Gets your teeth clean but can&#x27;t say it made mine any whiter.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste on its own works great when used at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> wow, i love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> Ask the special lady in my life.</li>
            <li> Whitening effect is very good, brush a few days</li>
            <li> Within a week my teeth are bright white.</li>
            <li> Yes this works, you&#x27;ll see the difference real quick and its very tasty</li>
            <li> Overall, good buy.</li>
            <li> But now that I&#x27;m kind of an adult I&#x27;ve learned that fluoride, which is pretty much the reason to use toothpaste, needs to stay on your teeth to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t make your teeth bright white like the strips do, but good daily alternative.</li>
            <li> see immediate results and have the super dentist clean feeling without the leftover grit from there cleaning paste.</li>
            <li> super clean teeth and whiter, too.</li>
            <li> Important to not swallow the toothpaste and to rinse your mouth out with fresh water afterwards.  </li>
            <li> And it said it whitens in just 1 day, but I don&#x27;t find that true.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Good for whitening as well as overall health of teeth.</li>
            <li> This is one of those rare moments when I&#x27;m not disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The taste is very fresh and clean and it really does whiten!  </li>
            <li> Taste was fine and it did exactly what it was proclaimed to do.</li>
            <li> Now I have no pains or anything and still a clean smile.</li>
            <li> ahhhh fresh and clean</li>
            <li> The next best thing to white strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Schmoe</li>
            <li> While I am sure they are somewhat whiter than before, they are not &amp;#34;glamorous white.&amp;#34;  Overall, I am satisfied with the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great really made my teeth white!</li>
            <li> If I use another toothpaste, they start getting more and more yellow, so yes, it works!!!</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how quickly this worked.</li>
            <li> I am super anal about the whiteness of my teeth</li>
            <li> I have pretty light teeth</li>
            <li> It costs more than twice as much as normal toothpaste, yet people still rave that they bought it \\&quot;on sale!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would live up to all it claimed to do</li>
            <li> I think the chemicals in this toothpaste are much too strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously the first step was a good teeth whitening toothpaste but the second step was using a spin brush!!!  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste really works!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, works fine as just toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Worth it,</li>
            <li> I have noticed that this helps make my smile brighter and whiter.  </li>
            <li> I think buying this product is worth the price differential vs. the Crest product that whitens up to 80%.  </li>
            <li> Just... Fresh.</li>
            <li> Doesnt seem like worth the price</li>
            <li> Its worth a try for the price.</li>
            <li> the toothpaste fixed 99.999% of the stains on my bottom set and 50% on the top set</li>
            <li> This item is as the same as I expected and with a great value also!</li>
            <li> It does make your mouth feel fresh too.  </li>
            <li> but I saw it for sale for 3.99 and bought it because I thought four dollars was worth the risk.</li>
            <li> I rarely drink coffee, but did during a week away from home because I was attending a conference.  </li>
            <li> I kind of went on a mission to get rid of my plaque and whiten my teeth in a short time frame before I flew home to see my family.  </li>
            <li> It is worth its money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily for exactly three weeks, and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It helps remove surface stains and keeps your teeth nice and white.</li>
            <li> feels good but not really whitened...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I like the taste and how fresh it smells.</li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth not only whiter but also very clean!</li>
            <li> And it leaves an awesome smell in the mouth for several hours as well.&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended over the other brands like Colgate, Aquafresh and AZ</li>
            <li> This stuff DOES whiten and brighten and it really makes my teeth feel dentist office fresh!  </li>
            <li> two days after using both products I have a much whiter smile!  </li>
            <li> takes off coffee stains if used right away.</li>
            <li> but I could see a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> And she was right about it.</li>
            <li> It tastes very minty, cool, and has a fresh sensation after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I had several people mention how nice my teeth looked, and I didn&#x27;t buy it the first time specifically to whiten my teeth but because it was on sale.</li>
            <li> I normally use the Crest 3D in Radiant Mint, but thought Vibrant Mint would be more powerful.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be good to try a new toothpaste for whitening, and was hoping to maybe get a tiny bit of plaque off...</li>
            <li> Great whitening with very little effort.</li>
            <li> On top of that I love the fresh flavor the toothpaste leaves after brushing and it lasts for quite a few hours.</li>
            <li> This is the only whitening toothpaste that actually works and is a great value for that.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers a reasonable price and I love the subscribe and save shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought the cheapest Oral B spin brush on here &amp; extra brushes so my whole family has their own brush to stick on the toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt as though my breath stayed fresher for longer, leading to an increase in love from my better half!</li>
            <li> I am very particular about my toothpaste, it has to really make my teeth feel clean</li>
            <li> like it very much.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li> Keeps my pearlie whites pearlie white :)</li>
            <li> Works after the first day.</li>
            <li> I use it with hydrogen peroxide which really kicks it up a notch!</li>
            <li> I believe once your body gets used to something consistent</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t see consistent results.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I think the best whitening is done at the dentist or with those expensive teeth whitening kits.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job and doesn&#x27;t taste weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands of toothpaste before and this one is one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I immediately noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> My husband smokes and this was the first toothpaste that removed the yellowness from it</li>
            <li> This is my first review</li>
            <li> Really does whiten your within a week, without irritation!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone interested in it.</li>
            <li> I first sampled this toothpaste when my dentist gave me a sample to take home after my cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the noticeable whitening in 5 days, but I was thoroughly impressed with the results!</li>
            <li> Today was my first time using the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> However, this brand whitened just after my first use.</li>
            <li> After using this consistently, I noticed that the side of my chin</li>
            <li> My skin only got better when I switched toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but decided to write my first on this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> so much that I have my fiance using it too!</li>
            <li> works really well!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also want to point out that the Advanced Vivid is NOT discontinued (at time of this post anyway) and is easily found in any local pharmacy, amazon, and ebay!</li>
            <li> especially when it does such a good job whitening.</li>
            <li> I used it first when I got for 5-6 days straight morning and night and my teeth and gums started to become sensative</li>
            <li> I think this is affective so long as you do your part of sipping coffee with a straw to avoid contact with your teeth and so on, if you dont do those things to save your teeth then you will need to use these products more often.</li>
            <li> This will remove pretty much any surface stains that you may have from food, coffee, wine, etc., but it won&#x27;t do miracles.  </li>
            <li> Its great if you want to white your theeth a little bit,its certainly works!..</li>
            <li> The Rembrandt was pretty poor in my opinion, despite great reviews.  </li>
            <li> you can handle strong tooth paste and a wicked mint flavor, this is definitely the toothpaste to add to your oral regime!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only going to be in school for probably sub 2 years, and this will probably last me most of those years!</li>
            <li> Not to much whiter</li>
            <li> It cleans very well.  </li>
            <li> It really does feel like my teeth have just been cleaned.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really abrasive either--it doesn&#x27;t scratch or hurt my gums at all.  </li>
            <li> Just used 1 whole tube but didn&#x27;t notice any difference in whitening.</li>
            <li> my teeth brushing leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> I really saw results fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 3 days and my whole mouth hurts.</li>
            <li> My husband will try it now, that will be the real test.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste ...</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t expect the paste to chap my lips so much.</li>
            <li> Fast and got on time as they promised.</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll have to see after time if this product really does make our teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> I try to avoid plastic as much as I can...</li>
            <li> Yes it does work really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few family members to switch to this product after they started noticing my brighter smile. :)</li>
            <li> When compared to a normal toothpaste it is fine, but I used the entire bottle and saw no improvement on whitening of teeth.</li>
            <li> Most other tubes of toothpaste I&#x27;ve used have this.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a staple in my white clean teeth arsenal.</li>
            <li> I like to save it to use before heading out on a date or a special event instead of my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> FEEL this clean after brushing, other than right after a dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and can barely tell a difference in the whiteness of my smile.</li>
            <li> First use, I noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;The 1 star reviews saying their teeth hurt scared me, but maybe they have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Really thorough in terms of the protections offered and excellent daily use toothpaste you can&#x27;t go wrong with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Check out my full review of Crest 3D white products here:&lt;br /&gt;[...</li>
            <li> Third morning i swiped my toothbrush around and it felt like I had amouth full of battery acid.</li>
            <li> I bought the smaller size for school, as I&#x27;m moving onto my campus dorm and don&#x27;t want to lug around a full sized tube.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve used Vivid White for so long and have spread the good word across the globe about how white it has kept my teeth and now it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s because i&#x27;ve been using some natural toothpaste for a few months, but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your teeth super unbelievably white</li>
            <li> I love the 3d line of crest products, I use this with the white strips and always get compliments on how white my teeth are!</li>
            <li> I am a full time smoker, drink hot coffee till the pot is empty, iced coffee, iced tea and sodas the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste next to Rembrandt and Amazon subscribe and save is cheaper than my local stores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Opalescence was decent.  </li>
            <li> product contains silica, so is more gritty then regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> After some inquiry, she discovered they were from toothpaste, mainly those used for \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; purposes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this over whitening strips.</li>
            <li> highly recommend using a spin brush along with this toothpaste for optimal results.</li>
            <li> I would love to try other items in the line as well to see if I can get my teeth even whiter without having to pay for a professional treatment.</li>
            <li> Went on Ebay and bought a case of tried and true Vivid White!</li>
            <li> I like the minty flavor, and it keeps my mouth and breath feeling fresh and clean for a few hours.    </li>
            <li> I bought this to maintain my white smile.</li>
            <li> I normally throw these away but read the box and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Yes, whitening indeed just like magic in a few days , within a week or so.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey for daily toothpaste, though, But to me it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> The biggest concern by dental hygienists is the fact that these particles can get stuck in the small pockets of your gums and create living grounds for many very harmful bacteria.  </li>
            <li> Love white teeth and this product along with other Crest products, works very well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t live up to its claims.</li>
            <li> I had two new brown line-like stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li> The Council will continue to monitor and evaluate new scientific information on this issue as it becomes available.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> In addition, we have decided not to introduce microplastic beads into any new product category.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> So far my glamorousness has not improved, though it was already quite high to begin with.</li>
            <li> After the first week, a much bigger difference!  </li>
            <li> So this evening I brushed with it (remember its my first day using it)</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean as with other toothpastes</li>
            <li> so it seems to depend on if you get old or new inventory</li>
            <li> Noticed changes within the first day - of course not dramatic changes - but you feel optimistic regarding the results, if it works within the 2nd time you brushed your teeth, you know after a week they will get a noticeable change!</li>
            <li> Despite strong doses of benadryl, pred, and epi, the swelling stayed firm.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want super white teeth, but I don&#x27;t want stained, yellow teeth either.</li>
            <li> Many of the toothpastes feels hard for the teeth to brush upon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did seem to whiten my teeth better than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s not worth this misery!!!  </li>
            <li> I do worry about the sensitivity concerns, so I brush with this 2 x a day and with my Crest sensitive gum, acid erosion prevention toothpaste once a day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that using this with my electric tooth brush has lead to quite an improvement over my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any considerable whitening of my teeth from using this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste can only do so much for whitening.</li>
            <li> I am not a heavy smoker or coffee drinker, but I do on occasion.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much so far as teeth whitening.  </li>
            <li> The last brand I tried was Rembrandt intense stain.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> but, wow the numer 3 on the box was like</li>
            <li> No replacement for professional dental teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> And not cause them to be sensitive like the whiten strips.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use crest white strips so much anymore.</li>
            <li> After that I tried Pearl Drops, which was recommended by my dental professional.</li>
            <li> The stain lightened from Pearl Drops, but hasn&#x27;t completely gone away after maybe 8 uses.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most commonly known plastics and is not biodegradable.  </li>
            <li> This tooth paste really does take off stains just by brushing daily.  </li>
            <li> Both of my children said wow mom</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive teeth than you should stay away from the product.</li>
            <li> fact, this is actually a blend-a-med product http://www.oralb-blendamed.de/de-DE/3Dwhite-zahnaufhellungs-zahnpasta that goes very well with the oral-b electric</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste, but I have yet to blind anyone with my smile yet.</li>
            <li> When I took this out of the package I was excited to brighten up my teeth a little bit.</li>
            <li> The results were good, but left my teeth VERY sensitive, like so sensitive that sucking air into my mouth wrong sent singing pain through my front teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is the first and only whitening toothpaste that I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> I am a smoker and a big coffee/tea drinker and I highly recommend product.</li>
            <li> my new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use the toothpaste even though I&#x27;ve finished the white strips.  </li>
            <li> I bought a second tube and took a look at the new reviews.</li>
            <li> According to Snopes:  \\&quot;Procter &amp; Gamble (the corporate parent of the Crest brand) asserted, in response to our inquiry, that their use of polyethylene (PE) in Crest brand toothpaste was harmless and that they would not be adding the substance to any new brands:    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a coffee lover and occasional red wine drinker and this has really helped brighten my teeth and improved my confidence.</li>
            <li> Nothing but strips and professional whitening will do that, however this paste should show an improvement and even keep teeth white once a professional whitening has been done.</li>
            <li> I do recommend it for effectiveness, as long as one is aware of the possible erosion of tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> Also, I haven&#x27;t really noticed my teeth getting white, as the product claims and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 5 weeks now.</li>
            <li> It keeps my breath feeling clean for a long time, compared to the other tooth pastes I use.</li>
            <li> My teeth actually got whiter after using the toothpaste, but there are so many different kinds, I am not sure which one to choose sometimes..</li>
            <li> I cannot find Vivid White anywhere</li>
            <li> So far, I see no difference, but it&#x27;s only be a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> I use it along with the crest white professional strips and it has made a difference in my teeth</li>
            <li> If you have even slightly sensitive teeth or occasionally get canker sores, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> + year old teeth still look just as yellow (esp.</li>
            <li> Procter &amp; Gamble have planned to remove the plastic from their products in the next six months, and to completely get rid of the plastic beads from their products by March 2016.    </li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what surface stains are, but this toothpaste works quickly with major impact.</li>
            <li> Dear Crest, give us Vivid White back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in my teeth since using this for the past several months.</li>
            <li> I have always preferred Crest to any other brand and I really like this whitening one with the mint</li>
            <li> Wow, finally I found a whitening toothpaste that actually whitens my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The tube is slightly smaller than a standard tube, which surprised me when I got it in the mail, but it&#x27;s not like they lied about the tube size, I just hadn&#x27;t paid attention, and was jarred by the difference in size between my husband&#x27;s tube of crest and</li>
            <li> But highly recommended, just be careful if you begin to feel irritation or sensativity in your teeth...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent toothpaste, but I wanted to note that this dried out my skin (which does sound a little strange</li>
            <li> it keeps my teeth clear, even though, it has been a long time I used CREST whitening strips.</li>
            <li> Tried this product for the first time just a few days ago.</li>
            <li> As I continued to use it I was dedicated to brush for at least a minute for the full effect.</li>
            <li> There are other Crest whitening toothpastes out there, including one that says it removes up to 80% and is called Vibrant Mint</li>
            <li> The fist time I rinsed too quickly, I came back and found the bristles as hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t exactly comment on the whitening ability of this toothpaste because I&#x27;ve always had pale, but not yellow teeth!  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it cleans like normal</li>
            <li> What I have noticed from Crest 3D is that you always have little blue bits in your teeth after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I use to rinse my mouth very thoroughly with tap water...</li>
            <li> While I am insure if this tooth paste can do a deep bleaching like you could get from expensive whitening strips or professional whitening, yet this product will clean and polish your teeth well removing surface stains.</li>
            <li> Of course none of these toothpaste products actually whiten as much as they say, at least in my experience.  </li>
            <li> My teeth look noticeably whiter after only a single use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive per ounce, but it works and it tastes fine.</li>
            <li> I use multiple products such as their Mouthwash, their brilliance toothpaste (I use it during the mid-day), and all their other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this line for years and am constantly complimented on how white my teeth are by friends and family and even my mental hygienist!</li>
            <li> so much so that I can&#x27;t brush my teeth too late at night or it wakes me up.</li>
            <li> Ive used toothpaste that says its whitenening before, and never really noticed a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a long line of Crest and Colgate products using plastic in their toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I use every other day now to maintain the pearly white appearance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, I do brush my teeth for about 2 minutes, wet my brush again, brush the toothpaste covered teeth with the wet brush several times, then do it all over again.</li>
            <li> Crest carries quite a few of these 3D white toothpastes, this is their newest one and also the strongest one, which may be why the last reviewer could taste the peroxide?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a few years to kkep my teeth white after bleaching with Night White.</li>
            <li> I like the product; I will continue to use the product; but this toothpaste does not live up to the hype on the label.</li>
            <li> Igot to the ER at midnight, they cut me loose</li>
            <li> I thought of giving a try to this and NEVER looked back at Colgate or whatever I had used previously.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that there are tiny blue dots in the paste, from reading past reviews</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 star because it&#x27;s not as good as using the strips, but I&#x27;m so bad at keeping up with doing those!</li>
            <li> Be very careful how often and for how long you use this product.  </li>
            <li> I am reviewing it here because I regret the purchase and am annoyed because I just missed the satisfaction guarantee deadline, and I decided to buy it largely because of this guarantee.</li>
            <li> The little blue particles...</li>
            <li> Not much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I never really thought of what the D stands for.</li>
            <li> It is stronger stuff but not good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the usual twice daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other toothpaste I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> As time passes if I&#x27;m still experiencing sensitivity and decide it&#x27;s due to the toothpaste, I&#x27;ll try to remember to come update my review accordingly</li>
            <li> I have tried other whitening toothpastes before with no visible results.</li>
            <li> I still look like a botox mess, but when the dr could see some decrease in the swelling, he cut me loose.</li>
            <li> I DEVELOPED LARGE, PAINFUL BLISTERS ON THE SIDE AND TIP OF MY TONGUE.  </li>
            <li> My 8 year old also uses this and doesn&#x27;t mind the taste of it, which is hard to find for kids!</li>
            <li> P&amp;G and other toothpaste manufacturers use limited amounts of small colored polyethylene specs in some toothpastes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within 7 days of normal use, it gave me a painful canker sore inside my mouth, EXTREMELY sensitive teeth, and even my tongue hurts.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Polyethylene microbeads are commonly used as scrub beads, such as in exfoliating products, but are also sometimes used in chewing gum and toothpaste, as part of the product design.</li>
            <li> Previous reviewers said it did not</li>
            <li> My routine literally takes less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I probably had less buildup than ever before.  </li>
            <li> Whiter teeth in less than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It uses a slight abrasive that polishes your teeth</li>
            <li> It makes sense that a toothpaste can do this, all they have to do is include whatever the dentist uses, for a LOT less money.  </li>
            <li> and I have seen a slight difference.</li>
            <li> Oh duh, I must be allergic to this.swished &amp; rinsed 4 a long time with tepid water.</li>
            <li> teeth may be a bit whiter, but that&#x27;s to be expected from any ordinary tooth whitening paste these days.</li>
            <li> but I also notice a my teeth a little whiter.</li>
            <li> a little kid drew it...</li>
            <li> This also seems to have those little plastic bits that get suck under your gums.</li>
            <li> Makes those pearly whites whiter and has a little grit that makes you feel like you scrubbing rather then pampering your teeth.</li>
            <li> I drink coffee and my teeth get a little stained.  </li>
            <li> This seems a little...</li>
            <li> will definitely buy again as now I dont want to go back to the regular whitening toothpaste from crest :(</li>
            <li> The first day I used this, I had an unpleasant stingy sensation around my gum line.</li>
            <li> (I drink a lot of green tea and some coffee, do not smoke) and</li>
            <li> I can definitly tell a difference after using if for a few months.</li>
            <li> I have used this paste a few times and see results.</li>
            <li> the toothpaste came out dried up my skin because it started peeling.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are visibly whiter after a few weeks and stains are gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product for just a few days, the stains are gone.  </li>
            <li> When brushing, it&#x27;s common for me that a little bit of the toothpaste escapes my lips and trickles down the edge of my lips onto one side of my chin.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that using this past is a little gentler.</li>
            <li> And I think it is not very effective for me.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this has removed those dark caffeine stains from my teeth</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll tell you what, there is something in this toothpaste that tastes so strange, leaves such a bad aftertaste for me and everyone in my family</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a rather small tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m guaranteed to have yellow teeth :/  </li>
            <li> Not sure that anyone else notices the difference on my teeth, but i do when I don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> i am not sure if its just me, but i think it does make a difference in whiteness.  </li>
            <li> Not much more to say.  </li>
            <li> Amazon no longer sold the whitestrips I usually get, so I thought I&#x27;d use this for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Small quantities of the colored polyethylene specks are included in some of Crest&#x27;s toothpastes, including Crest Pro Health, which has the ADA Seal of Acceptance ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to brush your teeth daily than to put on nasty sticky strips that may cause tooth sensitivity.    </li>
            <li> I also buy at least 10</li>
            <li> It did make my teeth whiter in at least a weeks time I would say.</li>
            <li> I use this product sparingly as my dental hygienist cautioned that these types of products erode teeth enamel and it is not noticeable until it is too late too reverse the damage.  </li>
            <li> They are used in chewing gums and are commonly used in toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Polyethylene beads are commonly used as scrub beads (e.g., in exfoliating products) but are also sometimes used to give color, like in chewing gum and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> works, slowly over time, but it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying this hoping it&#x27;s slowly working</li>
            <li> actually, this price is very expensive.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Yet it seems to surpass the abilities of less expensive whitening tooth pastes.  </li>
            <li> but I do see some subtle change in color.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to crest.</li>
            <li> my bad for being slow on the uptake.</li>
            <li> I have fake teeth.</li>
            <li> its sad that the reviews here dont tell u the truth, i didnt bother to return the item</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to eat or drink anything.</li>
            <li> I finally realized it was this awful toothpaste and threw it away immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found one that was particularly unsettling, and I&#x27;ve included my comment to theirs here as well...    </li>
            <li> Sorry crest, this is unacceptable.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this is a fake product!</li>
            <li> EATING WAS VERY DIFFICULT</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed and nervous to use the product when I opened the box and the tube of toothpaste didn&#x27;t have a tamper seal.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> How ridiculous!!!!</li>
            <li> Now I have to take pred for a week, that, ll make me real unpleasant.</li>
            <li> WHAT A TERRIBLE PRODUCT THEY HAVE ON THE MARKET.</li>
            <li> The package does not lie, 90%+ of the plaque on my bottom teeth that was annoying me, is now gone!</li>
            <li> And I have NEVER encountered the problems I did with this horrible</li>

            <li> there was no change in the color of my teeth. I stopped drinking coffee and started using this toothpaste. It has been over 2 weeks and there has been no change. I feel like this is a fake product!</li>
            <li> Whitens my teeth, great that i get it every month through subscribe and save every month. The tube will probably last longer then that, so i will always have a tube or two as backup.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a whitening product but wasn&#x27;t too keen on painting on gel or mouth guards or strips or anything having to sit in my mouth, I knew if it wasn&#x27;t easy, I wouldn&#x27;t use it. I read the reviews and there were sooo many great views, I had to get this!  I have never had teeth FEEL this clean after brushing, other than right after a dental cleaning.  I do worry about the sensitivity concerns, so I brush with this 2 x a day and with my Crest sensitive gum, acid erosion prevention toothpaste once a day.  It goes well together, and my teeth are noticeably WHITER after just a couple weeks.  They&#x27;ll only get whiter and brighter as I go along!  LOVE this toothpaste!  It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do, without all the fuss of strips and polishes and extra work!  Just brush!  Crest is a great name we all trust and know!  This stuff DOES whiten and brighten and it really makes my teeth feel dentist office fresh!  The price on here can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I bought this because several of my friends use it. However, I haven&#x27;t gotten the same results. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and can barely tell a difference in the whiteness of my smile.</li>
            <li> When compared to a normal toothpaste it is fine, but I used the entire bottle and saw no improvement on whitening of teeth.</li>
            <li> Good tooth paste, but the whitening power is not as strong as I would like.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I will buy it again...again.....and again!  It showed a significant difference in my smile within 5 or 6 days!  I actually received compliments!</li>
            <li> Whitening effect is very good, brush a few days there is a significant effect</li>
            <li> Yes this works, you&#x27;ll see the difference real quick and its very tasty</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed them being whiter BUT it is definitely toothpaste...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sweet....I don&#x27;t like the taste</li>
            <li> takes off coffee stains if used right away.</li>
            <li> It took longer than I thought but after continued use my tooth are whiter. Not to much whiter but I am happy with the results. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> actually, this price is very expensive. Target has a better price! And I think it is not very effective for me. Just so so</li>
            <li> Great taste, really works!  I&#x27;ve noticed that using this with my electric tooth brush has lead to quite an improvement over my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is a good toothpaste. It doesn&#x27;t make your teeth super unbelievably white but it does keep them from turning too yellow with daily coffee and tea. I feel like it&#x27;s daily stain remover. My mouth feels clean as with other toothpastes but I also notice a my teeth a little whiter. I would buy it again. Also, it&#x27;s a rather small tube of toothpaste. I have about a week left and I just got it on July 2 and I brush my teeth the usual twice daily. Overall, good buy.</li>
            <li> good stuff. works, slowly over time, but it works.</li>
            <li> It does the job. Whiten my teeth in a week!</li>
            <li> This is the only whitening toothpaste that actually works and is a great value for that. If your teeth are yellow, it may not be the best option for whitening.  However, if you&#x27;re like me and use whitening strips or trays periodically, this is a great way to maintain the whiteness.</li>
            <li> First use, I noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;The 1 star reviews saying their teeth hurt scared me, but maybe they have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and can&#x27;t say it has whitened my teeth. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li> This is great toothpaste and it really works. I had several people mention how nice my teeth looked, and I didn&#x27;t buy it the first time specifically to whiten my teeth but because it was on sale. Now I always keep it around.</li>
            <li> Worth it, Though I suggest seeing if it is cheaper at walmart,</li>
            <li> I love love love this toothpaste! It truly does make my teeth look whiter and I love the way it tastes. It keeps my breath feeling clean for a long time, compared to the other tooth pastes I use. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Keeps my pearlie whites pearlie white :)</li>
            <li> Works after the first day. Amazed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any considerable whitening of my teeth from using this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months. The taste is pleasant, and it does a good job with cleaning my teeth, but any old toothpaste can do that. I don&#x27;t dislike it, but I&#x27;m not overly impressed. It doesn&#x27;t live up to its claims.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a staple in my white clean teeth arsenal. I use it with hydrogen peroxide which really kicks it up a notch! My dentist used his color guide to show me that my tooth color is the second whitest shade of white. Not bad for a woman that smoked for over 20 years! Great product.</li>
            <li> Great whitening with very little effort. I was using gel and trays once a month to keep my teeth white. Now I brush twice a day with this toothpaste and only need to use the gel for a touch-up about once every four months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed all the Crest 3D Whitening Products. I use multiple products such as their Mouthwash, their brilliance toothpaste (I use it during the mid-day), and all their other toothpastes. I tend to switch my tube toothpastes every so often but I stay within the brand. I believe once your body gets used to something consistent it&#x27;s best to change it up before in the long run you won&#x27;t see consistent results.</li>
            <li> Thanks! Real good toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Tried this product for the first time just a few days ago. I can already see a difference. It tastes fine, and really does an excellent cleaning job. For once, a product that does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> The next best thing to white strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Schmoe</li>
            <li> I love the 3d line of crest products, I use this with the white strips and always get compliments on how white my teeth are! Some people even thing I have fake teeth.</li>
            <li> I LOVEEEE this tooth paste! Within a week my teeth are bright white. Great minty taste and I would also recommend the mouth wash. I have tried the strips and do love them but honestly think that using the tooth paste alone is enough. People are also saying how white my teeth are and asking where I got them done. I also buy at least 10 so I never run out and they are so so so cheap! My husband also uses this tooth paste and it is still able to remove the stains off his teeth event through he smokes and drinks coffee.</li>
            <li> Great fresh minty flavor. Gradual whitening, love this product.</li>
            <li> I like the product; I will continue to use the product; but this toothpaste does not live up to the hype on the label. After using the product for over three months, I cannot tell a great difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  While I am sure they are somewhat whiter than before, they are not &amp;#34;glamorous white.&amp;#34;  Overall, I am satisfied with the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The little blue particles... I can&#x27;t exactly comment on the whitening ability of this toothpaste because I&#x27;ve always had pale, but not yellow teeth!  What I have noticed from Crest 3D is that you always have little blue bits in your teeth after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I use to rinse my mouth very thoroughly with tap water... that&#x27;s just what my parents did.  But now that I&#x27;m kind of an adult I&#x27;ve learned that fluoride, which is pretty much the reason to use toothpaste, needs to stay on your teeth to be effective.  Therefore, I rinse ONCE and the blue bits stay on your teeth after one rinse.</li>
            <li> Great really made my teeth white!</li>
            <li> I bought this to maintain my white smile. Won&#x27;t make your teeth bright white like the strips do, but good daily alternative. I liked the price too.</li>
            <li> Still contains polyethylene (plastic) flakes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste seems fine but mine still contains the plastic flakes. Previous reviewers said it did not so it seems to depend on if you get old or new inventory</li>
            <li> Not much of a difference.</li>
            <li> My teeth actually got whiter after using the toothpaste, but there are so many different kinds, I am not sure which one to choose sometimes..</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste, but I have yet to blind anyone with my smile yet. I think the best whitening is done at the dentist or with those expensive teeth whitening kits. Toothpaste can only do so much for whitening. I am not a heavy smoker or coffee drinker, but I do on occasion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using once a day for a couple weeks and have seen improvement with my teeth as well as a couple of porceilin veneers.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job and doesn&#x27;t taste weird. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands of toothpaste before and this one is one of my favorite. Really thorough in terms of the protections offered and excellent daily use toothpaste you can&#x27;t go wrong with.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year now. I am a full time smoker, drink hot coffee till the pot is empty, iced coffee, iced tea and sodas the rest of the day.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m guaranteed to have yellow teeth :/  I can&#x27;t stand whitening strips so let&#x27;s try the toothpaste!  After the first use, I immediately noticed a difference.  Now, I do brush my teeth for about 2 minutes, wet my brush again, brush the toothpaste covered teeth with the wet brush several times, then do it all over again. My routine literally takes less than 5 minutes. After the first week, a much bigger difference!  Now, because of the torture my teeth go through, I&#x27;ll never had those bright whites, but man they are soooo much better!  They look white in my pics!  If I use another toothpaste, they start getting more and more yellow, so yes, it works!!!</li>
            <li> This makes me brush my teeth way more than I ever have....Needed that inspiration</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much so far as teeth whitening.  Didn&#x27;t irritate my gums like some reviewers responded, might as well go back to regular Crest in the 4 pack from Costco and save some money.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the one that removes 80% of stains. Not sure that anyone else notices the difference on my teeth, but i do when I don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> Crest carries quite a few of these 3D white toothpastes, this is their newest one and also the strongest one, which may be why the last reviewer could taste the peroxide? I have been using these toothpastes and the mouth wash for a while in conjunction with the strips for about 2 years now (strips every 8 months or so) and I love them! I can&#x27;t say if this will whiten your teeth in \\&quot;one day\\&quot; but after 3 you will definitely notice any stains gone, especially you smokers! My husband smokes and this was the first toothpaste that removed the yellowness from it and he doesn&#x27;t use the strips and his teeth are about a shade darker than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can handle strong tooth paste and a wicked mint flavor, this is definitely the toothpaste to add to your oral regime! I love it and we will continue using it in this house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out my full review of Crest 3D white products here:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also want to point out that the Advanced Vivid is NOT discontinued (at time of this post anyway) and is easily found in any local pharmacy, amazon, and ebay!</li>
            <li> It didnt whiten as much as I would like but its a good toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste next to Rembrandt and Amazon subscribe and save is cheaper than my local stores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see immediate results and have the super dentist clean feeling without the leftover grit from there cleaning paste.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste shows results with even ONE use, so I&#x27;m glad my dentist gave me a sample to try - got me hooked!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is amazing. The taste is great and I&#x27;ve definitely seen improvements after several days of usage.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I really began paying attention to my dental health.  I also had Zoom whitening done and continue to use whitening gel.  I have tried several whitening toothpastes but haven&#x27;t really been impressed with them.  Opalescence was decent.  The last brand I tried was Rembrandt intense stain.  The Rembrandt was pretty poor in my opinion, despite great reviews.  I would notice stains on my teeth that I would have to scrape off.  However, I do have to acknowledge that during my last cleaning (while using the Rembrandt) I probably had less buildup than ever before.  After that cleaning I was given a trial tube of Crest 3d glamorous white.  I normally throw these away but read the box and decided to try it.  Wow.  It cleans very well.  It really does feel like my teeth have just been cleaned.  It isn&#x27;t really abrasive either--it doesn&#x27;t scratch or hurt my gums at all.  I have noticed that this helps make my smile brighter and whiter.  Now it isn&#x27;t going to whiten as well as gel or bleaching trays.  This is my first review and I have to say I am very impressed.  Before this product I wouldn&#x27;t even think to use a product by Crest or Colgate.</li>
            <li> Totally NOT scientific I know but just using this product off and on, I feel my teeth have gotten whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll report back if I use it diligently and daily but that&#x27;s not my style...I tend to rotate to whatever toothpaste is within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is the only variable I&#x27;ve changed (I drink a lot of green tea and some coffee, do not smoke) and I feel like I&#x27;m seeing enough results that I would 100% purchase this again.</li>
            <li> its sad that the reviews here dont tell u the truth, i didnt bother to return the item but, wow the numer 3 on the box was like a little kid drew it...</li>
            <li> Really does whiten your within a week, without irritation!</li>
            <li> Taste was fine and it did exactly what it was proclaimed to do. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone interested in it.</li>
            <li> I have seen a noticeable difference it the whiteness of my teeth since I started using this.  I use it in the mornings and then use Crest&#x27;s Pro-Health toothpaste in the evenings for healthy gums.  The combination seems to be effective.  I think buying this product is worth the price differential vs. the Crest product that whitens up to 80%.  Of course none of these toothpaste products actually whiten as much as they say, at least in my experience.  No replacement for professional dental teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> Okay- my bad for being slow on the uptake. The first day I used this, I had an unpleasant stingy sensation around my gum line. Second day my gums were hypersensitive and I swear, my teeth stung. Third morning i swiped my toothbrush around and it felt like I had amouth full of battery acid. Oh duh, I must be allergic to this.swished &amp; rinsed 4 a long time with tepid water. About 5 yesterday afternoon my top lip started to swell. And swell, and swell. Igot to the ER at midnight, they cut me loose about 6 this am. Despite strong doses of benadryl, pred, and epi, the swelling stayed firm. The inner side of my lip split about every quarter inch to accomodate the swelling. I still look like a botox mess, but when the dr could see some decrease in the swelling, he cut me loose. Now I have to take pred for a week, that, ll make me real unpleasant. My story...caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT THIS TOOTHPASTE WOULD WHITEN, AS ADVERTISED.  NO WAY!  I DEVELOPED LARGE, PAINFUL BLISTERS ON THE SIDE AND TIP OF MY TONGUE.  EATING WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND THEY DID NOT HEAL FOR OVER A WEEK. I HOPE THE CEO  OF PROCTER AND GAMBLE USES THIS, AND DISCOVERS WHAT A TERRIBLE PRODUCT THEY HAVE ON THE MARKET.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in about a week. My teeth were fairly white but needed that extra boost. I do drink coffee and the occasional soda and this got rid of all remnants of stains. I did not have any sensitivity issues when using 3D white at all.</li>
            <li> Whiter teeth in less than 3 weeks. My brother and I are tea and cofee people. So, our teeth were brown almost.</li>
            <li> It makes the teeth a bit whiter !</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite toothpaste! I have been using this line for years and am constantly complimented on how white my teeth are by friends and family and even my mental hygienist!</li>
            <li> Keep your smile bright and this is way to go and yes I use amazon almost for everything I buy</li>
            <li> This leaves a strong residue on my tooth brush if there is any trace of paste not washed off. The fist time I rinsed too quickly, I came back and found the bristles as hard as a rock.  This also seems to have those little plastic bits that get suck under your gums. Not purchasing again. Just used 1 whole tube but didn&#x27;t notice any difference in whitening.</li>
            <li> Just began using this product so results not in .... great taste, though! :)</li>
            <li> wooooow.  i love it .... i will order more...</li>
            <li> Do not buy or use this product. If you have it at home, stop using it. This product has tiny PLASTIC balls that will get lodged in your gums. And they require removal by a dentist. Honest...this is a fact. DO NOT USE. Google it if you want to be sure...but don&#x27;t use it until you do.</li>
            <li> works great removes stains as stated and plus the taste is really fresh and light i will buy again :)</li>
            <li> This does not work as well as they claim it does.  I don&#x27;t see any significant difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this toothpaste along with the 3d white mouth wash. I have only used them 3 times and I already notice a difference! My teeth are whiter, and after brushing in the morning my teeth feel clean all day! I am a smoker and a big coffee/tea drinker and I highly recommend product. it also has a great mint flavor and a gritty texture.</li>
            <li> TBH, I had only used Colgate, Aquafresh and AZ toothpastes (different versions like whitening, anti-plaque etc). Especially, only Colgate in the last 3 or 4 years. I thought of giving a try to this and NEVER looked back at Colgate or whatever I had used previously. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING TOOTHPASTE! Yes, whitening indeed just like magic in a few days , within a week or so. And it leaves an awesome smell in the mouth for several hours as well.&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended over the other brands like Colgate, Aquafresh and AZ</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  I am very particular about my toothpaste, it has to really make my teeth feel clean and this does.  It is extra minty- so much so that I can&#x27;t brush my teeth too late at night or it wakes me up.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste keeps my teeth looking white all the time so I don&#x27;t have to use any extra whitening treatments</li>
            <li> For a daily toothpaste, I have found that Crest 3D Glamorous toothpaste is the best that I have used thus far. After you eat and drink stains will come back, however this is great toothpaste. A bit pricey for daily toothpaste, though, But to me it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Many of the toothpastes feels hard for the teeth to brush upon. This is one of those that does not hurt your teeth.</li>
            <li> I love the taste and seems to whiten my teeth.  And not cause them to be sensitive like the whiten strips.</li>
            <li> I bought this we tried it, my wife and I and it works. Definitely notice a difference with a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I will admit, I&#x27;m a guy. I take pride in hygiene but my teeth brushing leaves much to be desired. Ask the special lady in my life. When I took this out of the package I was excited to brighten up my teeth a little bit. As I continued to use it I was dedicated to brush for at least a minute for the full effect. I was impressed that this tooth paste lifted some set in stains from my braces that had been there for a while. I felt as though my breath stayed fresher for longer, leading to an increase in love from my better half! I&#x27;m glad to have used this!</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how quickly this worked. After just three brushings I noticed a difference. I&#x27;m a coffee lover and occasional red wine drinker and this has really helped brighten my teeth and improved my confidence. I have noticed it has plateaued and my teeth don&#x27;t seem to be getting whiter but I&#x27;m still impressed and will continue using it so they don&#x27;t go back to the way they were. On top of that I love the fresh flavor the toothpaste leaves after brushing and it lasts for quite a few hours. It reminds me of that just left the dentist feeling. I would love to try other items in the line as well to see if I can get my teeth even whiter without having to pay for a professional treatment.</li>
            <li> Tooth paste of the news gods. Makes those pearly whites whiter and has a little grit that makes you feel like you scrubbing rather then pampering your teeth.</li>
            <li> I first sampled this toothpaste when my dentist gave me a sample to take home after my cleaning.  I searched and found it on Amazon.  The toothpaste has a very fresh, vibrant and delicious taste.  It leaves my mouth refreshed and clean feeling... something I expect in a toothpaste.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I also enjoyed the fact you can &amp;#34;clip a coupon&amp;#34; on Amazon and enjoy the additional discounts.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel as clean as a cleaning at the dentist office.  Especially when you drink coffee.  I tried going back to regular toothpaste but I could see a difference right away.  I&#x27;m sold!!</li>
            <li> I really love this toothpaste. It did make my teeth whiter in at least a weeks time I would say. Would o fnever bought it since it was so expansive! But they had a really good coupon and I got it for under $2. It was a steal!</li>
            <li> It is the best toothpaste ever. it keeps my teeth clear, even though, it has been a long time I used CREST whitening strips.</li>
            <li> Seriously. I also have sensitive teeth. Some whitening gels kill me. This one doesn&#x27;t. Also, my breath doesn&#x27;t smell clinical after. Just... Fresh.</li>
            <li> Made my teeth clean, whiter and my breath very fresh. I don&#x27;t have to use crest white strips so much anymore.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon. I am reviewing it here because I regret the purchase and am annoyed because I just missed the satisfaction guarantee deadline, and I decided to buy it largely because of this guarantee. (It took me a while to find the necessary items to mail in, and it has to arrive to them within 60 days.) I had two new brown line-like stains on my teeth. The toothpaste didn&#x27;t work in 5 days (with twice/day use), so I stopped. After that I tried Pearl Drops, which was recommended by my dental professional. The stain lightened from Pearl Drops, but hasn&#x27;t completely gone away after maybe 8 uses.</li>
            <li> I am 50 and this vastly improved my teeth whiteness. Amazon subscribe and save is best price...</li>
            <li> Doesnt seem like worth the price</li>
            <li> Ive used toothpaste that says its whitenening before, and never really noticed a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff though definitely works.&lt;br /&gt;The flavor isnt very good, but I don&#x27;t really care about the flavor of my toothpaste... especially when it does such a good job whitening.</li>
            <li> I really saw results fast. In five days I could see a huge difference in the color of my teeth. I had met up with people that I had not seen for a while and they were the ones who pointed out at the beginning of the conversations that I had &amp;#34;very white teeth&amp;#34; and asked what I was using. I gave Crest 3D White Luxe Toothpaste all the credit. It works well for the time it takes to just erase a lot of the surface stains left on my teeth over the year. It tastes very minty, cool, and has a fresh sensation after brushing my teeth. Its worth a try for the price.</li>
            <li> Great for teeth whitening, been using this product for over a year now and I get compliments on how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of teeth whitening trays, kits, toothpastes, etc. and this one is not kidding around!  I saw an IMMEDIATE improvement and after only a week I am astonished at the difference.  I am going to buy a lifetime supply !!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste, it works! My teeth are clean!</li>
            <li> I use this every 2 or so days, keeps my teeth bright. I used it first when I got for 5-6 days straight morning and night and my teeth and gums started to become sensative so i started spacing it out after that. Now I have no pains or anything and still a clean smile. I think this is affective so long as you do your part of sipping coffee with a straw to avoid contact with your teeth and so on, if you dont do those things to save your teeth then you will need to use these products more often. But highly recommended, just be careful if you begin to feel irritation or sensativity in your teeth...</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean after I use it. I recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a few years to kkep my teeth white after bleaching with Night White. Does a great job without making my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> The whole family loves this toothpaste, my daughter isn&#x27;t a fan of anything mint but loves this toothpaste because of how great her teeth feel after.</li>
            <li> Very effective! I was skeptical about the noticeable whitening in 5 days, but I was thoroughly impressed with the results! I use every other day now to maintain the pearly white appearance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the end results!!</li>
            <li> I like the toothpaste and the taste is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> wow, i love this toothpaste!  i am not sure if its just me, but i think it does make a difference in whiteness.  my teeth feel clean and i like the taste.</li>
            <li> A whitening product that actually works as advertised! Not much more to say.  It does the job, despite my daily coffee and occasional cigar habit.</li>
            <li> Wow, finally I found a whitening toothpaste that actually whitens my teeth.  It uses a slight abrasive that polishes your teeth and I like the flavor of the paste itself.</li>
            <li> Crest took the best toothpaste on the market and changed it! Why? I cannot find Vivid White anywhere and instead I find Glamorous White. First of all, I&#x27;ve used Vivid White for so long and have spread the good word across the globe about how white it has kept my teeth and now it&#x27;s gone. Of course I tried Glamorous White but I&#x27;ll tell you what, there is something in this toothpaste that tastes so strange, leaves such a bad aftertaste for me and everyone in my family, we won&#x27;t use it. It has a very strong taste of something chemical! Guess what we did? Went on Ebay and bought a case of tried and true Vivid White! Dear Crest, give us Vivid White back! Please?!!!!</li>
            <li> like it very much. My teeth look whiter since I use it and it has a nice flavour</li>
            <li> Be very careful how often and for how long you use this product.  It gets teeth whiter though.</li>
            <li> Its great if you want to white your theeth a little bit,its certainly works!..</li>
            <li> Ok.  As far as whitening goes this product is awesome.  But after a news report today and more research online the discovery that polyethelene is used as &amp;#34;decorative&amp;#34;  dots inside the paste has given me recourse to stop usage immediately.  There is a long line of Crest and Colgate products using plastic in their toothpaste. This is one of the most commonly known plastics and is not biodegradable.  The biggest concern by dental hygienists is the fact that these particles can get stuck in the small pockets of your gums and create living grounds for many very harmful bacteria.  I&#x27;m switching back to my Arm &amp; Hammer which I honestly always felt great using.  And will save a lot more money and my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and I feel it does a great job. Amazon offers a reasonable price and I love the subscribe and save shipping. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Is good but I don&#x27;t saw white</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth with a clean, fresh feeling that lasts! I have always preferred Crest to any other brand and I really like this whitening one with the mint taste a lot.        I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This tooth paste really does take off stains just by brushing daily.  I&#x27;m impressed.  Nice taste, and doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth.</li>
            <li> I have had this toothpaste for a week. I thought it would be good to try a new toothpaste for whitening, and was hoping to maybe get a tiny bit of plaque off... The package does not lie, 90%+ of the plaque on my bottom teeth that was annoying me, is now gone! I am very happy! Now time to try some white strips, I will leave a review after I finish it all.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s because i&#x27;ve been using some natural toothpaste for a few months, but this stuff is amazing. super clean teeth and whiter, too.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I use this with a Philips Sonicare toothbrush. I can definitly tell a difference after using if for a few months. Just dont expect teeth to become magically white. Nothing but strips and professional whitening will do that, however this paste should show an improvement and even keep teeth white once a professional whitening has been done.</li>
            <li> I have noticed overtime this toothpaste keeps my teeth white. I have been using this product for probably 3 years now &amp; will not switch!</li>
            <li> Yellow teeth are yellow teeth.  Years of coffee, tea, and cola drinking will discolor teeth, as well as having been prescribed tetracycline as a child before my permanent teeth were in.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste really works!! Today was my first time using the toothpaste. So this evening I brushed with it (remember its my first day using it) and then I showed it to my children and said what do you think? Both of my children said wow mom what did you do to your teeth they look so white!!! I told them I used crest whitening luxe 3D and they both asked if they could use the toothpaste. They were not exaggerating actually when I looked in the mirror the toothpaste fixed 99.999% of the stains on my bottom set and 50% on the top set</li>
            <li> After months of coffee, this product was able to noticably whiten my teeth by a shade in about two weeks. Two by a month or so for me. It&#x27;s been four months and I use it continually, but my teeth haven&#x27;t seemed to have gotten any whiter. Nonetheless, I prefer it over the crest 3D, as it works faster and keeps stains away. I will continue to use it until I find something that works better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 3 days and my whole mouth hurts. I have sores on the roof of my mouth and my teeth actually hurt. It&#x27;s difficult to eat or drink anything. I&#x27;m tossing it.</li>
            <li> I work for a dentist but, don&#x27;t believe in using &amp;#34;bleaching trays&#x27;  so this is an amazing alternative . I have pretty light teeth but, I do drink tea ALOT this was so impressive after one day of use I noticed it working. I now a fan and will be a loyal customer to this product!</li>
            <li> Tastes good, has a good texture, and it works! I have used this paste a few times and see results. Great product. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This item is as the same as I expected and with a great value also! I am glad that I bought it:)</li>
            <li> just love the way my teeth feel after I brush with this tooth paste and my teeth looks a lot whiter too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this toothpaste but my wife does and loves it. Her teeth look whiter and when I get a kiss her breath has me asking for more. Try it or buy it for a loved one</li>
            <li> My holy grail of toothpastes.</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste.  The taste is very fresh and clean and it really does whiten!  It&#x27;s a recurring order for us so we never run out.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth paste. I bought the smaller size for school, as I&#x27;m moving onto my campus dorm and don&#x27;t want to lug around a full sized tube. I&#x27;m only going to be in school for probably sub 2 years, and this will probably last me most of those years! It helps to whiten my teeth, and makes my breath feel fresh!</li>
            <li> I use this product sparingly as my dental hygienist cautioned that these types of products erode teeth enamel and it is not noticeable until it is too late too reverse the damage.  Even so, I love the way my teeth feel so clean when I do use it.  Important to not swallow the toothpaste and to rinse your mouth out with fresh water afterwards.  I would imagine that any effective teeth whitening formula could erode tooth enamel eventually.  A teeny 1/4 inch dab does the job for me.  I do recommend it for effectiveness, as long as one is aware of the possible erosion of tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> I saw results in a week or so my friends constantly compliment my teeth. I will definitely keep using this.</li>
            <li> Saw whitening the second day I used it!!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste on its own works great when used at least twice a day. It works even better when used with the mouthwash</li>
            <li> Noticeably whiter teeth in five days.  I&#x27;m not sure what surface stains are, but this toothpaste works quickly with major impact.</li>
            <li> Most whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t work. Period. However, this brand whitened just after my first use. I like cofee. Okay, I&#x27;m addicted. If it were possible I&#x27;d shoot the stuff up in my veins, ha! Seriously, this has removed those dark caffeine stains from my teeth, I don&#x27;t know if the results will be as good as the strips, but so far it&#x27;s a cheaper alternative. This is one of those rare moments when I&#x27;m not disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I drink coffee and my teeth get a little stained.  I thought I&#x27;d try this, and after about 5 days, my teeth were looking better.  It does make your mouth feel fresh too.  It makes sense that a toothpaste can do this, all they have to do is include whatever the dentist uses, for a LOT less money.  My husband will try it now, that will be the real test.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to crest. Love procter&#x27;s products, nice breath and 3d white works. Strongly reccomend for customers. I will return for buy again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, works fine as just toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I really liked how this product removed 90% of my surface stains in just 5 days. I have been using this toothpaste for two weeks now and my teeth are still yellow.  That is why I gave this product 3 stars.  And it said it whitens in just 1 day, but I don&#x27;t find that true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in my teeth since using this for the past several months. I give it a 4 star because it&#x27;s not as good as using the strips, but I&#x27;m so bad at keeping up with doing those! I&#x27;m sure if you used this along with the strips, you&#x27;d get amazing results. My 8 year old also uses this and doesn&#x27;t mind the taste of it, which is hard to find for kids!</li>
            <li> I bought this as an extra measure to whiten my teeth. Works well! I like to save it to use before heading out on a date or a special event instead of my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent toothpaste, but I wanted to note that this dried out my skin (which does sound a little strange considering you use toothpaste for the teeth).  When brushing, it&#x27;s common for me that a little bit of the toothpaste escapes my lips and trickles down the edge of my lips onto one side of my chin.  After using this consistently, I noticed that the side of my chin the toothpaste came out dried up my skin because it started peeling.  My skin only got better when I switched toothpastes. I normally use the Crest 3D in Radiant Mint, but thought Vibrant Mint would be more powerful.  It is stronger stuff but not good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed and nervous to use the product when I opened the box and the tube of toothpaste didn&#x27;t have a tamper seal. Most other tubes of toothpaste I&#x27;ve used have this. Also, I haven&#x27;t really noticed my teeth getting white, as the product claims and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 5 weeks now.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. It has a great refreshing taste. Used twice daily my teeth remain very white. Also perfect dental check ups every time since beginning use of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> ahhhh fresh and clean</li>
            <li> It works as toothpaste but I don&#x27;t seem to be getting whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> product contains silica, so is more gritty then regular toothpaste. I like this fact as after one use it left my teeth feeling cleaner then they have in months. I&#x27;ve read warnings and reviews stating that consistent use of this  abrasive product might be damaging to enamel, but for now I will continue to use it until I am satisfied with the whitening results.Not appreciating the sensitivity caused by bleaching agents found in strips... I like the fact that using this past is a little gentler. Yet it seems to surpass the abilities of less expensive whitening tooth pastes.  It reminds me of the pastes used in dentist offices to polish teeth. While I am insure if this tooth paste can do a deep bleaching like you could get from expensive whitening strips or professional whitening, yet this product will clean and polish your teeth well removing surface stains. I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Just what I need. But I haven&#x27;t find the whitening effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other toothpaste I&#x27;d say. Gets your teeth clean but can&#x27;t say it made mine any whiter.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but decided to write my first on this toothpaste. I&#x27;m not a Crest person but I saw it for sale for 3.99 and bought it because I thought four dollars was worth the risk. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. This is my new favorite toothpaste. My teeth are visibly whiter after a few weeks and stains are gone. Most importantly, my mouth feels fresh and clean when I&#x27;m done brushing. I&#x27;ve gotten a few family members to switch to this product after they started noticing my brighter smile. :)</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews, I thought I would give this a few months to see if the whitening really does work.  So far, I see no difference, but it&#x27;s only be a couple of months.  I&#x27;ll keep buying this hoping it&#x27;s slowly working it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. I use it along with the crest white professional strips and it has made a difference in my teeth</li>
            <li> I’m not exactly sure why I think this is the best toothpaste but I do. I always buy it and am satisfied. I am super anal about the whiteness of my teeth so this goes hand in hand with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smoker for 12+ years and my teeth were as yellow as u can imagine! This works better than the strips, no joke! Will be buying again and again!</li>
            <li> It has a strong minty/menthol taste. I have been usuing this paste for a week, 2x a day and I have seen a slight difference. I also noticed that there are tiny blue dots in the paste, from reading past reviews I dont believe they make the toothpaste safe to use. I dont want to throw away my money that I used to purchase this toothpaste though .</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste ... so much that I have my fiance using it too! Our teeth aren&#x27;t 100% whiter but we both agreed that there&#x27;s a noticeable difference since using it. It leaves our mouths feeling nice and clean better than most other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> White teeth... Check. It is a great toothpaste but if you have sensitive teeth than you should stay away from the product.</li>
            <li> I rarely drink coffee, but did during a week away from home because I was attending a conference.  Somehow, it caused me to get two stains on my front two teeth that would not go away for two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for just a few days, the stains are gone.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just started using it so, I&#x27;m not 100% sure how to take it...but I do see some subtle change in color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my teeth are any whiter after months of use.</li>
            <li> Best whiting tooth paste on the market for the best price. I will purchase more when i need to by the two pack for the best price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 months and my teeth aren&#x27;t whiter. Very disappointing</li>
            <li> I kind of went on a mission to get rid of my plaque and whiten my teeth in a short time frame before I flew home to see my family.  must say, I neglect my oral care.  I have a bleeding disorder and haven&#x27;t seen a dentist in years.  I used a scraper to get rid of  my plaque then used this toothpaste in combination with the matching whitening strips.  The results were good, but left my teeth VERY sensitive, like so sensitive that sucking air into my mouth wrong sent singing pain through my front teeth.  Because I did all three steps in rapid succession I honestly can&#x27;t say if it was the combination of changes, or one of the parts in particular that caused the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this stuff has good flavor.  The tube is slightly smaller than a standard tube, which surprised me when I got it in the mail, but it&#x27;s not like they lied about the tube size, I just hadn&#x27;t paid attention, and was jarred by the difference in size between my husband&#x27;s tube of crest and my new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use the toothpaste even though I&#x27;ve finished the white strips.  As time passes if I&#x27;m still experiencing sensitivity and decide it&#x27;s due to the toothpaste, I&#x27;ll try to remember to come update my review accordingly</li>
            <li> If you have even slightly sensitive teeth or occasionally get canker sores, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me begin this by saying that I regularly use whitening toothpastes and I also use whitening strips.  And I have NEVER encountered the problems I did with this horrible toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 7 days of normal use, it gave me a painful canker sore inside my mouth, EXTREMELY sensitive teeth, and even my tongue hurts.  I finally realized it was this awful toothpaste and threw it away immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did seem to whiten my teeth better than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s not worth this misery!!!  I think the chemicals in this toothpaste are much too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the entire tube to give it a chance. I don&#x27;t see a difference. My 40+ year old teeth still look just as yellow (esp. at the gumline) as before. I&#x27;m not a smoker or wine drinker, but I do drink coffee occasionally. I&#x27;ve used the advanced seal white strips and they work incredibly well in terms of whitening, but they make my teeth hurt for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect the paste to chap my lips so much. Or cause irritation in the corners of my mouth. My tooth sensitivity has also increased. Other than that, it cleans like normal toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not impressed. It costs more than twice as much as normal toothpaste, yet people still rave that they bought it \\&quot;on sale!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It did whiten my teeth, but it also made them much more sensitive to cold. I threw it away before finishing the tube.</li>
            <li> Always love this product!</li>
            <li> So far my glamorousness has not improved, though it was already quite high to begin with. Nor has my tooth paste stopped time leaving me with three dimensions instead of four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth may be a bit whiter, but that&#x27;s to be expected from any ordinary tooth whitening paste these days.</li>
            <li> I use this back to back with my novamin sensodyne. Gives a very nice shade boost and has an exceptionally good flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun fact, this is actually a blend-a-med product http://www.oralb-blendamed.de/de-DE/3Dwhite-zahnaufhellungs-zahnpasta that goes very well with the oral-b electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note, seems to react w/ soda to form a membrane on teeth, just something to keep in mind...</li>
            <li> Fast and got on time as they promised. Good quality and as it showen in the picture that&#x27;s my opinion and my review</li>
            <li> This Product is great and works very well, and this is the product I&#x27;ve been looking for, for the right price. It is worth its money.</li>
            <li> Love white teeth and this product along with other Crest products, works very well.</li>
            <li> Glamorous white? This seems a little...well...flamboyant. Really. I just wanted something to keep my teeth from decaying and falling out. I brush them regularly and figured that I could use some sort of substance to help the cleaning process. Crest 3D. I never really thought of what the D stands for. It does a great job at cleaning teeth. I must now have some glamorous white chompers. I&#x27;m not so sure I&#x27;ll buy it again. I&#x27;m more of a &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; type of person. Maybe if they have &amp;#34;Manly white 3V&amp;#34; crest product I&#x27;ll be all over it.</li>
            <li> I bought the Glamorous White, mint flavor, which says it removes up to 90% of surface stains in 5 days. There are other Crest whitening toothpastes out there, including one that says it removes up to 80% and is called Vibrant Mint I believe.    I&#x27;ve used whitening products from Crest before, but not their toothpaste. Amazon no longer sold the whitestrips I usually get, so I thought I&#x27;d use this for maintenance. I&#x27;ve used this daily for exactly three weeks, and I&#x27;m very satisfied. I don&#x27;t want super white teeth, but I don&#x27;t want stained, yellow teeth either. This keeps my teeth fairly clean-looking. They&#x27;re \\&quot;white\\&quot; enough for my taste, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity while using this. I like the minty flavor, and it keeps my mouth and breath feeling fresh and clean for a few hours.    I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using the whitening strips anymore since using this product. I&#x27;ll be sticking to this instead. I highly recommend this over whitening strips. It&#x27;s much easier to brush your teeth daily than to put on nasty sticky strips that may cause tooth sensitivity.    UPDATE 9/22/14:    I bought a second tube and took a look at the new reviews. I found one that was particularly unsettling, and I&#x27;ve included my comment to theirs here as well...    A dental hygienist first brought the issue to the table through her blog when she began noticing small blue beads around her patients&#x27; gumlines. After some inquiry, she discovered they were from toothpaste, mainly those used for \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; purposes. There has been no scientific evidence or studies done to validate the dental hygienist&#x27;s claims, though they do make sense within logic and reason.    Procter &amp; Gamble have planned to remove the plastic from their products in the next six months, and to completely get rid of the plastic beads from their products by March 2016.    The ADA also issued a statement regarding this issue here: http://www.ada.org/en/press-room/news-releases/2014-archive/september/statement-on-polyethylene-microbeads-in-toothpaste. \\&quot;Polyethylene microbeads are commonly used as scrub beads, such as in exfoliating products, but are also sometimes used in chewing gum and toothpaste, as part of the product design. Small quantities of the colored polyethylene specks are included in some of Crest&#x27;s toothpastes, including Crest Pro Health, which has the ADA Seal of Acceptance ... The Council will continue to monitor and evaluate new scientific information on this issue as it becomes available.\\&quot;    According to Snopes:  \\&quot;Procter &amp; Gamble (the corporate parent of the Crest brand) asserted, in response to our inquiry, that their use of polyethylene (PE) in Crest brand toothpaste was harmless and that they would not be adding the substance to any new brands:    The colored polyethylene (PE) specks used in our oral care products are safe, FDA approved food additives. They are used in chewing gums and are commonly used in toothpastes. P&amp;G and other toothpaste manufacturers use limited amounts of small colored polyethylene specs in some toothpastes. Polyethylene beads are commonly used as scrub beads (e.g., in exfoliating products) but are also sometimes used to give color, like in chewing gum and toothpaste. There is no evidence from clinical studies or from on-going monitoring to indicate that these particles persist underneath the gumline or cause harm. We&#x27;ve already begun the process of identifying alternatives for use in our toothpaste and the PE specks will be replaced as soon as alternatives are qualified. In addition, we have decided not to introduce microplastic beads into any new product category.\\&quot;    Read more at http://www.snopes.com/medical/drugs/crest.asp#1kBajIeMIIEyWVyQ.99    After a little bit of research, I can say that it would be best to stay away from these products until they are removed and replaced with better, \\&quot;safer\\&quot; alternatives. P&amp;G do plan to remove the plastics soon, so I look forward to seeing what changes they will bring to their products. I havebeen very satisfied with Crest but this news is rather concerning. Hope this helps others gain a better perspective on this product line.</li>
            <li> I have tried other whitening toothpastes before with no visible results. I decided to try this one and after just 2 days I noticed a difference. I drink coffee daily so my teeth are stained. I am so happy with the results of this toothpaste. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I grew up using Crest, when the 3D White came out I didn&#x27;t hesitate to try it. OMG!! I get more compliments on my teeth when I use this toothpaste. It just makes my teeth sparkle. I love it so much. It&#x27;s the best line out there.</li>
            <li> works really well!  When I ran out and used the crest radiant mint version, I noticed and ordered the glamorous white version again.  I purchased this because my son has beautifully white teeth and this is what he uses.</li>
            <li> It is excellent. Works as stated. I recommend it to whom need white teeth.</li>
            <li> Great product. I get this about every two months from Amazon and good price.</li>
            <li> I saw an improvement in my teeth after using this toothpaste just ONE time.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.  It works for me!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best toothpastes I have ever tried!! It leaves my teeth not only whiter but also very clean! I would definitely recommend it, especially if you are a coffee and tea drinker like myself.</li>
            <li> This is my go to toothpaste. I will always repurchase this. It helps remove surface stains and keeps your teeth nice and white. I&#x27;m always asked how I keep my teeth white and this is always my answer.</li>
            <li> Great taste, not too sweet or too minty.</li>
            <li> Noticed changes within the first day - of course not dramatic changes - but you feel optimistic regarding the results, if it works within the 2nd time you brushed your teeth, you know after a week they will get a noticeable change! will definitely buy again as now I dont want to go back to the regular whitening toothpaste from crest :(</li>
            <li> This is our go to toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I change from Colgate to Crest 3D white after seeing my sister using this product. And she was right about it.</li>
            <li> feels good but not really whitened...</li>
            <li> This is the first and only whitening toothpaste that I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually does what it says it will do.  My teeth look noticeably whiter after only a single use.  This will remove pretty much any surface stains that you may have from food, coffee, wine, etc., but it won&#x27;t do miracles.  To remove stains that you&#x27;ve had for a while, you&#x27;ll need something like the whitening strips or trays.  Regardless, this product does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> PERFECT AND FAST DELIVERY :)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would live up to all it claimed to do but it did!  I was at the dentists office and saw a poster that listed what to do for a whiter smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the first step was a good teeth whitening toothpaste but the second step was using a spin brush!!!  I came home and purchased this toothpaste &amp; a rechargeable spin toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just two days after using both products I have a much whiter smile!  It looks like I used whitening strips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend using a spin brush along with this toothpaste for optimal results. I bought the cheapest Oral B spin brush on here &amp; extra brushes so my whole family has their own brush to stick on the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy whitening!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.  She is very happy with the whitening results it gives her teeth.  It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive per ounce, but it works and it tastes fine. Because of my skin tone, I need to have whitening tooth paste. Otherwise, my teeth look really yellow. I like this brand and toothpaste. I have decided that I do not need to bleach my teeth anymore. I can just use the whitening tooth paste and it seems to be able to help maintain the color of my teeth. It may also help that I have purchased an automatic toothbrush. The dentist thinks my teeth and gums are good now, when before when I used a regular toothbrush and toothpaste - they were atrocious.</li>
            <li> I like the taste and how fresh it smells. I used it for 4 weeks now but don&#x27;t see any improvement in whitening.</li>
            <li> Not all Toothpastes are created equal... we&#x27;ll have to see after time if this product really does make our teeth whiter. I&#x27;ll have to update this review later. As for taste... it&#x27;s strong and refreshing.</li>
            <li> BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  PLASTIC !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I try to avoid plastic as much as I can... recently something popped up on my facebook about Crest and Plastic... so yes.... this toothpaste contains plastic &amp;#34;Polyethylene&amp;#34;................... look it up, google it. Sorry crest, this is unacceptable.  Stay away and write to them and demand they remove plastic from their toothpaste. How ridiculous!!!!</li>
            <li> Good for whitening as well as overall health of teeth.</li>
            <li> Yes it does work really well. I use this toothpaste with my sonic toothbrush.</li>
