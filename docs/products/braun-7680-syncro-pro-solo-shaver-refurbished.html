    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best shaver ever built by Braun or anyone else that I ever used.  </li>
            <li>I consider this the perfect shaver.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with my unit; regardless of some of the negatives I can get an excellent shave in the quickest amount of time of any of the alternatives I&#x27;ve ever tried (which includes blades).</li>
            <li>This shaver is the best electric one I have come across.</li>
            <li>As at the time of this  writing, I have used the Braun Shaver for  over 2 years, and the  syncro has  been perfect.</li>
            <li>Best shaver if you&#x27;re afflicted with fuzzy logic.</li>
            <li>An excellent piece of technology.</li>
            <li>Definitely a best buy!!!</li>
            <li>I think Braun makes the best shavers in the world.  </li>
            <li>You have to try this machine to believe what a good shave it gives!!!!</li>
            <li>from the mouth of a gadget guy, its just cool!&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the BEST part...</li>
            <li>This is an awesome shaver.</li>
            <li>works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Excellent at cleaning the razor.</li>
            <li>This Braun Shaver (7680) will give you the best and closest shave you&#x27;ve ever gotten from ANY electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Tested three shavers and wet/dry Panasonic ES8092NC worked the best for me.  </li>
            <li>Braun 7680 is the best Braun I&#x27;ve had to date.</li>
            <li>While the shaver itself is the best on the market, the cleaning mechanism does not work as it should.</li>
            <li>This shaver has performed perfectly since I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>The Blade, foil, and swivel head all work brilliantly together to give the best results I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>However, it does not do a very good job of shaving.  </li>
            <li>The shaver itself is very good.  </li>
            <li>After 3 months of having this shaver I can say without hesitation it is the best, the self-cleaning is great</li>
            <li>Great item, very happy</li>
            <li>The cleaning feature is brilliant.  </li>
            <li>They cut great; but they&#x27;re always mounted in a position that I assume makes the best use of the shaver&#x27;s powertrain, and, realistically, you just have to contort a lot to get them into position.  </li>
            <li>shaver is incredible.  </li>
            <li>They used to make a good razor, but not anymore!</li>
            <li>Great razor.  </li>
            <li>Braun makes great coffee makers...</li>
            <li>This one works great.</li>
            <li>the cleaning thing is GREAT..</li>
            <li>If you work sensibly with the shaver, it does a great job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I used to be a razor man all my life and have heard great things about this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver</li>
            <li>the shave is great.</li>
            <li>A blade will give a closer shave, but I am extremely happy with this system.</li>
            <li>Of course the cleaning cartridge is an additional cost, but I am certainly happy with its results.</li>
            <li>I may look into getting a Panasonic shaver, but since I&#x27;m otherwise so happy with the Braun, I&#x27;ll probably just stay with Braun.</li>
            <li>Great Razor.&lt;br /&gt;28yr</li>
            <li>The cleaning system works great.  </li>
            <li>Have had this for thirteen months and it is great.</li>
            <li>This one works great just like the others.  </li>
            <li>Works great w/</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great product and</li>
            <li>The automatic cleaning feature is great, too.</li>
            <li>Mine worked great for 18 months until this issue surfaced.  </li>
            <li>The Braun 7680 looks nice, works great, and my skin is very happy afterwards as well.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, very nicely made piece of equipment.  </li>
            <li>is very nice.  </li>
            <li>And the self-cleaning system is truly remarkable.</li>
            <li>The Norelco&#x27;s are as effective as manually pulling each hair out!  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is more aggresive than the trimmer on a Norelco, but ALL trimmers on shavers to me are a convenience item, at best.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, use it every day and still running like a champ!</li>
            <li>After charging for the requisite period I tried the shaver, and was immediately impressed with one of the best, closest, and most comfortable shaves of my life.  </li>
            <li>The good: Self cleaning, smart-charging system, comfy shave&lt;br</li>
            <li>It never did a good shaving job.</li>
            <li>What a wise choice.  </li>
            <li>I FIND IT GIVES ME JUST A GOOD A SHAVE AS A RAZOR.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S A REALLY GOOD DEAL</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>the foils are still in good condition and do not need to be replaced for quite awhile yet.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with this purchase, and I have recommended the Braun 7680 Syncro, without qualification, to my friends.</li>
            <li>The pivot mode provides good flexible motion, the locked mode provides good control, and the extended long-hair trimmer mode performs as expected.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>&gt;I decided to turn from the Mach 3,even as good as that shaver was</li>
            <li>The shave I get from my Braun is as good as the MACH 3</li>
            <li>Shaves are close and I even shave during the weekend and not just on Sunday night,makes for a good Monday mornin.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>maybe Braun was not that good after all...</li>
            <li>So, when you leave town for a week, you just put the shaver &amp;amp; the cord in the pouch, toss it in the Ditty Bag, &amp;amp;your good to go.  </li>
            <li>All around a good system.</li>
            <li>Trust the Germans to come up with something this good.</li>
            <li>This gozmo is as good as any Ive tried.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is that the razor has a 2 year warranty.  </li>
            <li>It seems like a good idea in theory</li>
            <li>After it has run through its cleaning process, it&#x27;s so clean, it&#x27;s incredible!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many many electric shavers over the years and this Braun shaves as good as the best of them.  </li>
            <li>I love how close this razor gets and how the cleaning system does a great job.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system also works great but is pricey (about $60/year for the cleaning cartridges), so it&#x27;s much more over time than the cost of the shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, as a summary:  Great shave, even better if you&#x27;re used to electrics.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve had the razor for 16 months, and I&#x27;m still very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in many years but this one is great.</li>
            <li>Buy it,Use it, and you&#x27;ll Love it!</li>
            <li>Five stars, for sure!</li>
            <li>The 7680 refurbished arrived in good as new condition and has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>what I like best about my 7680 is that I don&#x27;t go more than a day without shaving anymore, sometimes I even shave in the morning and touch it up in the evening just because it is so quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The amazing thing about this type of Braun shaver is the charging and cleaning stand...</li>
            <li>This shaver in particualr is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the razor seemed to get warm on my face</li>
            <li>The value is good, and in many respects it is an investment.</li>
            <li>Has a nice screen indicating battery life.</li>
            <li>It gets nice and close and wont knick your skin like a rotary blade.</li>
            <li>Braun has made some really nice improvements at this point.  </li>
            <li>The shaver foils get rather warm if you use the shaver for over about 1.5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The shaver foils get rather warm if you use the shaver for over about 1.5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Being a gadget kind of guy I had to have the display, so I purchased the 7680.  </li>
            <li>(To see if it was as good as most of the reviews say).  </li>
            <li>There are replacement foils, but its kind of a pain to send away for it</li>
            <li>This is a nice shaver.  </li>
            <li>you want, and comes with this trendy charger set.&lt;BR&gt;  </li>
            <li>I found myself spending more time shaving in the morning and not getting a good shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice not to have to take the shaver apart and brush out the whiskers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately though, using a blade here is not painful for me and the blade is very effective, getting all the hairs in 1-2 swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to do,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to use, no brain is needed to manage the system; plus if somehow you can&#x27;t figure something out, it has a manual.</li>
            <li>VERY, VERY easy on your skin.  </li>
            <li>the very first shave its been GREAT..</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job, but no electric is as good as a blade</li>
            <li>It also cleans itself and maintains a strong battery charge!  </li>
            <li>I have used many electric shavers but the Braun system is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The most incredible thing is that it really does give you a shave as close as the blade.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how a $250 could be better.  </li>
            <li>The unit is much better constructed and sturdier than all the Norelco&#x27;s I ever owned.  </li>
            <li>AND YOU GET MORE</li>
            <li>and I get a better shave than with the blade.  </li>
            <li>Braun works much better than the rotary shavers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just been a satisfied customer for 7 years).</li>
            <li>With the requirements for myself  mentioned at the start of this  review, I have been  more than satisfied with this  product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s his favorite raiser.</li>
            <li>The latest models were running over $200.00.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I would appreciate any assistance you may be able to give me on this problem.  </li>
            <li>While I do seem to make more passes over my face than with the Remington, the shave is closer.</li>
            <li>I was able to take a week vacation without taking the cleaner stand along.</li>
            <li>I love the way this shaver shaves.  </li>
            <li>I have had many electric shavers in imy life.  </li>
            <li>Lectric\\&quot; pre shave helps minimize any irritation and gives an even better shave.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li>well if you allow your beard to grow for more than 48-72 hours.  </li>
            <li>I sure am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Let me tell you the shaver is better than advertisted.  </li>
            <li>How much more do you want?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better improvement than Norelco, but, shavers still have a ways to catch up to the razor.</li>
            <li>It also seemed to irritate my face more than the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am soooo pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I gotta say this is the coolest shaver, AND you get the best &amp;amp; most comfortable shave from this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Better than a rotary shaver, but I always wondered if there was a better shaver out there...</li>
            <li>it feels more like rubbing a glass all over your face.  </li>
            <li>the braun series 3 was ok</li>
            <li>Will you be able to shave once a day instead of twice?&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li>I bought this razor years ago and used it for many years without any issues.</li>
            <li>I thought the Norelco did okay</li>
            <li>The trimmer works much better than any of the Norelcos I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>In addition, it has a great battery life and is packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not about to spend any more money on this thing.</li>
            <li>but I think that a static head is just as good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No need to keep up with the latest technology when electric shavers hit their peak years ago anyway.</li>
            <li>On a dollar  for dollar  value, that kind of high useage  is quite good.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is actually incredibly effective, and leaves the razor perfectly clean and lubricated.</li>
            <li>I am very clean cut</li>
            <li>Wonderful, is a single word that I could able to think about this Braun 7680 Syncro System Logic Saver.</li>
            <li>Though this is just a minor inconvience, as it cleans the shaver perfectly</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is great and offers an excellent shave without the hassle of blowing out clippings or such.  </li>
            <li>I would wholeheartedly recommend this razor if your skin has become irritated through the foam and razor technique, and if you want a nice, quick shave in the morning.</li>
            <li>It cleans better - way better, than I can clean it by hand and it is sanitary.  </li>
            <li>The self-cleaning mechanism is very cool, though I&#x27;ll have to buy refills for it once a month or so . . .</li>
            <li>Replacement parts are still available in many places.  </li>
            <li>Great for and electric razor, but does not eliminate all the razor burn if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>old proud father of 1.&lt;br /&gt;Changed for Life</li>
            <li>This razor... if it were any more advanced, it would have to extend four spider-like limbs, crawl across the floor, climb into bed, and shave me while I sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cleaning is also remarkable, it removes all of the hair like it&#x27;s brand new</li>
            <li>Buy this shaver, true Shaving Nirvana!  </li>
            <li>The cleaning feature is outstanding for a clean shave each and every time.  </li>
            <li>That was until I recently had a friend marvel at how great the Braun 7680 was; I listened mostly out of amazement, because he sports a mustache too.  </li>
            <li>The 7680 handles it easily, even if I skip a day on the weekend.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you have a growth of a few days, it is best to start of with a  light setting, or just basically learn the way your  beard goes, the directions of the hair, and use the shaver in an appropriate manner.</li>
            <li>This is a first of a kind technology introduced by Braun into the 7680.</li>
            <li>It recharges and cleans fast, however, the refill cartridges can run into a good hunk of change if you clean the razor everytime</li>
            <li>easy to maintain, easy to use, shaves smooth.</li>
            <li>To clean the long-hair blades you need to bust out the cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a superior shaver for the money Braun wants for it.  </li>
            <li>To clean the long-hair blades you need to bust out the cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a superior shaver for the money Braun wants for it.  </li>
            <li>When I bought the new Braun 7680 Shaver about three years ago, the manual says that the rechargable battery would be good for three to five years.</li>
            <li>Otherwise both units are (were) fine products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this unit for more then a year and paid top dollar for its features when it was first released.  </li>
            <li>Some people can  shave  fine  with a blade, some can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Easy clean, easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Foils work the best hands down!</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is huge help in our bathroom since the shaver seems to \\&quot;catch\\&quot;</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T BE CHEAP BREAK BREAD</li>
            <li>Overall Great Razor and</li>
            <li>The Braun 7680 Syncro razor is really fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, Braun&#x27;s repair facility in San Francisco replaced it.  </li>
            <li>No burning, close shave, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I can genuinely tell you, he wasn&#x27;t kidding.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fit and finish of everything is of the highest caliber.  </li>
            <li>It is so smooth and cuts so well</li>
            <li>It cuts fully smooth in 2 strokes.... and (yes, I timed it)  </li>
            <li>Who worries about that money, when you get hassle free mornings</li>
            <li>I called the toll free service number and found a service place in my area.  </li>
            <li>They have the potential for a great product.</li>
            <li>I bought the refurbished version and saved a ton of money, and it has worked perfectly for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this thing is TOP NOTCH!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a fabulous shaver WELL worth the Money.</li>
            <li>Braun really come top of the pile when it comes to shavers - much better than philishave.</li>
            <li>As past reviewers correctly state, you do have to somewhat stretch your neck skin to get the absolute best shave.&lt;br /&gt;The joy of this shaver comes from NOT having three heads setup in a triangle, which really kills close touch ups.  </li>
            <li>I now know if I have shaved the area clean from that sound.  </li>
            <li>This review was originally written about the Syncro 7526 shaver,</li>
            <li>It does not come with the cleaning station it was originally packaged with.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>So all was well, until it broke again a couple of days ago, 2 months after the original repair.  </li>
            <li>The self cleaning is a great feature, it cleans the razor so much better than you could ever dream of doing with little brushes.</li>
            <li>I clean the shaver before every shave, so I don&#x27;t need all that hardware that came with the original shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have a very tuff beard and nothing really gives me a good shave.</li>
            <li>I clean mine</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It cuts supper close, super smooth and</li>
            <li>but the Braun trims it cleanly.  </li>
            <li>And, without the gizmo/toy/$ to clean it.  </li>
            <li>What happens is the arm on the clean and charge unit stops locking on to the razor.  </li>
            <li>The spring latch breaks and will not allow you to charge or clean the shaver.  </li>
            <li>Fifteen minutes later, the shaver is clean and good as new, with a nice scent added to boot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Im not one for highly consumable items (like the Cleaning cartridge in this thing), but man, it really is so nice to have a clean, fresh shaver</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;NO MORE BRAUN at these terribly high prices for cheap engineering.</li>
            <li>I just had to paint this review, BRIGHT BLUE.</li>
            <li>Cool design, lightweight, sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Cool design.</li>
            <li>They are ALL TRUE.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if this is true or just a staged event.  </li>
            <li>I have shaved with a blade for many years and about four years ago it began to really irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>but they tend to irritate more than even the blades which defeats the whole purpose.  </li>
            <li>While it is true</li>
            <li>While it is true</li>
            <li>This is true,</li>
            <li>that actually put some thought into scientifically explaining it; I had the good fortune to have a college room mate that paid his dues with a Norelco and he coached me well in this.  </li>
            <li>Cool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shave&#x27;s no worse than I get with anything else, but I was hoping for something significantly better.  </li>
            <li>When the shaver cuts any hair there is a distinct buzz to the sound.  </li>
            <li>If a simple good shave is what you want, this is for you.</li>
            <li>It really cuts close and better than my Gillette razor.    </li>
            <li>For under $70, this is not a bad price for a shaver of this design with LCD display and side pulsing technology.  </li>
            <li>The people in the store were very helpful and very familiar with this issue.  </li>
            <li>Other reviews do a great job describing how well it shaves, so I won&#x27;t repeat them.</li>
            <li>Under optimal shaving conditions this shaver provides a quick, clean, and smooth shave, exactly what it is supposed to do.ype of a swirling pattern.  </li>
            <li>Under optimal shaving conditions this shaver provides a quick, clean, and smooth shave, exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I would have to say the shave is about the same as the 5 year old 5000 series \\&quot;syncro\\&quot; Braun it replaced, which is very good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been able to cut the hair on my face with electric razors, but never been able to cut the hair on my neck, and I&#x27;ve tried several.  </li>
            <li>And If I have a date or something when I need a close shave just a quick skim with my Braun and then break out the Mach 3 Turbo</li>
            <li>I have never been able to get a decent shave from a disposable, or a so called  \\&quot;Blade\\&quot;  shaver , without looking like</li>
            <li>so I follow up quickly with a blade.  </li>
            <li>The Braun 7680 Syncro System Logic Shaver is a worthy 5 star item.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to clean and with top notch replacement parts, will last for years and years.  </li>
            <li>I have the previous model 7570 which gives a great shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned numerous electric shavers, and have consistently found Braun models to be superior for my needs.  </li>
            <li>You really have to stretch the skin to get the razor to shave such hairs--even then, it&#x27;s not always successful.</li>
            <li>It could simply be a style preference, and since performance was pretty good, I can&#x27;t knock it.</li>
            <li>Amazon has 2 refills for $10 right now which is pretty cheap compared to remingtons.</li>
            <li>(Note that my sensitive skin was not affected by any of the cleaning solution, which is mostly alcohol and evaporates quickly).  </li>
            <li>* clean the long-hair portion of the shaver, which is slightly higher than the foils when it is in the cleaner-case.  </li>
            <li>* clean the long-hair portion of the shaver, which is slightly higher than the foils when it is in the cleaner-case.  </li>
            <li>Rotary is great sometimes, but I&#x27;ve found a few problems.</li>
            <li>Being straight, you can get comfortably close to mustaches, goatees, etc.  </li>
            <li>Huge, very noticeable recharging stand.  </li>
            <li>Do you really need your face as smooth as a babys bottom?</li>
            <li>I was going to buy another Norelco until this Braun caught my attention as its self-cleaning ability was attractive; I found the cleaning of the Norelco messy.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to use a blade because my neck is so sensitive, so since my dad used a Remington electric razor, I did too.  </li>
            <li>well worth it.</li>
            <li>You can also buy from the braun site directly and get it cheap to!)</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest not wasting your money on this older technology.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the cash.  </li>
            <li>(the panasonic was as fast and close but the replacement heads weren&#x27;t as durable and cost about 50% more than the braun)  easy to clean and relatively quiet for a foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>definitely worth owning ...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a matter of whether or not you feel the refill is worth the time you would spend cleaning it every time you&#x27;d use it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the 150$.</li>
            <li>and it is powerful shaver.</li>
            <li>First, there are already a few very good positive reviews that I agree with.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used electrics for 25 plus years, now, and I&#x27;ve been more satisfied with this Braun than any other.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Yeah right.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and that is my story.</li>
            <li>it really does charge or clean or do both.</li>
            <li>Shaver is always clean and ready for use.</li>
            <li>Most likely I will find a way to &amp;quot;re-fill&amp;quot; the cartridge to extend its life, but even at $4.50 a month for replacements (Super Wallmart - $8.49 for a box with 2) ist worth it!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I have used the Braun electric razor and find that it does clean the blades very well.  </li>
            <li>Cool design (love the blue light), great feel, not too heavy, not too light, solidly built (dropped it once,</li>
            <li>No the blue is for the actual blue light that blinks and smiles at me letting me know its time for another great shave!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure) &amp;amp; the ever-present, light machine oil odor the cleaning solution imparts to the bathroom in general and to the razor in particular.</li>
            <li>ya, sure another expense, but a very small price to pay for a phenomenal shave!</li>
            <li>And , if you take a tad bit longer &amp;amp; really go for the super smmmooooth shave,  </li>
            <li>it takes about 3:00, or, if your in a rush, yuo can grab a good shave in less than 1 min, even with two days growth.  </li>
            <li>You can manually brush it out like most other electrics and that works fine.  </li>
            <li>No mess and easy to set up.  </li>
            <li>The locking mechanism on top of the cleaning station breaks easily; specifically, it ceases to stay in the locked (down) position which activates the cleaning function and keeps the shaver charged.</li>
            <li>it shaves faster, closer and more comfortably than any of the other razors i&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The switch of the first unit stucked at</li>
            <li>First, I shave before I shower.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried all that many electrics, but this is definitely the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten with one.</li>
            <li>but you can get pretty close by streaching your skin around.</li>
            <li>i had to restrain from writing this review the first day i got my 7680</li>
            <li>I first started using it</li>
            <li>This happened IMMEDIATELY when I tried to charge the shaver for the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had irritation or burn no matter how many times I have to go over the same spot and</li>
            <li>I go over spots where I might have missed during my last shave without being able to cut them.</li>
            <li>but you can set it to lock in place for a more controlled shave if necessary.</li>
            <li>First of all, the cartridges come 2 to a pack and are discounted online.</li>
            <li>Make sure you&#x27;re close to a Braun authorized repair facility, since shipping it back is a hassle.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li>I have been shaving with traditional blades for many years with a combination of a Norelco beard &amp;amp;</li>
            <li>I am critical in most reviews but when I have a product that performs as well as my Braun 7680</li>
            <li>But first let me say this, I have had electic razors before and always went with Norelco.</li>
            <li>at first I thought that I wasn&#x27;t going to like it, but since it was a Father&#x27;s Day gift, I was somewhat obligated to use it for a while.</li>
            <li>Most shaver manufacturers say that I need to use it for several weeks and that will go away.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t EVER judge ANY electric by the first two weeks; and DON&#x27;T get tempted to use a razor to touch up</li>
            <li>I first purchased a Remington 9500, and returned it after about 5 shaves.  </li>
            <li>it was the best, however, my cleaning/ recharging unit no longer works, and needless to say this puts me in a bind.</li>
            <li>I was doing on the first time out)I am truly converted.  </li>
            <li>Kudo&#x27;s to Braun for finally breaking the mold and figuring out how to make an outstanding razor.  </li>
            <li>But after a couple of weeks, the razor was shaving very closely, it was not irritating my skin, and it only took about 4 minutes to get a nice shave.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I really miss it!  </li>
            <li>but if you are looking to save a few bucks the lower priced units without the LCD would probably be a good choice.    </li>
            <li>My comments about shaving above still  apply, and if some of the  critics  took these  into accounts, maybe they  could  get more than adequate  use out of this high quality shaver.</li>
            <li>The razor does a pretty good job... there are still a few spots along my jaw line that only a non-electric hits easily.  </li>
            <li>No shaver is perfect and does not shave properly the first swipe over your face, but this one seems to cut fairly cleanly and takes only a few brushes against my cheeks.</li>
            <li>it conditions your battery to get the best life out of it, learning your shaving behavior and discharging when you&#x27;re least likely to use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously as good as shaving with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station not only cool looking but extremely functional.  </li>
            <li>Changing over has been a positive experience.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s pretty much all I found that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I must admit that I was very thorough with my first shave with it.  </li>
            <li>Like another reviewer, I don&#x27;t clean the shaver every day, more like every few shaves.  </li>
            <li>The good thing about this is that when I do use the blade afterwards, it&#x27;s painless because I&#x27;m shaving very few hairs at a time.</li>
            <li>Even from 45 minutes to 10 minutes the time saved is worth the price alone not even counting the cost of new blades.</li>
            <li>To me even if I have to but a new screen and blade plus 20 cleaning refills in a year it is still worth the price.</li>
            <li>Then I go back and cleanup with a blade, rather easily and painlessly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 7680 is the top of the line dry shaver from Braun.</li>
            <li>I thought my last Braun was unbeatable, but the 7680 beats it easily.</li>
            <li>, I am rather certain it is just me, and that cannot be helped.  </li>
            <li>, I am rather certain it is just me, and that cannot be helped.  </li>
            <li>Mainly because I liked my other one a lot.  </li>
            <li>Quite clever!</li>
            <li>The unit has more than adequate battery power to last the entire week</li>
            <li>A simple trimmer, such as Norelco&#x27;s superb little mustache/beard trimmer, just make life so much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>About the only 2 things I don&#x27;t care for are the very bright blue light on the base which is even a bit too bright as a bathroom nightlight</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and without any problem.  </li>
            <li>I was very intrigued by the self-cleaning razors, so I started my online investigations.  </li>
            <li>I have a fast beard growth and I have noticed that my face stays smoother longer</li>
            <li>BUT, if you plan on buying any of the braun syncro shavers be VERY careful(on</li>
            <li>Being that I&#x27;m cheap, I&#x27;m not using the cleaning solution on a regular basis, but will periodically use it, then close the container each time so it doesn&#x27;t evaporate.  </li>
            <li>It still shaves, but it makes so much noise that I cannot use it while my wife is still asleep in the bedroom for fear of waking her up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very close shave.  </li>
            <li>Have used Braun shavers for some time and have been very satisified with all.  </li>
            <li>The shave is also much closer and confortable.  </li>
            <li>Buying a Shaver really is a very \\&quot;personal\\&quot; decision.</li>
            <li>And if available, I may do this the next time as well.</li>
            <li>all you have to do is put it in and hit a button, that&#x27;s really it.</li>
            <li>It is very close to blade shaving and</li>
            <li>much easier.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>It turns out to be much better than expected.</li>
            <li>I had to switch to an electric because I have sensetive skin and the blade was irritiating my skin too much.  </li>
            <li>and I am ready to make my review.  </li>
            <li>Please dont confuse blue with the Kmart &amp;quot;Blue Light Special&amp;quot;.</li>
            <li>Never having used an electric razor befor, because I had always heard how they do not provide very close shave, and that they tend to pull hairs, I was reluctant to accept the Braun 7680 as a Fathers Day gift.</li>
            <li>Plus Amazon sent me a free travel shave case at no extra cost.  </li>
            <li>The shipment was lighting fast as well.</li>
            <li>, I simply cannot emphasize how important it is to TAKE TIME and let your beard/skin get accustomed to using the electric.  </li>
            <li>Oh yes, one last thing that&#x27;s important:  the cleaning solution tanks.  </li>
            <li>I read lots of reviews - thanks to all who posted them, they were very helpfull - and decided on the Braun 7680...</li>
            <li>5310 too 4:20 - 5:30, and my neck was irritatede&amp;amp; I had to really work some spots.  </li>
            <li>its really a &amp;quot;Shave &amp;amp</li>
            <li>; Go&amp;quot; system that self cleans... it really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Compared with Norelco rotary shaver, this one is clearly much noiser.</li>
            <li>Perhaps these folks will find a way to Mach 3 in the car!&lt;br /&gt;     If your beard really can not be cut by a machine, your not even shopping for one and you will never see this review.</li>
            <li>This is a quality shaver - it is very well made, you can tell by the feel of it in your hand.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t checked out how much those will cost yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a Philips since and much prefer the Philips.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t irritate as much for others.</li>
            <li>The blue light indicator for charging or cleaning is aesthetically pleasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The newer one is easier to use and charge; it uses the cleaner fluid more economically and seems to be built to last.</li>
            <li>The Braun shaved very well also, but the Panasonic was somewhat closer.  </li>
            <li>I was very dissappointed and have returned it to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I had never tried a Braun and was concerned whether it would be at least as good as the Norelco brand.  </li>
            <li>the razor itself, a very nice leather carrying case, a cleaning brush, the instructions, a hard clear plastic foil protector,a charging/cleaning stand and a bottle of the cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>The only way this will ever cut you is if the foil is damaged, and that is very rare ( I have found).  </li>
            <li>Whats best about this product compared to the other braun shavers is not only the cleaner that comes with it but its ability to shave closer then any other braun has before.</li>
            <li>with the totally  excellent  cleaner, I can definitively say that this Braun does a great job, cutting through tough beard hair, as well as treating sensitive skin very well.  </li>
            <li>(mainly because the shave is that much closer than the Remington delivers).  </li>
            <li>Second, I clean the razor after every shave.  </li>
            <li>I have the older version of this shaver (now has an LCD display) and the shaver has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>It has a special horizontal shaver in between the 2 standard cylinders that helps shave tuff to reach spots like your chin and jaw bone area.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t get \\&quot;excited\\&quot; about such mundane items, but for me, this is one good shaver.</li>
            <li>Well, I first shave with an old norelco 985rx under the chin, then I finish with the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Foil</li>
            <li>This effectively doubles the lifespan of the cartridges, if not more.</li>
            <li>you have read in the reviews below especially the PRO&#x27;s is absolutely true.  </li>
            <li>Just put it in the cleaning station push the top down</li>
            <li>Braun 7680 is a very &#x27;Teutonic&#x27; looking piece of equipment; very high tech, but classy, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li>So in order to get a decent shave I end up having to feel for each grain and try to arc the shave out from the epicenter in a sort-of counter swirl.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>So in order to get a decent shave I end up having to feel for each grain and try to arc the shave out from the epicenter in a sort-of counter swirl.&lt;BR&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>I have owned norelco and another older Braun model.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t get a decent shave with anything</li>
            <li>I thought this was the coolest shaver ever when I saw the sleek and sexy commercial back when I was a kid.</li>
            <li>The reviewers were VERY helpful to point out that this was no ordinary electric razor.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews for the Braun 7680 Syncro, I decided to give it a try, despite the high cost.</li>
            <li>I think you will find the cost a fraction of using high end blades and shaving foams/gels.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver on anyone&#x27;s wish list.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Braun Syncro 7680 shaving system.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to have a high tech &#x27;rocket launcher&#x27;</li>
            <li>More accurately, once that cutting sound is gone, I know I have a very close shave that will last the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning system</li>
            <li>With my old 6520 it would always miss hairs on certain parts of my neck.  </li>
            <li>and I find that I only need to clean it every 3-4 days; not everyday as the company says to.</li>
            <li>Definitely well worth it.</li>
            <li>but this is worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>The Braun 7680 is pricey but after about a month of usage I have found that the price is worth it for several reasons: &lt;</li>
            <li>expectations were way high when I got the new Braun 7680.  </li>
            <li>every other shave and my cartridge worked fine for 2 1/2 months.</li>
            <li>In deciding to purchase a replacement unit I considered the new Norelco \\&quot;James Bond\\&quot; model as well as the Braun 7680.  </li>
            <li>Braun has a new lifetime customer in me.  </li>
            <li>all say you need to give your beard about 20 days to adjust to the new system and I&#x27;ll give them all a fare chance).</li>
            <li>Therefore, I was weary about purchasing a new electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It is a shame since when new this razor worked quite well.  </li>
            <li>In my case I had to buy a new set of razor heads per week almost $10.</li>
            <li>Of course now I want to know if the battery is new for the refurbished device.</li>
            <li>I will not buy it if the battery is not replaced with a new one.</li>
            <li>It is like getting a new shaver with each use.</li>
            <li>My friend mentioned to me that he never had any problems with this new shaver.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Braun, which amiably sent me a new one with cutters.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re new to an electric</li>
            <li>, it was time for a new foil - or - a new razer.  </li>
            <li>Do I buy a new unit or do I ask for a new one but   </li>
            <li>I was new to electric razors when I bought this.</li>
            <li>This is particularly disappointing, because I expect more durability and better designs from the Germans.</li>
            <li>however, the cleaning solution is only good for about a month (assuming you shave at least every weekday) and the refills become rather costly.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>Due to my very sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t use a regular razor more than one or two days in a row.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through two units in two years, both failing in exactly the same fashion.</li>
            <li>This one is a lot more quiet than my other one.  </li>
            <li>They shaved well enough but 4 months into use with my first</li>
            <li>Here also because the Braun is a straight edge with its foil system, its easier to cut in the sideburns area versus the rotary, which if one is not careful could leave a circular cut on the sides.&lt;BR&gt;4.</li>
            <li>They fixed it while I waited at no charge!  </li>
            <li>The Syncro system would appear to offer not only a clean shave, but also the ultimate convenience of a self-cleaning function.</li>
            <li>Not having to open it and brush it clean constantly is a definate plus!  </li>
            <li>first, you plug the power cord into the razor and start a 4 hour charging procedure; Braun cautions you to NOT start using the cleaning stand for the initial charge (stating that the &#x27;Smart Logic&#x27; built into the razor needs this first, necessary charge in such a manner).  </li>
            <li>The shaver does have definite difficulty with long, flat-lying hairs, perhaps even more so than other electrics, which is its only remotely significant problem in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Once the hairs get past a certain length, the shaver proves very ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I managed to work around this by removing the spring inside the neck, but this fix only lasted 5 more recharging sessions until it once again refuse to click all the way down into position.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be that as it may, I recently switched to the new generation of self-cleaning Brauns and I am absolutely thrilled!&lt;BR</li>
            <li>Currently, the razor foil is more or less kaput, so I ordered a replacement head ...).  </li>
            <li>i had the norelco advantage which was &#x27;ok&#x27; but old and starting to wear down..</li>
            <li>When used correctly, which means learning your particular face patterns, there is little argument that the Braun will shave closer than any rotary, as a foil can be made much thinner than a rotary &amp;quot;cage.&amp;quot; In fact, the very closeness of the shave is why some people are complaining about ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li>When that razor crashed and burned, big time, I got smart and researched electric razors eventually settling on the Braun 7680.</li>
            <li>I bought the Braun 7680 refurbished even after being a little bit concerned with the number of refurbished units available.  </li>
            <li>This razor is quiet and gives a real close shave.</li>
            <li>the old one clean&lt;BR&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I had to replace the foil once or twice on my old braun shavers over those 6 years.  </li>
            <li>It just catches they very tips of the hairs occasionally.</li>
            <li>it started to get really loud and not shave well at all.  </li>
            <li>well, the price of the Mach 3 replacement blades will accumulate over the years, and they are a bit pricey, you only have to change the the blade on the Braun 7680 Syncro every 18 months, so it really pays for it self.</li>
            <li>Next a drying cycle occurs, where a gently blowing fan assists in helping evaporate the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>Nearly all of the claims Braun makes about this product are true:&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 7680 has changed that completely.</li>
            <li>The tri-head Norelco just couldn&#x27;t &#x27;touch up&#x27; near the &#x27;stache,</li>
            <li>As far as performance...</li>
            <li>This razor replaced my 5+ year old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>the difference between my old 6520 and the 7680 would be so monumental.  </li>
            <li>Having to replace the cartridges all the time is a complete gimmick too.</li>
            <li>I like that you can charge the shaver and then don&#x27;t have to use the cable until the battery is completely depleted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But these things are meaningless without a good shave -</li>
            <li>They need to be taken care, and they  will give a good  service; if you use it  carelessly, then it will break.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read the other reviews, and, unlike some reviewers, I&#x27;ve noticed no quality issues; everything has performed as I would&#x27;ve expected a nicely engineered German product to do.  </li>
            <li>First off, it is really 98% as close as a Mach 3 without the mess of shaving cream or nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>The cleaning cartridges are only 5$ each and last a month if you clean daily.  </li>
            <li>Because of how much shaving I do daily it is a major plus to have the self cleaning feature.</li>
            <li>It irritated my skin a bit, but friends told me that was normal when switching from a traditional blade.</li>
            <li>Change to a new cartridge only when the stubble level exceeds a desireable collected amount.</li>
            <li>Braun came out with a next generation series after this one (New version has irregular pattern on screen.).</li>
            <li>, well worth the extra money spent.  </li>
            <li>I had this shaver for only a few weeks and the charging stand/cleaner stopped working and engaging the shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides, this is the older 7000 series model, several generations behind the latest Braun shaver model.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver for my husband who has very sensitive skin and shaving with a normal razor caused razor burn every time he shaved no matter how careful he was.  </li>
            <li>Like so many other people on this board my cleaning unit broke after a few months.</li>
            <li>- I never find the sink full of little hairs anymore!  </li>
            <li>I thought that the 7000 series would be outstanding but this particular model failed the test.  </li>
            <li>I have had Norelco, Remington, and Braun shavers in the past and have never really been satisfied with any of them.  </li>
            <li>My Braun 7680 suddenly began making a loud noise after about six months.  </li>
            <li>I can testify to that basically  because my  beard hair is very coarse, but my skin is extremely  sensitive.</li>
            <li>Shaving time to do all my shaving with that regular razor was nearly 45 minutes per day.</li>
            <li>The complete shaving head pivots front to back</li>
            <li>The shave is very close (I would say 98% as close as a Mach 3 blade shave) with minimal irritation and razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Also if you have sensitive skin, the shaver will be sanitized to reduce irritation next time you use it.</li>
            <li>My beard is not heavy, but it is coarse.  </li>
            <li>only drawback so far is the position of the power button on the shaver.  </li>
            <li>The shaver has three settings, one for fixed head, one for swivel head and the third to activate the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It is not cheap, but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>extendable feature is powerful and I have used it to shave my legs a few times and my armpits.</li>
            <li>First the tab won&#x27;t stay down</li>
            <li>I sent it in for a replacement and now the new one is doing the same thing after only a couple months use.  </li>
            <li>I still waited about every other day to shave but the shave was much closer and even with the knicks, Mach 3, was a definate upgrade from the Norelco.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the other reviewers for taking the time to give feedback for a skeptic like me.  </li>
            <li>The little computer glitch is only a slight mar on an otherwise outstanding product.</li>
            <li>The button is loose enough and located in such a position that it is a little too easy to change inadvertently the settings from 1 to 2.  </li>
            <li>The setting for the trimmer is far enough on the setting that an accidental activation of the trimmer is not likely though.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>that is where this little beauty really shines!  </li>
            <li>the CLEAN and CHARGE center broke after only a couple of months, wont stay down which from what i&#x27;ve read is a known problem, there are even repair centers for it.  </li>
            <li>thought about purchasing the Braun 7526, which is apparently the same shaver without the LED display, and about 50 dollars cheaper.  </li>
            <li>my old braun 7505 finally died and i tried a couple others (including the braun series 3) that i took back and got my money back on and went ahead and purchased another braun syncro.  </li>
            <li>the Braun - well built and close shave, but one star off for the decorative/size aspect, second star off for the addtional maintenance cost and noise (which apparently increases with time).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every shaver (and I mean every) has always left me with that nice little burn under my neck.  </li>
            <li>Finally, after merely 5-weeks of usage, the original screen acquired a large hole.</li>
            <li>I decided to switch to the Braun mainly because of the online reviews of other customers.  </li>
            <li>With this shaver, it takes him less time to shave and it is much gentler on his face.  </li>
            <li>The stand for the cleaning system takes up a bit of space though and looks like a rocket launcher but it achieved my desire of not having to clean out all that hair mess every week or so from the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The LCD screen is functional but I especially like the feature about how long the last shave was, it is reassuring to see when the amount of time I used to shave was not too long.  </li>
            <li>The only other negative is that the ergonomics of the device could be much better, especially relative to Norelco products.</li>
            <li>I started a new habit, bringing it up to be cleaned in its stand with that lemon solution, perhaps my facial skin will benefit, maybe even keep the razor sharp longer?</li>
            <li>this shaver does is cut down most of the hairs without it being as painful as using a blade, but I end up having to use a blade to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>However, like all  high use items, there is a point where it will  break down, and</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This is the best shaver ever built by Braun or anyone else that I ever used.  </li>
            <li> I consider this the perfect shaver.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with my unit; regardless of some of the negatives I can get an excellent shave in the quickest amount of time of any of the alternatives I&#x27;ve ever tried (which includes blades).</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best electric one I have come across.</li>
            <li> As at the time of this  writing, I have used the Braun Shaver for  over 2 years, and the  syncro has  been perfect.</li>
            <li> Best shaver if you&#x27;re afflicted with fuzzy logic.</li>
            <li> An excellent piece of technology.</li>
            <li> Definitely a best buy!!!</li>
            <li> I think Braun makes the best shavers in the world.  </li>
            <li> You have to try this machine to believe what a good shave it gives!!!!</li>
            <li> from the mouth of a gadget guy, its just cool!&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the BEST part...</li>
            <li> This is an awesome shaver.</li>
            <li> works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Excellent at cleaning the razor.</li>
            <li> This Braun Shaver (7680) will give you the best and closest shave you&#x27;ve ever gotten from ANY electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Tested three shavers and wet/dry Panasonic ES8092NC worked the best for me.  </li>
            <li> Braun 7680 is the best Braun I&#x27;ve had to date.</li>
            <li> While the shaver itself is the best on the market, the cleaning mechanism does not work as it should.</li>
            <li> This shaver has performed perfectly since I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> The Blade, foil, and swivel head all work brilliantly together to give the best results I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> However, it does not do a very good job of shaving.  </li>
            <li> The shaver itself is very good.  </li>
            <li> After 3 months of having this shaver I can say without hesitation it is the best, the self-cleaning is great</li>
            <li> Great item, very happy</li>
            <li> The cleaning feature is brilliant.  </li>
            <li> They cut great; but they&#x27;re always mounted in a position that I assume makes the best use of the shaver&#x27;s powertrain, and, realistically, you just have to contort a lot to get them into position.  </li>
            <li> shaver is incredible.  </li>
            <li> They used to make a good razor, but not anymore!</li>
            <li> Great razor.  </li>
            <li> Braun makes great coffee makers...</li>
            <li> This one works great.</li>
            <li> the cleaning thing is GREAT..</li>
            <li> If you work sensibly with the shaver, it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I used to be a razor man all my life and have heard great things about this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver</li>
            <li> the shave is great.</li>
            <li> A blade will give a closer shave, but I am extremely happy with this system.</li>
            <li> Of course the cleaning cartridge is an additional cost, but I am certainly happy with its results.</li>
            <li> I may look into getting a Panasonic shaver, but since I&#x27;m otherwise so happy with the Braun, I&#x27;ll probably just stay with Braun.</li>
            <li> Great Razor.&lt;br /&gt;28yr</li>
            <li> The cleaning system works great.  </li>
            <li> Have had this for thirteen months and it is great.</li>
            <li> This one works great just like the others.  </li>
            <li> Works great w/</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product and</li>
            <li> The automatic cleaning feature is great, too.</li>
            <li> Mine worked great for 18 months until this issue surfaced.  </li>
            <li> The Braun 7680 looks nice, works great, and my skin is very happy afterwards as well.  </li>
            <li> Great quality, very nicely made piece of equipment.  </li>
            <li> is very nice.  </li>
            <li> And the self-cleaning system is truly remarkable.</li>
            <li> The Norelco&#x27;s are as effective as manually pulling each hair out!  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is more aggresive than the trimmer on a Norelco, but ALL trimmers on shavers to me are a convenience item, at best.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, use it every day and still running like a champ!</li>
            <li> After charging for the requisite period I tried the shaver, and was immediately impressed with one of the best, closest, and most comfortable shaves of my life.  </li>
            <li> The good: Self cleaning, smart-charging system, comfy shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> It never did a good shaving job.</li>
            <li> What a wise choice.  </li>
            <li> I FIND IT GIVES ME JUST A GOOD A SHAVE AS A RAZOR.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A REALLY GOOD DEAL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> the foils are still in good condition and do not need to be replaced for quite awhile yet.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this purchase, and I have recommended the Braun 7680 Syncro, without qualification, to my friends.</li>
            <li> The pivot mode provides good flexible motion, the locked mode provides good control, and the extended long-hair trimmer mode performs as expected.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> &gt;I decided to turn from the Mach 3,even as good as that shaver was</li>
            <li> The shave I get from my Braun is as good as the MACH 3</li>
            <li> Shaves are close and I even shave during the weekend and not just on Sunday night,makes for a good Monday mornin.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> maybe Braun was not that good after all...</li>
            <li> So, when you leave town for a week, you just put the shaver &amp;amp; the cord in the pouch, toss it in the Ditty Bag, &amp;amp;your good to go.  </li>
            <li> All around a good system.</li>
            <li> Trust the Germans to come up with something this good.</li>
            <li> This gozmo is as good as any Ive tried.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is that the razor has a 2 year warranty.  </li>
            <li> It seems like a good idea in theory</li>
            <li> After it has run through its cleaning process, it&#x27;s so clean, it&#x27;s incredible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many many electric shavers over the years and this Braun shaves as good as the best of them.  </li>
            <li> I love how close this razor gets and how the cleaning system does a great job.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system also works great but is pricey (about $60/year for the cleaning cartridges), so it&#x27;s much more over time than the cost of the shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, as a summary:  Great shave, even better if you&#x27;re used to electrics.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had the razor for 16 months, and I&#x27;m still very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in many years but this one is great.</li>
            <li> Buy it,Use it, and you&#x27;ll Love it!</li>
            <li> Five stars, for sure!</li>
            <li> The 7680 refurbished arrived in good as new condition and has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> what I like best about my 7680 is that I don&#x27;t go more than a day without shaving anymore, sometimes I even shave in the morning and touch it up in the evening just because it is so quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The amazing thing about this type of Braun shaver is the charging and cleaning stand...</li>
            <li> This shaver in particualr is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the razor seemed to get warm on my face</li>
            <li> The value is good, and in many respects it is an investment.</li>
            <li> Has a nice screen indicating battery life.</li>
            <li> It gets nice and close and wont knick your skin like a rotary blade.</li>
            <li> Braun has made some really nice improvements at this point.  </li>
            <li> The shaver foils get rather warm if you use the shaver for over about 1.5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The shaver foils get rather warm if you use the shaver for over about 1.5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Being a gadget kind of guy I had to have the display, so I purchased the 7680.  </li>
            <li> (To see if it was as good as most of the reviews say).  </li>
            <li> There are replacement foils, but its kind of a pain to send away for it</li>
            <li> This is a nice shaver.  </li>
            <li> you want, and comes with this trendy charger set.&lt;BR&gt;  </li>
            <li> I found myself spending more time shaving in the morning and not getting a good shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice not to have to take the shaver apart and brush out the whiskers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately though, using a blade here is not painful for me and the blade is very effective, getting all the hairs in 1-2 swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to do,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to use, no brain is needed to manage the system; plus if somehow you can&#x27;t figure something out, it has a manual.</li>
            <li> VERY, VERY easy on your skin.  </li>
            <li> the very first shave its been GREAT..</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job, but no electric is as good as a blade</li>
            <li> It also cleans itself and maintains a strong battery charge!  </li>
            <li> I have used many electric shavers but the Braun system is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The most incredible thing is that it really does give you a shave as close as the blade.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how a $250 could be better.  </li>
            <li> The unit is much better constructed and sturdier than all the Norelco&#x27;s I ever owned.  </li>
            <li> AND YOU GET MORE</li>
            <li> and I get a better shave than with the blade.  </li>
            <li> Braun works much better than the rotary shavers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been a satisfied customer for 7 years).</li>
            <li> With the requirements for myself  mentioned at the start of this  review, I have been  more than satisfied with this  product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s his favorite raiser.</li>
            <li> The latest models were running over $200.00.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I would appreciate any assistance you may be able to give me on this problem.  </li>
            <li> While I do seem to make more passes over my face than with the Remington, the shave is closer.</li>
            <li> I was able to take a week vacation without taking the cleaner stand along.</li>
            <li> I love the way this shaver shaves.  </li>
            <li> I have had many electric shavers in imy life.  </li>
            <li> Lectric\\&quot; pre shave helps minimize any irritation and gives an even better shave.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> well if you allow your beard to grow for more than 48-72 hours.  </li>
            <li> I sure am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Let me tell you the shaver is better than advertisted.  </li>
            <li> How much more do you want?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a better improvement than Norelco, but, shavers still have a ways to catch up to the razor.</li>
            <li> It also seemed to irritate my face more than the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am soooo pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I gotta say this is the coolest shaver, AND you get the best &amp;amp; most comfortable shave from this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Better than a rotary shaver, but I always wondered if there was a better shaver out there...</li>
            <li> it feels more like rubbing a glass all over your face.  </li>
            <li> the braun series 3 was ok</li>
            <li> Will you be able to shave once a day instead of twice?&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> I bought this razor years ago and used it for many years without any issues.</li>
            <li> I thought the Norelco did okay</li>
            <li> The trimmer works much better than any of the Norelcos I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it has a great battery life and is packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not about to spend any more money on this thing.</li>
            <li> but I think that a static head is just as good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No need to keep up with the latest technology when electric shavers hit their peak years ago anyway.</li>
            <li> On a dollar  for dollar  value, that kind of high useage  is quite good.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is actually incredibly effective, and leaves the razor perfectly clean and lubricated.</li>
            <li> I am very clean cut</li>
            <li> Wonderful, is a single word that I could able to think about this Braun 7680 Syncro System Logic Saver.</li>
            <li> Though this is just a minor inconvience, as it cleans the shaver perfectly</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is great and offers an excellent shave without the hassle of blowing out clippings or such.  </li>
            <li> I would wholeheartedly recommend this razor if your skin has become irritated through the foam and razor technique, and if you want a nice, quick shave in the morning.</li>
            <li> It cleans better - way better, than I can clean it by hand and it is sanitary.  </li>
            <li> The self-cleaning mechanism is very cool, though I&#x27;ll have to buy refills for it once a month or so . . .</li>
            <li> Replacement parts are still available in many places.  </li>
            <li> Great for and electric razor, but does not eliminate all the razor burn if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> old proud father of 1.&lt;br /&gt;Changed for Life</li>
            <li> This razor... if it were any more advanced, it would have to extend four spider-like limbs, crawl across the floor, climb into bed, and shave me while I sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaning is also remarkable, it removes all of the hair like it&#x27;s brand new</li>
            <li> Buy this shaver, true Shaving Nirvana!  </li>
            <li> The cleaning feature is outstanding for a clean shave each and every time.  </li>
            <li> That was until I recently had a friend marvel at how great the Braun 7680 was; I listened mostly out of amazement, because he sports a mustache too.  </li>
            <li> The 7680 handles it easily, even if I skip a day on the weekend.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you have a growth of a few days, it is best to start of with a  light setting, or just basically learn the way your  beard goes, the directions of the hair, and use the shaver in an appropriate manner.</li>
            <li> This is a first of a kind technology introduced by Braun into the 7680.</li>
            <li> It recharges and cleans fast, however, the refill cartridges can run into a good hunk of change if you clean the razor everytime</li>
            <li> easy to maintain, easy to use, shaves smooth.</li>
            <li> To clean the long-hair blades you need to bust out the cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a superior shaver for the money Braun wants for it.  </li>
            <li> To clean the long-hair blades you need to bust out the cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a superior shaver for the money Braun wants for it.  </li>
            <li> When I bought the new Braun 7680 Shaver about three years ago, the manual says that the rechargable battery would be good for three to five years.</li>
            <li> Otherwise both units are (were) fine products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this unit for more then a year and paid top dollar for its features when it was first released.  </li>
            <li> Some people can  shave  fine  with a blade, some can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Easy clean, easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Foils work the best hands down!</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is huge help in our bathroom since the shaver seems to \\&quot;catch\\&quot;</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BE CHEAP BREAK BREAD</li>
            <li> Overall Great Razor and</li>
            <li> The Braun 7680 Syncro razor is really fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, Braun&#x27;s repair facility in San Francisco replaced it.  </li>
            <li> No burning, close shave, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I can genuinely tell you, he wasn&#x27;t kidding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fit and finish of everything is of the highest caliber.  </li>
            <li> It is so smooth and cuts so well</li>
            <li> It cuts fully smooth in 2 strokes.... and (yes, I timed it)  </li>
            <li> Who worries about that money, when you get hassle free mornings</li>
            <li> I called the toll free service number and found a service place in my area.  </li>
            <li> They have the potential for a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought the refurbished version and saved a ton of money, and it has worked perfectly for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this thing is TOP NOTCH!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a fabulous shaver WELL worth the Money.</li>
            <li> Braun really come top of the pile when it comes to shavers - much better than philishave.</li>
            <li> As past reviewers correctly state, you do have to somewhat stretch your neck skin to get the absolute best shave.&lt;br /&gt;The joy of this shaver comes from NOT having three heads setup in a triangle, which really kills close touch ups.  </li>
            <li> I now know if I have shaved the area clean from that sound.  </li>
            <li> This review was originally written about the Syncro 7526 shaver,</li>
            <li> It does not come with the cleaning station it was originally packaged with.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> So all was well, until it broke again a couple of days ago, 2 months after the original repair.  </li>
            <li> The self cleaning is a great feature, it cleans the razor so much better than you could ever dream of doing with little brushes.</li>
            <li> I clean the shaver before every shave, so I don&#x27;t need all that hardware that came with the original shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have a very tuff beard and nothing really gives me a good shave.</li>
            <li> I clean mine</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It cuts supper close, super smooth and</li>
            <li> but the Braun trims it cleanly.  </li>
            <li> And, without the gizmo/toy/$ to clean it.  </li>
            <li> What happens is the arm on the clean and charge unit stops locking on to the razor.  </li>
            <li> The spring latch breaks and will not allow you to charge or clean the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Fifteen minutes later, the shaver is clean and good as new, with a nice scent added to boot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Im not one for highly consumable items (like the Cleaning cartridge in this thing), but man, it really is so nice to have a clean, fresh shaver</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;NO MORE BRAUN at these terribly high prices for cheap engineering.</li>
            <li> I just had to paint this review, BRIGHT BLUE.</li>
            <li> Cool design, lightweight, sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Cool design.</li>
            <li> They are ALL TRUE.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if this is true or just a staged event.  </li>
            <li> I have shaved with a blade for many years and about four years ago it began to really irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> but they tend to irritate more than even the blades which defeats the whole purpose.  </li>
            <li> While it is true</li>
            <li> While it is true</li>
            <li> This is true,</li>
            <li> that actually put some thought into scientifically explaining it; I had the good fortune to have a college room mate that paid his dues with a Norelco and he coached me well in this.  </li>
            <li> Cool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shave&#x27;s no worse than I get with anything else, but I was hoping for something significantly better.  </li>
            <li> When the shaver cuts any hair there is a distinct buzz to the sound.  </li>
            <li> If a simple good shave is what you want, this is for you.</li>
            <li> It really cuts close and better than my Gillette razor.    </li>
            <li> For under $70, this is not a bad price for a shaver of this design with LCD display and side pulsing technology.  </li>
            <li> The people in the store were very helpful and very familiar with this issue.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews do a great job describing how well it shaves, so I won&#x27;t repeat them.</li>
            <li> Under optimal shaving conditions this shaver provides a quick, clean, and smooth shave, exactly what it is supposed to do.ype of a swirling pattern.  </li>
            <li> Under optimal shaving conditions this shaver provides a quick, clean, and smooth shave, exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I would have to say the shave is about the same as the 5 year old 5000 series \\&quot;syncro\\&quot; Braun it replaced, which is very good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been able to cut the hair on my face with electric razors, but never been able to cut the hair on my neck, and I&#x27;ve tried several.  </li>
            <li> And If I have a date or something when I need a close shave just a quick skim with my Braun and then break out the Mach 3 Turbo</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get a decent shave from a disposable, or a so called  \\&quot;Blade\\&quot;  shaver , without looking like</li>
            <li> so I follow up quickly with a blade.  </li>
            <li> The Braun 7680 Syncro System Logic Shaver is a worthy 5 star item.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to clean and with top notch replacement parts, will last for years and years.  </li>
            <li> I have the previous model 7570 which gives a great shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned numerous electric shavers, and have consistently found Braun models to be superior for my needs.  </li>
            <li> You really have to stretch the skin to get the razor to shave such hairs--even then, it&#x27;s not always successful.</li>
            <li> It could simply be a style preference, and since performance was pretty good, I can&#x27;t knock it.</li>
            <li> Amazon has 2 refills for $10 right now which is pretty cheap compared to remingtons.</li>
            <li> (Note that my sensitive skin was not affected by any of the cleaning solution, which is mostly alcohol and evaporates quickly).  </li>
            <li> * clean the long-hair portion of the shaver, which is slightly higher than the foils when it is in the cleaner-case.  </li>
            <li> * clean the long-hair portion of the shaver, which is slightly higher than the foils when it is in the cleaner-case.  </li>
            <li> Rotary is great sometimes, but I&#x27;ve found a few problems.</li>
            <li> Being straight, you can get comfortably close to mustaches, goatees, etc.  </li>
            <li> Huge, very noticeable recharging stand.  </li>
            <li> Do you really need your face as smooth as a babys bottom?</li>
            <li> I was going to buy another Norelco until this Braun caught my attention as its self-cleaning ability was attractive; I found the cleaning of the Norelco messy.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use a blade because my neck is so sensitive, so since my dad used a Remington electric razor, I did too.  </li>
            <li> well worth it.</li>
            <li> You can also buy from the braun site directly and get it cheap to!)</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest not wasting your money on this older technology.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the cash.  </li>
            <li> (the panasonic was as fast and close but the replacement heads weren&#x27;t as durable and cost about 50% more than the braun)  easy to clean and relatively quiet for a foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> definitely worth owning ...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a matter of whether or not you feel the refill is worth the time you would spend cleaning it every time you&#x27;d use it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the 150$.</li>
            <li> and it is powerful shaver.</li>
            <li> First, there are already a few very good positive reviews that I agree with.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electrics for 25 plus years, now, and I&#x27;ve been more satisfied with this Braun than any other.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Yeah right.  </li>
            <li> The price was right and that is my story.</li>
            <li> it really does charge or clean or do both.</li>
            <li> Shaver is always clean and ready for use.</li>
            <li> Most likely I will find a way to &amp;quot;re-fill&amp;quot; the cartridge to extend its life, but even at $4.50 a month for replacements (Super Wallmart - $8.49 for a box with 2) ist worth it!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I have used the Braun electric razor and find that it does clean the blades very well.  </li>
            <li> Cool design (love the blue light), great feel, not too heavy, not too light, solidly built (dropped it once,</li>
            <li> No the blue is for the actual blue light that blinks and smiles at me letting me know its time for another great shave!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure) &amp;amp; the ever-present, light machine oil odor the cleaning solution imparts to the bathroom in general and to the razor in particular.</li>
            <li> ya, sure another expense, but a very small price to pay for a phenomenal shave!</li>
            <li> And , if you take a tad bit longer &amp;amp; really go for the super smmmooooth shave,  </li>
            <li> it takes about 3:00, or, if your in a rush, yuo can grab a good shave in less than 1 min, even with two days growth.  </li>
            <li> You can manually brush it out like most other electrics and that works fine.  </li>
            <li> No mess and easy to set up.  </li>
            <li> The locking mechanism on top of the cleaning station breaks easily; specifically, it ceases to stay in the locked (down) position which activates the cleaning function and keeps the shaver charged.</li>
            <li> it shaves faster, closer and more comfortably than any of the other razors i&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The switch of the first unit stucked at</li>
            <li> First, I shave before I shower.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all that many electrics, but this is definitely the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten with one.</li>
            <li> but you can get pretty close by streaching your skin around.</li>
            <li> i had to restrain from writing this review the first day i got my 7680</li>
            <li> I first started using it</li>
            <li> This happened IMMEDIATELY when I tried to charge the shaver for the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had irritation or burn no matter how many times I have to go over the same spot and</li>
            <li> I go over spots where I might have missed during my last shave without being able to cut them.</li>
            <li> but you can set it to lock in place for a more controlled shave if necessary.</li>
            <li> First of all, the cartridges come 2 to a pack and are discounted online.</li>
            <li> Make sure you&#x27;re close to a Braun authorized repair facility, since shipping it back is a hassle.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> I have been shaving with traditional blades for many years with a combination of a Norelco beard &amp;amp;</li>
            <li> I am critical in most reviews but when I have a product that performs as well as my Braun 7680</li>
            <li> But first let me say this, I have had electic razors before and always went with Norelco.</li>
            <li> at first I thought that I wasn&#x27;t going to like it, but since it was a Father&#x27;s Day gift, I was somewhat obligated to use it for a while.</li>
            <li> Most shaver manufacturers say that I need to use it for several weeks and that will go away.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t EVER judge ANY electric by the first two weeks; and DON&#x27;T get tempted to use a razor to touch up</li>
            <li> I first purchased a Remington 9500, and returned it after about 5 shaves.  </li>
            <li> it was the best, however, my cleaning/ recharging unit no longer works, and needless to say this puts me in a bind.</li>
            <li> I was doing on the first time out)I am truly converted.  </li>
            <li> Kudo&#x27;s to Braun for finally breaking the mold and figuring out how to make an outstanding razor.  </li>
            <li> But after a couple of weeks, the razor was shaving very closely, it was not irritating my skin, and it only took about 4 minutes to get a nice shave.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I really miss it!  </li>
            <li> but if you are looking to save a few bucks the lower priced units without the LCD would probably be a good choice.    </li>
            <li> My comments about shaving above still  apply, and if some of the  critics  took these  into accounts, maybe they  could  get more than adequate  use out of this high quality shaver.</li>
            <li> The razor does a pretty good job... there are still a few spots along my jaw line that only a non-electric hits easily.  </li>
            <li> No shaver is perfect and does not shave properly the first swipe over your face, but this one seems to cut fairly cleanly and takes only a few brushes against my cheeks.</li>
            <li> it conditions your battery to get the best life out of it, learning your shaving behavior and discharging when you&#x27;re least likely to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously as good as shaving with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station not only cool looking but extremely functional.  </li>
            <li> Changing over has been a positive experience.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s pretty much all I found that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was very thorough with my first shave with it.  </li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I don&#x27;t clean the shaver every day, more like every few shaves.  </li>
            <li> The good thing about this is that when I do use the blade afterwards, it&#x27;s painless because I&#x27;m shaving very few hairs at a time.</li>
            <li> Even from 45 minutes to 10 minutes the time saved is worth the price alone not even counting the cost of new blades.</li>
            <li> To me even if I have to but a new screen and blade plus 20 cleaning refills in a year it is still worth the price.</li>
            <li> Then I go back and cleanup with a blade, rather easily and painlessly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 7680 is the top of the line dry shaver from Braun.</li>
            <li> I thought my last Braun was unbeatable, but the 7680 beats it easily.</li>
            <li> , I am rather certain it is just me, and that cannot be helped.  </li>
            <li> , I am rather certain it is just me, and that cannot be helped.  </li>
            <li> Mainly because I liked my other one a lot.  </li>
            <li> Quite clever!</li>
            <li> The unit has more than adequate battery power to last the entire week</li>
            <li> A simple trimmer, such as Norelco&#x27;s superb little mustache/beard trimmer, just make life so much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> About the only 2 things I don&#x27;t care for are the very bright blue light on the base which is even a bit too bright as a bathroom nightlight</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and without any problem.  </li>
            <li> I was very intrigued by the self-cleaning razors, so I started my online investigations.  </li>
            <li> I have a fast beard growth and I have noticed that my face stays smoother longer</li>
            <li> BUT, if you plan on buying any of the braun syncro shavers be VERY careful(on</li>
            <li> Being that I&#x27;m cheap, I&#x27;m not using the cleaning solution on a regular basis, but will periodically use it, then close the container each time so it doesn&#x27;t evaporate.  </li>
            <li> It still shaves, but it makes so much noise that I cannot use it while my wife is still asleep in the bedroom for fear of waking her up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very close shave.  </li>
            <li> Have used Braun shavers for some time and have been very satisified with all.  </li>
            <li> The shave is also much closer and confortable.  </li>
            <li> Buying a Shaver really is a very \\&quot;personal\\&quot; decision.</li>
            <li> And if available, I may do this the next time as well.</li>
            <li> all you have to do is put it in and hit a button, that&#x27;s really it.</li>
            <li> It is very close to blade shaving and</li>
            <li> much easier.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> It turns out to be much better than expected.</li>
            <li> I had to switch to an electric because I have sensetive skin and the blade was irritiating my skin too much.  </li>
            <li> and I am ready to make my review.  </li>
            <li> Please dont confuse blue with the Kmart &amp;quot;Blue Light Special&amp;quot;.</li>
            <li> Never having used an electric razor befor, because I had always heard how they do not provide very close shave, and that they tend to pull hairs, I was reluctant to accept the Braun 7680 as a Fathers Day gift.</li>
            <li> Plus Amazon sent me a free travel shave case at no extra cost.  </li>
            <li> The shipment was lighting fast as well.</li>
            <li> , I simply cannot emphasize how important it is to TAKE TIME and let your beard/skin get accustomed to using the electric.  </li>
            <li> Oh yes, one last thing that&#x27;s important:  the cleaning solution tanks.  </li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews - thanks to all who posted them, they were very helpfull - and decided on the Braun 7680...</li>
            <li> 5310 too 4:20 - 5:30, and my neck was irritatede&amp;amp; I had to really work some spots.  </li>
            <li> its really a &amp;quot;Shave &amp;amp</li>
            <li> ; Go&amp;quot; system that self cleans... it really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li> Compared with Norelco rotary shaver, this one is clearly much noiser.</li>
            <li> Perhaps these folks will find a way to Mach 3 in the car!&lt;br /&gt;     If your beard really can not be cut by a machine, your not even shopping for one and you will never see this review.</li>
            <li> This is a quality shaver - it is very well made, you can tell by the feel of it in your hand.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t checked out how much those will cost yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Philips since and much prefer the Philips.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t irritate as much for others.</li>
            <li> The blue light indicator for charging or cleaning is aesthetically pleasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The newer one is easier to use and charge; it uses the cleaner fluid more economically and seems to be built to last.</li>
            <li> The Braun shaved very well also, but the Panasonic was somewhat closer.  </li>
            <li> I was very dissappointed and have returned it to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I had never tried a Braun and was concerned whether it would be at least as good as the Norelco brand.  </li>
            <li> the razor itself, a very nice leather carrying case, a cleaning brush, the instructions, a hard clear plastic foil protector,a charging/cleaning stand and a bottle of the cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> The only way this will ever cut you is if the foil is damaged, and that is very rare ( I have found).  </li>
            <li> Whats best about this product compared to the other braun shavers is not only the cleaner that comes with it but its ability to shave closer then any other braun has before.</li>
            <li> with the totally  excellent  cleaner, I can definitively say that this Braun does a great job, cutting through tough beard hair, as well as treating sensitive skin very well.  </li>
            <li> (mainly because the shave is that much closer than the Remington delivers).  </li>
            <li> Second, I clean the razor after every shave.  </li>
            <li> I have the older version of this shaver (now has an LCD display) and the shaver has worked very well.  </li>
            <li> It has a special horizontal shaver in between the 2 standard cylinders that helps shave tuff to reach spots like your chin and jaw bone area.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get \\&quot;excited\\&quot; about such mundane items, but for me, this is one good shaver.</li>
            <li> Well, I first shave with an old norelco 985rx under the chin, then I finish with the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Foil</li>
            <li> This effectively doubles the lifespan of the cartridges, if not more.</li>
            <li> you have read in the reviews below especially the PRO&#x27;s is absolutely true.  </li>
            <li> Just put it in the cleaning station push the top down</li>
            <li> Braun 7680 is a very &#x27;Teutonic&#x27; looking piece of equipment; very high tech, but classy, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> So in order to get a decent shave I end up having to feel for each grain and try to arc the shave out from the epicenter in a sort-of counter swirl.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> So in order to get a decent shave I end up having to feel for each grain and try to arc the shave out from the epicenter in a sort-of counter swirl.&lt;BR&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> I have owned norelco and another older Braun model.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t get a decent shave with anything</li>
            <li> I thought this was the coolest shaver ever when I saw the sleek and sexy commercial back when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> The reviewers were VERY helpful to point out that this was no ordinary electric razor.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for the Braun 7680 Syncro, I decided to give it a try, despite the high cost.</li>
            <li> I think you will find the cost a fraction of using high end blades and shaving foams/gels.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver on anyone&#x27;s wish list.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Braun Syncro 7680 shaving system.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to have a high tech &#x27;rocket launcher&#x27;</li>
            <li> More accurately, once that cutting sound is gone, I know I have a very close shave that will last the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning system</li>
            <li> With my old 6520 it would always miss hairs on certain parts of my neck.  </li>
            <li> and I find that I only need to clean it every 3-4 days; not everyday as the company says to.</li>
            <li> Definitely well worth it.</li>
            <li> but this is worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> The Braun 7680 is pricey but after about a month of usage I have found that the price is worth it for several reasons: &lt;</li>
            <li> expectations were way high when I got the new Braun 7680.  </li>
            <li> every other shave and my cartridge worked fine for 2 1/2 months.</li>
            <li> In deciding to purchase a replacement unit I considered the new Norelco \\&quot;James Bond\\&quot; model as well as the Braun 7680.  </li>
            <li> Braun has a new lifetime customer in me.  </li>
            <li> all say you need to give your beard about 20 days to adjust to the new system and I&#x27;ll give them all a fare chance).</li>
            <li> Therefore, I was weary about purchasing a new electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It is a shame since when new this razor worked quite well.  </li>
            <li> In my case I had to buy a new set of razor heads per week almost $10.</li>
            <li> Of course now I want to know if the battery is new for the refurbished device.</li>
            <li> I will not buy it if the battery is not replaced with a new one.</li>
            <li> It is like getting a new shaver with each use.</li>
            <li> My friend mentioned to me that he never had any problems with this new shaver.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Braun, which amiably sent me a new one with cutters.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re new to an electric</li>
            <li> , it was time for a new foil - or - a new razer.  </li>
            <li> Do I buy a new unit or do I ask for a new one but   </li>
            <li> I was new to electric razors when I bought this.</li>
            <li> This is particularly disappointing, because I expect more durability and better designs from the Germans.</li>
            <li> however, the cleaning solution is only good for about a month (assuming you shave at least every weekday) and the refills become rather costly.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Due to my very sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t use a regular razor more than one or two days in a row.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through two units in two years, both failing in exactly the same fashion.</li>
            <li> This one is a lot more quiet than my other one.  </li>
            <li> They shaved well enough but 4 months into use with my first</li>
            <li> Here also because the Braun is a straight edge with its foil system, its easier to cut in the sideburns area versus the rotary, which if one is not careful could leave a circular cut on the sides.&lt;BR&gt;4.</li>
            <li> They fixed it while I waited at no charge!  </li>
            <li> The Syncro system would appear to offer not only a clean shave, but also the ultimate convenience of a self-cleaning function.</li>
            <li> Not having to open it and brush it clean constantly is a definate plus!  </li>
            <li> first, you plug the power cord into the razor and start a 4 hour charging procedure; Braun cautions you to NOT start using the cleaning stand for the initial charge (stating that the &#x27;Smart Logic&#x27; built into the razor needs this first, necessary charge in such a manner).  </li>
            <li> The shaver does have definite difficulty with long, flat-lying hairs, perhaps even more so than other electrics, which is its only remotely significant problem in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Once the hairs get past a certain length, the shaver proves very ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I managed to work around this by removing the spring inside the neck, but this fix only lasted 5 more recharging sessions until it once again refuse to click all the way down into position.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be that as it may, I recently switched to the new generation of self-cleaning Brauns and I am absolutely thrilled!&lt;BR</li>
            <li> Currently, the razor foil is more or less kaput, so I ordered a replacement head ...).  </li>
            <li> i had the norelco advantage which was &#x27;ok&#x27; but old and starting to wear down..</li>
            <li> When used correctly, which means learning your particular face patterns, there is little argument that the Braun will shave closer than any rotary, as a foil can be made much thinner than a rotary &amp;quot;cage.&amp;quot; In fact, the very closeness of the shave is why some people are complaining about ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> When that razor crashed and burned, big time, I got smart and researched electric razors eventually settling on the Braun 7680.</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun 7680 refurbished even after being a little bit concerned with the number of refurbished units available.  </li>
            <li> This razor is quiet and gives a real close shave.</li>
            <li> the old one clean&lt;BR&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I had to replace the foil once or twice on my old braun shavers over those 6 years.  </li>
            <li> It just catches they very tips of the hairs occasionally.</li>
            <li> it started to get really loud and not shave well at all.  </li>
            <li> well, the price of the Mach 3 replacement blades will accumulate over the years, and they are a bit pricey, you only have to change the the blade on the Braun 7680 Syncro every 18 months, so it really pays for it self.</li>
            <li> Next a drying cycle occurs, where a gently blowing fan assists in helping evaporate the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Nearly all of the claims Braun makes about this product are true:&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 7680 has changed that completely.</li>
            <li> The tri-head Norelco just couldn&#x27;t &#x27;touch up&#x27; near the &#x27;stache,</li>
            <li> As far as performance...</li>
            <li> This razor replaced my 5+ year old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> the difference between my old 6520 and the 7680 would be so monumental.  </li>
            <li> Having to replace the cartridges all the time is a complete gimmick too.</li>
            <li> I like that you can charge the shaver and then don&#x27;t have to use the cable until the battery is completely depleted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But these things are meaningless without a good shave -</li>
            <li> They need to be taken care, and they  will give a good  service; if you use it  carelessly, then it will break.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews, and, unlike some reviewers, I&#x27;ve noticed no quality issues; everything has performed as I would&#x27;ve expected a nicely engineered German product to do.  </li>
            <li> First off, it is really 98% as close as a Mach 3 without the mess of shaving cream or nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> The cleaning cartridges are only 5$ each and last a month if you clean daily.  </li>
            <li> Because of how much shaving I do daily it is a major plus to have the self cleaning feature.</li>
            <li> It irritated my skin a bit, but friends told me that was normal when switching from a traditional blade.</li>
            <li> Change to a new cartridge only when the stubble level exceeds a desireable collected amount.</li>
            <li> Braun came out with a next generation series after this one (New version has irregular pattern on screen.).</li>
            <li> , well worth the extra money spent.  </li>
            <li> I had this shaver for only a few weeks and the charging stand/cleaner stopped working and engaging the shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides, this is the older 7000 series model, several generations behind the latest Braun shaver model.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband who has very sensitive skin and shaving with a normal razor caused razor burn every time he shaved no matter how careful he was.  </li>
            <li> Like so many other people on this board my cleaning unit broke after a few months.</li>
            <li> - I never find the sink full of little hairs anymore!  </li>
            <li> I thought that the 7000 series would be outstanding but this particular model failed the test.  </li>
            <li> I have had Norelco, Remington, and Braun shavers in the past and have never really been satisfied with any of them.  </li>
            <li> My Braun 7680 suddenly began making a loud noise after about six months.  </li>
            <li> I can testify to that basically  because my  beard hair is very coarse, but my skin is extremely  sensitive.</li>
            <li> Shaving time to do all my shaving with that regular razor was nearly 45 minutes per day.</li>
            <li> The complete shaving head pivots front to back</li>
            <li> The shave is very close (I would say 98% as close as a Mach 3 blade shave) with minimal irritation and razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Also if you have sensitive skin, the shaver will be sanitized to reduce irritation next time you use it.</li>
            <li> My beard is not heavy, but it is coarse.  </li>
            <li> only drawback so far is the position of the power button on the shaver.  </li>
            <li> The shaver has three settings, one for fixed head, one for swivel head and the third to activate the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It is not cheap, but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> extendable feature is powerful and I have used it to shave my legs a few times and my armpits.</li>
            <li> First the tab won&#x27;t stay down</li>
            <li> I sent it in for a replacement and now the new one is doing the same thing after only a couple months use.  </li>
            <li> I still waited about every other day to shave but the shave was much closer and even with the knicks, Mach 3, was a definate upgrade from the Norelco.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the other reviewers for taking the time to give feedback for a skeptic like me.  </li>
            <li> The little computer glitch is only a slight mar on an otherwise outstanding product.</li>
            <li> The button is loose enough and located in such a position that it is a little too easy to change inadvertently the settings from 1 to 2.  </li>
            <li> The setting for the trimmer is far enough on the setting that an accidental activation of the trimmer is not likely though.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> that is where this little beauty really shines!  </li>
            <li> the CLEAN and CHARGE center broke after only a couple of months, wont stay down which from what i&#x27;ve read is a known problem, there are even repair centers for it.  </li>
            <li> thought about purchasing the Braun 7526, which is apparently the same shaver without the LED display, and about 50 dollars cheaper.  </li>
            <li> my old braun 7505 finally died and i tried a couple others (including the braun series 3) that i took back and got my money back on and went ahead and purchased another braun syncro.  </li>
            <li> the Braun - well built and close shave, but one star off for the decorative/size aspect, second star off for the addtional maintenance cost and noise (which apparently increases with time).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every shaver (and I mean every) has always left me with that nice little burn under my neck.  </li>
            <li> Finally, after merely 5-weeks of usage, the original screen acquired a large hole.</li>
            <li> I decided to switch to the Braun mainly because of the online reviews of other customers.  </li>
            <li> With this shaver, it takes him less time to shave and it is much gentler on his face.  </li>
            <li> The stand for the cleaning system takes up a bit of space though and looks like a rocket launcher but it achieved my desire of not having to clean out all that hair mess every week or so from the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The LCD screen is functional but I especially like the feature about how long the last shave was, it is reassuring to see when the amount of time I used to shave was not too long.  </li>
            <li> The only other negative is that the ergonomics of the device could be much better, especially relative to Norelco products.</li>
            <li> I started a new habit, bringing it up to be cleaned in its stand with that lemon solution, perhaps my facial skin will benefit, maybe even keep the razor sharp longer?</li>
            <li> this shaver does is cut down most of the hairs without it being as painful as using a blade, but I end up having to use a blade to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> However, like all  high use items, there is a point where it will  break down, and</li>
            <li> You need to shave everyday, because if you let your facial hair grow out a little bit, it is much more difficult to obtain a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned, the unit is brand new without the usual fancy packaging.  </li>
            <li> The display provides the necessary basic information you&#x27;d need, like how long of shave was the last, replacement part number, battery life status, charging and cleaning status.</li>
            <li> Overall, I wish everything was slightly lighter and smaller, but this is so far the closest shaver I&#x27;ve purchased in my lifetime.lled shave if necessary.</li>
            <li> and did not leave my very sensative throat bleeding and raw..</li>
            <li> , you WILL notice it; it&#x27;s about 3 times bigger than the shaver (and gleaming, high tech BLACK) and unless you have a power socket UNDER your bathroom cabinet, it&#x27;s gotta go somewhere!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I wish everything was slightly lighter and smaller, but this is so far the closest shaver I&#x27;ve purchased in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a small display that gives you cues as to when to oil the coil and how much charge is left in the shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a minor point and in my opinion the benefits far outweight the minimal cost...</li>
            <li> &quot; position for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li> Braun recommends this because apparently the skin swells when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> If used to long the shaver can overheat to the point of a possible burn&lt;br</li>
            <li> no apparent harm</li>
            <li> I stumble into the bathroom in the morning, pick it up, rub it on my face, slap it back into its cradle, and wander off.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll be sticking with this one as long as possible.</li>
            <li> Seems like it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the handy base not only contains the cleaning solution and performs the lubrication, it also handles battery maintenance by monitoring your usage pattern and adjusting the charging schedule accordingly, including periodic and fully automatic complete battery discharge &amp;amp; recharge, which will result in longer battery life and longer cordless cycles.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> The only question I have is why I waited so long to change!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a fairly expensive razor, I expected more from it.</li>
            <li> A typical shave with the Old Braun</li>
            <li> whether that dampness is from natural sweat, or from moisture in the air from a recent shower, it causes the shave you get to be rather uneven at best.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> If you push the button while even just barely holding it down, the spring will break inside the machine and there is no way to open it up to fix it.  </li>
            <li> For the record, I&#x27;ve previously owned a Ronson, a Remington, 2 Norelco&#x27;s and one other older model Braun.</li>
            <li> While the shaver itself is a good product, my clean and charge base failed shortly after my purchase.  </li>
            <li> but this sucker really works.  </li>
            <li> When Used properly, this Braun provides a superlative  shave with minimal  fuss, and is a precision  instrument as one would expect  from Braun, and it delivers on all  promises.    </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time, they say 50 minutes, I haven&#x27;t tried to run the battery out yet, but I tried going a week without charging it and it ran fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have discarded my receipt long ago.</li>
            <li> , I will just have to see how long the battery lasts on this.  </li>
            <li> Worse yet, the battery was attached to a PC board and could not be replaced economically.</li>
            <li> The cleaning base is exceptionally cool, the LCD display is fun to look at &amp;amp; informative as well....  </li>
            <li> But my skin is very sensitive and I have a thick beard, so the regular razors were tearing my face to shreads every morning, so I decided to give electric another try.  </li>
            <li> The shaves are close and last longer than with the blade, the battery lasts significantly longer than did the Remington&#x27;s, and the foils last longer than the Remington&#x27;s and are less expensive.</li>
            <li> After 7 minutes, I have the closest shave I can get with no razor burn or dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My main complaint is the noise.  </li>
            <li> Telephone calls to Braun revealed that they have had a number of such failures, but they would not replace the defective base even within the warranty period; one could send it at one&#x27;s own expense to a repair facility.</li>
            <li> Every single time I tried an electric, I received razor burns and ingrown hairs as my reward....</li>
            <li> other major problem is as people here have reported, the neck of the recharging stand doesn&#x27;t remain clicked down into position to allow recharging.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, so I returned it and went back to Norelco ...</li>
            <li> This razor stays in the car not in a charging stand, until I get down to _ minutes of shave time left.</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this shaver to anyone that is tired of shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li> The NEW 7680 finished in 2:15 (and I was being slow about it),</li>
            <li> That cleaning system thingie looked weird at first, but I kept an open mind.  </li>
            <li> Shaving time with the electric razor is less too, around 3.5 mins for me.&lt;br /&gt;The only con to the razor is the cleaning part.  </li>
            <li> Normally one would be annoyed by this, but I found that it keeps me shaving on a regular basis, and I don&#x27;t look so scruffy anymore.  </li>
            <li> The shaver itself is quieter than the other models in Braun&#x27;s lineup only because the long hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t work until engaged and the synchro four directional head creates less resistance, counteracting increased noise.</li>
            <li> Albeit long on battery life, the razor has a difficult time snipping fine hairs (as opposed to stout and thick) as well as hairs along the middle to lower neck.</li>
            <li> Second, you need not clean the shaver each day.</li>
            <li> My neck will get bumpy and bleed, and my skin gets real dry.  </li>
            <li> The sound of the blades cutting through the beard lets you know you&#x27;re not done yet.  </li>
            <li> far as negative comments - I guess the cartriges for the charger could be cheaper...</li>
            <li> It did not give me the close shave I expected from Norelco.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> The cleaning cartriges last about a month with everyday use and are cheep...</li>
            <li> I used a Norelco one a few years back</li>
            <li> I expected it to replace using a blade to shave with, and it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The stand even has an indicator to tell you when your cleaning cartridge is almost empty.</li>
            <li> The only flaw we have found is that after a few months the shaver head gets minior holes in it that tear up his face when he shaves.</li>
            <li> After 1-month, I&#x27;d say that the Braun performs as expected.  </li>
            <li> I had just gotten a job and needed to shave everyday, but the traditional foam and razor shave was killing my skin.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m looking into another shaver because this one is definitely not worth the money I spent and is defective.</li>
            <li> When these batteries wear out, I will replace them with a set I&#x27;ve put in my other shaver and get about two weeks run on them.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the other blades this items steel frame razor guard is thinner and stronger than the others.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is an extremely well built-product that has lasted almost 4 years.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable comes to mind, initially.  </li>
            <li> The foil just broke on me the other day too.</li>
            <li> The self cleaning part: I was skeptical when I first bought it</li>
            <li> If you read other reviews you will read about the problems with the cleaning unit.  </li>
            <li> Read some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> but the time that I spent shaving is cut in half.</li>
            <li> the only thing this shaver did for me is to cut down some of the longer coarse facial hair around the cheeks, above the lip and around the chin, where a blade would be painful to use.</li>
            <li> However, there is some truth to the fact that it is a little harder to use than a rotary.</li>
            <li> Also, much of the criticisms  in these  reviews appear to be based on some people who use things  carelessly.</li>
            <li> last complaint I have is that it does not shave under the chin and neck AT ALL.</li>
            <li> though but with out the cleaning unit not nearly worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not warm enough to cause burning or even discomfort, but still rather warm.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not warm enough to cause burning or even discomfort, but still rather warm.&lt;BR&gt;5.  </li>
            <li> However, periodically it WILL leave a dark residue on the screen.</li>
            <li> It gets stuck as an average review.</li>
            <li> It lasted about 2 years, and then refused to stay down.  </li>
            <li> So I nervously laid down the $180 and bought it.  </li>
            <li> I have seen ads on TV showing a man with a growth of probably 5-7 days cutting right through with a 3000 series.</li>
            <li> Twenty-four hours after shaving, I have less beard than I did immediately after shaving with a model in the Braun 5000 series.</li>
            <li> I can do it in less then 5/10 minutes a day now.</li>
            <li> Invest a few extra $$ and at least get the 8000 series or the newest model.  </li>
            <li> I had been a Braun user years ago, but switched to a Norelco a few years ago because I felt the old Braun was too irritating.</li>
            <li> Therefore, don&#x27;t be agape if you notice black smudge marks on your face.</li>
            <li> My previous one, a 6550, traveled with me all over the US on business trips for almost 10 years.</li>
            <li> ALL ELECTRIC SHAVERS SEEM TO TAKE LONGER TO SHAVE THAN A RAZOR, HOWEVER MUCH LESS MESS.</li>
            <li> : Did lousy job shaving tough areas (neck), took a LONG time to shave normal areas, finally broke in less than a month out of the box!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to mess around brushing / washing out my shaver.</li>
            <li> It was poorly constructed and extremely difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> I get as close a shave as I can manage with a blade, and with a lot less trouble.  </li>
            <li> I bought one a little over two weeks ago</li>
            <li> factory serviced means little.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a little hesitant about the price, and think \\&quot;Maybe I should just stick with the Mach 3\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have now owned this shaver for a little over a month</li>
            <li> I have to give this little gem 5 out of 5.</li>
            <li> My wife adds this little bit of trivia to the review, as she HATES the recharging stand, forcing me to use the downstairs bathroom for storage, as she has a &#x27;theme&#x27; to our master bedroom.  </li>
            <li> The Norelcos did such a weak job that I always had to use a separate blade razor to trim sideburns when I used them.  </li>
            <li> But, to my surprise, it gets it as close as a razor, and of course with out the hassle, mess, ad trouble.</li>
            <li> have a very coarse beard, which is tough on electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I felt bad having spent so much money on it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> I had tried a few of the rotary shavers and none of them where what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> but it seems ot have subsided after a few weeks or so.  </li>
            <li> I found that keeping a few spare cartridges around is helpful, and to extend the life between cartridges I just replace the used solution with distilled alcohol which can be found inexpensively at any store.</li>
            <li> To add a bit of lubrication, I add a few drops of electric shave solution to it.</li>
            <li> The shaver also comes with a portable charging cord, so if you are travelling for a few days, you can pack it in the included case and take it with you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now a year later, and it&#x27;s broken again.  </li>
            <li> I listed a few negatives about it</li>
            <li> I listed a few negatives about it</li>
            <li> I tolerated the uneven shave of the Norelcos for awhile then switched to the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I wanted to shave everyday but never had the time to do it..</li>
            <li> I waited a month before writting this review because the instructions tell you that it takes a few weeks for your beard to get adjusted to the electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I changed the foil a few times.  </li>
            <li> It shaves close and comfortably, and the clean/charge base is excellant.</li>
            <li> then plug cord in said base.. select Clean and Re-charge.</li>
            <li> No more cleaning out my razor in the sink with that little brush.  </li>
            <li> $200 for a razor seemed crazy, $158 at Amazon still seemed high, but, when I got the thing, it felt like QUALITY.  </li>
            <li> because Braun has now come out with the new, similarly priced Activator line (that still has a cleaning base but doesn&#x27;t have the arm that breaks), THERE IS NO REASON TO BUY THIS SYNCRO SHAVER ANYMORE.  </li>
            <li> it was irritating my neck, was a rough shave &amp;amp; wans not comfortable, the battery lasted 5 min at best.&lt;br /&gt;Finally</li>
            <li> Norelco used to include a little pamphlet in with their shavers (years ago!)</li>
            <li> Very little irritation</li>
            <li> The purchase was made through Amazon and as usual no problems.</li>
            <li> No more messing up the sink in the morning.</li>
            <li> No more bleeding neck nicks and closer than a razor.  </li>
            <li> This one manages the battery charging which I believe will extend the life of the battery which is what failed on the last one.</li>
            <li> It is self cleaning (although you do incur the cost of purchasing the cleaning solution packets), but you don&#x27;t have to brush the hairs out, and an additional bonus is that shaved hairs seem to go INTO the foil, not fall away from it, which means your bathroom counter doesn&#x27;t turn into a small haired</li>
            <li> the manufacturer?&lt;br /&gt;It charged in almost four hours to the minute; the timer is unbelievable in this thing.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> no more opening it, cleaning itr, etc...</li>
            <li> No more razor burn or ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> only giving it 4 stars, because the cleaning solution is a tad expensive, and the razor has difficulty shaving on some parts of your neck.  </li>
            <li> Dead - period!  </li>
            <li> I know two days is not much, and that I am supposed to wait to two weeks for conclusions (what is the hair &#x60;brain&#x27; science behind this anyway?).  </li>
            <li> The lock down mechanism failed after about 6 months of use, and the Braun authorized repair center has had it for a month now waiting for replacement charger parts.  </li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve owned sevral previous Braun shavers, I&#x27;d hesitate to buy another from a firm that won&#x27;t stand fully behind its products.</li>
            <li> I was a Gillette Mach 3 razor user who hated to shave because of the irritating red rashes I would get after shaving due to my  sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> COMFORTABLE!!!&lt;br /&gt;The charging in the base is great, and, you get a pouch that holds the shaver &amp;amp; the power cord (that is also used for the chargibg base).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously been a Panasonic fan, favoring their wet/dry capability and single cutting head (which helps reach those difficult and smaller shaving spots).</li>
            <li> Braun refuses to fix the base under warranty this time, I will definitely not pay to get it fixed (since it&#x27;ll break in a year anyway) and will buy the new Activator, even though I hate to reward Braun for selling me a defective product.  </li>
            <li> Unless one is willing to accept frustration with the base, I would recommend against its purchase.  </li>
            <li> I never felt the Norelco shaved as closely, and maybe that&#x27;s why it was less irritating.</li>
            <li> , you hardly know its a razer...</li>
            <li> The complaints about dirty alcohol are not warranted, as alcohol is a disinfectant and all solid materials settle into traps at the bottom of the container (and aren&#x27;t pulled into the stream of reciprocating alcohol).</li>
            <li> the one negative review about replacing the foil...</li>
            <li> ago I owned a Norelco Triple header, but never liked the shave I got from it and switched to blades.  </li>
            <li> The chief complaint was the cost of the cleaning cartridges, since they are quoted at a cartridge per month.</li>
            <li> Some have complained about the cost of the cleaning cartridges.  </li>
            <li> this thing rates at least a 3. &lt;br</li>
            <li> I also called Braun customer service to register a complaint.</li>
            <li> No more brushing hairs and dulling the cutter block - now just pop the shaver in the pod, push a button, and voila!  </li>
            <li> Additionally, he has been using the razor every other day for about a year now and nothing has gone wrong and</li>
            <li> I am extremely demanding concerning the quality of the durable goods that I purchase, and I am not easily impressed.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> The lock down mechanism failed after about 8 months of use.  </li>
            <li> I will add that my previous braun lasted over 6 years and finally failed to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> Having been a Norelco user ever since I started shaving well over thirty years ago, I was a little wary of buying anything else.  </li>
            <li> Bad at actually shaving your face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after four times it was used with about three minutes for each time, the battery was dead.</li>
            <li> and I have gotten so sick of it that I&#x27;m finally replacing it.</li>
            <li> As an  example:  if the Cleaning  base dies, thats  not the end of charging , since the plug to the  charge base can be plugged into the back of the shaver, and old fashioned cleaning by  hand  </li>
            <li> the charging base I previously had from my first purchase (i.e. does not come w/ a charging base).</li>
            <li> I would buy a new razor every 3-4 years because I hated cleaning them.  </li>
            <li> (this was causing my face to dry out really bad).</li>
            <li> I have broken two of them already.</li>
            <li> Bought a Remington and was not really happy with it, but it was acceptable.</li>
            <li> If you use the razor for a few days without cleaning, it will eventually warn you that it has become dirty.  </li>
            <li> To get it back to \\&quot;like-new\\&quot; condition, however, you need to use the cleaning base.  </li>
            <li> However, it worked poorly for me from the beginning.</li>
            <li> After using razors for years, I was sick and tired of the hassle, mess, and uncomfortability of it.   </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed at it because I totally unexpected this to happen.</li>
            <li> The cleaning base has a neck that presses down on the shaver to start the cleaning process that is prone to breaking.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt detract from the shaving process but is just a slight bit annoying.  </li>
            <li> sorry i every ordered it.</li>
            <li> try this shaver, you can&#x27;t go wrong..</li>
            <li> I really fail to see what  some critics expect with these shavers.</li>
            <li> But even worse, it does NOT come with the charging cord!  </li>
            <li> Finally, the on/off switch is in a terrible location.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t--it&#x27;s basically useless.</li>
            <li> Very, Very poor build quality.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is incpable of cutting whiskers after a three day growth.</li>
            <li> A cleaning cycle is where the dual cutting surfaces are repeatedly bathed in the cleaning solution, lubricating the parts and removing shaving debris.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> bad design.</li>
            <li> SHOCKED..</li>
            <li> so using a blade is usually painful, and why I wanted to get an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also was disappointed because I thought it didn&#x27;t get my neck well, but I figured out that a circular motion on the neck solved that problem.  </li>
            <li> I figure the worst that can happen is it&#x27;s merely a gimmick</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> AND ALL YOU GET IS THE SHAVER, BASE, AND 1 CLEANER</li>
            <li> with a cleaning base.  </li>
            <li> (the hairs can be rinsed out under the tap since the base CANNOT be taken with you, cleaning solution would leak everywhere).  </li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because of the problems with the cleaning base, and</li>
            <li> The cleaning base is a plus.</li>
            <li> specialy when all you do is put it in the base -</li>
            <li> The self - cleaning base is not a gimmick.</li>
            <li> Go ahead and purchase this model -- you will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a terrible design and overpriced!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my second time ordering a \\&quot;refurbished\\&quot; Braun 7000-model shaver in the last 4 years.  As far as I am concerned, the unit is brand new without the usual fancy packaging.  The switch of the first unit stucked at \\&quot;on\\&quot; position for no apparent reason.  Otherwise both units are (were) fine products.</li>
            <li> I have used the shaver for over a month and it works like a charm.   Worth the money and would recommend it to anyone.  Delivery was fast and without any problem.  The purchase was made through Amazon and as usual no problems.</li>
            <li> Due to my very sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t use a regular razor more than one or two days in a row.  My neck will get bumpy and bleed, and my skin gets real dry.  Thankfully, the Braun 7680 solves all that . ..  &lt;br /&gt;This is my second Braun shaving system, and I just retired my Braun 6500 series after four years of constant use since the battery failed to take any more charge.  Prior to the Braun 6500 series, I tried a Norelco with the flex-head system, but it could not match the performance of the Braun 6500.&lt;br /&gt;My expectations were way high when I got the new Braun 7680.  That cleaning system thingie looked weird at first, but I kept an open mind.  After two weeks of solid use, I offer the following observations:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.  This is the best shaver ever built by Braun or anyone else that I ever used.  Cool design, lightweight, sturdy.  But these things are meaningless without a good shave - that is where this little beauty really shines!  After 7 minutes, I have the closest shave I can get with no razor burn or dry skin.  Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  &lt;br /&gt;2.  The cleaner pod makes this system a \\&quot;must buy.\\&quot;  No more brushing hairs and dulling the cutter block - now just pop the shaver in the pod, push a button, and voila!  Fifteen minutes later, the shaver is clean and good as new, with a nice scent added to boot.  (Note that my sensitive skin was not affected by any of the cleaning solution, which is mostly alcohol and evaporates quickly).  &lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Though advertised as \\&quot;smart\\&quot;, that is BS.  The shaver clock will turn off and on with each switch of the on/off slider.  I turn my shaver off several times before I finish shaving each day, and the clock just does not work - it only calculates from the last time I turned it on.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  Buy this shaver, true Shaving Nirvana!  The little computer glitch is only a slight mar on an otherwise outstanding product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use a blade because my neck is so sensitive, so since my dad used a Remington electric razor, I did too.  I would buy a new razor every 3-4 years because I hated cleaning them.  I was very intrigued by the self-cleaning razors, so I started my online investigations.  I decided to switch to the Braun mainly because of the online reviews of other customers.  I bought one a little over two weeks ago and I have NEVER had such a close shave before.  My neck isn&#x27;t irritated in the slightest and my girlfriend loves how close it shaves.  I have a fast beard growth and I have noticed that my face stays smoother longer (mainly because the shave is that much closer than the Remington delivers).  I have changed two of my shaving habits.  First, I shave before I shower.  Braun recommends this because apparently the skin swells when it&#x27;s wet (I didn&#x27;t know this).  Second, I clean the razor after every shave.  The manual claims this takes approx 15 minutes.  I don&#x27;t start this process until I&#x27;m done in the bathroom however as it turns the razor off and on periodically while it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s cleaning thing.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, well worth the extra money spent.  Go ahead and purchase this model -- you will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> The good: Self cleaning, smart-charging system, comfy shave&lt;br /&gt;The bad: Did lousy job shaving tough areas (neck), took a LONG time to shave normal areas, finally broke in less than a month out of the box!!  &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Not worth the money, so I returned it and went back to Norelco ...</li>
            <li> I love how close this razor gets and how the cleaning system does a great job. BUT, if you plan on buying any of the braun syncro shavers be VERY careful(on the cleaning system part)when you press the blue release button.  If you push the button while even just barely holding it down, the spring will break inside the machine and there is no way to open it up to fix it.  I have broken two of them already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been able to cut the hair on my face with electric razors, but never been able to cut the hair on my neck, and I&#x27;ve tried several.  The Braun 7680 looks nice, works great, and my skin is very happy afterwards as well.  I consider this the perfect shaver.  Being that I&#x27;m cheap, I&#x27;m not using the cleaning solution on a regular basis, but will periodically use it, then close the container each time so it doesn&#x27;t evaporate.  Definitely well worth it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all that many electrics, but this is definitely the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten with one. However, there is some truth to the fact that it is a little harder to use than a rotary. The reason is simply that the Braun MUST be used against the grain of your hair (the direction of which changes all over your face) whereas a rotary is perfecty symetric and it doesn&#x27;t matter. When used correctly, which means learning your particular face patterns, there is little argument that the Braun will shave closer than any rotary, as a foil can be made much thinner than a rotary &amp;quot;cage.&amp;quot; In fact, the very closeness of the shave is why some people are complaining about ingrown hairs! The shaver does have definite difficulty with long, flat-lying hairs, perhaps even more so than other electrics, which is its only remotely significant problem in my opinion. The cleaning system is actually incredibly effective, and leaves the razor perfectly clean and lubricated. The complaints about dirty alcohol are not warranted, as alcohol is a disinfectant and all solid materials settle into traps at the bottom of the container (and aren&#x27;t pulled into the stream of reciprocating alcohol). Quite clever! The only other negative is that the ergonomics of the device could be much better, especially relative to Norelco products. All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with my unit; regardless of some of the negatives I can get an excellent shave in the quickest amount of time of any of the alternatives I&#x27;ve ever tried (which includes blades).</li>
            <li> My Braun 7680 suddenly began making a loud noise after about six months.  It still shaves, but it makes so much noise that I cannot use it while my wife is still asleep in the bedroom for fear of waking her up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fairly expensive razor, I expected more from it.</li>
            <li> I am convinced that a lot of these reviews are written by people on the Braun payroll. I&#x27;ve had the system for about 18 months. It never did a good shaving job. It missed a lot of hairs. Now the cleaner stopped working and I am stuck with all these extra cartridges and replacement blades. Shame on Braun. They used to make a good razor, but not anymore!</li>
            <li> refurbished razor trimmer could not be retracted and couldn&#x27;t be turned off.   factory serviced means little.  supplier is out of stock.   waiting for replacement.  sorry i every ordered it.</li>
            <li> Great razor.  For the price it can not be beat.   I don&#x27;t see how a $250 could be better.  very close shave.  Cool design.</li>
            <li> Have used Braun shavers for some time and have been very satisified with all.  The 7680 refurbished arrived in good as new condition and has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> If you have 10-15 minutes to shave in the morning... Buy this razor... Then after a couple of weeks the razor begins to vibrate and becomes &amp;quot;VERY&amp;quot; noisey... You will have no problem waking up... The owners manuel should recommend earplugs... Braun makes great coffee makers... They should stick to that... Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> I had been a Norelco user for over 20 years until recently.  The last razor I purchased was the 6867XL model (at over a $100).  It was poorly constructed and extremely difficult to clean.  Within a month the spring connecting the razor head came dislodged and was subsequently lost.  It did not give me the close shave I expected from Norelco.&lt;BR&gt; In deciding to purchase a replacement unit I considered the new Norelco \\&quot;James Bond\\&quot; model as well as the Braun 7680.  I had never tried a Braun and was concerned whether it would be at least as good as the Norelco brand.  I read all the comments on Amazon.com and reviewed Consumer Reports.  I took the plunge on the Braun.&lt;BR&gt; What a wise choice.  The unit is much better constructed and sturdier than all the Norelco&#x27;s I ever owned.  The shave is also much closer and confortable.  Cleaning the razor is a breeze!  Braun has a new lifetime customer in me.  The only question I have is why I waited so long to change!</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY THIRD BRAUN SHAVER AND IT&#x27;S DONE ME WELL. I FIND IT GIVES ME JUST A GOOD A SHAVE AS A RAZOR. ALL ELECTRIC SHAVERS SEEM TO TAKE LONGER TO SHAVE THAN A RAZOR, HOWEVER MUCH LESS MESS. I&#x27;LL TAKE THE BRAUN AS MY FATHER HAS ONE AND MY BROTHER-IN LAW AND MY NEPHEW AS WELL.</li>
            <li> THIS SHAVER GOES FOR $199 REGULARLY  AND ALL YOU GET IS THE SHAVER, BASE, AND 1 CLEANER I FOUND THIS SHAVER AT COSTCO FOR $139.99 IT COMES WITH 3 CLEANER CARTRIDGES AND EXTRA REPLACEMENT FOIL AND CUTTER SO FOR ALL OF YOU WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PRICE IT&#x27;S A REALLY GOOD DEAL $60 CHEAPER THEN RETAIL YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT THAT AND YOU GET MORE DON&#x27;T BE CHEAP BREAK BREAD</li>
            <li> ...well, almost. Twenty-four hours after shaving, I have less beard than I did immediately after shaving with a model in the Braun 5000 series. And the self-cleaning system is truly remarkable.</li>
            <li> This razor is quiet and gives a real close shave. It recharges and cleans fast, however, the refill cartridges can run into a good hunk of change if you clean the razor everytime it indicates it. I find taking off the head and brushing out the stubble can extend the need of cleaning the razor too often. You can get about a year out of the blade and foil head before you have to replace it. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I had tried a few of the rotary shavers and none of them where what I was looking for. I have a very tuff beard and nothing really gives me a good shave. I used all of them for about two to three months(they all say you need to give your beard about 20 days to adjust to the new system and I&#x27;ll give them all a fare chance). Well I thought that I was finaly going to settle with the Mach 3 turbo, but I had to change blades every day or to. I also had to shave twice every morning (this was causing my face to dry out really bad). Then I desided to try out a foil type electric razor. This one works great. now I admit that it is not as close as a bladed razor but you can get pretty close by streaching your skin around. No more messing up the sink in the morning. The self cleaning is a great feature, it cleans the razor so much better than you could ever dream of doing with little brushes. Just put it in the cleaning station push the top down and that&#x27;s it in a about 10 min. there is not a hair in it and it&#x27;s also oiled too. The cleaning cartriges last about a month with everyday use and are cheep...Overall Great Razor and well worth it. And If I have a date or something when I need a close shave just a quick skim with my Braun and then break out the Mach 3 Turbo</li>
            <li> i had to restrain from writing this review the first day i got my 7680.. &lt;br /&gt;from the very first shave its been GREAT.. i had the norelco advantage which was &#x27;ok&#x27; but old and starting to wear down.. &lt;br /&gt;i tried a panasonic and sent it back after one shave.. &lt;br /&gt;this has made me a beliver in foil shavers.. i honestly expected to return this, but was pleasantly surprised.. no wait.. SHOCKED.. about how close the shave was.. it was 100x closer than the advantage. and did not leave my very sensative throat bleeding and raw.. &lt;br /&gt;just try this shaver, you can&#x27;t go wrong.. if it can shave my throat, it can shave anything.. &lt;br /&gt;and the cleaning thing is GREAT.. ya, sure another expense, but a very small price to pay for a phenomenal shave!</li>
            <li> Well, I first shave with an old norelco 985rx under the chin, then I finish with the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Foil shavers just do not cut it under the chin.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best electric one I have come across. I used a Norelco one a few years back and it didn&#x27;t work well at all, and cleaninn it was a pain.  Therefore, I was weary about purchasing a new electric razor.  But my skin is very sensitive and I have a thick beard, so the regular razors were tearing my face to shreads every morning, so I decided to give electric another try.  I decided on this electric for several reasons:&lt;BR&gt;1. The self-cleaning is a must have, because I could never get &lt;BR&gt;   the old one clean&lt;BR&gt;2. The head of the shaver pivots to the contours of my face and &lt;BR&gt;   neck&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using it I noticed that the razor seemed to get warm on my face but it seems ot have subsided after a few weeks or so.  I also was disappointed because I thought it didn&#x27;t get my neck well, but I figured out that a circular motion on the neck solved that problem.  After 3 months of having this shaver I can say without hesitation it is the best, the self-cleaning is great and I get a better shave than with the blade.  Shaving time with the electric razor is less too, around 3.5 mins for me.&lt;br /&gt;The only con to the razor is the cleaning part.  When it is cleaning it makes a lot of noise and it makes my bedroom smell like lemon (cleaning solution).  Though this is just a minor inconvience, as it cleans the shaver perfectly and I find that I only need to clean it every 3-4 days; not everyday as the company says to.</li>
            <li> First, there are already a few very good positive reviews that I agree with.  I will add that my previous braun lasted over 6 years and finally failed to hold a charge.  Hopefully the self charging system will work and is not just a marketing gimmick.  I figure the worst that can happen is it&#x27;s merely a gimmick and I&#x27;ll get another 6 years out of the replacement shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the one negative review about replacing the foil...I had to replace the foil once or twice on my old braun shavers over those 6 years.  I found that they are SOMEWHAT fragile.  Meaning that you shouldn&#x27;t toss it on the counter or bump it against anything or drop it.  Use the blade cover!&lt;br /&gt;The Braun works much better than the rotary shavers.  The sound of the blades cutting through the beard lets you know you&#x27;re not done yet.  More accurately, once that cutting sound is gone, I know I have a very close shave that will last the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning system is very nice.  Like another reviewer, I don&#x27;t clean the shaver every day, more like every few shaves.  I do shake out the stubble after each use.&lt;br /&gt;Years ago I owned a Norelco Triple header, but never liked the shave I got from it and switched to blades.  In &#x27;97 I bought the Braun and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;Braun makes a quality shaver.  If not this one, try another. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. (No I don&#x27;t work for Braun. I&#x27;ve just been a satisfied customer for 7 years).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this unit for more then a year and paid top dollar for its features when it was first released.  The unit has worked without problem. The cleaning system is great and offers an excellent shave without the hassle of blowing out clippings or such.  I&#x27;d recommend this unit without question.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned numerous electric shavers, and have consistently found Braun models to be superior for my needs.  The Syncro system would appear to offer not only a clean shave, but also the ultimate convenience of a self-cleaning function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So why the 3-star rating? The locking mechanism on top of the cleaning station breaks easily; specifically, it ceases to stay in the locked (down) position which activates the cleaning function and keeps the shaver charged. I&#x27;ve gone through two units in two years, both failing in exactly the same fashion. This is particularly disappointing, because I expect more durability and better designs from the Germans.</li>
            <li> While the shaver itself is a good product, my clean and charge base failed shortly after my purchase.  It would no longer latch and thus couldn&#x27;t be used. Telephone calls to Braun revealed that they have had a number of such failures, but they would not replace the defective base even within the warranty period; one could send it at one&#x27;s own expense to a repair facility. Unless one is willing to accept frustration with the base, I would recommend against its purchase.  Even though I&#x27;ve owned sevral previous Braun shavers, I&#x27;d hesitate to buy another from a firm that won&#x27;t stand fully behind its products.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get a decent shave from a disposable, or a so called  \\&quot;Blade\\&quot;  shaver , without looking like I was attacked by Freddie  Kreuger.  Suffice to say, after a year using the 7000  series together  with the totally  excellent  cleaner, I can definitively say that this Braun does a great job, cutting through tough beard hair, as well as treating sensitive skin very well.  The Blade, foil, and swivel head all work brilliantly together to give the best results I have ever had.  It is not cheap, but it is worth the money. If you have a growth of a few days, it is best to start of with a  light setting, or just basically learn the way your  beard goes, the directions of the hair, and use the shaver in an appropriate manner. The only way this will ever cut you is if the foil is damaged, and that is very rare ( I have found).  It works well as a travel shaver, and cuts through almost any length hair with the trim. If you work sensibly with the shaver, it does a great job. I can testify to that basically  because my  beard hair is very coarse, but my skin is extremely  sensitive. When Used properly, this Braun provides a superlative  shave with minimal  fuss, and is a precision  instrument as one would expect  from Braun, and it delivers on all  promises.    This review was originally written about the Syncro 7526 shaver, however the shaver  I bought is basically the same as the 7680.  Buying a Shaver really is a very \\&quot;personal\\&quot; decision. Some people can  shave  fine  with a blade, some can&#x27;t. So, for each person , that  aspect of shaving has to be taken into account. Also, much of the criticisms  in these  reviews appear to be based on some people who use things  carelessly. And to some  degree thoughtlessly. As an  example:  if the Cleaning  base dies, thats  not the end of charging , since the plug to the  charge base can be plugged into the back of the shaver, and old fashioned cleaning by  hand  can be done, and a replacement  cleaning unit  can bebought.  As at the time of this  writing, I have used the Braun Shaver for  over 2 years, and the  syncro has  been perfect. However, like all  high use items, there is a point where it will  break down, and sometimes  breakdown  so it cannot be repaired.On a dollar  for dollar  value, that kind of high useage  is quite good. I really fail to see what  some critics expect with these shavers. They need to be taken care, and they  will give a good  service; if you use it  carelessly, then it will break.  As at this  time, August 2006, I will be buying a  Braun  Syncro  8585  with a cleaning base.  With the requirements for myself  mentioned at the start of this  review, I have been  more than satisfied with this  product. The value is good, and in many respects it is an investment. My comments about shaving above still  apply, and if some of the  critics  took these  into accounts, maybe they  could  get more than adequate  use out of this high quality shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews here, and found it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. I expected it to replace using a blade to shave with, and it doesn&#x27;t. I been using it for about a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this shaver does is cut down most of the hairs without it being as painful as using a blade, but I end up having to use a blade to get a clean shave. The good thing about this is that when I do use the blade afterwards, it&#x27;s painless because I&#x27;m shaving very few hairs at a time. I have very coarse hair so using a blade is usually painful, and why I wanted to get an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other major problem is as people here have reported, the neck of the recharging stand doesn&#x27;t remain clicked down into position to allow recharging. It pops up 1/8th of an inch and disconnects itself from the shaver. This happened IMMEDIATELY when I tried to charge the shaver for the first time. I managed to work around this by removing the spring inside the neck, but this fix only lasted 5 more recharging sessions until it once again refuse to click all the way down into position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last complaint I have is that it does not shave under the chin and neck AT ALL. It just catches they very tips of the hairs occasionally. I tried pulling the skin taught, shaving from different directions, and nothing worked. I must have run about 50 passes over the skin and still all of the hair remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately though, using a blade here is not painful for me and the blade is very effective, getting all the hairs in 1-2 swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the only thing this shaver did for me is to cut down some of the longer coarse facial hair around the cheeks, above the lip and around the chin, where a blade would be painful to use. Then I go back and cleanup with a blade, rather easily and painlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking into another shaver because this one is definitely not worth the money I spent and is defective.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and he loves it.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> my man loves it, has been using it for about 2 years and it&#x27;s his favorite raiser. easy to maintain, easy to use, shaves smooth.</li>
            <li> Had an earlier model of this Braun shaver that finally gave up the ghost.  Actually it is still running, but not well.  So I decided to do some research and see what else was out there.  Man, sticker shock.  The latest models were running over $200.00.  Not going to do that so I went with refurbished model.  Mainly because I liked my other one a lot.  This one is a lot more quiet than my other one.  Replacement parts are still available in many places.  It does a pretty good job, but no electric is as good as a blade so I follow up quickly with a blade.  I clean the shaver before every shave, so I don&#x27;t need all that hardware that came with the original shaver.  Comes with a plug in charger.  Battery life is about a week for me.  When these batteries wear out, I will replace them with a set I&#x27;ve put in my other shaver and get about two weeks run on them.  I&#x27;m happy with this shaver.  Has a nice screen indicating battery life. And if available, I may do this the next time as well.</li>
            <li> I have had two of these razors.  They shaved well enough but 4 months into use with my first it started to get really loud and not shave well at all.  I sent it in for a replacement and now the new one is doing the same thing after only a couple months use.  Very, Very poor build quality.  It is a shame since when new this razor worked quite well.  Back to the blade for me.</li>
            <li> Best shaver if you&#x27;re afflicted with fuzzy logic. (I haven&#x27;t used the shaver--just like the name.)</li>
            <li> An excellent piece of technology. The Braun 7680 Syncro System Logic Shaver is a worthy 5 star item. It gets nice and close and wont knick your skin like a rotary blade. It has a special horizontal shaver in between the 2 standard cylinders that helps shave tuff to reach spots like your chin and jaw bone area. Whats best about this product compared to the other braun shavers is not only the cleaner that comes with it but its ability to shave closer then any other braun has before. This is a first of a kind technology introduced by Braun into the 7680. Unlike the other blades this items steel frame razor guard is thinner and stronger than the others.</li>
            <li> Being a recent heart patient, I am now on blood thinners. I used to be a razor man all my life and have heard great things about this shaver.  They are ALL TRUE.  No more bleeding neck nicks and closer than a razor.  Definitely a best buy!!!</li>
            <li> The Braun 7680 Syncro razor is really fantastic. First off, it is really 98% as close as a Mach 3 without the mess of shaving cream or nicks and cuts. The cleaning is also remarkable, it removes all of the hair like it&#x27;s brand new and it&#x27;s very easy to do, all you have to do is put it in and hit a button, that&#x27;s really it. It&#x27;s also very easy to use, no brain is needed to manage the system; plus if somehow you can&#x27;t figure something out, it has a manual. Now, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is when you want to recharge it, you have to hit the button twice, I sometimes just hit it once and it cleans when I don&#x27;t want it to, that&#x27;s pretty much all I found that I didn&#x27;t like. If you&#x27;re a little hesitant about the price, and think \\&quot;Maybe I should just stick with the Mach 3\\&quot; well, the price of the Mach 3 replacement blades will accumulate over the years, and they are a bit pricey, you only have to change the the blade on the Braun 7680 Syncro every 18 months, so it really pays for it self.</li>
            <li> Foils work the best hands down! Rotary is great sometimes, but I&#x27;ve found a few problems. &lt;br /&gt;1) Razor burn if not careful&lt;BR&gt;2) Hair pulling if not careful&lt;BR&gt;3) Repeated motions to get a close shave&lt;BR&gt;4) If used to long the shaver can overheat to the point of a possible burn&lt;br /&gt; Foils remove all that stuff! I&#x27;ve never had irritation or burn no matter how many times I have to go over the same spot and the shave is smoother then a rotary. I shave both my face and my head &amp;quot;daily&amp;quot; and the screen handles it without wear and tear. Because of how much shaving I do daily it is a major plus to have the self cleaning feature. I still only run it about every 3 days though.&lt;br /&gt; For those of you who worry about the cost of the replacements you just have to wiegh out the pros and cons of your shave and shaver.&lt;br /&gt; In my case I had to buy a new set of razor heads per week almost $10. Shaving time to do all my shaving with that regular razor was nearly 45 minutes per day. I can do it in less then 5/10 minutes a day now. Even from 45 minutes to 10 minutes the time saved is worth the price alone not even counting the cost of new blades. To me even if I have to but a new screen and blade plus 20 cleaning refills in a year it is still worth the price. (You also need to remember something. Amazon has 2 refills for $10 right now which is pretty cheap compared to remingtons. You can also buy from the braun site directly and get it cheap to!)</li>
            <li> Like so many other people on this board my cleaning unit broke after a few months. First the tab won&#x27;t stay down then the unit falls apart. Great shaver though but with out the cleaning unit not nearly worth the price. Also the cleaning solution is $5 a month or two. My friend&#x27;s unit broke also.</li>
            <li> Great item, very happy</li>
            <li> Great for and electric razor, but does not eliminate all the razor burn if you have sensitive skin. It has been 6 months and I still get red bumps. Easy clean, easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> For under $70, this is not a bad price for a shaver of this design with LCD display and side pulsing technology.  But this is just the shaver by itself.  It does not come with the cleaning station it was originally packaged with.  But even worse, it does NOT come with the charging cord!  I checked with the supplier.  You get ONLY the shaver.  This is being sold as a replacement unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, this is the older 7000 series model, several generations behind the latest Braun shaver model.  Braun has made some really nice improvements at this point.  I strongly suggest not wasting your money on this older technology.  Invest a few extra $$ and at least get the 8000 series or the newest model.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun 7680 refurbished even after being a little bit concerned with the number of refurbished units available.  I now can understand why the shavers were returned.  This is my second attempt to use an electric razor. I had one years ago but It did not give me the shave I desired and I went back to a regular razor.  This shaver is incpable of cutting whiskers after a three day growth. I go over spots where I might have missed during my last shave without being able to cut them. I thought that the 7000 series would be outstanding but this particular model failed the test.  I thought of returning the shaver but I did not and I don&#x27;t remember your return policy.  I have seen ads on TV showing a man with a growth of probably 5-7 days cutting right through with a 3000 series. I wonder if this is true or just a staged event.  I would appreciate any assistance you may be able to give me on this problem.  Thomas D. Mc Nulty</li>
            <li> When I bought the new Braun 7680 Shaver about three years ago, the manual says that the rechargable battery would be good for three to five years. Recently the battery started to perform abnomally. I decided to purchase a refurbished one of the same model when I had a trip to go. Unfortunately after four times it was used with about three minutes for each time, the battery was dead. I am very disappointed at it because I totally unexpected this to happen. I suspect that they did not change the battery when they refurbished it.   Of course now I want to know if the battery is new for the refurbished device. I will not buy it if the battery is not replaced with a new one.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with a blade for many years and about four years ago it began to really irritate my skin. Bought a Remington and was not really happy with it, but it was acceptable. When that razor crashed and burned, big time, I got smart and researched electric razors eventually settling on the Braun 7680. &lt;br /&gt;For me the shave is great. While I do seem to make more passes over my face than with the Remington, the shave is closer. A blade will give a closer shave, but I am extremely happy with this system. The shaves are close and last longer than with the blade, the battery lasts significantly longer than did the Remington&#x27;s, and the foils last longer than the Remington&#x27;s and are less expensive. Of course the cleaning cartridge is an additional cost, but I am certainly happy with its results. It is like getting a new shaver with each use. &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get \\&quot;excited\\&quot; about such mundane items, but for me, this is one good shaver.</li>
            <li> I had been a Braun user years ago, but switched to a Norelco a few years ago because I felt the old Braun was too irritating. I never felt the Norelco shaved as closely, and maybe that&#x27;s why it was less irritating. Be that as it may, I recently switched to the new generation of self-cleaning Brauns and I am absolutely thrilled!&lt;BR&gt;The shave I get now is almost as close as a blade, but because the self-cleaning mechanism also lubricates the blades, I am getting *none* of the irritation I used to get. In addition, the handy base not only contains the cleaning solution and performs the lubrication, it also handles battery maintenance by monitoring your usage pattern and adjusting the charging schedule accordingly, including periodic and fully automatic complete battery discharge &amp;amp; recharge, which will result in longer battery life and longer cordless cycles.&lt;BR&gt;About the only 2 things I don&#x27;t care for are the very bright blue light on the base which is even a bit too bright as a bathroom nightlight (I&#x27;ll get used to that, I&#x27;m sure) &amp;amp; the ever-present, light machine oil odor the cleaning solution imparts to the bathroom in general and to the razor in particular.</li>
            <li> The 7680 is the top of the line dry shaver from Braun. I&#x27;ve previously been a Panasonic fan, favoring their wet/dry capability and single cutting head (which helps reach those difficult and smaller shaving spots). However, the battery constantly dies after a while and that would cause me to buy another shaver. Not so with the Braun...it conditions your battery to get the best life out of it, learning your shaving behavior and discharging when you&#x27;re least likely to use it. The display provides the necessary basic information you&#x27;d need, like how long of shave was the last, replacement part number, battery life status, charging and cleaning status. The amazing thing about this type of Braun shaver is the charging and cleaning stand...it really does charge or clean or do both. A cleaning cycle is where the dual cutting surfaces are repeatedly bathed in the cleaning solution, lubricating the parts and removing shaving debris. Next a drying cycle occurs, where a gently blowing fan assists in helping evaporate the cleaning solution. The stand even has an indicator to tell you when your cleaning cartridge is almost empty. The cartidge contains a filter which prevents stubble from being in the reused solution. I found that keeping a few spare cartridges around is helpful, and to extend the life between cartridges I just replace the used solution with distilled alcohol which can be found inexpensively at any store. To add a bit of lubrication, I add a few drops of electric shave solution to it. This effectively doubles the lifespan of the cartridges, if not more. Change to a new cartridge only when the stubble level exceeds a desireable collected amount. The shaver itself is quieter than the other models in Braun&#x27;s lineup only because the long hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t work until engaged and the synchro four directional head creates less resistance, counteracting increased noise. The complete shaving head pivots front to back but you can set it to lock in place for a more controlled shave if necessary. Overall, I wish everything was slightly lighter and smaller, but this is so far the closest shaver I&#x27;ve purchased in my lifetime.lled shave if necessary.

            <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband who has very sensitive skin and shaving with a normal razor caused razor burn every time he shaved no matter how careful he was.  With this shaver, it takes him less time to shave and it is much gentler on his face.  The cleaning system is huge help in our bathroom since the shaver seems to \\&quot;catch\\&quot; all the hairs as he shaves and then they are rinsed away in a self contained system - I never find the sink full of little hairs anymore!  The shaver also comes with a portable charging cord, so if you are travelling for a few days, you can pack it in the included case and take it with you (the hairs can be rinsed out under the tap since the base CANNOT be taken with you, cleaning solution would leak everywhere).  Additionally, he has been using the razor every other day for about a year now and nothing has gone wrong and the foils are still in good condition and do not need to be replaced for quite awhile yet.</li>
            <li> I have used many electric shavers but the Braun system is by far the best I have ever used. It is very close to blade shaving and much easier.&lt;BR&gt; I rate it five stars.</li>
            <li> I also had the identicle problem with the charging cleaning stand.  The lock down mechanism failed after about 8 months of use.  Other than that, this is an excelent shaver!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver after owning earlier Braun models. I was diappointed with my last shaver in that it only lasted 4 years. (Braun gives shavers a 5-7 year life.) This one manages the battery charging which I believe will extend the life of the battery which is what failed on the last one. Worse yet, the battery was attached to a PC board and could not be replaced economically. &lt;br /&gt;I read reviews prior to buying this model. The chief complaint was the cost of the cleaning cartridges, since they are quoted at a cartridge per month. It turns out to be much better than expected. First of all, the cartridges come 2 to a pack and are discounted online. Second, you need not clean the shaver each day. I clean mine every other shave and my cartridge worked fine for 2 1/2 months. &lt;br /&gt;One last thing. I was able to take a week vacation without taking the cleaner stand along. The unit has more than adequate battery power to last the entire week and you need only brush out the shaver manually until you return home.</li>
            <li> I had this shaver for only a few weeks and the charging stand/cleaner stopped working and engaging the shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a terrible design and overpriced!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Worst thing I have bought this year.  I will try and get Braun to replace the stand....BUT WHAT A HASSLE. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;NO MORE BRAUN at these terribly high prices for cheap engineering. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> After my 5 year-old Braun electric shaver bit the dust, I investigated the current crop of electric razors. I have had Norelco, Remington, and Braun shavers in the past and have never really been satisfied with any of them.  After reading the reviews for the Braun 7680 Syncro, I decided to give it a try, despite the high cost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I am extremely demanding concerning the quality of the durable goods that I purchase, and I am not easily impressed.  When the 7680 Syncro arrived I noticed the forethought and engineering in both the design and the manufacturing of this shaver. After charging for the requisite period I tried the shaver, and was immediately impressed with one of the best, closest, and most comfortable shaves of my life.  I am delighted with this purchase, and I have recommended the Braun 7680 Syncro, without qualification, to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love the way this shaver shaves.  The shaver itself is an extremely well built-product that has lasted almost 4 years.  Other reviews do a great job describing how well it shaves, so I won&#x27;t repeat them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are two caveats I need to point out: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1)  The cleaning system also works great but is pricey (about $60/year for the cleaning cartridges), so it&#x27;s much more over time than the cost of the shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2)  The cleaning base has a neck that presses down on the shaver to start the cleaning process that is prone to breaking.  It lasted about 2 years, and then refused to stay down.  Fortunately, Braun&#x27;s repair facility in San Francisco replaced it.  Then a year later, it broke again.  I called Braun, they asked for the serial number to determine whether it was still in warranty, then authorized a repair.  The SF repair facility this time insisted on repairing it rather than replacing it.  It&#x27;s now a year later, and it&#x27;s broken again.  I&#x27;m  going to place another call to Braun, and hopefully they&#x27;ll say that I&#x27;m still under warranty.  Make sure you&#x27;re close to a Braun authorized repair facility, since shipping it back is a hassle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because of the problems with the cleaning base, and because Braun has now come out with the new, similarly priced Activator line (that still has a cleaning base but doesn&#x27;t have the arm that breaks), THERE IS NO REASON TO BUY THIS SYNCRO SHAVER ANYMORE.  BUY THE ACTIVATOR LINE! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If Braun refuses to fix the base under warranty this time, I will definitely not pay to get it fixed (since it&#x27;ll break in a year anyway) and will buy the new Activator, even though I hate to reward Braun for selling me a defective product.  I may look into getting a Panasonic shaver, but since I&#x27;m otherwise so happy with the Braun, I&#x27;ll probably just stay with Braun.</li>
            <li> I have the older version of this shaver (now has an LCD display) and the shaver has worked very well.  The cleaning feature is outstanding for a clean shave each and every time.  &lt;br /&gt;The charging stand, however, is a different story.  The lock down mechanism failed after about 6 months of use, and the Braun authorized repair center has had it for a month now waiting for replacement charger parts.  I&#x27;ve had many many electric shavers over the years and this Braun shaves as good as the best of them.  Hopefully,  Braun will improve the charging stand design to match.</li>
            <li> I have had many electric shavers in imy life.  Recently I&#x27;ve been using the Mach3 line of blades.  I had to switch to an electric because I have sensetive skin and the blade was irritiating my skin too much.  &lt;BR&gt;I think Braun makes the best shavers in the world.  The Norelco&#x27;s are as effective as manually pulling each hair out!  The Panasonic line shaves close but they tend to irritate more than even the blades which defeats the whole purpose.  &lt;BR&gt;This shaver in particualr is absolutely amazing.  The shave is very close (I would say 98% as close as a Mach 3 blade shave) with minimal irritation and razor burn.  &lt;BR&gt;I have found the using a preshave such as \\&quot;Williams  Lectric\\&quot; pre shave helps minimize any irritation and gives an even better shave.&lt;BR&gt;The cleaning feature is brilliant.  You just shave and put the shaver in the stand and all maintenence (cleaning/lubrication and charging) is taken care of.  Also if you have sensitive skin, the shaver will be sanitized to reduce irritation next time you use it. &lt;BR&gt;Some have complained about the cost of the cleaning cartridges.  I think you will find the cost a fraction of using high end blades and shaving foams/gels.  It&#x27;s a minor point and in my opinion the benefits far outweight the minimal cost...&lt;BR&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this shaver to anyone that is tired of shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever bought.  I have been shaving with traditional blades for many years with a combination of a Norelco beard &amp;amp; mustache trimmer.  I have now owned this shaver for a little over a month and I am ready to make my review.  Nearly all of the claims Braun makes about this product are true:&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. It holds a charge for a long time, they say 50 minutes, I haven&#x27;t tried to run the battery out yet, but I tried going a week without charging it and it ran fine.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is self cleaning (although you do incur the cost of purchasing the cleaning solution packets), but you don&#x27;t have to brush the hairs out, and an additional bonus is that shaved hairs seem to go INTO the foil, not fall away from it, which means your bathroom counter doesn&#x27;t turn into a small haired carpet.&lt;br /&gt;3. All three of the modes this shaver functions in, work as designed.  The pivot mode provides good flexible motion, the locked mode provides good control, and the extended long-hair trimmer mode performs as expected.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Cool design (love the blue light), great feel, not too heavy, not too light, solidly built (dropped it once, no apparent harm done).&lt;br /&gt;5.  Comes with a &amp;quot;smart-chip&amp;quot; that learns how you shave, and will start customizing your shaver to behave how you behave (keeping it fully charged, cleaning cycles, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;However, there are some downsides to this shaver (which is why I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars).&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. I don&#x27;t know if it is just me, but this shaver does *not* work well if you allow your beard to grow for more than 48-72 hours.  Once the hairs get past a certain length, the shaver proves very ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;2. This shaver does *not* work well on damp skin, whether that dampness is from natural sweat, or from moisture in the air from a recent shower, it causes the shave you get to be rather uneven at best.&lt;br /&gt;3. The shaver does *not* work well with the way my neck hairs grow.  My neck hairs grow in a type of a swirling pattern.  So in order to get a decent shave I end up having to feel for each grain and try to arc the shave out from the epicenter in a sort-of counter swirl.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The shaver foils get rather warm if you use the shaver for over about 1.5 minutes.  Not warm enough to cause burning or even discomfort, but still rather warm.&lt;br /&gt;5.  The automatic cleaning mode does *not* clean the long-hair portion of the shaver, which is slightly higher than the foils when it is in the cleaner-case.  To clean the long-hair blades you need to bust out the cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a superior shaver for the money Braun wants for it.  While it is true I listed a few negatives about it, I am rather certain it is just me, and that cannot be helped.  Under optimal shaving conditions this shaver provides a quick, clean, and smooth shave, exactly what it is supposed to do.ype of a swirling pattern.

            <li> I have to give this little gem 5 out of 5. I am critical in most reviews but when I have a product that performs as well as my Braun 7680 I just had to paint this review, BRIGHT BLUE. Please dont confuse blue with the Kmart &amp;quot;Blue Light Special&amp;quot;. This product doesnt skimp on quality. No the blue is for the actual blue light that blinks and smiles at me letting me know its time for another great shave! &lt;BR&gt;I decided to turn from the Mach 3,even as good as that shaver was, it still knicked from time to time. But first let me say this, I have had electic razors before and always went with Norelco. I tolerated the uneven shave of the Norelcos for awhile then switched to the Mach 3. I still waited about every other day to shave but the shave was much closer and even with the knicks, Mach 3, was a definate upgrade from the Norelco. I wanted to shave everyday but never had the time to do it..in comes the Braun 7680. I have never looked back. The cleaning base is a plus. The shave I get from my Braun is as good as the MACH 3 but the time that I spent shaving is cut in half. And that Ladies and Gentleman of the jury, is a PLUS in my book. No hassle with brushes and shaver heads. Shaver is always clean and ready for use. The charge holds and if I have to re-charge..I shave with the cord... then plug cord in said base.. select Clean and Re-charge. Shaves are close and I even shave during the weekend and not just on Sunday night,makes for a good Monday mornin. So all in all...I highly recommend this shaver on anyone&#x27;s wish list. Buy it,Use it, and you&#x27;ll Love it!</li>
            <li> Never having used an electric razor befor, because I had always heard how they do not provide very close shave, and that they tend to pull hairs, I was reluctant to accept the Braun 7680 as a Fathers Day gift. I was a Gillette Mach 3 razor user who hated to shave because of the irritating red rashes I would get after shaving due to my  sensitive skin. Sometimes I would go 3 or 4 days between shaves just to avoid shaving.&lt;br /&gt;NOT ANYMORE!!!! The 7680 has changed that completely. I shave daily with no irritation, and it only takes 4 - 7 minutes to do so.  I waited a month before writting this review because the instructions tell you that it takes a few weeks for your beard to get adjusted to the electric shaver. This is true, at first I thought that I wasn&#x27;t going to like it, but since it was a Father&#x27;s Day gift, I was somewhat obligated to use it for a while. I sure am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I would agree that the shaver shaves about 98% as close as the Mach 3, but what I like best about my 7680 is that I don&#x27;t go more than a day without shaving anymore, sometimes I even shave in the morning and touch it up in the evening just because it is so quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I can only compare this to a manual shaver, because it is all I have used, but I definitely give it a double thumbs up!!! Great Razor.&lt;br /&gt;28yr old proud father of 1.&lt;br /&gt;Changed for Life</li>
            <li> Every shaver (and I mean every) has always left me with that nice little burn under my neck.  Most shaver manufacturers say that I need to use it for several weeks and that will go away.  Yeah right.  My friend mentioned to me that he never had any problems with this new shaver.  I said &amp;quot;no burn..no pull..no nothing?&amp;quot; and he said &amp;quot;nothing&amp;quot;.  So I nervously laid down the $180 and bought it.  Let me tell you the shaver is better than advertisted.  No burning, close shave, easy to clean.  How much more do you want?  I highly recommend the Braun Syncro 7680 shaving system.  It&#x27;s worth the cash.  Plus Amazon sent me a free travel shave case at no extra cost.  The shipment was lighting fast as well. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Purchased this shaver to replace a tri-head Norelco. The syncro clearning system does a wondrous job--I only use it once a week. However, periodically it WILL leave a dark residue on the screen. Therefore, don&#x27;t be agape if you notice black smudge marks on your face. Albeit long on battery life, the razor has a difficult time snipping fine hairs (as opposed to stout and thick) as well as hairs along the middle to lower neck. You really have to stretch the skin to get the razor to shave such hairs--even then, it&#x27;s not always successful. The so-called lock button on the on/off switch does NOT work. Meaning, while you&#x27;re shaving, if your finger touches the on/off switch, it will move to the next level. Finally, after merely 5-weeks of usage, the original screen acquired a large hole. I contacted Braun, which amiably sent me a new one with cutters. Do not use pre-electric lotion on your face. This will denigrate the life of the screen. Use a bit of baby oil dabbed on the screen. Finally, the on/off switch is in a terrible location. Your thumb always hits it, thereby switching it to another level of shave. If the auto-lock mechanism actually worked, then there would be no problems. But it doesn&#x27;t--it&#x27;s basically useless. It&#x27;s a better improvement than Norelco, but, shavers still have a ways to catch up to the razor.</li>
            <li> I used to use a Norelco during my college days and did so up until my mid 20&#x27;s when I started sporting a mustache.  The tri-head Norelco just couldn&#x27;t &#x27;touch up&#x27; near the &#x27;stache, so instead of spending time using BOTH the Norelco and a blade, I just went back to blades.  That was until I recently had a friend marvel at how great the Braun 7680 was; I listened mostly out of amazement, because he sports a mustache too.  It sounded literally &#x27;too-good-to-be-true&#x27;, but enticed me enough to buy one.  I can genuinely tell you, he wasn&#x27;t kidding.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 7680 is a very &#x27;Teutonic&#x27; looking piece of equipment; very high tech, but classy, if that makes sense.  Fit and finish of everything is of the highest caliber.  It comes with:  the razor itself, a very nice leather carrying case, a cleaning brush, the instructions, a hard clear plastic foil protector,a charging/cleaning stand and a bottle of the cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;At first, you plug the power cord into the razor and start a 4 hour charging procedure; Braun cautions you to NOT start using the cleaning stand for the initial charge (stating that the &#x27;Smart Logic&#x27; built into the razor needs this first, necessary charge in such a manner).  I did so, at $170 who needs to second-guess the manufacturer?&lt;br /&gt;It charged in almost four hours to the minute; the timer is unbelievable in this thing.  What it states on the LCD can be taken with authority from my impressions.  But enough tech; how does it shave?  Unbelievable comes to mind, initially.  VERY, VERY easy on your skin.  My beard is not heavy, but it is coarse.  The Braun just glides over your facial contours with the lightest touch.  I experience no burning, nor irritation at all.  As past reviewers correctly state, you do have to somewhat stretch your neck skin to get the absolute best shave.&lt;br /&gt;The joy of this shaver comes from NOT having three heads setup in a triangle, which really kills close touch ups.  Being straight, you can get comfortably close to mustaches, goatees, etc.  The trimmer is more aggresive than the trimmer on a Norelco, but ALL trimmers on shavers to me are a convenience item, at best.  They cut great; but they&#x27;re always mounted in a position that I assume makes the best use of the shaver&#x27;s powertrain, and, realistically, you just have to contort a lot to get them into position.  A simple trimmer, such as Norelco&#x27;s superb little mustache/beard trimmer, just make life so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to an electric, I simply cannot emphasize how important it is to TAKE TIME and let your beard/skin get accustomed to using the electric.  Norelco used to include a little pamphlet in with their shavers (years ago!) that actually put some thought into scientifically explaining it; I had the good fortune to have a college room mate that paid his dues with a Norelco and he coached me well in this.  Whatever the scientific reason, I can tell you, it takes about a month for everything to start working together.  I can&#x27;t put it any simpler than that.  Don&#x27;t EVER judge ANY electric by the first two weeks; and DON&#x27;T get tempted to use a razor to touch up; you&#x27;re simply delaying the process.&lt;br /&gt;One final note, that may interest some readers:  You&#x27;re going to have a high tech &#x27;rocket launcher&#x27; (I don&#x27;t take credit for this; another reviewer CORRECTLY termed it thusly) on your bathroom counter.  This may/may not matter to you, but make no mistake, you WILL notice it; it&#x27;s about 3 times bigger than the shaver (and gleaming, high tech BLACK) and unless you have a power socket UNDER your bathroom cabinet, it&#x27;s gotta go somewhere!  My wife adds this little bit of trivia to the review, as she HATES the recharging stand, forcing me to use the downstairs bathroom for storage, as she has a &#x27;theme&#x27; to our master bedroom.  Go figure!  Oh yes, one last thing that&#x27;s important:  the cleaning solution tanks.  Once the cap is off of them, they CAN leak; i.e. once you install them, place the recharging stand where you won&#x27;t move it; if you tilt the stand, they DO leak!&lt;br /&gt;So, as a summary:  Great shave, even better if you&#x27;re used to electrics.  Great quality, very nicely made piece of equipment.  Huge, very noticeable recharging stand.  Five stars, for sure!</li>
            <li> I have the previous model 7570 which gives a great shave but the foil wears out about every 9 months so except to replace them at $25 each.  Also, had to replace the cleaning system that broke after about a year as noted by another reviewer.</li>
            <li> I first purchased a Remington 9500, and returned it after about 5 shaves.  It wouldn&#x27;t shave anything around the nose, and wasn&#x27;t close at all anywhere else.  It also seemed to irritate my face more than the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I thought about purchasing the Braun 7526, which is apparently the same shaver without the LED display, and about 50 dollars cheaper.  Being a gadget kind of guy I had to have the display, so I purchased the 7680.  I must admit that I was very thorough with my first shave with it.  (To see if it was as good as most of the reviews say).  &lt;br /&gt;This shaver is incredible.  As close as a razor for me.  I have owned norelco and another older Braun model.  I am soooo pleased with this product.  Not having to open it and brush it clean constantly is a definate plus!  You have to try this machine to believe what a good shave it gives!!!!</li>
            <li> Wow, I gotta say this is the coolest shaver, AND you get the best &amp;amp; most comfortable shave from this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I had a Braun 5310 for about 4 years. I changed the foil a few times.  Better than a rotary shaver, but I always wondered if there was a better shaver out there... maybe Braun was not that good after all... it was irritating my neck, was a rough shave &amp;amp; wans not comfortable, the battery lasted 5 min at best.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it was time for a new foil - or - a new razer.  I read lots of reviews - thanks to all who posted them, they were very helpfull - and decided on the Braun 7680... yes, another Braun.  $200 for a razor seemed crazy, $158 at Amazon still seemed high, but, when I got the thing, it felt like QUALITY.  The cleaning base is exceptionally cool, the LCD display is fun to look at &amp;amp; informative as well....  from the mouth of a gadget guy, its just cool!&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the BEST part... THE SHAVE.  I actually look forward to shaving!!  Unbelievable.  It is so smooth and cuts so well, you hardly know its a razer... it feels more like rubbing a glass all over your face.  It cuts fully smooth in 2 strokes.... and (yes, I timed it)  is faster... A typical shave with the Old Braun 5310 too 4:20 - 5:30, and my neck was irritatede&amp;amp; I had to really work some spots.  The NEW 7680 finished in 2:15 (and I was being slow about it), no iritation, almost felt like I hadent shaved - except the days growth is gone!.  Very smooth.  And , if you take a tad bit longer &amp;amp; really go for the super smmmooooth shave,  it takes about 3:00, or, if your in a rush, yuo can grab a good shave in less than 1 min, even with two days growth.  &lt;br /&gt;It cuts supper close, super smooth and COMFORTABLE!!!&lt;br /&gt;The charging in the base is great, and, you get a pouch that holds the shaver &amp;amp; the power cord (that is also used for the chargibg base). So, when you leave town for a week, you just put the shaver &amp;amp; the cord in the pouch, toss it in the Ditty Bag, &amp;amp;your good to go.  Actually, you can shave for well over a week on one charge.  My 5130 would die in the middle of the second shave... if it lasted that long.&lt;br /&gt;Im not one for highly consumable items (like the Cleaning cartridge in this thing), but man, it really is so nice to have a clean, fresh shaver EVERY time you shave... specialy when all you do is put it in the base - no more opening it, cleaning itr, etc... its really a &amp;quot;Shave &amp;amp; Go&amp;quot; system that self cleans... it really does make a difference.  Most likely I will find a way to &amp;quot;re-fill&amp;quot; the cartridge to extend its life, but even at $4.50 a month for replacements (Super Wallmart - $8.49 for a box with 2) ist worth it!&lt;br /&gt;As far as negative comments - I guess the cartriges for the charger could be cheaper... but thats not a big problem.. As far as performance... this thing is TOP NOTCH!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a fabulous shaver WELL worth the Money.</li>
            <li> This razor... if it were any more advanced, it would have to extend four spider-like limbs, crawl across the floor, climb into bed, and shave me while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It allows me to be totally brainless about shaving.  I stumble into the bathroom in the morning, pick it up, rub it on my face, slap it back into its cradle, and wander off.  That&#x27;s it.  Cool.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome shaver. I bought 1 for my husband 2 years ago. The only flaw we have found is that after a few months the shaver head gets minior holes in it that tear up his face when he shaves. There are replacement foils, but its kind of a pain to send away for it</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used electric razors for about 15 years now and have owned a remington, a panasonic and 2 brauns.  my old braun 7505 finally died and i tried a couple others (including the braun series 3) that i took back and got my money back on and went ahead and purchased another braun syncro.  i&#x27;m not disappointed.  the braun series 3 was ok but this is worth the extra money.  it shaves faster, closer and more comfortably than any of the other razors i&#x27;ve used.  (the panasonic was as fast and close but the replacement heads weren&#x27;t as durable and cost about 50% more than the braun)  easy to clean and relatively quiet for a foil shaver.  can be used with or without the cord so if the battery dies it&#x27;s still usable.   i&#x27;ll be sticking with this one as long as possible.</li>
            <li> This is a nice shaver.  My main complaint is the noise.  Compared with Norelco rotary shaver, this one is clearly much noiser.</li>
            <li> I have owned a model 7680 for abou 6 months and up until this morning it was the best, however, my cleaning/ recharging unit no longer works, and needless to say this puts me in a bind. Do I buy a new unit or do I ask for a new one but   I have discarded my receipt long ago. Also what is the difference between a model 7680 and 7526. I know there is a price difference but I do not see why it is different. I need help!!!       Greetings!       Mike Dobbin</li>
            <li> I have searched the world over for a shaver that can handle my beard.  This is the only one that gets the job done.  It also cleans itself and maintains a strong battery charge!  Quality product- well worth the money.</li>
            <li> 4 1/2 Stars - This razor replaced my 5+ year old Panasonic.  I decided that I needed to try a self-cleaning razor.  After 1-month, I&#x27;d say that the Braun performs as expected.  The razor does a pretty good job... there are still a few spots along my jaw line that only a non-electric hits easily.  The cleaning system works great.  When I travel, I miss having it.  If you use the razor for a few days without cleaning, it will eventually warn you that it has become dirty.  You can manually brush it out like most other electrics and that works fine.  To get it back to \\&quot;like-new\\&quot; condition, however, you need to use the cleaning base.  All around a good system.</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun razor. Initial attraction on both counts was the battery meter. I shave in the car on the way, or when I get there. This razor stays in the car not in a charging stand, until I get down to _ minutes of shave time left. Braun also has a car power charging cord. &lt;BR&gt;     &lt;BR&gt;     I started a new habit, bringing it up to be cleaned in its stand with that lemon solution, perhaps my facial skin will benefit, maybe even keep the razor sharp longer? I bought this for the razor, the cleaning stand is immaterial.&lt;br /&gt;     What is the deal with being as close as a blade anyway? Will you be able to shave once a day instead of twice?&lt;BR&gt;Do you really need your face as smooth as a babys bottom? &lt;BR&gt;Are you trying to look like you did before facial hair?&lt;BR&gt;Perhaps these folks will find a way to Mach 3 in the car!&lt;br /&gt;     If your beard really can not be cut by a machine, your not even shopping for one and you will never see this review.</li>
            <li> I have used the traditioanl razor and cream for over 30 years.  Every single time I tried an electric, I received razor burns and ingrown hairs as my reward....until now!&lt;BR&gt;My wife gave me a Braun 7680 for Christmas, after I had read enough reviews from here to take one last stab at the electric.  The reviewers were VERY helpful to point out that this was no ordinary electric razor.  Particularly several recent converts to this machine.  When it arrived, I was still leary, but after the second shave(I didn&#x27;t know what the hell I was doing on the first time out)I am truly converted.  No more razor burn or ingrown hairs.  The most incredible thing is that it really does give you a shave as close as the blade.  Score another one for  Amazon.com for allowing this customer feedback format to hear others experiences.  Thanks to the other reviewers for taking the time to give feedback for a skeptic like me.  Kudo&#x27;s to Braun for finally breaking the mold and figuring out how to make an outstanding razor.  Put your turbo razor and the shaving gel out at the curb gentlemen because technology has triumphed again!</li>
            <li> Have had this for thirteen months and it is great. Braun really come top of the pile when it comes to shavers - much better than philishave.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable! I can tell you that I will never go back to my Philishave 8000 series (that&#x27;s &#x27;Norelco&#x27; to you in the States). This is a quality shaver - it is very well made, you can tell by the feel of it in your hand.&lt;BR&gt;As for the shave - I can tell you that it is 97% of what I get from a Mach 3 razor. On some parts of my face it even surpasses the Mach 3. Very little irritation too.&lt;BR&gt;The self - cleaning base is not a gimmick. I don&#x27;t want to mess around brushing / washing out my shaver. I want to be shaved and out of the door. With this, all you do is put the shaver in the cradle and push a button. The shaver comes out spotless and smelling of scent. For $15 I can by refill cartridges for 3 months. Who worries about that money, when you get hassle free mornings / evenings?&lt;BR&gt;I would wholeheartedly recommend this appliance to anyone.&lt;BR&gt;Trust the Germans to come up with something this good. Total satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several times to give this thing three stars, but the interface seems to be a piece of junk.  Pay no attention if there&#x27;s only one star there . . . this thing rates at least a 3. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get a decent shave with anything, so I try lots of different approaches.  This gozmo is as good as any Ive tried.  I get as close a shave as I can manage with a blade, and with a lot less trouble.  The self-cleaning mechanism is very cool, though I&#x27;ll have to buy refills for it once a month or so . . . haven&#x27;t checked out how much those will cost yet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shave&#x27;s no worse than I get with anything else, but I was hoping for something significantly better.  Maybe I&#x27;ll go back to just having a beard.</li>
            <li> I was new to electric razors when I bought this. It irritated my skin a bit, but friends told me that was normal when switching from a traditional blade. I&#x27;ve owned a Philips since and much prefer the Philips. It could simply be a style preference, and since performance was pretty good, I can&#x27;t knock it. It gets stuck as an average review. Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t irritate as much for others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a version of this shaver for probably the last 10 years -- three of them over that time.  This one works great just like the others.  Shipping was quick and product exactly as described. Works great w/ the charging base I previously had from my first purchase (i.e. does not come w/ a charging base).</li>
            <li> I bought this razor years ago and used it for many years without any issues. Recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend owns this and here&#x27;s what I hear him say everytime:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product and definitely worth owning ... however, the cleaning solution is only good for about a month (assuming you shave at least every weekday) and the refills become rather costly.&lt;br /&gt;At the end, it&#x27;s a matter of whether or not you feel the refill is worth the time you would spend cleaning it every time you&#x27;d use it.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas in 2001, after extensive research on the web.  I had just gotten a job and needed to shave everyday, but the traditional foam and razor shave was killing my skin.  So, I finally suggested to my parents that this is what I want for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;On Christmas Day I received the Braun from my parents, and I gave it a try.  The directions recommend that it takes 3 weeks for your face/facial hair to become accustomed to the electric razor, and I would agree with that.  But after a couple of weeks, the razor was shaving very closely, it was not irritating my skin, and it only took about 4 minutes to get a nice shave.  I&#x27;ve been shaving every morning since.&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve had the razor for 16 months, and I&#x27;m still very satisfied with it.  You need to shave everyday, because if you let your facial hair grow out a little bit, it is much more difficult to obtain a clean shave.  Normally one would be annoyed by this, but I found that it keeps me shaving on a regular basis, and I don&#x27;t look so scruffy anymore.  Currently, the razor foil is more or less kaput, so I ordered a replacement head ...).  Braun suggests that you replace the head and foil every 18 months, so it does not surprise me that the foil is starting to chip.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars, because the cleaning solution is a tad expensive, and the razor has difficulty shaving on some parts of your neck.  I&#x27;ve read the other reviews, and, unlike some reviewers, I&#x27;ve noticed no quality issues; everything has performed as I would&#x27;ve expected a nicely engineered German product to do.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this razor if your skin has become irritated through the foam and razor technique, and if you want a nice, quick shave in the morning.</li>
            <li> The batteries in my Norelco (model 5885XL) gave out after about four years of usage.  Having been a Norelco user ever since I started shaving well over thirty years ago, I was a little wary of buying anything else.  I was going to buy another Norelco until this Braun caught my attention as its self-cleaning ability was attractive; I found the cleaning of the Norelco messy.  Changing over has been a positive experience. The Braun 7680 is pricey but after about a month of usage I have found that the price is worth it for several reasons: &lt;br /&gt;1. It provides a closer shave than the Norelco.  I thought the Norelco did okay but perhaps because the foil head of the Braun is thinner, it can provide an even closer cut.&lt;BR&gt;2. When the shaver cuts any hair there is a distinct buzz to the sound.  I now know if I have shaved the area clean from that sound.  This is especially helpful in the morning when I have just gotten up and not fully awake when shaving.&lt;BR&gt;3. The trimmer works much better than any of the Norelcos I have ever had.  I dont know why none of the Norelco trimmer function ever worked well but the Braun trims it cleanly.  The Norelcos did such a weak job that I always had to use a separate blade razor to trim sideburns when I used them.  Here also because the Braun is a straight edge with its foil system, its easier to cut in the sideburns area versus the rotary, which if one is not careful could leave a circular cut on the sides.&lt;BR&gt;4. The cleaning system actually works.  No mess and easy to set up.  The stand for the cleaning system takes up a bit of space though and looks like a rocket launcher but it achieved my desire of not having to clean out all that hair mess every week or so from the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The LCD screen is functional but I especially like the feature about how long the last shave was, it is reassuring to see when the amount of time I used to shave was not too long.  The blue light indicator for charging or cleaning is aesthetically pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback so far is the position of the power button on the shaver.  The shaver has three settings, one for fixed head, one for swivel head and the third to activate the trimmer.  The button is loose enough and located in such a position that it is a little too easy to change inadvertently the settings from 1 to 2.  It doesnt detract from the shaving process but is just a slight bit annoying.  The setting for the trimmer is far enough on the setting that an accidental activation of the trimmer is not likely though.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will just have to see how long the battery lasts on this.  I dont see why the makers dont have a replaceable batter for these units.</li>
            <li> Throw away those razors and creams for ever!  After using razors for years, I was sick and tired of the hassle, mess, and uncomfortability of it.   I am very clean cut and so I always figured electric wouldn&#x27;t do the job.  So, I went all out and tried this shaver.  But, to my surprise, it gets it as close as a razor, and of course with out the hassle, mess, ad trouble. This shavor is like heaven... works wonderfully. Seems like it will last a long time.  There can&#x27;t be another electric shaver that works as well.  Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just received my 7680 today.  It replaced my Braun 6520 which actually still works after about 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;Everything you have read in the reviews below especially the PRO&#x27;s is absolutely true.  I was amazed the first time I used it.  I had no idea the difference between my old 6520 and the 7680 would be so monumental.  With my old 6520 it would always miss hairs on certain parts of my neck.  I no longer have this problem.  Not only is the shave twice as close but it cleaned up my entire face.  This was not possible with the 6520 on my face.  It&#x27;s seriously as good as shaving with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station not only cool looking but extremely functional.  No more cleaning out my razor in the sink with that little brush.  The cleaning cartridges are only 5$ each and last a month if you clean daily.  That&#x27;s aprox 15 cents a day.  Definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the 150$.</li>
            <li> Braun came out with a next generation series after this one (New version has irregular pattern on screen.). The newer one is easier to use and charge; it uses the cleaner fluid more economically and seems to be built to last. This version I am reviewing is likewise built to last and shaves closest of any shaver I&#x27;ve used (closer than even the newer version). However, the mechanism of the re-charger/cleaner device broke after a couple of years (I nurtured it with velcro for a while.). Therefore, I bought this replacement set as back-up. If a simple good shave is what you want, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Nice product, use it every day and still running like a champ!</li>
            <li> This is one of the finest of the Shavers that I have come accross. I have been hunting for a shaver that will have a display for informations. It does gives you the info. you want, and comes with this trendy charger set.&lt;BR&gt;  Wonderful, is a single word that I could able to think about this Braun 7680 Syncro System Logic Saver.</li>
            <li> I have used the Braun electric razor and find that it does clean the blades very well.  In addition, it has a great battery life and is packaged very well.  However, it does not do a very good job of shaving.  I found myself spending more time shaving in the morning and not getting a good shave. I would then have to follow-up my shave with a regular blade, to clean-up the patches it missed.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Excellent at cleaning the razor. Bad at actually shaving your face.</li>
            <li> Believe it! This Braun Shaver (7680) will give you the best and closest shave you&#x27;ve ever gotten from ANY electric shaver. As a matter of fact, I would compare it favorably to a razor shave. I&#x27;ve used electrics for 25 plus years, now, and I&#x27;ve been more satisfied with this Braun than any other. For the record, I&#x27;ve previously owned a Ronson, a Remington, 2 Norelco&#x27;s and one other older model Braun. I thought my last Braun was unbeatable, but the 7680 beats it easily. The automatic cleaning feature is great, too. It&#x27;s so nice not to have to take the shaver apart and brush out the whiskers. After it has run through its cleaning process, it&#x27;s so clean, it&#x27;s incredible! Buy it! You&#x27;ll never regret it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year now and I have gotten so sick of it that I&#x27;m finally replacing it. I felt bad having spent so much money on it. Having to replace the cartridges all the time is a complete gimmick too. Expect to spend 10 dollars a month on just cartridges. The foil just broke on me the other day too. I&#x27;m not about to spend any more money on this thing.</li>
            <li> Tested three shavers and wet/dry Panasonic ES8092NC worked the best for me.  Please check reviews under the Panasonic ES8092NC and ES8095NC.  The Braun shaved very well also, but the Panasonic was somewhat closer.  And, without the gizmo/toy/$ to clean it.  Just water and soap - and it works.  &lt;br /&gt;For the Braun - well built and close shave, but one star off for the decorative/size aspect, second star off for the addtional maintenance cost and noise (which apparently increases with time).&lt;br /&gt;The third shaver was a differnt story - Mr. Bond&#x27;s Norelco 8894XL Spectra.  The battery died at the end of the second shave!  Dead - period!  I know two days is not much, and that I am supposed to wait to two weeks for conclusions (what is the hair &#x60;brain&#x27; science behind this anyway?).  However, it worked poorly for me from the beginning.</li>
            <li> the CLEAN and CHARGE center broke after only a couple of months, wont stay down which from what i&#x27;ve read is a known problem, there are even repair centers for it.  bad design.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in many years but this one is great. It really cuts close and better than my Gillette razor.    The only problem I have is finding replacement cleaning cartridges. I would like to order them on-line if there is someplace to do that.</li>
            <li> After using this shaver on a daily basis since January 2003 I thought I would finally write a review.  The shaver itself is very good.  I would have to say the shave is about the same as the 5 year old 5000 series \\&quot;syncro\\&quot; Braun it replaced, which is very good.  The display shows the battery life and you can push the button to show the last shave time as well as the cutter block number.  I&#x27;m a gadget person and like the feature but if you are looking to save a few bucks the lower priced units without the LCD would probably be a good choice.    The self cleaning part: I was skeptical when I first bought it but this sucker really works.  It cleans better - way better, than I can clean it by hand and it is sanitary.  I got about 5-6 weeks out of a cleaning cartridge.  (...)  It makes about the same noise as the razor running on and off during a 15 minute cleaning cycle.      NOW THE CATCH.  If you read other reviews you will read about the problems with the cleaning unit.  What happens is the arm on the clean and charge unit stops locking on to the razor.  Mine worked great for 18 months until this issue surfaced.  The good thing is that the razor has a 2 year warranty.  I called the toll free service number and found a service place in my area.  The people in the store were very helpful and very familiar with this issue.  They fixed it while I waited at no charge!  So all was well, until it broke again a couple of days ago, 2 months after the original repair.  I brought it in again and they are going to fix it for no charge but didnt have the part, so I have to wait and am temporarily without the cleaning unit (It can be charged without it or run off the cord)  I really miss it!  I cant confim this but the person in the shop said they are Braun is working on a fix for the problem. Hopefully it will done before my warranty runs out.  I would give this 4 1/2 stars if it wasnt for the difficulties with the cleaning unit</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers for decades. Literally. My previous one, a 6550, traveled with me all over the US on business trips for almost 10 years. Finally, I decided to replace it with a newer shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Braun 7680 is the best Braun I&#x27;ve had to date. It shaves close and comfortably, and the clean/charge base is excellant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have a very coarse beard, which is tough on electric shavers. The 7680 handles it easily, even if I skip a day on the weekend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Best shaver I&#x27;ve owned, actually.</li>
            <li> I bought TWO of these shavers over the period of a year. While the shaver itself is the best on the market, the cleaning mechanism does not work as it should. The spring latch breaks and will not allow you to charge or clean the shaver.  Read some of the other reviews. I&#x27;m not the only one experiencing this obvious design flaw. I was very dissappointed and have returned it to Amazon.com. I also called Braun customer service to register a complaint. The engineers on this product need to go back to the drawing board. They have the potential for a great product.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Would buy it again and give it as a gift.  The price was right and that is my story.</li>
            <li> This shaver has performed perfectly since I purchased it.  It is so easy to clean and with top notch replacement parts, will last for years and years.  The battery lasts for weeks without a charge.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the coolest shaver ever when I saw the sleek and sexy commercial back when I was a kid. I have not kept up with electric shaving technology but I know that Braun is a trustworthy name. I like all of the features of this Braun 7680 Syncro shaver. I bought the refurbished version and saved a ton of money, and it has worked perfectly for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a small display that gives you cues as to when to oil the coil and how much charge is left in the shaver. I like that you can charge the shaver and then don&#x27;t have to use the cable until the battery is completely depleted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating head seems like a gimmick to me. I have observed myself while shaving and have not noticed the head of the shaver pivoting when changing directions on my face. It seems like a good idea in theory but I think that a static head is just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extendable feature is powerful and I have used it to shave my legs a few times and my armpits. Don&#x27;t judge me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this shaver included the entire package: recharge cable, storage case, and lubricating oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the color scheme and it is powerful shaver. No shaver is perfect and does not shave properly the first swipe over your face, but this one seems to cut fairly cleanly and takes only a few brushes against my cheeks. It should serve me for years to come. No need to keep up with the latest technology when electric shavers hit their peak years ago anyway. Anything else is probably just a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Ken Flemming&lt;br /&gt;Author, How to Get a Job in Video Games</li>
