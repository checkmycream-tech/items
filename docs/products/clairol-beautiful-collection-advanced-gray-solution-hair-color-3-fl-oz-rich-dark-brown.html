    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Especially handy if you are mixing 2 colors together</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good for this.</li>
            <li>I been using Clariol&#x27;s Beautiful collection for years with no reaction.  </li>
            <li>not so great</li>
            <li>This was great and and at a great price, it is also better than the hairdresser uses on my hair.</li>
            <li>It took me a year to find a good prduct like this.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I do not get this effect with the Clairol Beautiful Collection Advanced Gray Solution Semi-permanent Color, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the root touch did which is amazing to me</li>
            <li>even the hairdresser said he was going to buy some for his own stock, because it covered the gray so well.</li>
            <li>This method covers my grays beautifully and the dye does not fade quickly.</li>
            <li>This method covers my grays beautifully and the dye does not fade quickly.</li>
            <li>Finally found a product with excellent gray hair coverage, is amazing, like a permanent but non.</li>
            <li>And if you have thinning hair, you better leave the permanent stuff alone if you want to keep your hair.</li>
            <li>which is more then is recommended</li>
            <li>I love this dye.</li>
            <li>It takes me about 10 minutes to apply the dye all over my head, and then I leave it on for 20 minutes more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to touch it again until I need to touch up the roots, and sometimes all I do is cover the roots on the top of my head where most of the gray is.</li>
            <li>It takes me about 10 minutes to apply the dye all over my head, and then I leave it on for 20 minutes more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to touch it again until I need to touch up the roots, and sometimes all I do is cover the roots on the top of my head where most of the gray is.</li>
            <li>so I tried the Gray formula this time and was more</li>
            <li>Having seen the AGS product I thought it might cover the gray better.  </li>
            <li>Not red reflects in my hair very happy</li>
            <li>It can irritate the scalp for sure.</li>
            <li>Once that is done the application is easy.</li>
            <li>(I have light ash brown hair).</li>
            <li>I mixed the darkest brown with a bit of the mahogany and got a great color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.... does not contain peroxide or ammonia, very gentle for damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I have found that touching up my roots with this product between salon visits is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;Clairol Beautiful Collection Semi-Permanent Hair Color - Wine Brown or Black\\&quot; for a few years now, with more grays appearing I was very excited last week when I saw \\&quot;Clairol Beautiful AGS - Midnight Black\\&quot; even though it was a couple dollars more than the former product.  </li>
            <li>I sure wish they&#x27;d bring back Loving Care as that was truly a coloring you could use without any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>I like the semi-permanent color, since it gives a uniform color without special attention to the roots.</li>
            <li>I use this product to color my roots between full coloring jobs.</li>
            <li>It was also challenging and time consuming to wash out, mainly from my scalp and my temple/forehead/earlobe areas.  </li>
            <li>and I was trying to save my long hair by using root touch up every couple of weeks { nice and easy]  </li>
            <li>have used light golden chestnut on its own, but it&#x27;s too red for me.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, liked the color, covered the gray - which is actually pretty white.</li>
            <li>you have a clear recyclable water bottle with the squirt top - use it.  </li>
            <li>but I really felt it washed out rather quickly</li>
            <li>This product goes on easy with no harsh ammonia or chemical smells.  </li>
            <li>I tried this first mahogany red brown color just on my part with my mostly gray hair   </li>
            <li>I will most likely have to do this every 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I already used it and went perfect, only that the next time I will get one no so dark, maybe you can send me a chart of the colors available.</li>
            <li>YOU MUST WASH YOUR HAIR FIRST, otherwise the color will not take.</li>
            <li>She also has an allergy to most dyes, and this is close to the only option.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really wish I could, but unfortunately, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I mixed colors the golden chestnut and rich dark brown and got a nice medium golden brown</li>
            <li>mix 2 parts light golden chestnut with 1 part rich dark brown.</li>
            <li>The only hair color I use very gentle on the hair and covers the grey for a good month before having to touch up</li>
            <li>Covers simply and well with nice results, but sure is messy to apply, and it rubs off all over things, despite rinsing well after applying.</li>
            <li>The red does fade within 4-5 days so that the grays are more blonde, but ultimately it&#x27;s too warm a color for me even after it fades.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I did not have any problem with the color washing out too fast.</li>
            <li>bought this for my mother-in-law after a whole lot of her complaining about the dye from the hair salon not doing the job.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t grow that fast</li>
            <li>and I was very worried about how I was going to cover</li>
            <li>AND after all of that, there were still some very noticeable grays.  </li>
            <li>I am caucasian but have a lot of dark brown, very curly, fine hair that gets dry and damaged very easily.  </li>
            <li>My hair dresser applied the color as she normally does and the \\&quot;Clairol Beautiful AGS\\&quot; was noticeably messier, we left it on the usual 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re buying dark brown leave it on for 30 minutes or more to your liking.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it was the dyes they were using or the particular stylist.</li>
            <li>it turned too red but faded to a nice color after a few washes read some other reviews that talked of mixing the colors which  I did half golden chestnut and half dark brown got a lovely medium golden brown which has faded with each wash but still looks nice                             </li>
            <li>Even after the wash out she used a wet towel dampened with color removal products to clean my face/hair line.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my hair is just very sensitive to the darker permanent dyes.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time and it will be my last.</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive scalp this is not for you!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried rich dark brown on its own, but it&#x27;s too dark for me, and I find the grays don&#x27;t stay covered as long or as well.</li>
            <li>hope this helps someone else.tnut with 1 part rich dark brown.</li>
            <li>I bought dark brown and it was a true brown and turned my beard light brown instead of black.  </li>
            <li>This formula is gentle enough to use when you have a chemical straightener or if your hair is natural.  </li>
            <li>Looks natural to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried highlights and lowlights, as well as all-over permanent dyes in both lighter and darker shades than my natural color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is still a bit too dark at first, but I prefer this to using permanent dye, because the semi does fade to something closer to my natural color, and it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair as much.</li>
            <li>The color looks natural both inside and outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>started with the non-graying product (The Clairol Professional in the brown bottle)</li>
            <li>far I have yet to find a semi permanent hair dye that can completely cover gray.</li>
            <li>Also, with permanent color I always had to go to a salon, since my hair is too curly, thick, and long (about to my shoulder-blades) to apply a permanent dye on my own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s maybe a little too cool for me</li>
            <li>Even getting professional color done, I always had the problem that the overlapping section between previously dyed and new growth was too dark, whereas the newly dyed section was too light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use weekly is necessary.</li>
            <li>hair is more manageable too - less frizzy, and I can use less product to control the curls (I don&#x27;t straighten it, but I don&#x27;t like it to be frizzy).</li>
            <li>Straight, not fine, not thick.</li>
            <li>However, I would not use it to color my whole head of hair as the coverage is not really thorough enough for that.</li>
            <li>This has no busines calling itself advanced gray solution.&lt;br /&gt;There are other semi permanent hair dyes out there that produce the same results and in less time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I figure I can always reapply and leave it in for longer, but if it&#x27;s too dark, then I have to reapply on the whole head.</li>

            <li>but I am feeling very let down by Clairol for taking the product I used to use off the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only do the whole head every third time, on average.</li>

            <li> I only do the whole head every third time, on average.</li>
            <li> Left it on for about 30 minutes and it covered the grey in my beard well.</li>
            <li> ALSO, my scalp was left very dry and itchy as a result of this.</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair, and this washed out within a couple of weeks, faded to red, and now I am back to gray streaks peaking through.</li>
            <li> The only concern that I had is, I read on other semi color products that if I didn&#x27;t want too dark of a BLACK on my beard that didn&#x27;t look natural, go a shade lighter.</li>
            <li> However, I wear it dark brown with red highlights.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product  as if it were the old Clairol product, being careful to cover  the hair with a plastic cap and then wash the color out as I did in the past.</li>
            <li> hubby suggested  time to go gray not ready for that</li>
            <li> /&gt;DO NOT rinse all of the color out of your hair if you can - try to leave a little in and in the next few days do not wash it and the color will absorb more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The application is a little complicated since it requires freshly shampooed hair that has been towel dried.</li>
            <li> However, after the 25 minutes my gray hair roots were  reddish and not the dark brown promised.  </li>
            <li> I have average hair.</li>
            <li> I used dark brown which is the color of my hair.</li>
            <li> Less chemicals and something I can use at home without messing up.  </li>
            <li> I should have bought the black.  </li>
            <li> Put color in bottle with a little conditioner and it is easier to apply.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m 60, and my hair is completely white. However, I wear it dark brown with red highlights. I have found that touching up my roots with this product between salon visits is exactly what I needed. And no damage is done.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.... does not contain peroxide or ammonia, very gentle for damaged hair. And if you have thinning hair, you better leave the permanent stuff alone if you want to keep your hair. Also find a shampoo without sulfates or parabens , saw palmetto helps too.</li>
            <li> Receive it fashionable time</li>
            <li> I really like this I will be using this from now on I have 85 percent gray hair  which is more then is recommended and I was trying to save my long hair by using root touch up every couple of weeks { nice and easy]  but after a few months my hair got fried from the root touch up and  hair started breaking off big time I tried going with out coloring and hated the gray roots hubby suggested  time to go gray not ready for that I tried some temporary rinses which was a real mess and the color not so great I tried this first mahogany red brown color just on my part with my mostly gray hair   it turned too red but faded to a nice color after a few washes read some other reviews that talked of mixing the colors which  I did half golden chestnut and half dark brown got a lovely medium golden brown which has faded with each wash but still looks nice                             I will most likely have to do this every 3 weeks this is actually lasting longer then the root touch did which is amazing to me I mixed colors the golden chestnut and rich dark brown and got a nice medium golden brown</li>
            <li> I already used it and went perfect, only that the next time I will get one no so dark, maybe you can send me a chart of the colors available.</li>
            <li> It took me a year to find a good prduct like this.I had no allergy reaction to this product.It,s biggest downfall is there is not a variety of colors.It,s a little messy but color holds up well.I did not have any problem with the color washing out too fast.Looks natural to me.</li>
            <li> I love this dye. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It works so well for me that I can&#x27;t believe I ever tried anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had enough gray hair since I was in my mid-thirties to want to cover it. I&#x27;ve tried highlights and lowlights, as well as all-over permanent dyes in both lighter and darker shades than my natural color. This semi-permanent dye outdoes them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used light golden chestnut on its own, but it&#x27;s too red for me. The red does fade within 4-5 days so that the grays are more blonde, but ultimately it&#x27;s too warm a color for me even after it fades. I&#x27;ve also tried rich dark brown on its own, but it&#x27;s too dark for me, and I find the grays don&#x27;t stay covered as long or as well. It&#x27;s maybe a little too cool for me (I have light ash brown hair). What I like to do is mix the two. See \\&quot;my method\\&quot; below for details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is still a bit too dark at first, but I prefer this to using permanent dye, because the semi does fade to something closer to my natural color, and it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair as much. Also, with permanent color I always had to go to a salon, since my hair is too curly, thick, and long (about to my shoulder-blades) to apply a permanent dye on my own. Even getting professional color done, I always had the problem that the overlapping section between previously dyed and new growth was too dark, whereas the newly dyed section was too light. Every salon I ever went to had this problem, so I don&#x27;t think it was the dyes they were using or the particular stylist. Maybe my hair is just very sensitive to the darker permanent dyes. I do not get this effect with the Clairol Beautiful Collection Advanced Gray Solution Semi-permanent Color, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is more manageable too - less frizzy, and I can use less product to control the curls (I don&#x27;t straighten it, but I don&#x27;t like it to be frizzy). The color looks natural both inside and outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix 2 parts light golden chestnut with 1 part rich dark brown. I leave it on for 30 minutes from the time I begin coloring to when I wash it out. It takes me about 10 minutes to apply the dye all over my head, and then I leave it on for 20 minutes more. This means that some of the hair only has the dye on for 20 minutes, while the section where I started will get 30. I have not found this to be a problem. There is no unevenness that I can detect. This method covers my grays beautifully and the dye does not fade quickly. I don&#x27;t need to touch it again until I need to touch up the roots, and sometimes all I do is cover the roots on the top of my head where most of the gray is. I only do the whole head every third time, on average. If it has faded a lot and I&#x27;m just doing roots, I only leave it in for 20 minutes after I finish applying. (I figure I can always reapply and leave it in for longer, but if it&#x27;s too dark, then I have to reapply on the whole head. I have left it in for only 15 minutes before, but that is not enough time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone else.tnut with 1 part rich dark brown.

            <li> This product was specifically for gray hair and instructions were to use for 25 minutes.  I did not want to go over the time limit because I did not not know what the results would be. However, after the 25 minutes my gray hair roots were  reddish and not the dark brown promised.  This product is supposedly \\&quot;for professionals\\&quot; and maybe there are things I do not know, since I have always colored my hair at home--but I am feeling very let down by Clairol for taking the product I used to use off the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am revising this review to note that I continue to use this product because there just is nothing else that I can use at home that is similar.  However, I have discovered that keeping it on hair for a longer time (about 55 minutes to an hour) does help.  My hair is hard to color, I believe,and there are references for this product and \\&quot;relaxed hair\\&quot; which mine is not.  I have been using this product  as if it were the old Clairol product, being careful to cover  the hair with a plastic cap and then wash the color out as I did in the past. Still, the color obtained has reddish overtones.  I have discovered a brush-on hair color powder that I can use to retouch as the color starts to wash out after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I like the semi-permanent color, since it gives a uniform color without special attention to the roots. I color every 2 weeks. The application is a little complicated since it requires freshly shampooed hair that has been towel dried. Once that is done the application is easy. I leave it on for only 12 minutes to avoid having the ends darker than recently treated roots.</li>
            <li> Less chemicals and something I can use at home without messing up.  YOU MUST WASH YOUR HAIR FIRST, otherwise the color will not take.</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair, and this washed out within a couple of weeks, faded to red, and now I am back to gray streaks peaking through.</li>
            <li> Covers simply and well with nice results, but sure is messy to apply, and it rubs off all over things, despite rinsing well after applying. My pillow cases are a disaster. Not a good choice for any drought stricken parts of the country, due to the amount of rinsing and cleaning involved.</li>
            <li> I use this product to color my roots between full coloring jobs. It&#x27;s very good for this. However, I would not use it to color my whole head of hair as the coverage is not really thorough enough for that.</li>
            <li> bought this for my mother-in-law after a whole lot of her complaining about the dye from the hair salon not doing the job. She also has an allergy to most dyes, and this is close to the only option. I thought sh3 was being finicky,  but even the hairdresser said he was going to buy some for his own stock, because it covered the gray so well.</li>
            <li> This formula is gentle enough to use when you have a chemical straightener or if your hair is natural.  It&#x27;s gentle enough to use weekly is necessary.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I was sad when it became so hard to find it in the stores.  Please let the company know that the product is still needed by some of us ladies.</li>
            <li> I am caucasian but have a lot of dark brown, very curly, fine hair that gets dry and damaged very easily.  Any haircolor with ammonia or peroxide is out for me - it fries my hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t grow that fast so it&#x27;s a big problem for me.  I am 42 and now I&#x27;m starting to get gray and I was very worried about how I was going to cover the gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with the non-graying product (The Clairol Professional in the brown bottle) but I really felt it washed out rather quickly so I tried the Gray formula this time and was more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to offer some tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a clear recyclable water bottle with the squirt top - use it.  Put color in bottle with a little conditioner and it is easier to apply.  Especially handy if you are mixing 2 colors together (see tip below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO leave the product on for 30 minutes - it doesn&#x27;t damage and it needs that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you rinse it out \\&quot;wash\\&quot; it with a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT rinse all of the color out of your hair if you can - try to leave a little in and in the next few days do not wash it and the color will absorb more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO expect it to rinse out a bit every time you wash your hair - the water will be colored!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO play with shades - I mixed the darkest brown with a bit of the mahogany and got a great color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT mix the brown bottle colors with the gray bottle colors - ONLY mix the gray color / gray cover bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT jump into a pool after or even after that if you still have color in your hair - it will run into the water and freak people out!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy hair coloring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please give me tips if you have any!!</li>
            <li> This was great and and at a great price, it is also better than the hairdresser uses on my hair. I am sticking to this one.</li>
            <li> I have average hair. Straight, not fine, not thick. Just regular hair. I have gray hair at my temples only and that is all I wanted to dye. This product tinted them to a blondish champagne color. I used dark brown which is the color of my hair. I followed the intrstuctions. I&#x27;m not sure why this didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m disappointed. This has no busines calling itself advanced gray solution.&lt;br /&gt;There are other semi permanent hair dyes out there that produce the same results and in less time.&lt;br /&gt;So far I have yet to find a semi permanent hair dye that can completely cover gray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;Clairol Beautiful Collection Semi-Permanent Hair Color - Wine Brown or Black\\&quot; for a few years now, with more grays appearing I was very excited last week when I saw \\&quot;Clairol Beautiful AGS - Midnight Black\\&quot; even though it was a couple dollars more than the former product.  My hair dresser applied the color as she normally does and the \\&quot;Clairol Beautiful AGS\\&quot; was noticeably messier, we left it on the usual 30 minutes.  It was also challenging and time consuming to wash out, mainly from my scalp and my temple/forehead/earlobe areas.  Even after the wash out she used a wet towel dampened with color removal products to clean my face/hair line.  AND after all of that, there were still some very noticeable grays.  This product was like a charcoal pencil, it colored my scalp (and skin) better/more than it colored my hair.  ALSO, my scalp was left very dry and itchy as a result of this. Even my nails got &#x27;dirty&#x27; from my black stained scalp throughout the week when I scratched my itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really wish I could, but unfortunately, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This product goes on easy with no harsh ammonia or chemical smells.  Left it on for about 30 minutes and it covered the grey in my beard well. The only concern that I had is, I read on other semi color products that if I didn&#x27;t want too dark of a BLACK on my beard that didn&#x27;t look natural, go a shade lighter. I bought dark brown and it was a true brown and turned my beard light brown instead of black.  I should have bought the black.  If you&#x27;re buying dark brown leave it on for 30 minutes or more to your liking.  It works!</li>
            <li> I been using Clariol&#x27;s Beautiful collection for years with no reaction.  Having seen the AGS product I thought it might cover the gray better.  Ordered it and decided to do the 48 hour skin test, lucky I did as I had a horrible reaction and only have an itchy raised spot on my inside arm instead of all over my head.  Threw the bottle away.</li>
            <li> I sure wish they&#x27;d bring back Loving Care as that was truly a coloring you could use without any skin irritation.  But this is a Big appointment.  I had an itchy skin reaction.  PLUS it doesn&#x27;t even last 24 hours before the coloring wears off.</li>
            <li> Finally found a product with excellent gray hair coverage, is amazing, like a permanent but non. Not red reflects in my hair very happy</li>
            <li> makes hair feel silky</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time and it will be my last. If you have a sensitive scalp this is not for you! It can irritate the scalp for sure. Pass on this one. Doesn&#x27;t cover gray well either.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, liked the color, covered the gray - which is actually pretty white. Wish it came with gloves.</li>
            <li> Items as Described. Thank you AAA+++</li>
            <li> The only hair color I use very gentle on the hair and covers the grey for a good month before having to touch up</li>
