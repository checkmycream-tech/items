            <li>I have been looking for a product that could do what they claim they can do, and many times I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>This shaver did an excellent job leaving his nose hairless and him with the ability to breathe better.  </li>
            <li>Nice product !</li>
            <li>Wahl 5545-400 is a good item to have around.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality and am expecting to have years of use.</li>
            <li>For this price I haven&#x27;t found anything even close to as good.  </li>
            <li>Spend $25 and get a good one.</li>
            <li>Its good quality and affordable which is why i bought it.</li>
            <li>It holds up to all of my manscaping duties and has a good grip on it.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>It was a good price and works as promised.</li>
            <li>Wahl makes good quality clippers</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED .</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>They Eye brow trimmer guide does nothing (maybe a good thing) it might work if you have some hellishly bushy eyebrows that stand up on their own like a garden rake though?  </li>
            <li>Had many of these types of groomers!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It came exactly as pictured and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>love that it is waterproof!</li>
            <li>Really nice tool.  </li>
            <li>I also own Wahl hair clipper.</li>
            <li>Nice ergonomic grip.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for the price and works very well</li>
            <li>Nice set of attachments come with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The nose hair trimmer part isn&#x27;t as good as some others, and I haven&#x27;t yet tried the pen detail trimmer head, but I&#x27;m sure it works</li>
            <li>Effective</li>
            <li>Works well, good price, can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this handy tool for a couple months</li>
            <li>nice product.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Would have been nice if they had provided a case to keep trimmer and all attachments together</li>
            <li>nice product.</li>
            <li>You can run the nose and detail trimmer under water to clean, but don&#x27;t rinse the trimmer blades under water, brush clean and oil those every 6 months for best performance and life.  </li>
            <li>Works great, super price.</li>
            <li>very good ,all attachments are very functional, prefer over chargable model</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great price, nice item, comfortable, doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs, cuts they nicely, quickly and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way to go Wahl!!!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best!</li>
            <li>I dont think the quality is good  cheap</li>
            <li>works good, I am able to trim the areas of my ears and nose easily.</li>
            <li>Great value and does exactly as I needed it to do...</li>
            <li>Good service and not a bad price either.  </li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>I have had better luck with the Conair brand but thought I&#x27;d give Wahl a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lives up to the Wahl reputation for performance, I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Its okay.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t store attachments in one spot and is just ok.</li>
            <li>is quite handsome but plagued by a lavish and unrestrained unibrow (think Muppet).</li>
            <li>Although many brands claim that they won&#x27;t yank the hair</li>
            <li>, I say this to point out that this product is much more durable than others.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely totally recommend as best battery trimmer choice to purchase without reservation.</li>
            <li>and it was better in that aspect.</li>
            <li>I wish i had something more helpful to contribute to this review</li>
            <li>Favorite trimmer for &amp;#34;peach fuzz.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>; This works great for women who just want to gently trim that &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; on your face, lips, or neck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li>If it did I would probably use it more often as I probably should</li>
            <li>Able to trim mustache, goatee and nose/ear .</li>
            <li>They fit nice.</li>
            <li>It is OK.  </li>
            <li>Well satisfied with price as well as quality of merchandise.  </li>
            <li>I love this one.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li>the AA battery has more power and it works as advertised,,</li>
            <li>but this one is much better and much more efficient.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for trimming my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and comfortable to use, and He&#x27;s very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It was a good buy ,the price was right and it works.</li>
            <li>This model works as great as the older Whal model I replaced.  </li>
            <li>This tool is doing a great job of sprucing me up, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>for the price pretty good deal ,works well</li>
            <li>quick ship nice product</li>
            <li>each of the 3 heads has their own specific use and does a great job of hair removal and trimming.</li>
            <li>The attachments are very useful and easy to change!</li>
            <li>It would be a lot better if they had made one that fit over any of the heads and provided a case or bag or something to hold the two heads not in use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than the girly one with the light I found at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>So far, so great.</li>
            <li>I have a Whal clipper for trimming my hair that is now 20 years old and still works great</li>
            <li>This is a good unit and from a really trusted brand name, delivered promptly</li>
            <li>grip and switch are good, and changing the heads is easy and fast and they lock into place</li>
            <li>Easy to use and versatile with the exchangeable heads.</li>
            <li>Clogs easily.</li>
            <li>the 3 heads are easy too change, even for a senior with arthritis.</li>
            <li>I like the handle, size, and easy on/off button, some others you have to twist.</li>
            <li>I have used it about a dozen times and the batteries are just as strong as the day I put them in.</li>
            <li>It has good feel in the hand, is easy to manipulate, and just plain works great.</li>
            <li>The three attachments attach easily and secure.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works fine although it does not cut the hair quite as close as I would like it.</li>
            <li>Replaced the battery and checked the connections: all fine.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>Item as described, shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>this is an excellent little clipper with lots of power.  </li>
            <li>It feels cheap, looks cheap and is cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but he is happy with its overall performance.</li>
            <li>I even get the feeling this one may last beyond what I have experienced with others.</li>
            <li>Cheap in price, and in looks.</li>
            <li>Too cheap to bother about returning,</li>
            <li>I liked the interchangeable parts and now he wants me to trim his neck hairs and shape his hair line up.  </li>
            <li>So happy I found this same one again on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Feels really light and cheap.</li>
            <li>But, so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>overall good product, much better than a comparable norelco and panasonic ear and nose trimmer.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for with the attachments I use most.</li>
            <li>When clean it works</li>
            <li>I have used beard trimmers, and I have to say, they are far more better than this.</li>
            <li>Then I tried to take it apart and clean it.</li>
            <li>Works good but needs different size eyebrow guides.</li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer locally 7-8 years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I had this same trimmer once before, loved it till it just came to the end of its life.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to remove and replace the attachments that come with it and the additional attachments give me more versatility than my old one.</li>
            <li>I love this thing to do super fast man grooming</li>
            <li>The difference between this one and my most recent (the Braun) is astonishing from the moment you turn it on and hear it run.</li>
            <li>A QUICK TRIM</li>
            <li>Trims very close and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>, I wanted something to trim my brows and the brow guard on this is perfect; not too short and not too long.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have this little device.</li>
            <li>great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>Powerful motor and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Not that powerful  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made, I broke a piece getting it out of the most unfriendly packing I have ever encountered,and weeks later, I have not attempted to use the &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times and so far it has worked great.</li>
            <li>strong at a consistent speed and at all angles&lt;br /&gt;Has 3 different attachments - Ear, Nose, Brow&lt;br /&gt;Easily removable top piece for cleaning</li>
            <li>Not that much more than others I have bought, but the quality of the device as well as the results gotten are so much better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li>My cat has particularly fine (small-diameter) fur, and this clipper will cut it fairly well but not magically.  </li>
            <li>And then you would have something blowing up right by your face and/or eyes.</li>
            <li>If anyone has it right they do.</li>
            <li>then again, you get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li>and they were about to die right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the new one now for about a month and the batteries are still going strong.</li>
            <li>Very loud and not as effective as my old Remington.</li>
            <li>Strong motor keeps facial hair clean and neat.</li>
            <li>works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t last forever, but for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>My first one lasted about three years</li>
            <li>I put a uploaded a photo of the box that shows you better what you will receive for this low price (even includes a AA battery).</li>
            <li>I will purchase another on my next Amazon order just to be sure I have another when this one wears out in about 5 years</li>
            <li>first one died after 2 years.</li>
            <li>First of all the battery that came in the pack was dead-as-a-door-nail</li>
            <li>Works more quietly than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Actually it sounds strong and power delivery is consistent - 5th star earned.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few weeks now and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It does a much better job than I could do with the flat straight attachment.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product, works very well!</li>
            <li>and this one has more attachments (my older one only has the eyebrow attachment).</li>
            <li>Grey nose hair be gone! :)</li>
            <li>but what I like so much better about this one is that the batteries last much longer than the on the older trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s buzzy, but not terribly loud, which is good because I actually bought this to remove mats and tangles from my cat&#x27;s fur.  </li>
            <li>Nostril attachment is to large.</li>
            <li>I was not surprised that the circular attachment did a better job with nose hairs than I could do with the flat attachment, but I was surprised it did a better job on ear hair as well.  </li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s hard to find a good combo unit like this.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my eyebrows, but it&#x27;s really bulky</li>
            <li>Reasonably price.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>and it really does the job.  </li>
            <li>multi-funciton and very well made.</li>
            <li>I really do like this product.</li>
            <li>and I am very greatful.</li>
            <li>but i really dont have much.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and non-abrasive.</li>
            <li>I really wish it came with a bag or case to hold the attachments.</li>
            <li>It works very well, and is quite versatile with its three heads.</li>
            <li>Very displeased.</li>
            <li>but you can obviously tell that it is cheaply made...</li>
            <li>Just really irked by the lack of thought going into the cap design.</li>
            <li>Treat it gently or the parts will break</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a need for the rest of the tools</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really recommend others to buy one.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I was used to the more cylindrical micro trimmers that were popular as of late (the ones who&#x27;s body is the same shape as the batter</li>
            <li>I got this one because the one I had made too much noise when trimming the ear.</li>
            <li>I really like this one.</li>
            <li>It does everything he wants without pulling or yanking .</li>
            <li>This appliance works really well.</li>
            <li>Once I started trimming them though, I realized how much neater it makes your appearance.</li>
            <li>No power and doesn&#x27;t cut very well</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>This product though, is really sketchy.</li>
            <li>Very God product.highly recommended</li>
            <li>This product trims really well.</li>
            <li>Wow this is a much better quality then the last one I had.</li>
            <li>The nose hair trimmer, again like the other head is a considerable amount larger than it&#x27;s competitors, great for large holes or farm animals maybe?  </li>
            <li>So if you can live with the shoddy appearance and cheap platic feel and the super loud motor, this product is a great buy at 7 odd dollars.</li>
            <li>Super strong and sturdy, To large for getting into small places.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for my sensitive skin &amp; durable enough to trim my guy between trips to the barber to maintain a nicely groomed look.</li>
            <li>This worked good for me for a little over a year, but I could never get all the hair out so it would run slow many times.</li>
            <li>since my old one did just fine and all it had was a permanent flat or straight end.  </li>
            <li>Quiet for the type motor and size --- quick and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This unit has a lot of power because it uses AA battery instead of AAA baterry, but the head of the unit is considerably larger than most of it&#x27;s competitors of the same design.  </li>
            <li>Same quality and have had them more than ten years.</li>
            <li>Simply does not work adequately.</li>
            <li>It always seems to me that the older trimmer was running out of steam almost as soon as I put new batteries in it.</li>
            <li>My husband loves his new 3-in-1 trimmer.</li>
            <li>Had it for about 2years and still works like new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other wahl products and although they aren&#x27;t super reliable and generally fall apart within an year or so, they tend to look and feel better as long as they are alive.</li>
            <li>so really this is more of an observation than a complaint.</li>
            <li>Sounds like a high powered adult toy, even from across the house.</li>
            <li>The first day it malfunctioned: it won&#x27;t turn on unless you remove the attachment and screw it back on a couple of times.</li>
            <li>The AA battery power is so much better than the AAA battery ones - not sure why as both are both 1.5V, but I suppose it&#x27;s like the 12V battery in your car -</li>
            <li>now I can replace my more expensive one knowing I have a better unit from Wahl at a lesser cost</li>
            <li>When my first one broke from dropping it too many times I tried 2 other different brands of similar trimmers and they did not measure up to this one.</li>
            <li>I have used Wahl trimmers in the past and have always been satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t look like and old man with 10ft hairs sticking out where they shouldn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>All in all a strong motor, lots of torque just a little over sized on the attachments.</li>
            <li>Works great for nose hair as well as keeping eyebrows under control with the precise fittings that keep you from cutting off too much or too little.</li>
            <li>Well worth the few bucks more not to be replacing trimmers every other month.</li>
            <li>this is the only one where that actually holds true.  </li>
            <li>The round nose trimmer head gets pretty warm after using it for a minute or two, and every-so-often will snag on my nose hair a little before it cuts it.</li>
            <li>and they were light weights, with little power and a unsatisfactory cut.  </li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>I use this product for touch up on my neck line and eyebrows (old guy) between barber visits</li>
            <li>I could only imagine what else he wants shaved.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses the old one to trim the hair on his ears.  </li>
            <li>It does the job and the attachments really add to work in different areas.</li>
            <li>In all not a very well finished product but does its job well and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>So as it turns out, the flat straight attachment is the one not getting used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cutting head design is very simple but needs to be cleaned under a hot water tap fairly often.</li>
            <li>The only one it doesn&#x27;t get hot with is the actual nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I even use it on my unwanted facial fuzz that has begun to appear as I get older.</li>
            <li>I certainly have no plans to let the device run all night long in my bedroom while I&#x27;m sleeping.  </li>
            <li>These however are high horsepower relative to those.</li>
            <li>The tiny motor is so powerful when operating that it feels like the unit is plugged into a wall socket instead of running on a single AA battery.  </li>
            <li>Interchangeable heads is a bonus, but I usually use the flat (wide/many teeth) for most jobs.</li>
            <li>Spend a few extra $$ and get one that will last:)</li>
            <li>the one with the more amps with always crank your car and the AA in this trim will always give the power you need but won&#x27;t get in the weak wimpy AAA powered ones.  </li>
            <li>No sharp edges and removes unwanted hair in ears, eyebrows, and nose.</li>
            <li>I dropped my old Wahl 5545 several times and it never broke.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and he has only used it once so far</li>
            <li>So far I have only used the rotary and the trimmer.</li>
            <li>but they would inevitably grind to a halt even with regular cleaning, oiling, and new batteries.</li>
            <li>He does have to go over his brows more than a few times to clip off a few stray hairs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Plastic is a little cheap looking, but then it&#x27;s less than $8</li>
            <li>Really neat little trimmer package.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that this little shaver had so much power.</li>
            <li>Use a rechargeable NIMH battery to keep the longterm cost down - batteries do seem  to last a decent amount of time.</li>

            <li> I have been looking for a product that could do what they claim they can do, and many times I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> This shaver did an excellent job leaving his nose hairless and him with the ability to breathe better.  </li>
            <li> Nice product !</li>
            <li> Wahl 5545-400 is a good item to have around.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality and am expecting to have years of use.</li>
            <li> For this price I haven&#x27;t found anything even close to as good.  </li>
            <li> Spend $25 and get a good one.</li>
            <li> Its good quality and affordable which is why i bought it.</li>
            <li> It holds up to all of my manscaping duties and has a good grip on it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> It was a good price and works as promised.</li>
            <li> Wahl makes good quality clippers</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED .</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> They Eye brow trimmer guide does nothing (maybe a good thing) it might work if you have some hellishly bushy eyebrows that stand up on their own like a garden rake though?  </li>
            <li> Had many of these types of groomers!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It came exactly as pictured and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> love that it is waterproof!</li>
            <li> Really nice tool.  </li>
            <li> I also own Wahl hair clipper.</li>
            <li> Nice ergonomic grip.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for the price and works very well</li>
            <li> Nice set of attachments come with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The nose hair trimmer part isn&#x27;t as good as some others, and I haven&#x27;t yet tried the pen detail trimmer head, but I&#x27;m sure it works</li>
            <li> Effective</li>
            <li> Works well, good price, can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this handy tool for a couple months</li>
            <li> nice product.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Would have been nice if they had provided a case to keep trimmer and all attachments together</li>
            <li> nice product.</li>
            <li> You can run the nose and detail trimmer under water to clean, but don&#x27;t rinse the trimmer blades under water, brush clean and oil those every 6 months for best performance and life.  </li>
            <li> Works great, super price.</li>
            <li> very good ,all attachments are very functional, prefer over chargable model</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great price, nice item, comfortable, doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs, cuts they nicely, quickly and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way to go Wahl!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best!</li>
            <li> I dont think the quality is good  cheap</li>
            <li> works good, I am able to trim the areas of my ears and nose easily.</li>
            <li> Great value and does exactly as I needed it to do...</li>
            <li> Good service and not a bad price either.  </li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> I have had better luck with the Conair brand but thought I&#x27;d give Wahl a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lives up to the Wahl reputation for performance, I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Its okay.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t store attachments in one spot and is just ok.</li>
            <li> is quite handsome but plagued by a lavish and unrestrained unibrow (think Muppet).</li>
            <li> Although many brands claim that they won&#x27;t yank the hair</li>
            <li> , I say this to point out that this product is much more durable than others.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely totally recommend as best battery trimmer choice to purchase without reservation.</li>
            <li> and it was better in that aspect.</li>
            <li> I wish i had something more helpful to contribute to this review</li>
            <li> Favorite trimmer for &amp;#34;peach fuzz.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> ; This works great for women who just want to gently trim that &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; on your face, lips, or neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li> If it did I would probably use it more often as I probably should</li>
            <li> Able to trim mustache, goatee and nose/ear .</li>
            <li> They fit nice.</li>
            <li> It is OK.  </li>
            <li> Well satisfied with price as well as quality of merchandise.  </li>
            <li> I love this one.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li> the AA battery has more power and it works as advertised,,</li>
            <li> but this one is much better and much more efficient.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it for trimming my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and comfortable to use, and He&#x27;s very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It was a good buy ,the price was right and it works.</li>
            <li> This model works as great as the older Whal model I replaced.  </li>
            <li> This tool is doing a great job of sprucing me up, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> for the price pretty good deal ,works well</li>
            <li> quick ship nice product</li>
            <li> each of the 3 heads has their own specific use and does a great job of hair removal and trimming.</li>
            <li> The attachments are very useful and easy to change!</li>
            <li> It would be a lot better if they had made one that fit over any of the heads and provided a case or bag or something to hold the two heads not in use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better than the girly one with the light I found at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> So far, so great.</li>
            <li> I have a Whal clipper for trimming my hair that is now 20 years old and still works great</li>
            <li> This is a good unit and from a really trusted brand name, delivered promptly</li>
            <li> grip and switch are good, and changing the heads is easy and fast and they lock into place</li>
            <li> Easy to use and versatile with the exchangeable heads.</li>
            <li> Clogs easily.</li>
            <li> the 3 heads are easy too change, even for a senior with arthritis.</li>
            <li> I like the handle, size, and easy on/off button, some others you have to twist.</li>
            <li> I have used it about a dozen times and the batteries are just as strong as the day I put them in.</li>
            <li> It has good feel in the hand, is easy to manipulate, and just plain works great.</li>
            <li> The three attachments attach easily and secure.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine although it does not cut the hair quite as close as I would like it.</li>
            <li> Replaced the battery and checked the connections: all fine.</li>
            <li> and it seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> Item as described, shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> this is an excellent little clipper with lots of power.  </li>
            <li> It feels cheap, looks cheap and is cheap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> but he is happy with its overall performance.</li>
            <li> I even get the feeling this one may last beyond what I have experienced with others.</li>
            <li> Cheap in price, and in looks.</li>
            <li> Too cheap to bother about returning,</li>
            <li> I liked the interchangeable parts and now he wants me to trim his neck hairs and shape his hair line up.  </li>
            <li> So happy I found this same one again on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Feels really light and cheap.</li>
            <li> But, so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> overall good product, much better than a comparable norelco and panasonic ear and nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for with the attachments I use most.</li>
            <li> When clean it works</li>
            <li> I have used beard trimmers, and I have to say, they are far more better than this.</li>
            <li> Then I tried to take it apart and clean it.</li>
            <li> Works good but needs different size eyebrow guides.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer locally 7-8 years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I had this same trimmer once before, loved it till it just came to the end of its life.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to remove and replace the attachments that come with it and the additional attachments give me more versatility than my old one.</li>
            <li> I love this thing to do super fast man grooming</li>
            <li> The difference between this one and my most recent (the Braun) is astonishing from the moment you turn it on and hear it run.</li>
            <li> A QUICK TRIM</li>
            <li> Trims very close and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> , I wanted something to trim my brows and the brow guard on this is perfect; not too short and not too long.  </li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have this little device.</li>
            <li> great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Not that powerful  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made, I broke a piece getting it out of the most unfriendly packing I have ever encountered,and weeks later, I have not attempted to use the &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times and so far it has worked great.</li>
            <li> strong at a consistent speed and at all angles&lt;br /&gt;Has 3 different attachments - Ear, Nose, Brow&lt;br /&gt;Easily removable top piece for cleaning</li>
            <li> Not that much more than others I have bought, but the quality of the device as well as the results gotten are so much better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li> My cat has particularly fine (small-diameter) fur, and this clipper will cut it fairly well but not magically.  </li>
            <li> And then you would have something blowing up right by your face and/or eyes.</li>
            <li> If anyone has it right they do.</li>
            <li> then again, you get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li> and they were about to die right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the new one now for about a month and the batteries are still going strong.</li>
            <li> Very loud and not as effective as my old Remington.</li>
            <li> Strong motor keeps facial hair clean and neat.</li>
            <li> works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Sure, it doesn&#x27;t last forever, but for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted about three years</li>
            <li> I put a uploaded a photo of the box that shows you better what you will receive for this low price (even includes a AA battery).</li>
            <li> I will purchase another on my next Amazon order just to be sure I have another when this one wears out in about 5 years</li>
            <li> first one died after 2 years.</li>
            <li> First of all the battery that came in the pack was dead-as-a-door-nail</li>
            <li> Works more quietly than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Actually it sounds strong and power delivery is consistent - 5th star earned.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It does a much better job than I could do with the flat straight attachment.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product, works very well!</li>
            <li> and this one has more attachments (my older one only has the eyebrow attachment).</li>
            <li> Grey nose hair be gone! :)</li>
            <li> but what I like so much better about this one is that the batteries last much longer than the on the older trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s buzzy, but not terribly loud, which is good because I actually bought this to remove mats and tangles from my cat&#x27;s fur.  </li>
            <li> Nostril attachment is to large.</li>
            <li> I was not surprised that the circular attachment did a better job with nose hairs than I could do with the flat attachment, but I was surprised it did a better job on ear hair as well.  </li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s hard to find a good combo unit like this.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my eyebrows, but it&#x27;s really bulky</li>
            <li> Reasonably price.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> and it really does the job.  </li>
            <li> multi-funciton and very well made.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product.</li>
            <li> and I am very greatful.</li>
            <li> but i really dont have much.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and non-abrasive.</li>
            <li> I really wish it came with a bag or case to hold the attachments.</li>
            <li> It works very well, and is quite versatile with its three heads.</li>
            <li> Very displeased.</li>
            <li> but you can obviously tell that it is cheaply made...</li>
            <li> Just really irked by the lack of thought going into the cap design.</li>
            <li> Treat it gently or the parts will break</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a need for the rest of the tools</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really recommend others to buy one.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I was used to the more cylindrical micro trimmers that were popular as of late (the ones who&#x27;s body is the same shape as the batter</li>
            <li> I got this one because the one I had made too much noise when trimming the ear.</li>
            <li> I really like this one.</li>
            <li> It does everything he wants without pulling or yanking .</li>
            <li> This appliance works really well.</li>
            <li> Once I started trimming them though, I realized how much neater it makes your appearance.</li>
            <li> No power and doesn&#x27;t cut very well</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> This product though, is really sketchy.</li>
            <li> Very God product.highly recommended</li>
            <li> This product trims really well.</li>
            <li> Wow this is a much better quality then the last one I had.</li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer, again like the other head is a considerable amount larger than it&#x27;s competitors, great for large holes or farm animals maybe?  </li>
            <li> So if you can live with the shoddy appearance and cheap platic feel and the super loud motor, this product is a great buy at 7 odd dollars.</li>
            <li> Super strong and sturdy, To large for getting into small places.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for my sensitive skin &amp; durable enough to trim my guy between trips to the barber to maintain a nicely groomed look.</li>
            <li> This worked good for me for a little over a year, but I could never get all the hair out so it would run slow many times.</li>
            <li> since my old one did just fine and all it had was a permanent flat or straight end.  </li>
            <li> Quiet for the type motor and size --- quick and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This unit has a lot of power because it uses AA battery instead of AAA baterry, but the head of the unit is considerably larger than most of it&#x27;s competitors of the same design.  </li>
            <li> Same quality and have had them more than ten years.</li>
            <li> Simply does not work adequately.</li>
            <li> It always seems to me that the older trimmer was running out of steam almost as soon as I put new batteries in it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new 3-in-1 trimmer.</li>
            <li> Had it for about 2years and still works like new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other wahl products and although they aren&#x27;t super reliable and generally fall apart within an year or so, they tend to look and feel better as long as they are alive.</li>
            <li> so really this is more of an observation than a complaint.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a high powered adult toy, even from across the house.</li>
            <li> The first day it malfunctioned: it won&#x27;t turn on unless you remove the attachment and screw it back on a couple of times.</li>
            <li> The AA battery power is so much better than the AAA battery ones - not sure why as both are both 1.5V, but I suppose it&#x27;s like the 12V battery in your car -</li>
            <li> now I can replace my more expensive one knowing I have a better unit from Wahl at a lesser cost</li>
            <li> When my first one broke from dropping it too many times I tried 2 other different brands of similar trimmers and they did not measure up to this one.</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl trimmers in the past and have always been satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look like and old man with 10ft hairs sticking out where they shouldn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> All in all a strong motor, lots of torque just a little over sized on the attachments.</li>
            <li> Works great for nose hair as well as keeping eyebrows under control with the precise fittings that keep you from cutting off too much or too little.</li>
            <li> Well worth the few bucks more not to be replacing trimmers every other month.</li>
            <li> this is the only one where that actually holds true.  </li>
            <li> The round nose trimmer head gets pretty warm after using it for a minute or two, and every-so-often will snag on my nose hair a little before it cuts it.</li>
            <li> and they were light weights, with little power and a unsatisfactory cut.  </li>
            <li> wow...</li>
            <li> I use this product for touch up on my neck line and eyebrows (old guy) between barber visits</li>
            <li> I could only imagine what else he wants shaved.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses the old one to trim the hair on his ears.  </li>
            <li> It does the job and the attachments really add to work in different areas.</li>
            <li> In all not a very well finished product but does its job well and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> So as it turns out, the flat straight attachment is the one not getting used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cutting head design is very simple but needs to be cleaned under a hot water tap fairly often.</li>
            <li> The only one it doesn&#x27;t get hot with is the actual nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I even use it on my unwanted facial fuzz that has begun to appear as I get older.</li>
            <li> I certainly have no plans to let the device run all night long in my bedroom while I&#x27;m sleeping.  </li>
            <li> These however are high horsepower relative to those.</li>
            <li> The tiny motor is so powerful when operating that it feels like the unit is plugged into a wall socket instead of running on a single AA battery.  </li>
            <li> Interchangeable heads is a bonus, but I usually use the flat (wide/many teeth) for most jobs.</li>
            <li> Spend a few extra $$ and get one that will last:)</li>
            <li> the one with the more amps with always crank your car and the AA in this trim will always give the power you need but won&#x27;t get in the weak wimpy AAA powered ones.  </li>
            <li> No sharp edges and removes unwanted hair in ears, eyebrows, and nose.</li>
            <li> I dropped my old Wahl 5545 several times and it never broke.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he has only used it once so far</li>
            <li> So far I have only used the rotary and the trimmer.</li>
            <li> but they would inevitably grind to a halt even with regular cleaning, oiling, and new batteries.</li>
            <li> He does have to go over his brows more than a few times to clip off a few stray hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Plastic is a little cheap looking, but then it&#x27;s less than $8</li>
            <li> Really neat little trimmer package.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that this little shaver had so much power.</li>
            <li> Use a rechargeable NIMH battery to keep the longterm cost down - batteries do seem  to last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> The blades finally got dull about two years ago, and after much searching gave up and have tried several battery trimmers from my local stores</li>
            <li> The one it comes with is too long and doesn&#x27;t give  a close enough trim.</li>
            <li> I had another brand that had a short and long length</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> Attachments are strange, although all do work well enough.</li>
            <li> This little device has tamed that wild patch of facial hair and</li>
            <li> It is a little loud at times, but overall I could give this 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> It cuts very well and has a very heavy duty feeling when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I dobt this 7 dollar trimmer will last very long</li>
            <li> Only used a few times so far</li>
            <li> The bigger trimming head that faces sideways does not fit under the clear cap.</li>
            <li> I broke 2 of the 3 little light weights I purchased locally - while dropping is not a good thing</li>
            <li> It worked for several months and now it can&#x27;t even cut a single hair.  </li>
            <li> Get one of these and tame those wild hedges above your eyes.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money  Should be rated as NO stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be careful it is a plastic product, if it walls on the bathroom tiles, well, be prepared to buy your second one.</li>
            <li> I feel like it may be hot enough to burn out the mechanism, or even worse, affect the battery.  </li>
            <li> Several attachments, so you really can trim hard to reach spots, like nostrils!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Enough power to do the job, long lasting, and small enough to bring along for those trips to meet the Corporate Executives that haven&#x27;t learned how to trim their unibrows yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery life is very long.  </li>
            <li> The plastic cap only fits over the round nose trimmer and the smaller trimmer.</li>
            <li> But cuts well, and the single AA battery lasts a while.</li>
            <li> It trims nose and ear hair easily and closely without cutting me.</li>
            <li> im not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I am disturbed by the fact that when using this with the eyebrow and trimmer attachments, the device heats up to an alarming degree.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of $8.00.</li>
            <li> My Wahl trimmer arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It has worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I followed instructions, put on the brow guard, but it did not trim my brows like I expected it to do.  </li>
            <li> When you put the round insert in this trimmer, the noise is low, so it is easier on my ear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, so</li>
            <li> everything as expected ..</li>
            <li> I use to it to keep my unibrow from forming and to trim my moustache along with trimming ear and nose hair and have absolutely no issues with the way this product performs.</li>
            <li> it was everything I expected</li>
            <li> Got this the other day from Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, you might want to put a little lotion on after you use it.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic-Broke while in my shaving bad on a trip.</li>
            <li> Other trimmers seemed to spin slower or faster depending on the angle at which I held them!  </li>
            <li> But for cutting close to the skin without drama or accidents, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Both work, and both cut the hair cleanly, no pulling or tugging.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little coaxing.  </li>
            <li> but I feel that it is a little under powered.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on it.</li>
            <li> The packaging that contained the trimmer was broken open and it made me think this item was used and returned for done reason.  </li>
            <li> I would say overall this product is worth the investment if you&#x27;re tired of pluckin&#x27; those painful nose hairs..</li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer worked well for a while then gradually became ineffective - would cut very little hair.</li>
            <li> We decided it was time for excessive eyebrow intervention.</li>
            <li> I was particularly skeptical of the brow attachment even though it had two length settings, both seemed too short.  </li>
            <li> But I still have to get in there with small scissors.</li>
            <li> it seems to have plenty of power and has no problem with thick growth of hair.</li>
            <li> I think its unfair, but I did break down and helped him shave the hairs from his nose.  </li>
            <li> The box says &amp;#34;whisper quiet&amp;#34; but I would hate to tell these people a secret if they whisper this loudly.</li>
            <li> So, if you are tired of watering eyes while trimming nose hairs</li>
            <li> and I was not happy w/ the results.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy with this.</li>
            <li> like but not exactly this: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t touch the eyebrow trimmer, because I&#x27;ve had disastrous results with those types in the past and</li>
            <li> Though, read the instructions when it comes to the eyebrow trimmer (I didn&#x27;t &amp; used it wrongly... &amp; can attest to the fact</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> the brow trimming component is useless.</li>
            <li> That was the wrong thing for me to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using 99% for cutting nose hair, and I like the fact that there are two attachments you can use for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> Works well, but does leave annoying hairs behind.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the nose hair trimmer attachment.  </li>
            <li> Is a horrible contrapation.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Disappointed in the nose hair trimmer attachment.  I have had better luck with the Conair brand but thought I&#x27;d give Wahl a try.</li>
            <li> hope it works well....</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well for me. It trims nose and ear hair easily and closely without cutting me.</li>
            <li> Never bought a personal trimmer before, always used a razor, shaver or tweezers to get those rascally nose hairs.  This thing works great, and comes with two additional tips to trim your Girlfriends bushy eyebrows, and the party favors sticking out your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough power to do the job, long lasting, and small enough to bring along for those trips to meet the Corporate Executives that haven&#x27;t learned how to trim their unibrows yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, nice item, comfortable, doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs, cuts they nicely, quickly and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way to go Wahl!!!</li>
            <li> Works well, but does leave annoying hairs behind.</li>
            <li> I always wanted one of these.  It&#x27;s great for trimming eyebrows, ears and nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid sixties and hair is growing where it never grew before.  This tool is doing a great job of sprucing me up, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sharp enough. Takes several strokes to remove nose hair.</li>
            <li> for the price pretty good deal ,works well</li>
            <li> Works well.  The device hums along and does its job.  I had it working before I knew it.</li>
            <li> Really neat little trimmer package. Quiet for the type motor and size --- quick and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lives up to the Wahl reputation for performance, I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> very good ,all attachments are very functional, prefer over chargable model</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my eyebrows, but it&#x27;s really bulky so I&#x27;ve been just plucking them but it&#x27;s great quality.</li>
            <li> Wahl 5545-400 is a good item to have around.  The three attachments attach easily and secure. The battery life is very long.  I have used it about a dozen times and the batteries are just as strong as the day I put them in. It&#x27;s easy to clean. It&#x27;s a very simple device. I purchased another one to keep in my shaving kit.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Really nice tool.  Though, read the instructions when it comes to the eyebrow trimmer (I didn&#x27;t &amp; used it wrongly... &amp; can attest to the fact it&#x27;s not dummy proof!).</li>
            <li> This unit has a lot of power because it uses AA battery instead of AAA baterry, but the head of the unit is considerably larger than most of it&#x27;s competitors of the same design.  They Eye brow trimmer guide does nothing (maybe a good thing) it might work if you have some hellishly bushy eyebrows that stand up on their own like a garden rake though?  The nose hair trimmer, again like the other head is a considerable amount larger than it&#x27;s competitors, great for large holes or farm animals maybe?  All in all a strong motor, lots of torque just a little over sized on the attachments.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husbands eyebrows.  works pretty well. He does have to go over his brows more than a few times to clip off a few stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Reasonably price.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Works good but needs different size eyebrow guides. The one it comes with is too long and doesn&#x27;t give  a close enough trim.</li>
            <li> Its okay.  Can&#x27;t store attachments in one spot and is just ok.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and versatile with the exchangeable heads. Fits in the hand well.</li>
            <li> I am disturbed by the fact that when using this with the eyebrow and trimmer attachments, the device heats up to an alarming degree.  The only one it doesn&#x27;t get hot with is the actual nose hair trimmer.  I feel like it may be hot enough to burn out the mechanism, or even worse, affect the battery.  And then you would have something blowing up right by your face and/or eyes.</li>
            <li> Broke immediately out of the box!!</li>
            <li> is quite handsome but plagued by a lavish and unrestrained unibrow (think Muppet). We decided it was time for excessive eyebrow intervention. This little device has tamed that wild patch of facial hair and wow... What a difference!</li>
            <li> The best trimmer have ever had. No pulling, no tugging, no pain. Wahl has been around for a lot of years. If anyone has it right they do. This isn&#x27;t the most expensive one either. It&#x27;s good quality and am expecting to have years of use. I also own Wahl hair clipper. Same quality and have had them more than ten years.</li>
            <li> For this price I haven&#x27;t found anything even close to as good.  Sure, it doesn&#x27;t last forever, but for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  My first one lasted about three years and I have bought extras just as a back-up in case they ever stop making these.  I should mentioned that I only use it as a nose hair trimmer.  Although many brands claim that they won&#x27;t yank the hair this is the only one where that actually holds true.  So, if you are tired of watering eyes while trimming nose hairs this is the tool for you.</li>
            <li> I went through two Panasonics and a Braun before finding this one. The difference between this one and my most recent (the Braun) is astonishing from the moment you turn it on and hear it run. It sounds like a Ferrari, compared to a lawn tractor. When this one kicks the bucket, I will buy another one just like it.</li>
            <li> Broke within a month.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine although it does not cut the hair quite as close as I would like it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, based on the reviews. The first day it malfunctioned: it won&#x27;t turn on unless you remove the attachment and screw it back on a couple of times. Replaced the battery and checked the connections: all fine. This does not bode well and I will be returning and buying an upgrade.</li>
            <li> Rating five stars for now.  I&#x27;m using 99% for cutting nose hair, and I like the fact that there are two attachments you can use for that purpose.  Both work, and both cut the hair cleanly, no pulling or tugging.  Nice ergonomic grip.  Will update and downgrade stars if this doesn&#x27;t prove durable.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer locally 7-8 years ago and loved it.  The blades finally got dull about two years ago, and after much searching gave up and have tried several battery trimmers from my local stores and they were light weights, with little power and a unsatisfactory cut.  I dropped my old Wahl 5545 several times and it never broke.  I broke 2 of the 3 little light weights I purchased locally - while dropping is not a good thing, I say this to point out that this product is much more durable than others.  I put a uploaded a photo of the box that shows you better what you will receive for this low price (even includes a AA battery). The AA battery power is so much better than the AAA battery ones - not sure why as both are both 1.5V, but I suppose it&#x27;s like the 12V battery in your car - the one with the more amps with always crank your car and the AA in this trim will always give the power you need but won&#x27;t get in the weak wimpy AAA powered ones.  You can run the nose and detail trimmer under water to clean, but don&#x27;t rinse the trimmer blades under water, brush clean and oil those every 6 months for best performance and life.  Has a 3 year warranty and 30 day money back guarantee - can&#x27;t beat that.  I use this product for touch up on my neck line and eyebrows (old guy) between barber visits and it really does the job.  I will purchase another on my next Amazon order just to be sure I have another when this one wears out in about 5 years (hope I&#x27;m around too!)  Absolutely totally recommend as best battery trimmer choice to purchase without reservation.</li>
            <li> Worked great. I have been using it for a few weeks now and am very satisfied. Strong motor keeps facial hair clean and neat.</li>
            <li> Total waste of $8.00. Battery lasts about 30 seconds. Clogs easily. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on it. Spend $25 and get a good one.</li>
            <li> very nice. multi-funciton and very well made. nice product!</li>
            <li> Perfect for the price and works very well</li>
            <li> Item as described, shipped quickly! A++</li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer worked well for a while then gradually became ineffective - would cut very little hair. I discovered that it would fill up with cut hair which stay inside and deflect the hair you want to cut. The cutting head design is very simple but needs to be cleaned under a hot water tap fairly often. When clean it works great.&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow trimmer works well for all kinds of hair, including to trim my mustache. In all not a very well finished product but does its job well and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. It fell apart on day one. I can&#x27;t afford to ship it back.</li>
            <li> Had many of these types of groomers! This is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Is a horrible contrapation. Does almost nothing. A complete waste of money  Should be rated as NO stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who ever invented it knows nothing about hair removal.</li>
            <li> I like it!  Use a rechargeable NIMH battery to keep the longterm cost down - batteries do seem  to last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product. It has done everything that it said it would do. I am very happy with this product from the moment that I started to use it. I have been looking for a product that could do what they claim they can do, and many times I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I like  Wahl products they came through for me and I am very greatful. I will continue to use only their products. They have won my business.</li>
            <li> Seems to be well made and works for trimming nose hairs and chin hairs.</li>
            <li> Works well, but only has one length on the eyebrow/hair trimmer. I want to use this on my eyebrows but this gives them a buzz cut and it&#x27;s TOO SHORT. I had another brand that had a short and long length and it was better in that aspect.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he has only used it once so far but he is happy with its overall performance. I wish i had something more helpful to contribute to this review but i really dont have much. Its good quality and affordable which is why i bought it.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Favorite trimmer for &amp;#34;peach fuzz.&amp;#34; This works great for women who just want to gently trim that &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; on your face, lips, or neck. It is gentle and non-abrasive. I don&#x27;t touch the eyebrow trimmer, because I&#x27;ve had disastrous results with those types in the past and well, the thought of yanking out nose hairs... ouch. If you have dry skin, you might want to put a little lotion on after you use it.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Ear Nose &amp; Brow trimmer is an excellent product  now I can replace my more expensive one knowing I have a better unit from Wahl at a lesser cost</li>
            <li> I already had a similar product, but I&#x27;m living in two places now so I&#x27;m duplicating some of my personal items so I have one in each place. I paid about the same for this product as I did several years ago for the one that I already had and this one has more attachments (my older one only has the eyebrow attachment). To me, a trimmer is a trimmer but what I like so much better about this one is that the batteries last much longer than the on the older trimmer. It always seems to me that the older trimmer was running out of steam almost as soon as I put new batteries in it. I&#x27;ve had the new one now for about a month and the batteries are still going strong. It is easy to remove and replace the attachments that come with it and the additional attachments give me more versatility than my old one. I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li> Was gonna buy the micro touch until I read the reviews, this thing has a lot of power and gets the job done. Hope it lasts</li>
            <li> this is an excellent little clipper with lots of power.  It doesn&#x27;t pull hair like the smaller ones do and it does a very nice job</li>
            <li> Only used a few times so far and it seems to work fine.  Nice set of attachments come with.</li>
            <li> I really wish it came with a bag or case to hold the attachments. Does the job well enough, a bit bulky though.</li>
            <li> Great value and does exactly as I needed it to do...</li>
            <li> Not that much more than others I have bought, but the quality of the device as well as the results gotten are so much better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve bought.  I even get the feeling this one may last beyond what I have experienced with others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED . GREAT DEALER TO PURCHASE FROM . PRODUCT JUST AS DESCRIBED .  I WOULD DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN . JAY</li>
            <li> My Wahl trimmer arrived sooner than expected. It works very well, and is quite versatile with its three heads. So far I have only used the rotary and the trimmer. I think because it uses a AA battery instead of a AAA it seems to have plenty of power and has no problem with thick growth of hair. It is reasonably quiet. It has good feel in the hand, is easy to manipulate, and just plain works great. I could not be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Very loud and not as effective as my old Remington. Very displeased.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for several months and have no complaints with it. It has worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto...</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned. When my first one broke from dropping it too many times I tried 2 other different brands of similar trimmers and they did not measure up to this one. Trims very close and cleans up easily. It holds up to all of my manscaping duties and has a good grip on it. Just don&#x27;t drop it on the floor.</li>
            <li> Great gadget to have.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Remington that finally gave out after over a decade of reliable use.  I didn&#x27;t think I needed the brow or circular attachment since my old one did just fine and all it had was a permanent flat or straight end.  I was particularly skeptical of the brow attachment even though it had two length settings, both seemed too short.  I was wrong.  It does a much better job than I could do with the flat straight attachment.  I was not surprised that the circular attachment did a better job with nose hairs than I could do with the flat attachment, but I was surprised it did a better job on ear hair as well.  So as it turns out, the flat straight attachment is the one not getting used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only four stars?  I wish it had a stand/holder for the trimmer as well as the spare attachments.  If it did I would probably use it more often as I probably should and yes, I&#x27;m blaming the product for that.</li>
            <li> Personally I like it but you can obviously tell that it is cheaply made...then again, you get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li> This trimmer does the job, but the protective sanitary cap only fits on it with the nose-hair trimmer head on.  It would be a lot better if they had made one that fit over any of the heads and provided a case or bag or something to hold the two heads not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose hair trimmer part isn&#x27;t as good as some others, and I haven&#x27;t yet tried the pen detail trimmer head, but I&#x27;m sure it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip and switch are good, and changing the heads is easy and fast and they lock into place well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price can&#x27;t be beat for having all three functions.  Just really irked by the lack of thought going into the cap design.</li>
            <li> Cheap in price, and in looks. But cuts well, and the single AA battery lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Second one i own.&lt;br /&gt;works great. Quite flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;My first one died after 2 years. Treat it gently or the parts will break</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It was a good price and works as promised. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product, price &amp; shipping time.  I have had no problems.  The product works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is  great product for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This works well, I wanted something to trim my brows and the brow guard on this is perfect; not too short and not too long.  I don&#x27;t really have a need for the rest of the tools so I cannot speak to those features.</li>
            <li> Got this the other day from Amazon. It is the quintessential POS. Too cheap to bother about returning, but, words of advice: GET SOMETHING ELSE. It just does not work!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a personal trimmer - but let me tell ya...I often feel like my neighbors can hear when it is being used.</li>
            <li> I Purchase this so my friend could shave his nose hairs, He refuses to shave his nose hairs unless I find it in my heart to cater to his nose hairs.  I think its unfair, but I did break down and helped him shave the hairs from his nose.  This shaver did an excellent job leaving his nose hairless and him with the ability to breathe better.  I was amazed that this little shaver had so much power. I liked the interchangeable parts and now he wants me to trim his neck hairs and shape his hair line up.  I could only imagine what else he wants shaved.  wink!  wink!</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic-Broke while in my shaving bad on a trip.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very powerful. Able to trim mustache, goatee and nose/ear . Effective and I would recommend. If you are looking for a versatile tool for facial grooming this would work.</li>
            <li> Nice product ! Made me sneeze, when I trimmed my nose hairs, LOL</li>
            <li> works good, I am able to trim the areas of my ears and nose easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this to trim my brows and I was not happy w/ the results.  First of all the battery that came in the pack was dead-as-a-door-nail so I used one I already had.  I followed instructions, put on the brow guard, but it did not trim my brows like I expected it to do.  I am not returning it and I don&#x27;t really recommend others to buy one.  It may work wonderfully for some but this one didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> ordered this for my mom, she loves it, works great. the 3 heads are easy too change, even for a senior with arthritis. each of the 3 heads has their own specific use and does a great job of hair removal and trimming.</li>
            <li> as advertised and on time</li>
            <li> Works well for grooming your man. No sharp edges and removes unwanted hair in ears, eyebrows, and nose.</li>
            <li> Works well, good price, can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Works great!  This model works as great as the older Whal model I replaced.  I use it to cut the hair around my dog&#x27;s eyes.  My husband uses the old one to trim the hair on his ears.  He says it works great!</li>
            <li> Wow this is a much better quality then the last one I had. I use it for my nose and my blonde hairs around my lip.  Love it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great! I even use it on my unwanted facial fuzz that has begun to appear as I get older. It works wonderfully! The attachments are very useful and easy to change!</li>
            <li> They fit nice. Thanks</li>
            <li> As advertised, no problems.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband. He absolutely loves it. It works well. Great buy. It is just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have this little device. It came exactly as pictured and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Works more quietly than I thought it would. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the standard attachment, as I don&#x27;t need the others.  I tried the clipper on my arm, and it works about as well as you could expect.  It&#x27;s buzzy, but not terribly loud, which is good because I actually bought this to remove mats and tangles from my cat&#x27;s fur.  My cat has particularly fine (small-diameter) fur, and this clipper will cut it fairly well but not magically.  It takes a little coaxing.  However, the clipper is inexpensive, and as I said it&#x27;s quiet enough that my cat tolerates it, although of course different cats may have different opinions.  But for cutting close to the skin without drama or accidents, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I was used to the more cylindrical micro trimmers that were popular as of late (the ones who&#x27;s body is the same shape as the batter and it&#x27;s outside housing sleeve slides off to get to the battery like but not exactly this: [[ASIN:B000B8YYBW Cricket Micro Hair Trimmer]]), but they would inevitably grind to a halt even with regular cleaning, oiling, and new batteries. These however are high horsepower relative to those. Well worth the few bucks more not to be replacing trimmers every other month. Interchangeable heads is a bonus, but I usually use the flat (wide/many teeth) for most jobs.</li>
            <li> I got this one because the one I had made too much noise when trimming the ear. When you put the round insert in this trimmer, the noise is low, so it is easier on my ear. I really like this one.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made product. Simply does not work adequately. the brow trimming component is useless. Would like to send the product back for a refund.</li>
            <li> It was a good buy ,the price was right and it works. Its all plastic thou and im not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Works great. Much better than the girly one with the light I found at Walgreens. The box says &amp;#34;whisper quiet&amp;#34; but I would hate to tell these people a secret if they whisper this loudly. Sounds like a high powered adult toy, even from across the house.</li>
            <li> Wahl makes good quality clippers so I thought this would be a great trimmer. It works fine but I feel that it is a little under powered. No complaints because it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new 3-in-1 trimmer. It does everything he wants without pulling or yanking . It&#x27;s easy and comfortable to use, and He&#x27;s very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great item at a great price!</li>
            <li> Junk.  It worked for several months and now it can&#x27;t even cut a single hair.  Spend a few extra $$ and get one that will last:)</li>
            <li> This appliance works really well. Like it for trimming hairline as well as for nose hairs!!</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl trimmers in the past and have always been satisfied with them.  But, this trimmer is the best one ever.  It cuts very well and has a very heavy duty feeling when I use it.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  But, so far, so good.  The tiny motor is so powerful when operating that it feels like the unit is plugged into a wall socket instead of running on a single AA battery.  The unit does make noise, but so what?  The noise just indicates power.  I certainly have no plans to let the device run all night long in my bedroom while I&#x27;m sleeping.  I recommend this Wahl.</li>
            <li> Super strong and sturdy, To large for getting into small places. Nostril attachment is to large.</li>
            <li> So far, so great. I&#x27;ve had this handy tool for a couple months and it&#x27;s performed perfectly. A lot of guys don&#x27;t keep up with their brows. I used to be one of them. Once I started trimming them though, I realized how much neater it makes your appearance. Do yourself, and your lady, a favor. Get one of these and tame those wild hedges above your eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the five star reviews people had written about it. Big mistake! The blade is really tiny. It doesn&#x27;t remove hair properly. I have used beard trimmers, and I have to say, they are far more better than this. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it, I had to return mine.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for with the attachments I use most. I would recommend this item, my husband likes it.</li>
            <li> quick ship nice product</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband to replace one we lost in a recent move.  It works like a charm and he loves it.</li>
            <li> It is OK.  But I still have to get in there with small scissors.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT FOR GETTING RID OF EXCESS HAIR WHERE YOU DON&#x27;T WANT IT 7 A QUICK TRIM</li>
            <li> Not that powerful  I dont think the quality is good  cheap</li>
            <li> I had this same trimmer once before, loved it till it just came to the end of its life.  Then I bought a different one at the store, it was horrid.  So happy I found this same one again on Amazon.  My husband and I both have one now.</li>
            <li> No power and doesn&#x27;t cut very well</li>
            <li> nice product. everything as expected .. thanks</li>
            <li> Every trimmer I&#x27;ve owned (3 prior to this one) sounded like it&#x27;s gears were made of plastic and they were about to die right out of the box.  So this trimmer got four stars from me just for sounding like it wasn&#x27;t on it&#x27;s last leg.  Actually it sounds strong and power delivery is consistent - 5th star earned.  Other trimmers seemed to spin slower or faster depending on the angle at which I held them!  This trimmer says it can operate in the shower, but I just have this thing about not taking electrical appliances in the shower with me. I know it&#x27;s a low voltage, but still not going to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Runs strong at a consistent speed and at all angles&lt;br /&gt;Has 3 different attachments - Ear, Nose, Brow&lt;br /&gt;Easily removable top piece for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;No pulling or tearing of hair, as advertised&lt;br /&gt;Good value at under $8&lt;br /&gt;Reputable name - Whal.  I have a Whal clipper for trimming my hair that is now 20 years old and still works great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Plastic is a little cheap looking, but then it&#x27;s less than $8&lt;br /&gt;Would have been nice if they had provided a case to keep trimmer and all attachments together&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Quality brand name product that does what is says it will do (though I didn&#x27;t test in water) without pinching, pulling hairs or nicking, for a really low price.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This worked good for me for a little over a year, but I could never get all the hair out so it would run slow many times. Then I tried to take it apart and clean it. That was the wrong thing for me to do.</li>
            <li> I wanted this for eyebrow trimming &amp; it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li> Feels really light and cheap. The plastic cap only fits over the round nose trimmer and the smaller trimmer. The bigger trimming head that faces sideways does not fit under the clear cap. The round nose trimmer head gets pretty warm after using it for a minute or two, and every-so-often will snag on my nose hair a little before it cuts it.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed. It does the job and the attachments really add to work in different areas.</li>
            <li> love that it is waterproof! great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Really poor fit and finish. I&#x27;ve used other wahl products and although they aren&#x27;t super reliable and generally fall apart within an year or so, they tend to look and feel better as long as they are alive. This product though, is really sketchy. It feels cheap, looks cheap and is cheap so really this is more of an observation than a complaint. I dobt this 7 dollar trimmer will last very long and i don&#x27;t expect it to. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and does it well. I use to it to keep my unibrow from forming and to trim my moustache along with trimming ear and nose hair and have absolutely no issues with the way this product performs. So if you can live with the shoddy appearance and cheap platic feel and the super loud motor, this product is a great buy at 7 odd dollars.</li>
            <li> great product for the money</li>
            <li> Good service and not a bad price either.  Well satisfied with price as well as quality of merchandise.  They produced what they promised.</li>
            <li> Best clipper yet. Several attachments, so you really can trim hard to reach spots, like nostrils!  I love this one.  Wahl continues to&lt;br /&gt;be the premier clipper company.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this thing. Works great, super price. It is a little loud at times, but overall I could give this 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, I broke a piece getting it out of the most unfriendly packing I have ever encountered,and weeks later, I have not attempted to use the &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, reliable micro trimmer. Gentle enough for my sensitive skin &amp; durable enough to trim my guy between trips to the barber to maintain a nicely groomed look.</li>
            <li> This is a good unit and from a really trusted brand name, delivered promptly</li>
            <li> Grey nose hair be gone! :)</li>
            <li> The packaging that contained the trimmer was broken open and it made me think this item was used and returned for done reason.  I am not happy with this.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, works very well!</li>
            <li> overall good product, much better than a comparable norelco and panasonic ear and nose trimmer. I like the handle, size, and easy on/off button, some others you have to twist. Just be careful it is a plastic product, if it walls on the bathroom tiles, well, be prepared to buy your second one.</li>
            <li> it was everything I expected</li>
            <li> Works great for nose hair as well as keeping eyebrows under control with the precise fittings that keep you from cutting off too much or too little. I love this thing to do super fast man grooming so I don&#x27;t look like and old man with 10ft hairs sticking out where they shouldn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> the AA battery has more power and it works as advertised,,</li>
            <li> This product is heartier and easier to use then the India have used in the last. Very God product.highly recommended</li>
            <li> Attachments are strange, although all do work well enough. I would say overall this product is worth the investment if you&#x27;re tired of pluckin&#x27; those painful nose hairs..</li>
            <li> Works great--it&#x27;s hard to find a good combo unit like this.  This does the job well.</li>
            <li> This product trims really well. Had a similar trimmer that came with the kit I purchased but this one is much better and much more efficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times and so far it has worked great. I mostly use it for trimming my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> nice product. Had it for about 2years and still works like new.</li>
