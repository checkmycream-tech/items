            <li>If you want to change the color mid day, or retouch, you need a good remover like Maybelline Superaway.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I did find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it !!!</li>
            <li>so much I don&#x27;t want it to not be available when I eventually run out</li>
            <li>One for me and another for my daughter who likes the same kind of lipstain as I do.  </li>
            <li>Comes right off.</li>
            <li>Just rub it on and the lipstick wipes right off.</li>
            <li>just put it on like lipstick, rub your lips together, and VOILA, the lipstick wipes right off.  </li>
            <li>It removes lip color easily with one swipe of a tissue, and it&#x27;s not messy!  </li>
            <li>I wear the long lasting kind of lipstick and nothing works better than this to remove it.  </li>
            <li>I do like this remover very much.  </li>
            <li>As the small tube can last over a year with once a day use, I was very happy.</li>
            <li>long has this been around while I have been rubbing off the top layer of lip-skin every nite?</li>
            <li>outlast is way better than maybelline lasting lipcolor imo - but at least maybelline had the good sense to invent this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;how</li>
            <li>You really need it to remove the Maybelline  Superstay lipcolor.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even have to use much.  </li>
            <li>This is great stuff and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone who wants to remove their lipstick and have their lips left supple with no bad taste.</li>
            <li>A GREAT product for removing lipstick; especially long-stay lipstick that is hard to just wipe off without this product.  </li>
            <li>This product works like a charm to remove the most stubborn lipstick with a few swipes of a tissue.  </li>
            <li>right next to their lip color, but thank goodness</li>
            <li>It is hard to fine now, not in Walmart anymore!  </li>
            <li>I love the lip ink product but they are hard to remove.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear gel that you squeeze out the tube onto your lips.  </li>
            <li>I always use the color-stay type lipstick and have found this product to be the quickest and easiest way to remove them completely.  </li>
            <li>SO MUCH BOUGHT EXTRA TUBES FOR MY DAUGHTERS........</li>
            <li>This product really takes off the long lasting/no transfer lipsticks and does not leave any trace of itself after it and the lipstick are wiped off.</li>
            <li>I bought several because I only use long lasting lipsticks and this is the only product I could fine that would take it off.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave an odd taste on your mouth and you can re-apply right away.  </li>
            <li>It takes off all of the long lasting lipsticks and yet is gentle to my lips.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different lipstain removers and the only one that worked without rubbing my lips off was Victoria&#x27;s Secret.  </li>
            <li>Just put a little on lips, put lips together for about 30 seconds or so, then gently wipe off</li>

            <li> This is the only product I can find to remove ALL my long wearing lipstick.</li>
            <li> LAST A LONG TIME..</li>
            <li> I add it to all my orders that might fall just shy of the $25 free delivery quota.  </li>
            <li> if it is it&#x27;s super expensive.</li>
            <li> I got the few that you had for now, when I need it again, then I will definitely look for you</li>
            <li> I have been using this for some of my lipsticks that are harder to get off.  </li>
            <li> have used outlast for years and have rubbed and rubbed it into little balls to get it off, even resorted to alcohol.</li>
            <li> Usually red lipsticks and other dark colors are really difficult to remove, with this, I just put a little on my lips and it removes the color.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had to use liquid makeup remover (that isn&#x27;t oil-free) which can be messy.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Maybelline 24 hr.</li>
            <li> I had been using Lancome Bi-Facil to remove my long-lasting lipsticks, but it is too expensive for what it is, PLUS, the way the bottle is designed, causes half the product to leak out and be lost...  </li>
            <li> They go hand in hand, Vaseline won&#x27;t take it off without some rubbing and that&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> There is no color to this product so you are asking the wrong questions here regarding color.  </li>
            <li> I thought shipping was too expensive!!</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to find in the stores now, so I turned to Amazon!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased one last year, but I could not find it in any store, so I went online.  I do like this remover very much.  I would certainly recommend it, and my experience with Amazon was excellent.</li>
            <li> This is the best remover of all-day lip color. I fear it&#x27;s no longer being made, so I think I&#x27;ve cornered the market :) At any rate, I&#x27;m stockpiling a number of tubes!</li>
            <li> This is the lipcolor remover I referred to in my review of the Maybelline SuperStay lip color.  They go hand in hand, Vaseline won&#x27;t take it off without some rubbing and that&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> Really low price, which is great! And the top is wrapped in plastic. I haven&#x27;t used it because I already have one. I ordered two though because I buy a lot of Maybelline 24 hr lipcolor stain. Comes right off. BUY THIS</li>
            <li> Perfect for taking off lip stain</li>
            <li> This is a great remover for long wearing lipstick.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I can find to remove ALL my long wearing lipstick. Love it!</li>
            <li> I always use the color-stay type lipstick and have found this product to be the quickest and easiest way to remove them completely.  It doesn&#x27;t leave an odd taste on your mouth and you can re-apply right away.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS WONDERFULLY WELL!  WHY MAYBELLINE DISCONTINUED IT, I SURE DON&#x27;T KNOW, BUT I WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> wish I had known about this stuff, just discovered it. have used outlast for years and have rubbed and rubbed it into little balls to get it off, even resorted to alcohol. dont know how I ever got along without this remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;covergirl outlast is way better than maybelline lasting lipcolor imo - but at least maybelline had the good sense to invent this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;how long has this been around while I have been rubbing off the top layer of lip-skin every nite?</li>
            <li> love the smooth feel of my lips after using to remove the lipstick, keeps my lips soft and smooth always</li>
            <li> I am very happy that I was able to find this product online.  I had looked everywhere and asked at many stores about it but no one had even heard of it.  You really need it to remove the Maybelline  Superstay lipcolor.  Without it, your lips are damaged trying to remove the lipcolor.  So happy that I found it!  I bought 3 so I&#x27;m all set for a while.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that removes all residue of those &amp;#34;stay on&amp;#34; lipsticks. Excellent product and definitely one that I always stock up on because it&#x27;s sells out quickly everywhere. Even my family in Canada tell me to buy a bunch for them when I visit as it&#x27;s not sold in Canada or if it is it&#x27;s super expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes it would take the long-lasting lipsticks out of my white blouses. It did not work. The only thing that will take the lipstick out is lighter fluid, and i have used everything. I have never used it to remove lipstick. I love the lipsticks, but this won&#x27;t get it out of your clothes. BUT, it wasn&#x27;t made to do that, either.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 6 years and love it. It is almost impossible to find in the stores now, so I turned to Amazon! I have tried to use petroleum jelly (Vaseline) which does not work as thoroughly.</li>
            <li> This is the best lipstick remover!</li>
            <li> It takes off all of the long lasting lipsticks and yet is gentle to my lips.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Received by date stated</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job at removing lipsticks. Usually red lipsticks and other dark colors are really difficult to remove, with this, I just put a little on my lips and it removes the color. Love this!</li>
            <li> It is hard to fine now, not in Walmart anymore!  Don&#x27;t understand why not!  I got the few that you had for now, when I need it again, then I will definitely look for you</li>
            <li> Removes even Revlon Lip Stain!  I have tried many different lipstain removers and the only one that worked without rubbing my lips off was Victoria&#x27;s Secret.  Now I have this which is smooth and I don&#x27;t even have to use much.  It works great.    Update on this review.  I just ordered more Superaway for Christmas.  One for me and another for my daughter who likes the same kind of lipstain as I do.  This is great stuff and a little goes a long way.  If you have any doubt whatsoever; purchase this tube.  My two tubes arrived yesterday and I just opened it up and found Eucerin Moisteruzing Cream .32 oz in the package as well.  I don&#x27;t know if this was by accident or on purchase.  Nice touch if it was on purpose, and oops if it was by accident.  The Superaway was seperately packaged.    Thank you for making this product available!  My lips thank you as well :)</li>
            <li> The lipstick remover is quick and great for removing the &#x27;long-lasting lipstick&#x27; products.  Recently I could not find it in any store.  I called the company and was told it was no longer manufactured.  Luckily, I did find it on Amazon. I purchased 7!  As the small tube can last over a year with once a day use, I was very happy.</li>
            <li> I have to wear color stay lip color for stage and I&#x27;ve always had to use liquid makeup remover (that isn&#x27;t oil-free) which can be messy.  This product is amazing!  It removes lip color easily with one swipe of a tissue, and it&#x27;s not messy!  I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> If you use Maybelline Superstay 24 hours lip color, you need this to remove it from your lips.  It works well.</li>
            <li> I thought shipping was too expensive!! It cost more than the item. Otherwise I love the product and wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued it!</li>
            <li> I usually use Maybelline 24 hr. lip color, which doesn&#x27;t wipe off.  It&#x27;s really more of a stain, that wears off over the course of a day (or more).  If you want to change the color mid day, or retouch, you need a good remover like Maybelline Superaway.  It&#x27;s great, fits nicely in my purse and applies much like chapstick, allowing the lip color to be wiped off easily with a tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why this item isn&#x27;t carried in the stores (My first one was, but I can&#x27;t find it any more) right next to their lip color, but thank goodness it&#x27;s still available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> great product. great price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for some of my lipsticks that are harder to get off.  I&#x27;ve also used it for  YEARS  Then they got rid of the lipstick that actually stayed on alllllllll  day  and that&#x27;s how I started using it.  SO,  I was thrilled when I found it online</li>
            <li> This EASILY removes 12 hr lipsticks!!!!!</li>
            <li> Product better than advertised, easy to order, well packaged, reasonably priced (all acording to my wife)  give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS USED THIS REMOVER, BUT CAN&#x27;T FIND ANYWHERE...WALMART USED TO SELL IT.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS VERY EASY TO APPLY AND REMOVING  THE 24 HOUR LIPSTICK IS A BREEZE.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO THIS SIZE TUBE LAST A LONG TIME..&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT SO MUCH BOUGHT EXTRA TUBES FOR MY DAUGHTERS........&lt;br /&gt;WIL&lt;br /&gt;RENO NV</li>
            <li> I love the lip ink product but they are hard to remove. This is the easiest, best way to remove your LIP INK products.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 10 online because I could not find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to find this item on Amazon. It removes all Lipcolors with ease. Just rub it on and the lipstick wipes right off.</li>
            <li> There is no color to this product so you are asking the wrong questions here regarding color.  It&#x27;s a clear gel that you squeeze out the tube onto your lips.  It works immediately and you are able to wipe off the long-stay lipstick with ease.  I love it and ordered additional ones to have when the first ones I ordered run out.  I like the product so much I don&#x27;t want it to not be available when I eventually run out so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve stocked up on it.  A GREAT product for removing lipstick; especially long-stay lipstick that is hard to just wipe off without this product.  Highly recommend it !!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the store many times when I go to look for it. It&#x27;s a great product for removing 24 hour lip color and it conditions lips very well. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product really takes off the long lasting/no transfer lipsticks and does not leave any trace of itself after it and the lipstick are wiped off.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic for removing maybelline 24 hour lipsticks.  Just put a little on lips, put lips together for about 30 seconds or so, then gently wipe off and it&#x27;s gone!  Got lucky and found 3 for 10 on Ebay!</li>
            <li> I use this product every day to remove my lip stain. I wear Chanel Rouge Double Intensite which stays on all day until I take it off and this product does it without drying my lips.</li>
            <li> I had been using Lancome Bi-Facil to remove my long-lasting lipsticks, but it is too expensive for what it is, PLUS, the way the bottle is designed, causes half the product to leak out and be lost...  I am soooo happy that I discovered Maybelling Superaway Lipcolor Remover!  It works perfectly...  just put it on like lipstick, rub your lips together, and VOILA, the lipstick wipes right off.  Perfect.  Simple.  Inexpensive.  I love it.</li>
            <li> It has been discontinued. Can&#x27;t imagine why. I bought several because I only use long lasting lipsticks and this is the only product I could fine that would take it off.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this on Amazon.  I purchased one at a brick and mortar store and then couldn&#x27;t find it again.  This product works like a charm to remove the most stubborn lipstick with a few swipes of a tissue.  I wear the long lasting kind of lipstick and nothing works better than this to remove it.  I hope Amazon never stops carrying it.  I add it to all my orders that might fall just shy of the $25 free delivery quota.  I would recommend this to everyone who wants to remove their lipstick and have their lips left supple with no bad taste.</li>
            <li> The best lipstick remover for long wearing lipstick</li>
