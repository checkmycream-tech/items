            <li>Flossing the front, top and bottom front teeth for me is easy.</li>
            <li>The floss part of these are more than fine.  </li>

            <li>Easy to use because of the angled design.</li>

            <li>The floss is really strong and does not break.  </li>
            <li>strong floss doesn&#x27;t pull out of holder.</li>
            <li>It does fray a little but still the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The Floss is secure and does not break which is great when cleaning back teeth.</li>

            <li>These are great for those back teeth, which is why I will continue to buy them.</li>
            <li>so fresh &amp; so clean!</li>
            <li>Use after every meal for that fantastic smile and a healthier mouth plus they are easy to carry around for convenience</li>
            <li>I&#x27;l like the original better,&lt;br</li>
            <li>original is like a tape, this one is like string.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>prefer the original.</li>
            <li>I originally had another brand name that I can no longer find.  </li>
            <li>Great, as expected.</li>
            <li>They last a good while too if you just use them morning and evening.</li>
            <li>They really do the job as they are made to do :)</li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t notice that there were specific piks for problem teeth, but since I began using this brand, the piks come out easily.</li>
            <li>In truth, I consider myself lucky for how things turned out.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy to have found Complete Clean Floss Piks for Back Teeth.</li>
            <li>These picks are amazing and has made me floss regularly.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s almost fun.  </li>
            <li>That floss GLIDES in between the teeth easily and just as easily pops back out.</li>
            <li>My tartar is so under control right now that I have seven boyfriends.</li>
            <li>These are great floss picks to get between those very tight teeth.</li>
            <li>So handy to have these - I keep a bag in my car and a bag on the first floor of the house for those times that something gets stuck in my back teeth</li>
            <li>I found out I could buy it for less locally, but I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>They are great for getting at hard to reach back teeth and the minty flavor is nice for fresher breath.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really care for the offset floss design nor the super flimsy pick end.  </li>
            <li>These are at the right angle to clean back teeth, which are the important grinders.</li>
            <li>The regular ones work a lot better for me.</li>
            <li>Much better than flossing with blue fingers.</li>
            <li>OK CANT SAY ENOUGH.</li>
            <li>Regular floss picks are abundantly available in stores however do not get job done of reaching between spaces in the back rows of teeth as effectively.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Thanks DenTek!</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s not saying much since I rarely flossed up until about a year ago.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but realize Walmart is only $2.75 for 75 ct</li>
            <li>I am able to reach way back to in between my molars and can also use the bristled end to floss under my metal permanent retainer.</li>
            <li>Not as easy to use as regular pics, but worth it, if you need to keep your teeth, hh</li>
            <li>Complete Clean Floss Picks for travel since they are more flat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These would be great for people who have teeth with no back crowns / fillings - otherwise if you aren&#x27;t careful (or panic)</li>
            <li>Each pick seems good for 4-5 uses (as opposed to the glide picks which would only last one use or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strong plastic and, more importantly, firm floss!</li>
            <li>Easily reach back teeth (without putting your whole hand in your mouth!)</li>
            <li>I really want them to see how much these flosses have helped me out!</li>
            <li>Finally, found these and they even reach all of my wisdom teeth easily.</li>
            <li>Back teeth, front teeth or molars, these are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Once I started using these, my flossing has increased to nearly daily because these are just so convenient and easy.  </li>
            <li>The works well from a design standpoint, the floss itself is too large for my teeth spacing.  </li>
            <li>These are easy to use on absolute any tooth of mine unlike traditional floss.</li>
            <li>On Amazon, there are different quantity options of floss picks available.</li>
            <li>So why wouldn&#x27;t BACK TEETH floss picks be as available in stores?</li>
            <li>I see myself purchasing these again as they are so reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>They have never broken or frayed, but I will not be buying these ever again.</li>
            <li>Has the bristled point which really pulls out debris.</li>
            <li>Because of the way they are angled, it makes it a whole lot easier to get in between each tooth.</li>
            <li>I am now flossing twice a day: after lunch and dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These floss really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy compared to the ones I had before.</li>
            <li>Buy a whole bunch,  but check the pricing.</li>
            <li>shape of holder works very well on both front and rear teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always struggled with the top back teeth, both on the right and left side.</li>
            <li>I use them to remove my Jamberry manicure and normally after one removal, they are destroyed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had issue before, but I have noticed that these get are getting more stuff out from my gum lines than any other floss pick that i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love cool toiletries and beauty products, and these are definitely more fun and less mess than the traditional method.</li>
            <li>I stumbled on these at Target when I couldn&#x27;t find my older floss pics.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my doctor actually picked up on how I needed to floss in the back more.</li>
            <li>I would much rather use these than the old fashioned dental floss!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend, would buy again, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these floss picks.  </li>
            <li>A little flimsy but at that price Im satisfied.</li>
            <li>These are oriented sideways compared to normal floss picks.</li>
            <li>Love this little picks, fits in the smallest of spaces!</li>
            <li>had no idea that floss piks could vary so much, but apparently they can.</li>
            <li>On the back handle is more of a toothpick and the head has an angled  floss bow that never breaks like some other sticks.</li>
            <li>one doesn&#x27;t tear for sure, but very thin compared to the original</li>
            <li>On the first try this got caught in between my back teeth (right on edge of molar crown) and I had to use a skinny scissor to carefully cut it off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>flexible and has fine round serrations.</li>
            <li>I feel like I do not have to keep my mouth wide open just to get to the molars which means less drool when I am flossing and that is always a good thing.</li>
            <li>Im glad I took a chance because the string never breaks and it&#x27;s easier for me to get hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>The floss is strong and doesn&#x27;t break when I floss between my very tight teeth.</li>
            <li>Dentek Complete Clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I prefer this style because it makes it so much easier to get the back molars.</li>
            <li>The plastic handle part is too soft and flexible</li>
            <li>These last much longer.</li>
            <li>The DenTek Complete</li>
            <li>Since I have the attention span of a baby newt, I&#x27;m only likely to do things like flossing if it&#x27;s made fun for me.</li>
            <li>these are the best for people that hate flossing like myself -  </li>
            <li>The pick sides have little serrations that really clean between the teeth.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use then the flat style.</li>
            <li>I started taking oral hygiene a lot more seriously since I had a tooth ache.</li>
            <li>I have one tooth in particular at the back of my mouth that grabs on to the piks and won&#x27;t let me remove  the pik.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this particular one is the pick on the handle.</li>
            <li>One thing is I don&#x27;t find th very cost effective because you have to use at least a few of them per sitting.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to floss with and the floss itself breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>they can easily get caught - I had my other half try it too and same exact problem - we threw them out - NEXT!</li>
            <li>I floss every single day now, and my gums are much, much healthier, because of these picks.</li>
            <li>The pick itself is thick and comfortable grip.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; style is apparently the only one that works well for me.</li>
            <li>I like that these are vertical rather than the typical horizontal floss picks so they are much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>They utilize a thin floss and make flossing easy.</li>
            <li>The floss is thin and does not fray easily.</li>

            <li> These are great for those back teeth, which is why I will continue to buy them.</li>
            <li> so fresh &amp; so clean!</li>
            <li> Use after every meal for that fantastic smile and a healthier mouth plus they are easy to carry around for convenience</li>
            <li> I&#x27;l like the original better,&lt;br</li>
            <li> original is like a tape, this one is like string.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> prefer the original.</li>
            <li> I originally had another brand name that I can no longer find.  </li>
            <li> Great, as expected.</li>
            <li> They last a good while too if you just use them morning and evening.</li>
            <li> They really do the job as they are made to do :)</li>
            <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t notice that there were specific piks for problem teeth, but since I began using this brand, the piks come out easily.</li>
            <li> In truth, I consider myself lucky for how things turned out.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy to have found Complete Clean Floss Piks for Back Teeth.</li>
            <li> These picks are amazing and has made me floss regularly.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s almost fun.  </li>
            <li> That floss GLIDES in between the teeth easily and just as easily pops back out.</li>
            <li> My tartar is so under control right now that I have seven boyfriends.</li>
            <li> These are great floss picks to get between those very tight teeth.</li>
            <li> So handy to have these - I keep a bag in my car and a bag on the first floor of the house for those times that something gets stuck in my back teeth</li>
            <li> I found out I could buy it for less locally, but I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> They are great for getting at hard to reach back teeth and the minty flavor is nice for fresher breath.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really care for the offset floss design nor the super flimsy pick end.  </li>
            <li> These are at the right angle to clean back teeth, which are the important grinders.</li>
            <li> The regular ones work a lot better for me.</li>
            <li> Much better than flossing with blue fingers.</li>
            <li> OK CANT SAY ENOUGH.</li>
            <li> Regular floss picks are abundantly available in stores however do not get job done of reaching between spaces in the back rows of teeth as effectively.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Thanks DenTek!</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not saying much since I rarely flossed up until about a year ago.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but realize Walmart is only $2.75 for 75 ct</li>
            <li> I am able to reach way back to in between my molars and can also use the bristled end to floss under my metal permanent retainer.</li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as regular pics, but worth it, if you need to keep your teeth, hh</li>
            <li> Complete Clean Floss Picks for travel since they are more flat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These would be great for people who have teeth with no back crowns / fillings - otherwise if you aren&#x27;t careful (or panic)</li>
            <li> Each pick seems good for 4-5 uses (as opposed to the glide picks which would only last one use or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strong plastic and, more importantly, firm floss!</li>
            <li> Easily reach back teeth (without putting your whole hand in your mouth!)</li>
            <li> I really want them to see how much these flosses have helped me out!</li>
            <li> Finally, found these and they even reach all of my wisdom teeth easily.</li>
            <li> Back teeth, front teeth or molars, these are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Once I started using these, my flossing has increased to nearly daily because these are just so convenient and easy.  </li>
            <li> The works well from a design standpoint, the floss itself is too large for my teeth spacing.  </li>
            <li> These are easy to use on absolute any tooth of mine unlike traditional floss.</li>
            <li> On Amazon, there are different quantity options of floss picks available.</li>
            <li> So why wouldn&#x27;t BACK TEETH floss picks be as available in stores?</li>
            <li> I see myself purchasing these again as they are so reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> They have never broken or frayed, but I will not be buying these ever again.</li>
            <li> Has the bristled point which really pulls out debris.</li>
            <li> Because of the way they are angled, it makes it a whole lot easier to get in between each tooth.</li>
            <li> I am now flossing twice a day: after lunch and dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These floss really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy compared to the ones I had before.</li>
            <li> Buy a whole bunch,  but check the pricing.</li>
            <li> shape of holder works very well on both front and rear teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with the top back teeth, both on the right and left side.</li>
            <li> I use them to remove my Jamberry manicure and normally after one removal, they are destroyed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had issue before, but I have noticed that these get are getting more stuff out from my gum lines than any other floss pick that i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love cool toiletries and beauty products, and these are definitely more fun and less mess than the traditional method.</li>
            <li> I stumbled on these at Target when I couldn&#x27;t find my older floss pics.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my doctor actually picked up on how I needed to floss in the back more.</li>
            <li> I would much rather use these than the old fashioned dental floss!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend, would buy again, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these floss picks.  </li>
            <li> A little flimsy but at that price Im satisfied.</li>
            <li> These are oriented sideways compared to normal floss picks.</li>
            <li> Love this little picks, fits in the smallest of spaces!</li>
            <li> had no idea that floss piks could vary so much, but apparently they can.</li>
            <li> On the back handle is more of a toothpick and the head has an angled  floss bow that never breaks like some other sticks.</li>
            <li> one doesn&#x27;t tear for sure, but very thin compared to the original</li>
            <li> On the first try this got caught in between my back teeth (right on edge of molar crown) and I had to use a skinny scissor to carefully cut it off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> flexible and has fine round serrations.</li>
            <li> I feel like I do not have to keep my mouth wide open just to get to the molars which means less drool when I am flossing and that is always a good thing.</li>
            <li> Im glad I took a chance because the string never breaks and it&#x27;s easier for me to get hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> The floss is strong and doesn&#x27;t break when I floss between my very tight teeth.</li>
            <li> Dentek Complete Clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I prefer this style because it makes it so much easier to get the back molars.</li>
            <li> The plastic handle part is too soft and flexible</li>
            <li> These last much longer.</li>
            <li> The DenTek Complete</li>
            <li> Since I have the attention span of a baby newt, I&#x27;m only likely to do things like flossing if it&#x27;s made fun for me.</li>
            <li> these are the best for people that hate flossing like myself -  </li>
            <li> The pick sides have little serrations that really clean between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use then the flat style.</li>
            <li> I started taking oral hygiene a lot more seriously since I had a tooth ache.</li>
            <li> I have one tooth in particular at the back of my mouth that grabs on to the piks and won&#x27;t let me remove  the pik.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this particular one is the pick on the handle.</li>
            <li> One thing is I don&#x27;t find th very cost effective because you have to use at least a few of them per sitting.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to floss with and the floss itself breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> they can easily get caught - I had my other half try it too and same exact problem - we threw them out - NEXT!</li>
            <li> I floss every single day now, and my gums are much, much healthier, because of these picks.</li>
            <li> The pick itself is thick and comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; style is apparently the only one that works well for me.</li>
            <li> I like that these are vertical rather than the typical horizontal floss picks so they are much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> They utilize a thin floss and make flossing easy.</li>
            <li> The floss is thin and does not fray easily.</li>
            <li> These work similarly, however the floss is lower quality and do not last as long.</li>
            <li> Finding floss and picks to easily access back molars has been difficult.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor doesn&#x27;t last long,  but you&#x27;re not using them for the minty taste.  </li>
            <li> Quick little rant when I say that I have a hard time finding BACK TEETH floss picks in stores specifically.</li>
            <li> However, they are a bit larger due since the floss head is set perpendicular to the handle, so I use and recommend the regular DenTek</li>
            <li> hope this product stays around for a long time.</li>
            <li> It makes the handle a little more difficult to hold onto.</li>
            <li> Regular floss, glide floss and glide floss picks all work to one extent or the other</li>
            <li> My mouth is small, and I find the &#x27;normal&#x27; straight floss picks to be difficult to work with.  </li>
            <li> Also harder to get into the space around my implant in #30.</li>
            <li> I tugged on it gently to no avail.</li>
            <li> I use them daily, usually at night.</li>
            <li> a plastic 2 sided comb on the other end works like a proxi-brush for cleaning gums.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m having a hard time getting use to them put</li>
            <li> No more struggling with the long tangled string of floss.</li>
            <li> Trying to get floss between my teeth is a bear at times, the molars are so tightly pressed together that every other floss product I&#x27;ve tried has shredded midway through flossing.</li>
            <li> Slight mint flavor.  </li>
            <li> I would also like to point out they are slightly flavored which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> These are long and hard to get in between my teeth.</li>
            <li> The floss doesn&#x27;t come out of the plastic on my tightly spaced teeth like some of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Tight teeth?</li>
            <li> They work well for someone who fights to get floss between teeth that are tightly packed together.</li>
            <li> Both teeth are tight together.</li>
            <li> The floss went down in between a plain tooth and a capped tooth</li>
            <li> and they beat store prices by a little.</li>
            <li> I can reuse them by soaking in a little alcohol after each use.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a few things I like to say are God&#x27;s gift to us, Amazon being 1 of them.</li>
            <li> Not easy to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Some of my teeth are very tight.</li>
            <li> I floss each night and usually break my floss 1-3 times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the spaces between my teeth are much smaller than everyone else&#x27;s because I find the pick end of these useless.  </li>
            <li> It was hard and sharper than I like.</li>
            <li> I have hated the side type of floss-pick as it was hard to properly get to the back teeth, and whatever type I had used broke the floss, so I never recommended them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no good with holding the floss string so these make my life a lot easier.  </li>
            <li> I hate dragging that old line out</li>
            <li> The floss doesn&#x27;t snap, it&#x27;s not paper thin.  </li>
            <li> yet I haven’t broken one of these yet.</li>
            <li> I am addicted.</li>
            <li> it is thin.</li>
            <li> Although a trifle difficult for me to use, these work well at digging in the masticating mines.</li>
            <li> You can imagine how scary that can be if you have something stuck in your teeth</li>
            <li> My experience with this pick was scary.</li>
            <li> Bristled pick is difficult to use.</li>
            <li> These are just awkward to use.</li>
            <li> its just so darn inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, as it makes flossing my molars very difficult without hurting the sides of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I never realized how bad it was until I started using these.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate flossing....</li>
            <li> Literally the worst floss I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My teeth could have been a lot worst off.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> happy to see the other end had a great tool for cleaning in between teeth.</li>
            <li> could not find the product at Target any more  so glad the Amazon carries the day</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. The regular ones work a lot better for me. Even for my back teeth. These are just awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Love these!  I would much rather use these than the old fashioned dental floss!  Plus, love the pick part!</li>
            <li> On the first try this got caught in between my back teeth (right on edge of molar crown) and I had to use a skinny scissor to carefully cut it off.&lt;br /&gt;These would be great for people who have teeth with no back crowns / fillings - otherwise if you aren&#x27;t careful (or panic) they can easily get caught - I had my other half try it too and same exact problem - we threw them out - NEXT!</li>
            <li> These are great for back teeth.</li>
            <li> Although a trifle difficult for me to use, these work well at digging in the masticating mines. Tastes good, too.</li>
            <li> Much better than flossing with blue fingers.</li>
            <li> Always needed.  can not always find in stores.</li>
            <li> these are the best for people that hate flossing like myself -  easy breasy so fresh &amp; so clean!</li>
            <li> Dentek Complete Clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea that floss piks could vary so much, but apparently they can. I have one tooth in particular at the back of my mouth that grabs on to the piks and won&#x27;t let me remove  the pik. You can imagine how scary that can be if you have something stuck in your teeth and you can&#x27;t get it out. Obviously, it will come out eventually, but your heart is pounding by the time you finally get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I used the entire bag before I realized that all piks are not created equal and I&#x27;m so happy to have found Complete Clean Floss Piks for Back Teeth. To be honest, I didn&#x27;t notice that there were specific piks for problem teeth, but since I began using this brand, the piks come out easily. And now I know why... it&#x27;s all in the shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros...&lt;br /&gt;minty taste&lt;br /&gt;easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;perfect length for those back teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons...&lt;br /&gt;the package says that they are shred proof, but they are not. I shred them all the time but they don&#x27;t break thankfully.</li>
            <li> Great Floss picks. Best I tried to get between the back teeth. They last a good while too if you just use them morning and evening.</li>
            <li> good and strong doesn&#x27;t tear easy</li>
            <li> So handy to have these - I keep a bag in my car and a bag on the first floor of the house for those times that something gets stuck in my back teeth and I don&#x27;t have any floss handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DenTek should form a partnership with beef jerky companies to include one of these floss sticks in each bag of beef jerky that is sold in America.</li>
            <li> OK CANT SAY ENOUGH. I hate dragging that old line out like I&#x27;m about to cut some cheese or something. I don&#x27;t hate flossing....its just so darn inconvenient. These picks are amazing and has made me floss regularly. On the back handle is more of a toothpick and the head has an angled  floss bow that never breaks like some other sticks. Not to mention the minty flavor. These should be apart of everyone&#x27;s bathroom</li>
            <li> I did perfect for me. I can&#x27;t find these in the shops nearby.</li>
            <li> Product as described. I have purchased this product before and I would purchase again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Slight mint flavor.  The floss doesn&#x27;t come out of the plastic on my tightly spaced teeth like some of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Den tek is just great.  The floss doesn&#x27;t snap, it&#x27;s not paper thin.  The pick itself is thick and comfortable grip. I know mine said it was mint.  The floss itself isn&#x27;t mint, but the toothpick at the bottom is mint.  Speaking of the tooth pick, now I have yet to use it or need it but it is a bit on the flimsy side and I would be worried that if needed it would simply bend and wiggle around any stuck food.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Oral Hygiene is important.&amp;#34; I am gonna end this review the way I started it. On Amazon, there are different quantity options of floss picks available. Quick little rant when I say that I have a hard time finding BACK TEETH floss picks in stores specifically. Regular floss picks are abundantly available in stores however do not get job done of reaching between spaces in the back rows of teeth as effectively. So why wouldn&#x27;t BACK TEETH floss picks be as available in stores? There&#x27;s a few things I like to say are God&#x27;s gift to us, Amazon being 1 of them. I love them, use them &amp; plan on buying more when needed. These are a must have b/c &amp;#34;Oral Hygiene is Important.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over a month now and I find almost as much joy using them as the day I received them. I haven&#x27;t used &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; floss since I&#x27;ve had these as they are better all around. These are easy to use on absolute any tooth of mine unlike traditional floss. I would also like to point out they are slightly flavored which is an added bonus. I see myself purchasing these again as they are so reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve used 10 already and none of them have snapped. It does fray a little but still the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> floss gets stuck in teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using these a lot and they beat store prices by a little.</li>
            <li> I am a retired dentist and these are great. I floss each night and usually break my floss 1-3 times yet I haven’t broken one of these yet. I have hated the side type of floss-pick as it was hard to properly get to the back teeth, and whatever type I had used broke the floss, so I never recommended them. These are at the right angle to clean back teeth, which are the important grinders. I recently had carpal tunnel surgery and could not use both hands. This worked great with my non dominate/ non surgerized hand. I highly recommend, would buy again, and I hope this helps someone. They’re waxed, for those that care.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was hoping for. I prefer this style because it makes it so much easier to get the back molars. The pick end is very nice as well as it helps get out food particles between the teeth if something is really wedged in there.</li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as regular pics, but worth it, if you need to keep your teeth, hh</li>
            <li> Literally the worst floss I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s like putting barbed wire between your teeth. Avoid!!!!</li>
            <li> These are sturdy and angled perfectly.  My mouth is small, and I find the &#x27;normal&#x27; straight floss picks to be difficult to work with.  However, these making flossing easy.  I floss every single day now, and my gums are much, much healthier, because of these picks.</li>
            <li> Strong plastic and, more importantly, firm floss!</li>
            <li> These special angled Floss picks are great!  They allow for a better reach around each tooth.The Floss is secure and does not break which is great when cleaning back teeth.</li>
            <li> Trying to get floss between my teeth is a bear at times, the molars are so tightly pressed together that every other floss product I&#x27;ve tried has shredded midway through flossing. Ugh. This, however, does not shred, gets between all my teeth with ease, and has a brush tip on it. It even tastes good! I won&#x27;t go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> These are the best floss picks on the market.  Easily reach back teeth (without putting your whole hand in your mouth!) and floss does not break or shred.</li>
            <li> This was a reorder, The package content was 75 pieces this time instead of 30 (better), I find these easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> You have not flossed your teeth until you have used these floss picks. I am addicted. I never realized how bad it was until I started using these. They are very very effective and comfortable to use!</li>
            <li> Love these. Durable and effective.</li>
            <li> Does what needs to be done.</li>
            <li> These are the best floss picks I&#x27;ve ever used.  The floss is really strong and does not break.  The fact that they&#x27;re angled makes it easy to reach your wisdom teeth.  The pick sides have little serrations that really clean between the teeth. This was a great find!</li>
            <li> The plastic handle part is too soft and flexible so it&#x27;s hard to floss with and the floss itself breaks easily.  Going back to GUM brand</li>
            <li> use these things ALL the time!!! big fan!!!</li>
            <li> taste like mint.  have a lot in the bag. Can last for 21/2 months depending how often you use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no good with holding the floss string so these make my life a lot easier.  I stumbled on these at Target when I couldn&#x27;t find my older floss pics.  Im glad I took a chance because the string never breaks and it&#x27;s easier for me to get hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> I like that these are vertical rather than the typical horizontal floss picks so they are much easier to use.  And these have a flossy toothpick on the end giving them double duty.  I can reuse them by soaking in a little alcohol after each use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the spaces between my teeth are much smaller than everyone else&#x27;s because I find the pick end of these useless.  They collapse and bend at the joint when I try to insert them between my teeth rendering them unusable.  The floss part of these are more than fine.  They have never broken or frayed, but I will not be buying these ever again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;l like the original better,&lt;br /&gt;this one doesn&#x27;t tear for sure, but very thin compared to the original and somehow it gets stuck easier.&lt;br /&gt;The original is like a tape, this one is like string.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the original.</li>
            <li> My tartar is so under control right now that I have seven boyfriends. Thanks DenTek! Mitch Hedberg forever.</li>
            <li> These are a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;!  Much easier to use then the flat style.</li>
            <li> I originally had another brand name that I can no longer find.  These work similarly, however the floss is lower quality and do not last as long.</li>
            <li> Love this little picks, fits in the smallest of spaces!</li>
            <li> Love these. Well made. Floss doesn&#x27;t tear. Has the bristled point which really pulls out debris.</li>
            <li> These are oriented sideways compared to normal floss picks. I don&#x27;t like it, as it makes flossing my molars very difficult without hurting the sides of my mouth. Also harder to get into the space around my implant in #30. Disappointed. Otherwise, they do what they are intended.</li>
            <li> This product is a part of my AM and PM dental hygiene regimen. The picks work GREAT and it&#x27;s a PLUS that they are minty!!</li>
            <li> These are the best dental floss picks by far! They are angled properly - not sideways like all the others. Because of the way they are angled, it makes it a whole lot easier to get in between each tooth. My husband uses these religiously after each meal. I use them daily, usually at night. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> very good product, will  recommend</li>
            <li> The works well from a design standpoint, the floss itself is too large for my teeth spacing.  The &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; style is apparently the only one that works well for me.</li>
            <li> I like this style of floss pick because you can get to the back teeth. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this particular one is the pick on the handle. It makes the handle a little more difficult to hold onto. I probably won&#x27;t buy them again. The dollar tree carries one  that I  like much better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Easy to use because of the angled design.</li>
            <li> Not as good as those from Glide.</li>
            <li> not the best quality, it&#x27;s a bit tricky to use, but these are not the worst picks either..&lt;br /&gt;search for more sturdy alternatives if you can, but if you end up buying this - you won&#x27;t make a huge mistake. they are usable.</li>
            <li> These actually help with my gum line and the dentist was quite impressed.  Took me some time to get used to them because they are much more durable than the Glide version.  I have tried Glide&#x27;s version and they break very easily.  Definitely would recommend these!!!</li>
            <li> These work great, I&#x27;m on my second bag.  The angle of these works way better then the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Tight teeth? These are great floss picks to get between those very tight teeth. The angle allows for better handling and ability to push and get to the gum line. Finding floss and picks to easily access back molars has been difficult. Finally, found these and they even reach all of my wisdom teeth easily. It&#x27;s great to hear the hygienist call out a lot of &amp;#34;2s&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;3s&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;4s&amp;#34; when checking the gums!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best teeth floss I&#x27;ve used. But that&#x27;s not saying much since I rarely flossed up until about a year ago. I started taking oral hygiene a lot more seriously since I had a tooth ache. In truth, I consider myself lucky for how things turned out. My teeth could have been a lot worst off. But not anymore. I am now flossing twice a day: after lunch and dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These floss really gets the job done. The handles are longer and others and the curvature shape makes reaching the back of your teeth with ease. In fact, my doctor actually picked up on how I needed to floss in the back more. Flossing the front, top and bottom front teeth for me is easy. I&#x27;ve always struggled with the top back teeth, both on the right and left side. Not anymore though. These floss picks rocks! I never thought I would be saying this ever but I am actually looking forward to my next dental appointment! I really want them to see how much these flosses have helped me out!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really care for the offset floss design nor the super flimsy pick end.  Trying something else.</li>
            <li> I like this style better than the inline flosses. The minty flavor is noticeable but not over powering</li>
            <li> I love these flossing picks. They work well for someone who fights to get floss between teeth that are tightly packed together. Back teeth, front teeth or molars, these are easy to use. I highly recommend them. I can also get multiple uses from just one pick.</li>
            <li> They really do the job as they are made to do :)</li>
            <li> Awesome quality for the price.  A little flimsy but at that price Im satisfied.</li>
            <li> doing it&#x27;s job :), love it</li>
            <li> Easier to use than dental floss and does a very good job.  I use them for my invalid son and it makes the process of flossing much more efficient. Will continue using them.</li>
            <li> Use after every meal for that fantastic smile and a healthier mouth plus they are easy to carry around for convenience</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product! Very sturdy compared to the ones I had before. I use them to remove my Jamberry manicure and normally after one removal, they are destroyed! These last much longer.</li>
            <li> Since I have the attention span of a baby newt, I&#x27;m only likely to do things like flossing if it&#x27;s made fun for me. I love cool toiletries and beauty products, and these are definitely more fun and less mess than the traditional method. One thing is I don&#x27;t find th very cost effective because you have to use at least a few of them per sitting.</li>
            <li> These work so much better for flossing, it&#x27;s almost fun.  No more struggling with the long tangled string of floss.</li>
            <li> My experience with this pick was scary. The floss went down in between a plain tooth and a capped tooth Both teeth are tight together. The floss would not come back up. It got blocked by a cap. I tugged on it gently to no avail. My dentist had warned me not to pry up the cap or it might come off despite the cement holding it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose not to risk it. I used a scissor to cut the floss so I could remove the pick from my mouth. Never again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to a ribbon floss. That floss GLIDES in between the teeth easily and just as easily pops back out.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but realize Walmart is only $2.75 for 75 ct</li>
            <li> The DenTek Complete Clean Easy Angle Floss Picks are my favorite floss picks for home. They utilize a thin floss and make flossing easy. Once I started using these, my flossing has increased to nearly daily because these are just so convenient and easy.  I highly recommend these floss picks.  However, they are a bit larger due since the floss head is set perpendicular to the handle, so I use and recommend the regular DenTek Complete Clean Floss Picks for travel since they are more flat.</li>
            <li> These are big and don&#x27;t have an angle to it,  I&#x27;m use to using Oral-B glide. These are long and hard to get in between my teeth. I&#x27;ve never had issue before, but I have noticed that these get are getting more stuff out from my gum lines than any other floss pick that i&#x27;ve ever used. Overall I&#x27;m having a hard time getting use to them put I believe they will be great.</li>
            <li> Love the shape of these floss picks, but wish they would go back to the skinny solid end instead of this weird, flimsy, spiky thing.  They are great for getting at hard to reach back teeth and the minty flavor is nice for fresher breath.</li>
            <li> The best for strength, durability and re-use.</li>
            <li> could not get these to work for me. needed to be waxed.</li>
            <li> These things are perfect for those of us who have difficulty getting to the back teeth.  And you definitely need to get the back teeth.  The mint flavor doesn&#x27;t last long,  but you&#x27;re not using them for the minty taste.  Buy a whole bunch,  but check the pricing.</li>
            <li> I found out I could buy it for less locally, but I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  The floss is strong and doesn&#x27;t break when I floss between my very tight teeth.</li>
            <li> Bristled pick is difficult to use.</li>
            <li> These are the best floss picks I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Some of my teeth are very tight. Regular floss, glide floss and glide floss picks all work to one extent or the other however I need a pick device rather than regular floss or a floss holder to reach all of the spaces especially around 3d molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pick is the best I have ever used. The floss is thin and does not fray easily. Each pick seems good for 4-5 uses (as opposed to the glide picks which would only last one use or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the pick end. it is thin. flexible and has fine round serrations. Very good for really cleaning between teeth and removing material the floss does not catch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this product stays around for a long time.</li>
            <li> strong floss doesn&#x27;t pull out of holder. a plastic 2 sided comb on the other end works like a proxi-brush for cleaning gums. shape of holder works very well on both front and rear teeth.</li>
            <li> the angle on the pics are great. I feel like I do not have to keep my mouth wide open just to get to the molars which means less drool when I am flossing and that is always a good thing.</li>
            <li> Great, as expected. Not easy to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these flossers. I am able to reach way back to in between my molars and can also use the bristled end to floss under my metal permanent retainer.</li>
            <li> These are great for those back teeth, which is why I will continue to buy them. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the brush at the end. It was hard and sharper than I like.</li>
            <li> These are easier to use than floss.</li>
