            <li>For beginners this is a great glue, it holds ok if you put a lot but don&#x27;t expect to get it out of your hair after without a fine toothed comb after the wefts are out.</li>

            <li>&lt;br /&gt;fray check fabric glue is much better for sealing your weafs.</li>
            <li>Well after many years of using liqiud gold to fuse my hair wefts,</li>
            <li>I think this is an okay, product.</li>
            <li>Works lovely.</li>
            <li>it was on backorder for about a week which is okay</li>
            <li>i have always used this glue it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I do wish that packaging was better.</li>
            <li>Otherwise love this.</li>
            <li>looking for a better one</li>
            <li>This stuff is easy to get all mucked up.</li>
            <li>Can go easily 6-8 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Removes easily with C-22 citrus solvent.  </li>
            <li>it is super strong and holds superbly for a long time.</li>
            <li>My product came very fast, it was in great conditions and was very sercure and protected in the packaging wrap, i will have another review after I apply the glue to the tracks of my brazilian cuely hair that I purchased on here also.</li>
            <li>It is a great product bt, it does turn white for some reason.</li>
            <li>is actually worth that or not?!</li>
            <li>And it looked fresh!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product to do glue ins on my own hair, using wefted hair (most recently, saga brand).  </li>
            <li>IT MAKES IT SUPER STICKY..</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>some slipped right out.</li>
            <li>IM PRETTY MUCH</li>
            <li>USE 100% PURE ACETONE..</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s easy to get a nice thin line across your weft before setting it.  </li>
            <li>I wish it dried black and it sealed better!!!</li>
            <li>it is good for bonding but not very safe for your scalp or natural hair.</li>
            <li>i like it as much as clip-ins</li>
            <li>, you can even do three sections of glue like clipins instead of glueing the whole strip, and it doesn&#x27;t damage to much of your hair.</li>
            <li>Meaning, the product i got in the mail looks old and oxidized but still somewhat useful</li>
            <li>It does get the job done, and really sticks the the tracks to your head if you put some on.</li>
            <li>Absolutely.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely.  </li>
            <li>Very sticky.</li>
            <li>It gets really sticky even after one use.</li>
            <li>i am left with sticky tacky extentions that fall out if you perspire, or wash them, when  first glued in they were fine for a few days they felt secure, that was until i washed my hair</li>
            <li>Too strong and very sticky and messy. ..</li>
            <li>im sorry to say that the glue is not as good as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;It used to bond the hair very well, and i could wash my hair regular without it all peeling off my head!!!  </li>
            <li>When I do a whole head, depending on the weight of the hair being attached and other factors like weather, and condition of hair being attached to, this glue will hold for a solid two weeks before your ends start to come up and may need to be reglued, and that&#x27;s with every two/three days full hair wash (and using only leave in conditioner at the ends).</li>
            <li>If you use the brush it comes with, it&#x27;s a huge mess, and I do mean huge.  </li>
            <li>Comes right out with a fine toothed comb and oil tho but wouldnt suggest buying expensive oil to take out because you need a lot.</li>
            <li>NO REGRETS!</li>
            <li>and really holds without all the mess, highly and</li>
            <li>Dried pretty fast with heat and held well for the first few days,</li>
            <li>I have a love and hate relationship with this glue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one it has a very strong and tight hold</li>

            <li> Dried pretty fast with heat and held well for the first few days,</li>
            <li> I have a love and hate relationship with this glue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one it has a very strong and tight hold</li>
            <li> It instantly starts to dry when you are using it</li>
            <li> but the smell turned me away from this for a long time.</li>
            <li> First of all the moment you open the bottle and oxygen hits the product tiny fibers form like taffy making it difficult to apply to the weft.</li>
            <li> it took about a week to dry , then when i installed the hair all of the hair fell out within a week.....</li>
            <li> It used to dry like a rubber bond and held my hair in place,even on holiday for a month in the humidity, and heat!.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Once applied to extensions took awhile to dry.</li>
            <li> never get to finish bottle as soon as air hits it, it starts to dry out</li>
            <li> Way too messy and it barely lasted two washes.</li>
            <li> As soon as I worked out, it started to get loose.</li>
            <li> not good for long and steady applications, go for another brand...</li>
            <li> be careful with this product.</li>
            <li> I was not aware that I needed to purchase another product in order to use this product.  </li>
            <li> Holds extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Also, after a few uses the cap wouldn&#x27;t close properly, and the rest of the glue went to waste</li>
            <li> but the only thing I didnt like is how hard it is to remove them its like superglue</li>
            <li> I went to fix the hair and lone and behold the glue dried out WHILE CLOSED.</li>
            <li> Its a little tacky, you may need help apply wefts with this glue.</li>
            <li> to use&lt;br /&gt;does not dry clear, instead leaves ugly orange buildup&lt;br /&gt;dryes</li>
            <li> I saw this product at a beauty supply store for a little over half the price!</li>
            <li> SOUNDS HARSH..</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t like how messy it is after a few uses and the glue strings everywhere.</li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s been uses a few times I&#x27;ve noticed that to happen.</li>
            <li> When it so called dried</li>
            <li> A waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s messy</li>
            <li> :/  </li>
            <li> i had to add more tracks to cover up the tracks showing, it was terrible</li>
            <li> It was super tough to get out of my hair it stuck so bad and hurt like heck.</li>
            <li> Very messy and hard to maintain while applying.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to brush on  to anything.</li>
            <li> then when it dries it is so hard to get needle through weft to sew.</li>
            <li> It went too thick that when I tried to use it came out in globs and didn&#x27;t stick the weft to my hair.</li>
            <li> The product works well once it is used and dried, but very difficult to apply without getting hair in the brush and those little glue strings all over.</li>
            <li> Now im left with a horrible sticky mess, my hair is covered in sticky glue, that is like chewing gum??</li>
            <li> all broken up</li>
            <li> I USUALLY IMMEDIATELY WASH MY HAIR AND CONDITION LIKE CRAZY.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with this sealant  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the amount is crap of removing it</li>
            <li> I use an infant medicine dropper (the real thin ones with the plunger), to draw up my glue</li>
            <li> Glue holds excellent,BUT it is very difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> but then it is almost impossible to remove and the remover doesn&#x27;t get it all out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received a bad batch or something...</li>
            <li> This product was horrible.  </li>
            <li> Horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very messy and hard to maintain while applying.</li>
            <li> It was a great choice.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair glue to attach my extensions. it is super strong and holds superbly for a long time. however this cannot be used on your hair or scalp because it burns like hell and it also hardens and doesnt come out of your hair. be careful with this product. it is good for bonding but not very safe for your scalp or natural hair. if you wanna try this it MUST be used with Grow Protect Solution. I repeat this stuff burns. but if used properly can have the desired effect without damage.</li>
            <li> IM PRETTY MUCH A HAIR EXTENSION PRO. BEEN WEARING THEM FOR YEARSSSSSSS&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE ONE SET THAT IS &amp;#34;CLIP IN&amp;#34; AND ONE OR TWO SETS I LIKE TO &amp;#34;BOND&amp;#34; IN IF I AM GOING SOMEWHERE I DONT WANT THEM TO FALL OUT. I HAVE USED THE WHITE BONDING GLUE AT SALLYS IT LASTS ME ABOUT 3-4 DAYS ..THATS ASSUMING I DONT WASH MY HAIR...THEN AFTER 3-4 DAYS MY WEFTS START FALLING OUT :/  NOWWW THIS STUFF HERE...INCREDIBLE BONDING POWER...DO NOT..I REPEAT DO NOT GET IT ON YOUR SKIN AKA SCALP I SHOULD SAY.&lt;br /&gt;THIS WILL HOLD LIKE CRAZY.&lt;br /&gt;~~TIP~~ IF YOU WANT TO REMOVE THIS GLUE..DONT USE A BOND REMOVER IT MAKES IT SUPER STICKY.. USE 100% PURE ACETONE..ITLL TAKE THE WEFT RIGHT OUT!!! I KNOW  I KNOW..SOUNDS HARSH..AND IT PROLLY IS. BUTTT.... IT LOOSENS THE GLUE AND YOUR WEFT WILL POP RIGHT OUT I USUALLY IMMEDIATELY WASH MY HAIR AND CONDITION LIKE CRAZY.</li>
            <li> i used this glue to seal my wefts. it took about a week to dry , then when i installed the hair all of the hair fell out within a week..... i had to add more tracks to cover up the tracks showing, it was terrible</li>
            <li> I have not used the product.  I was not aware that I needed to purchase another product in order to use this product.  If the advertisement would have stated the facts, I would have purchase everything I needed at the same time.</li>
            <li> top notch stuff and really holds without all the mess, highly and most definetely recommend for your hair extensions and seller ships it immediately no long waiting period, AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> I have a love and hate relationship with this glue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one it has a very strong and tight hold but then it is almost impossible to remove and the remover doesn&#x27;t get it all out so you spend the next week trying to get the oily residue and stickiness out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a latex allergy so I thought this would be perfect for my hair extensions and make them last longer and it did but like I said ugh I&#x27;m not sure the amount is crap of removing it is actually worth that or not?!</li>
            <li> Glue holds excellent,BUT it is very difficult to work with. Its a little tacky, you may need help apply wefts with this glue. If your allergic to latex it is a good product</li>
            <li> This product was horrible.  It did not adhere to extensions or any thing else.  It was rubbery instead of glue&#x3D;like.</li>
            <li> Its a great product for gluing in extensions and it stays put for weeks but the only thing I didnt like is how hard it is to remove them its like superglue and I ended up loosing handfuls of hair so im done gluing them in</li>
            <li> this stuff is great i like it as much as clip-ins, you can even do three sections of glue like clipins instead of glueing the whole strip, and it doesn&#x27;t damage to much of your hair.</li>
            <li> terrible!&lt;br /&gt;hard to use&lt;br /&gt;does not dry clear, instead leaves ugly orange buildup&lt;br /&gt;dryes as you use making the brush and bottle sticky&lt;br /&gt;fray check fabric glue is much better for sealing your weafs.</li>
            <li> VERY GREAT PRODUCT AND DRIES PERFECTLY CLEAR... IF YOU WANT THE SAME LASTING RESULTS AS THE FUSION EXTENSIONS THEN GET THIS.. NO REGRETS! (:</li>
            <li> Well after many years of using liqiud gold to fuse my hair wefts, im sorry to say that the glue is not as good as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;It used to bond the hair very well, and i could wash my hair regular without it all peeling off my head!!!  Now im left with a horrible sticky mess, my hair is covered in sticky glue, that is like chewing gum?? Whars happened to liquid gold? It used to dry like a rubber bond and held my hair in place,even on holiday for a month in the humidity, and heat!.&lt;br /&gt;Now i am left with sticky tacky extentions that fall out if you perspire, or wash them, when  first glued in they were fine for a few days they felt secure, that was until i washed my hair they ALL fell out!!! It took me three hours to reglue them again. I dont want to do this everytime i wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Anybody have this problem??</li>
            <li> I saw this product at a beauty supply store for a little over half the price! And it looked fresh! Meaning, the product i got in the mail looks old and oxidized but still somewhat useful</li>
            <li> I think this is an okay, product. It does get the job done, and really sticks the the tracks to your head if you put some on. I just didn&#x27;t like how messy it is after a few uses and the glue strings everywhere. After it&#x27;s been uses a few times I&#x27;ve noticed that to happen. Also, after a few uses the cap wouldn&#x27;t close properly, and the rest of the glue went to waste and i dropped it and the glass cracked some.</li>
            <li> Way too messy and it barely lasted two washes.</li>
            <li> First of all the moment you open the bottle and oxygen hits the product tiny fibers form like taffy making it difficult to apply to the weft. The consistency is like Bic pen ink with a touch of gum.  Does it seal well? Absolutely.  Will you cuss like a sailor trying to use it? Absolutely.  Will you google another product? Absolutely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t be bothered.  Give me something with a nozzle.</li>
            <li> For beginners this is a great glue, it holds ok if you put a lot but don&#x27;t expect to get it out of your hair after without a fine toothed comb after the wefts are out. It was super tough to get out of my hair it stuck so bad and hurt like heck. Dried pretty fast with heat and held well for the first few days, washed it twice while in and second time some slipped right out. I went to fix the hair and lone and behold the glue dried out WHILE CLOSED. It went too thick that when I tried to use it came out in globs and didn&#x27;t stick the weft to my hair. Comes right out with a fine toothed comb and oil tho but wouldnt suggest buying expensive oil to take out because you need a lot.</li>
            <li> Works lovely. Used for my lock extensions. Does leave white stick residue. Can be removed with ease however. I&#x27;d order again anytime.</li>
            <li> My product came very fast, it was in great conditions and was very sercure and protected in the packaging wrap, i will have another review after I apply the glue to the tracks of my brazilian cuely hair that I purchased on here also.</li>
            <li> It is a great product bt, it does turn white for some reason. I will try it again. Maybe the formula should be re-evaluated.</li>
            <li> This stuff is easy to get all mucked up. It instantly starts to dry when you are using it and it is hard to brush on  to anything. The product works well once it is used and dried, but very difficult to apply without getting hair in the brush and those little glue strings all over.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a while back through here and never had opened or used it before. I don&#x27;t know if I received a bad batch or something...but upon opening up this bottle I couldn&#x27;t help but gasp for air at the horrid chemical odor that ended up hitting me in the face. It smelled like gasoline and rotten eggs! I also couldn&#x27;t help but notice the &amp;#34;new improved&amp;#34; sticker on top of the applicator, but I figured there was no point in voicing a complaint and going through the trouble of sending it back. I took a glass pump/applicator and applied it to a weft, the smell was unbearable! I don&#x27;t think I could bring myself to purchasing another bottle of this product ever again, perhaps I might try the tube version...but the smell turned me away from this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product to do glue ins on my own hair, using wefted hair (most recently, saga brand).  I use an infant medicine dropper (the real thin ones with the plunger), to draw up my glue and then it&#x27;s easy to get a nice thin line across your weft before setting it.  If you use the brush it comes with, it&#x27;s a huge mess, and I do mean huge.  When I do a whole head, depending on the weight of the hair being attached and other factors like weather, and condition of hair being attached to, this glue will hold for a solid two weeks before your ends start to come up and may need to be reglued, and that&#x27;s with every two/three days full hair wash (and using only leave in conditioner at the ends).</li>
            <li> Very sticky. Once applied to extensions took awhile to dry. When it so called dried it was still sticky. Couldn&#x27;t leave in hair that sticky and had to remove.</li>
            <li> A waste of my money and time. #1 it was on backorder for about a week which is okay but when they sent me the product all broken up that was the end. they glue is soooooo tacky, when u take the brush out the bottle it drags out the slimy glue leaving a sticky trail of weave bond every where. then when it dries it is so hard to get needle through weft to sew. I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> does not stick well, if u workout or sweat turns white. never get to finish bottle as soon as air hits it, it starts to dry out</li>
            <li> i have always used this glue it is my favorite. I do wish that packaging was better. It gets really sticky even after one use. It should be In a a squeeze tube that would be wonderful. Otherwise love this. Hold my extensions in and i just sock my hair in baby oil when im ready for it to come out :D</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with this sealant  It dries and looks white!!!!!  I wish it dried black and it sealed better!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bond my hair at all.  As soon as I worked out, it started to get loose.</li>
            <li> Too strong and very sticky and messy. ..</li>
            <li> Horrible it&#x27;s messy and it&#x27;s not transparent as they claim</li>
            <li> not good for long and steady applications, go for another brand... i wouldnt ever use this product again... looking for a better one</li>
            <li> Holds extremely well.  Can go easily 6-8 weeks.  Removes easily with C-22 citrus solvent.  Great for making no sew wefts.</li>
