            <li>I really wish the stores will bring it back.</li>
            <li>was not able to fine it anywhere and was about to run out.</li>

            <li>This is an effective deodorant that unfortunately is unavailable at stores.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> the original tussy that i am use to is cream type not white and soft.  i have to use it cause i have already paid for it.  i am not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> Husband used this for years.  All of a sudden we could not find on the store shelves.  Thanks goodness to Amazon we found it on line with a great price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else I need to say.  The four jars will last me about a year.  My wife thanks you!</li>
            <li> Can only get this online it seems. Don&#x27;t like to use antiperspirants. Tussy is one of the few that doesn&#x27;t have antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> I love tussy. it is the only thing I use. was not able to fine it anywhere and was about to run out. got address from container and was able to find it online. I am so glad you sell it.  I cannot us any product and this one works.  Thanks</li>
            <li> it keep my dry and smell very good&lt;br /&gt;and I would tell a friend&lt;br /&gt;its a good product to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant cream for sixty seven  years. never have had any problems. It. holds for hears. I can not find it in stores so I ordered it on line. However my children have their laughs about me never changing after all these years. I have tried to change, but always go back to my  faithful TUSSY cream. When I could not find it in stores anymore one of my children helped me find it on line.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t stop stocking it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream deodorant for decades because it&#x27;s the only one that works for me.  Of course, everyone has a body chemistry all their own, but for me, no other deodorant keeps my dry and smelling great all day even in very humid weather.  Know how some deodorants smell great at first, but wear off within a few hours?  Not this one.</li>
            <li> My husband is allergic to all deodorants but Tussy. And that doesn&#x27;t bother him. So we will keep on buying it thank you</li>
            <li> No anti perspirant avoiding that controversy with teh carcinogenic possibilities of anti perspirants, simple to use, and long lasting. Small jar lasts months. if it dries out, water restores it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very good deodorant , cream is the best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years from a teenager when my Mom gave it to me, now I am fifty-five and still used it. Works great and holds. Great thing is that it allows me to sweat and not dry me out. Sad thing is that you cannot find them in many stores today.</li>
            <li> been unable to locate this product until I found it online.  Being able to order this product online was wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant around. I remember using this brand in my youth years to the present. One day I went to the store and I could not find it. I drove around for hours going store to store to find; no luck. I decided to go to Amazon and I found it. I really wish the stores will bring it back. It last past 24 hours, it will not stain your clothes...try it and let me know what you think.</li>
            <li> Very quick everything was perfect. Thank you David Delaney</li>
            <li> have used for years. got to where I could not find it now that I have I am happy again</li>
            <li> This is an effective deodorant that unfortunately is unavailable at stores. It arrived quickly when I ordered it. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tussy since I was a teenager and I am now a Senior - hard to find in stores now so it was great to find here.  good shipping - product as described and good price</li>
            <li> I have used Tussy for forty years after it was recommended by my doctor.  Other deodorants caused rash and kernels under my arms.  I have had no problems since I switched.  I have not been able to find in the local stores this year and was just about out when I found it on Amazon.com.  I was very the day my four pack arrived in the mail.  I will be ordering again as needed.</li>
            <li> This is literally the only underarm deodorant that does trigger an allergic reaction for me. The scent is faint yet pleasant and it last well for an entire day.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR OVER Y0 YEARS.  HARD TO FIND.  THANKS, AMALZON</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase from Vision Marketplace. Tussy is the only thing I can use. My products came within the time stated. I was satisfied and would consider a future purchase. My only thing, I wish there was a way to &amp;#34;track&amp;#34; the delivery as to where exactly your merchandise is on the third or fifth day that is within your 1 week or 2 week delivery. Other than that, I was satisfied with my purchase.  I would recommend this buyer to my friends for future purchases.</li>
            <li> This an excellent deodorant. I am skin sensitive to other deodorants but tussy never gives me a problem. I have used it for more than thirty years. The stores stop selling it and its a little pricier online. Use to pay a dollar a jar but it&#x27;s almost triple that depending on who you purchase it from online.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my husband he was thrilled-it was a surprise addition to a birthday present.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t seem to find it locally. Priced fair. Would like to find it cheaper but was happy to find on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks sm</li>
