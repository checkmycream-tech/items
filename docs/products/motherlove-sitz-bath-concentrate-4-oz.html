            <li>The product is great but the bottle seems designed to spill excess fluid even when you hold a spoon under the lid of the bottle to control the fluid outpouring.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Mother-in-law said it was VERY VERY soothing in her Sitz Bath.</li>
            <li>what it was with my first delivery.</li>
            <li>only wish there was more in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Instantly makes you feel better.</li>
            <li>At least it made the bath pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li>this is mostly used postpartum and no new mama has time to scrub her</li>
            <li>but I enjoyed every single one.</li>
            <li>but it was very soothing</li>
            <li>but when you are done having a baby you really aren&#x27;t in the mood to brew any herbs to sit in.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it very helpful or very soothing ....</li>
            <li>Really helps heal your whole area.</li>

            <li>didn&#x27;t really feel like it made a difference</li>
            <li>I  created pads with this bath a few drop and added warm water and pore into the pad.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>not sure if it was effective or not-</li>
            <li>and this really help to feel a little better.</li>
            <li>Seems mild enough with minimum fragrance.</li>
            <li>Bottle is mainly alcohol.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Who wants to brew a sitz bath when you are sleep deprived and only have a few precious moments before your baby wakes up?!?  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I think this wash was for moms who had babies and the surgery that goes with it.  Seems mild enough with minimum fragrance.</li>
            <li> Wish there was more in the bottle. This lasted 2 baths. Keep in mind that you can&#x27;t take baths for 6-8 weeks post partum. Best use is for soothing some of the less attractive side effects of pregnancy...hemmorhoids and achy muscles.</li>
            <li> Used this postpartum and enjoyed it</li>
            <li> Easy to use and no mess!  Great to use a few times after having a baby.</li>
            <li> not sure if it was effective or not- only allowed for 4 baths-- maybe increase the size of the bottle?</li>
            <li> Very nice and soothing, I used it with sitz bath after my surgery. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used this product for after giving birth to my daughter and it help with making me feel better. I  created pads with this bath a few drop and added warm water and pore into the pad. After I placed them in refrigerator for those time when I was really sore and believe me after birth you are super sore for weeks and this really help to feel a little better.</li>
            <li> Great all natural postpartum product!</li>
            <li> I had a vaginal delivery and needed stitches for a second degred tear. I used this in a sitz bath after every time I went to the bathroom and would soak for 5-10 minutes. I did this along with Earth Mama bottom spray and balm. I also made padsic let with witch hazel, aloe and lavender oil. Not sure what helped the most but I did heal very fast and swelling went away quickly. Healing time was about 1/4 what it was with my first delivery. I&#x27;m not sure how much is attributed to Mother Love but it was very soothing and I will use again for future pregnancies.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish there was more in the bottle. They recommend you use 11oz per gallon of water so there is only enough for 4 gallons. I figure my sitz bath holds half a gallon. I used about 1/4 oz per sitz bath so 1 bottle only lasted about 2 days. I used 2 bottles do had about 4 days worth of sitz bath, would have liked longer but cost was too high to buy more.</li>
            <li> Great product helped with my pain would buy again</li>
            <li> Perfect for postpartum! Very easy to use. Makes up 4 sits baths.</li>
            <li> Who wants to brew a sitz bath when you are sleep deprived and only have a few precious moments before your baby wakes up?!?  Not me!!!  This was perfect.  I used it in my squirt bottle and baths.  I ordered several bottles over the first months.</li>
            <li> Only used this once but felt relief afterwards.</li>
            <li> Instantly makes you feel better. Less irritation, burning, soreness after use with sitz bath bowl. Ordering more until discomfort is completely gone!</li>
            <li> This is good for  healing a lot of sensitive things.  I like having this sitz bath concentrate for more than post birthing types of soreness.</li>
            <li> It worked well, but stained my bathtub! I gave it a 2 stars since I imagine this is mostly used postpartum and no new mama has time to scrub her tub!&lt;br /&gt;The Motherlove herb sitz bath, where you boil the herbs and make your own works just as well but doesn&#x27;t leave marks on the tub</li>
            <li> I have bought this item. This is very useful to my wife. I can strongly recommend this item.&lt;br /&gt;thank you.</li>
            <li> PERFECT FOR YOUNG MOTHERS BUT FELT DID &#x27;NOT&#x27; MEET MY NEEDS.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;s effective. I purchased this at recommendations from others.</li>
            <li> My wife is pregnant and this has really helped!</li>
            <li> Bottle is mainly alcohol. Wish I had not purchased. I recommend checking ingredients carefully before buying anything for postpartum help.</li>
            <li> Easier than making the tea sitz bath yourself. I know it cost more but when you are done having a baby you really aren&#x27;t in the mood to brew any herbs to sit in. I think it was helpful postpartum.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it very helpful or very soothing ....used baking soda mixed with warm water.</li>
            <li> This product works well but is as smelly as any other sitz bath solution.  I love motherlove products and I would probably buy it again after having my next baby.</li>
            <li> The product is great but the bottle seems designed to spill excess fluid even when you hold a spoon under the lid of the bottle to control the fluid outpouring.</li>
            <li> This SItz Bath is absolutely necessary after having a baby! Really helps heal your whole area. It&#x27;s very soothing for your stitches and swelling. I put a lIttle (about 1/8 teaspoon) with a full bottle of water in my little spray bottle to rInse off after each time I went to the bathroom. Alternating with New Mama Bottom Spray and Mama Bottom Balm.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to use after the birth of my daughter.  I think it is a good product, but I have very sensitive skin and it wasn&#x27;t very gentle on my skin.  However, a friend used it after she gave birth and loved it!  I think it just depends on how sensitive you are.</li>
            <li> This was a must have post birth. Daily baths helped healing immensely.</li>
            <li> All I can say is AHHHHH.  Quite a treat after giving birth.  I had two stitches.  You only get four baths from this bottle but I enjoyed every single one.</li>
            <li> Used it for after giving birth. It helped with temporary relief of pain. If I have another kid, will definitely stock up on it again!</li>
            <li> Waste of money, does nothing</li>
            <li> So easy. Since I can&#x27;t compare it to anything I can&#x27;t be sure it helped speed recovery but I figured might as well.  I had a lot of stitches and bruising postpartum and the RNP recommended this for recovery.  At least it made the bath pleasant smelling. I would do it again. Don&#x27;t get the loose jar stuff - who has time for that with a baby around.</li>
            <li> I used this post delivery.... didn&#x27;t really feel like it made a difference (I had some pretty bad tearing and had stitches). Was kind of hard to use (don&#x27;t recommend trying to use it in the back because of ratio to water doesn&#x27;t give you enough water to sit in)</li>
            <li> Mother-in-law said it was VERY VERY soothing in her Sitz Bath.</li>
