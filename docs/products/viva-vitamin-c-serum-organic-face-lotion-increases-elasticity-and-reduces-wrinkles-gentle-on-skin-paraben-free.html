            <li>The ingredients are superb: Vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, Vitamin E, jojoba, MSM (great for skin and hair), horsetail and more.</li>
            <li>I have found Viva Vitamin C Serum to be one of the best products I have ever used in my many years of experimenting with skin products.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, you just feel good applying it to your skin.  </li>
            <li>The oil is pleasant to apply and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The oil is pleasant to apply and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>serum is easily applied with the dropper, which I found to be the perfect applicator.</li>
            <li>C serum is known to be good for skin</li>
            <li>It also has hyaluronic acid and vitamin E, both known to have good effects on the skin.</li>
            <li>And it was surprisingly convenient to use.</li>
            <li>A good shake will redistribute the ingredients and clarify the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Efficacy</li>
            <li>All of these ingredients do good things for your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but Viva Vitamin C Serum was recommended to me and I am VERY glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, is quickly absorbed and provides just wonderful results.  </li>
            <li>I decided to go ahead with my product trial anyway, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>My wife saw positive results (firmer skin and reduce wrinkles) in about two weeks, which was impressive.  </li>
            <li>and I will continue to use it as a effective healing product.</li>
            <li>My review is honest and a result of my own trial of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>I am almost finished with the bottle and can say it is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>To say I&#x27;m thrilled would be an understatement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was sent a sample of this to review, and this represents my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It is intended for use on the face, but is equally effective on problem areas like elbows and knees.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was given the product in exchange for an honest review; this does not affect my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lovely product, easy to apply and absorbs beautifully into the skin.</li>
            <li>This serum comes in a liquid glass bottle with a very easy and convenient eye dropper.  </li>
            <li>Its not greasy and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this Vitamin C Serum!  </li>
            <li>The serum feels good on the skin; feels like it&#x27;s getting absorbed nicely.  </li>
            <li>While I do not have wrinkles, the smoother skin is definitely more moisturized and “plump”, leading me to believe that this Serum will be more than effective against wrinkles around the mouth and crows feet.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I am definitely a huge fan of this product!</li>
            <li>I find my skin is more radiant since I began using this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is nice and light going on skin</li>
            <li>A friend told me my skin tone looked more even.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I could not be more pleased and wholeheartedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>WIN-WIN in my book! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results:  The hyperpigmented spot that had been plaguing my forehead for more than a year is lighter.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something magical about the healing quality of this rejuvenating serum, that must have something to do with the combination of Vitamins C and E with Jojoba.</li>
            <li>love that it is Made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>Both of us love organic products and after talking about it, I decided to try this one out.</li>
            <li>As for as freckles and age spots, I noticed the best results on the back of my hands.  </li>
            <li>I do still struggle with breakouts, although these have been MUCH better controlled since I began using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This product is good.i saw changes in 3 days.i had to order for more bottles and recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li>was provided a free sample for an honest review</li>
            <li>After all, when you are no longer running from a wooly mammoth, you have time to notice that Ugga has fewer wrinkles than Ook, but Ook smells better and has softer skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viva</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t say I am 65, but my skin is...:)</li>
            <li>Saw both ingredients recommended on Dr. Oz and was glad this contains both.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for an effective Vitamin C serum, you will enjoy this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do like the idea of this however, and hopefully I will see results with more time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles on my face</li>
            <li>When I had the opportunity to try Viva Vitamin C serum, I was sure I would like it just because of the hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love, love this item.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>But I haven&#x27;t been using the product for more than a week.</li>
            <li>Pleasant feel and certainly has a soothing feel on the skin.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I love the easy application for this serum.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this review for a complimentary review bottle of this serum I received in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>This winter will be the best test but so far, I think I found the serum I cannot live without. :)</li>
            <li>My face breaks out in rashes easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s colorless and seems to applies easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, no skin reactions whatsoever aside from improved texture and firmness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it absorbs very quickly (fewer than 30 seconds).</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time in the sun with our sons&#x27; sports (I do use sunscreen) and combating the damage to my skin is as easy as smoothing on this serum once</li>
            <li>but nothing compares,  simply the most pure and best.</li>
            <li>just about 2 weeks, my acne looks more better right away.</li>
            <li>Overall a very good product that is worth a try!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been fine.  </li>
            <li>I will say that using this product twice a day for a month brightened my complexion &amp; diminished my fine lines &amp; wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My skin is noticeable brighter and my fine lines aren&#x27;t as noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is bottled in amber glass to protect it from the light, with a dropper cap for easy application that comes sealed in a zipper bag.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and firmer.</li>
            <li>The genuine article, will be ordering again.</li>

            <li>product is really unique.</li>
            <li>Thanks for producing such an incredible product XO</li>
            <li>As I have aged, I have more of an interest in keeping my skin looking as good as I can.  </li>
            <li>It went on clean</li>
            <li>She found that the best way to apply the product to keep it from running down the face was to apply it to her fingertips first then apply to the face.  </li>
            <li>, it soaked right in, and I think it&#x27;s helping with the fine lines I have everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s definitely helping me to take good care of my skin, though,</li>
            <li>, to sum everything up: if you would like a pleasant-smelling, effective Vitamin C Serum that will last for a good while, the Viva Natural Vitamin C Serum is the way to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, to sum everything up: if you would like a pleasant-smelling, effective Vitamin C Serum that will last for a good while, the Viva Natural Vitamin C Serum is the way to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Several good features about the packaging:  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the full ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels nice on the skin, and I was also relieved to see that I didn&#x27;t break out from the product although I have sensitive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying multiple products to try to reverse the aging process, my problem is my skin is very fair and very sensitive, so when a product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and seems to be doing what it is supposed to, I&#x27;m happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just starting using Pacific Rim Vitamin C Serum  has a nice non greasing feel, goes on easy.</li>
            <li>But Viva is very light and absorbs almost instantly, which I love.</li>
            <li>The product was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick  delivery.  </li>
            <li>I like the feel of it and the quick absorption.</li>
            <li>This product is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback was the watery nature of the product, which made it more challenging to apply than some others.  </li>
            <li>They are more like &#x27;creases&#x27; and this is what I mainly used them on.</li>
            <li>mostly botanical formula has ingredients known to benefit the skin such as vitamin C, vegetarian hyaluronic acid, aloe, jojoba oil, and glycerin, many of organic source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use about 5 drops on my face and it gets absorbed really quickly</li>
            <li>VIVA Vitamin C Serum contains many ingredients that are proven to not only brighten your complexion,  but improve the elasticity of your skin, and diminish fine lines &amp; wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product for younger women dealing with under eye wrinkles, and I think it has great potential for older women struggling with beautiful age marks</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product for younger women dealing with under eye wrinkles, and I think it has great potential for older women struggling with beautiful age marks</li>
            <li>It appears to both smooth and even out my skin and because of that, I really like using it before applying foundation.  </li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>No artificial smell</li>
            <li>a woman in my mid-40s, I have become more conscious incorporating anti-aging products into my skincare regimen.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps my skin may have gotten used to this serum eventually, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it for me to find out.  </li>
            <li>still gave this product 3 stars because I believe my own response to it was a very individual one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a constant quest to find effective face products.  </li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about this serum is that, unlike others I&#x27;ve used, this one isn&#x27;t oily or full of &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34; (silicone, dimethicone and the like).</li>
            <li>It calms any irritations and leaves my face feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of Via Vitamin C Serum for testing and review purposes.  </li>
            <li>I really liked: this product is not greasy at all, but it definitely moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li>The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li>As skin care products go, this is right up there.</li>
            <li>We are transitioning between seasons right now (summer to fall)</li>
            <li>an goes right on using you finger</li>
            <li>now, my verdict is: WORTH TRYING if you have dryness, fine lines, hyperpigmentation and have sensitive skin ,but with caution if you are breakout/dermatitis</li>
            <li>Very much like this product and can tell a difference after just a week.  </li>
            <li>It feels like a very light facial mask in that it tightens the area that you apply the serum on.</li>
            <li>My skin did break out the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Have been using it for a couple of months now and my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have just ordered more and this will remain an essential item in my beauty kit forever.</li>
            <li>first, I used it all over my face.</li>
            <li>It is 99% naturally derived, and 72% organic according to the label.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free bottle for purposes of review.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to use this product at first, since the bottle was not sealed.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if there was a big result, but when I stopped using it, I noticed a change in the elasticity of my skin.</li>
            <li>As our ancestors settled into permanent dwellings and had more time to dedicate toward leisure, so too came the interests in personal care and beauty regimens.</li>
            <li>This is the first serum I have ever tried, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li>I love this product and intend to buy it when my current bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The amber bottle helps prevent breakdown of the vitamin C. I also store it away from natural light in order to retain its efficacy.</li>
            <li>First, there are ZERO parabens.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s the first three ingredients that give it the power to transform and improve your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used it now for a few weeks, with good results.</li>
            <li>I was not asked or expected to leave a positive review, and this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and break out easily, so I was a bit worried using a new product on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months.  </li>
            <li>This serum absorbs quickly into the skin with no greasy residue and no discernible smell which may be off-putting to those with a sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>There is a scent, but it&#x27;s very mild, and I can&#x27;t even distinguish it enough to describe it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to work good, just haven&#x27;t had it long enough yet.  </li>
            <li>, but it certainly did help wake my eyes up a bit.</li>
            <li>, but it certainly did help wake my eyes up a bit.</li>
            <li>but it certainly didn&#x27;t &#x27;vanish&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Upon trying this VIVA serum, I liked that it applied easily from the dropper with a thin, spreadable consistency</li>
            <li>Wrinkles and fine lines are diminished, my skin is visibly brighter, and as mentioned earlier, any incidental cuts and abrasions healed amazingly fast, with no signs they were ever there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>The shipment came really fast.  </li>
            <li>It is readily absorbed with no piling on the skin, it just leaves the skin quite soft.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how it worked-</li>
            <li>It really has helped me out.</li>
            <li>I have been using this a couple of weeks once a day, as it was given to me for review,  and I have notice my skin color seems more pink and youthful.</li>
            <li>using this product at night before I go to bed, and I really like the fact that it is odorless.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>as it really does &#x27;plump&#x27; up your skin around the area you apply the serum on.</li>
            <li>,  I found my skin to be much smoother, brighter with many of these rough patches from sun damage to be almost gone.  </li>
            <li>enjoyed good results with this serum both when applied after washing my face with cold water and cleanser and just leaving the serum as is, and also when applying a follow-up moisturizing lotion afterward.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this would work better for someone with drier skin, not someone who is prone to adult acne such as myself.</li>
            <li>After just a few weeks I have noticed that this natural product hydrates my skin, reduces fine lines and helps it to look more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>This was so unique, because unlike with lotions that are heavy and oily, this was really light and airy.</li>
            <li>This comes in a brown bottle that protects the liquid from light, and an eyedropper that&#x27;s rounded on the end.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit thin, and very easy to apply-</li>
            <li>Lastly, since the Serum is “98% Naturally Derived” I am more comfortable recommending this mixture than some other creams and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>serum is worth the money, especially when you see how much the department stores charge for their serums($100 and up).  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!!!, After using Viva Natural Vitamin C Serum for only one month , My skin is soft, fresh and smoother than its ever been.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this serum on the advice of a friend who highly recommended the product-</li>
            <li>Because of the high quality ingredients, this product doesn&#x27;t deteriorate over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and will be replacing it when it runs out.</li>
            <li>but I have had no issues with this product so far really like using it.</li>
            <li>skin seems much smoother, and it is helping to make the fine lines around my eyes less pronounced.  </li>
            <li>I really like this Vitamin C Serum from Viva Natural Skin Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had no negative reaction to this serum at all.  </li>
            <li>however I do have &#x27;laugh&#x27; marks between the nose and upper lip.</li>
            <li>Viva-Vitamin C serum goes on slightly thicker than water, and it soaked right into my skin leaving it ready for the next round of moisturizers I use every day, including a 50-block sunscreen, which was very nice.  </li>
            <li>I may simply have used TOO much at first, but I don&#x27;t want to test using less in those areas and risk more bumpies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I may simply have used TOO much at first, but I don&#x27;t want to test using less in those areas and risk more bumpies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have some slight acne scarring that it seems to be helping to fade also, but I think I need to keep using it longer to see more of a clear improvement in that area.  </li>
            <li>serum feels lighter than the other one I&#x27;ve used, which feels better on my skin (not as sticky), but I&#x27;m not sure if it is quite a strong.</li>
            <li>I have uneven skin tone and rough dry patches on my skin, however, also tend to be sensitive to the ingredients in many serums of this kind.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shopping around for serums to find one that I cannot live without.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any spots diminish on my face, but didn&#x27;t notice any new ones forming.  </li>
            <li>I started a new regimen of products for my face and it works well with a peptide moisturizer I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>It had a nice, non-greasy texture, and it dried relatively quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Natural Skincare has followed in the footsteps of early civilization by using ingredients found in nature combined with the ingenuity of modern science in the creation of their Vitamin C Premium Anti-Aging Serum.</li>
            <li>I also used it while on a boat all summer and didn&#x27;t come back with any extra sunspots and in fact in some light, they seemed to have faded</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be a little rough feeling, but when I smooth this on after washing my skin, it feels so smooth and there is no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a Vitamin C serum and will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li>This serum is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried this past summer.  </li>
            <li>advertised, the product shines up the skin slightly and expands the area that you choose to use it on--for fine wrinkles it will help reduce visibility.</li>
            <li>I have been particularly interested in trying something with Vitamin C given the positive things I have had about this ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serums are still relatively new to me; I have yet to find one that I like enough to use on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about two weeks now and have only had positive results.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to know these days with so many choices....</li>
            <li>The bottle and dropper arrived quickly in the mail and were extremely well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this product to help clear up acne.</li>
            <li>Recommended to those who like myself are looking to try a natural way to avoid using invasive treatments for aging skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and found that the serum did not irritate my skin at all-</li>
            <li>, I will purchase a serum for my 21 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, hydrated, and even looks smoother.  </li>
            <li>but so far, everything is working well.  </li>
            <li>Early days yet</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, then I think this is one you should</li>
            <li>I purchased Viva Vitamin C Serum a month ago and already notice visible improvements in my 58year old skin.</li>
            <li>the Viva Natural Vitamin C serum beats them all.  </li>
            <li>At 22, my mother always told me &amp;#34;It&#x27;s never too early to care about your skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>but it did, and it actually worked really efficiently.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and my old acnes marks are fading.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have sensitive skin &amp; didn&#x27;t have any problems using this</li>
            <li>Chasing eternal youth has been an obsession of humanity dating back to the creation of modern civilization.</li>
            <li>Instant skin softness, with a very silky feel.  </li>
            <li>The glass bottle allows you to see how much you have left</li>
            <li>I do like the serum since it&#x27;s not heavy and does seem to make my complexion look brighter.</li>
            <li>When I checked the list of ingredients, I was pleasantly surprised that there was no &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; or</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is listed as 98% naturally derived / 72% organic.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve never had acne, so</li>
            <li>almost immediately(I am really sensitive to smells).  </li>
            <li>The hyaluronic acid may help repair and replace damaged protein structures in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pacific Rim 1001 provided a bottle of VIVA Natural Skincare vitamin C serum for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a pricey product, but if you can&#x27;t get these qualities elsewhere and really need a face moisturizer, do consider this product especially if it&#x27;s still on sale at the time.</li>
            <li>you can save the cap and place it back on the bottle when traveling with your serum to help prevent spillage waste, AND, the dropper allows you better control of the amount you are using.  </li>
            <li>Also, a small amount goes a long way, which is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a nice product that moisturizes well without a greasy after film and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t mean that your skin will look swollen because it is more in the &#x27;feel&#x27; than the look of the &#x27;plumped&#x27; skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only a few small drops go a long way, and I enjoyed using the dropper applicator both as a dropper and also as a spreading applicator, using it to smooth the extremely fluid serum quickly in the areas I wish it to be applied before it has a chance to run or drip off the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Rather than endure the typical slow healing cycle of waiting to see facial cuts scabbing and possibly leaving scars, I witnessed a most remarkable high-speed healing of these minor facial lacerations.</li>
            <li>Coincidentally, at the exact time I was starting my trial of this product, I received two accidental facial abrasions.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and firm after using it and I have noticed some improvement around my eyes; also I notice the slight bagginess under my eyes has pretty much disappeared.</li>
            <li>In comparing to other products, my wife indicates that this is better than the average in effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>Once dried it feels slightly cool where it was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What impressed me the most was the small amount needed to achieve such good results; no more burning through expensive face creams that require glob-after-glob and leave behind a greasy mess.</li>

            <li>far as packaging goes, it&#x27;s a dark (&amp;#34;amber&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a while, I want to say I noticed a slight change in appearance for the laugh marks</li>
            <li>This vitamin C skin serum is slightly milky with the fresh scent of witch hazel.  </li>
            <li>The small bottle will last a lot longer then lotion, and can easily be taken on trips (it&#x27;s under the ounce requirement for US airport liquid regulations!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not familiar with the benefits of vitamin C, just know that it is a powerful antioxidant that helps prevent premature</li>
            <li>/&gt;The serum moisturizes and protects the skin and will improve its appearance with regular use over time by increasing hydration, reducing the visual effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>Overall I would highly recommend this product and would definitely encourage others to purchase it.</li>
            <li>You can check my other reviews and note that receiving a product for review does not always result in a positive review.</li>
            <li>My old vitamin C serum would sting just a tiny</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and looks younger.</li>
            <li>In which, it&#x27;s only natural that you could fight them</li>
            <li>aged marks is much prettier).ning and tightening in a way that opens your eyes up (eliminating under-eye wrinkles from tiredness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have used it daily for one month on my 54 year old skin.</li>
            <li>98 % naturally derived, 72 % organic.&amp;#34;  The 1 fluid oz./30ml container is made in the USA, and provides a website for additional information.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My cheeks, which are excessively dry due to a medical condition, feel much smoother and do not “burn” as much.</li>
            <li>BUT I do have VERY tired eyes (the kind that ALWAYS have bags underneith)</li>
            <li>When I compare the skin on the other half of my face, there is a huge difference.</li>
            <li>When I use paper to blot the area of application, there is absolutely no trace of oil on the paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the delivery route is an eyedropper, it&#x27;s easy to use just a small amount.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Directions given are to apply a small amount with fingertips to freshly cleansed and toned skin.</li>
            <li>It has roughly the viscosity of water and has a slightly sticky feel when it is rubbed in that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>Mind you, this product is not advertised as a healing serum, so I tried it cautiously at first, waiting to see if any negative reaction would occur--but to my surprise, not only was there no negative reaction, but the fastest healing I&#x27;ve yet seen for any facial injuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product to evaluate at little or no cost, I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.</li>
            <li>to slightly sensitive, and dry skin (these are my qualities).</li>
            <li>Simply apply a small amount on your fingertip and spread on your freshly cleansed face.  </li>
            <li>72% of the ingredients are organic, which is very high, since so many items are impossible to get in organic form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is no longer necessary, at least during these last lovely weeks of summer, as this little bottle does it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>decided to use it on half of my face and really focus on old acne scars since other reviews have noted that these fade with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> My wife saw positive results (firmer skin and reduce wrinkles) in about two weeks, which was impressive.  </li>
            <li> and I will continue to use it as a effective healing product.</li>
            <li> My review is honest and a result of my own trial of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> I am almost finished with the bottle and can say it is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> To say I&#x27;m thrilled would be an understatement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of this to review, and this represents my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It is intended for use on the face, but is equally effective on problem areas like elbows and knees.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was given the product in exchange for an honest review; this does not affect my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lovely product, easy to apply and absorbs beautifully into the skin.</li>

            <li> Love, love, love this Vitamin C Serum!  </li>
            <li> The serum feels good on the skin; feels like it&#x27;s getting absorbed nicely.  </li>
            <li> While I do not have wrinkles, the smoother skin is definitely more moisturized and “plump”, leading me to believe that this Serum will be more than effective against wrinkles around the mouth and crows feet.&lt;br</li>

            <li> and it is nice and light going on skin</li>

            <li> /&gt;I could not be more pleased and wholeheartedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> WIN-WIN in my book! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results:  The hyperpigmented spot that had been plaguing my forehead for more than a year is lighter.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something magical about the healing quality of this rejuvenating serum, that must have something to do with the combination of Vitamins C and E with Jojoba.</li>
            <li> love that it is Made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> Both of us love organic products and after talking about it, I decided to try this one out.</li>
            <li> As for as freckles and age spots, I noticed the best results on the back of my hands.  </li>
            <li> I do still struggle with breakouts, although these have been MUCH better controlled since I began using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This product is good.i saw changes in 3 days.i had to order for more bottles and recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> was provided a free sample for an honest review</li>
            <li> After all, when you are no longer running from a wooly mammoth, you have time to notice that Ugga has fewer wrinkles than Ook, but Ook smells better and has softer skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viva</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t say I am 65, but my skin is...:)</li>
            <li> Saw both ingredients recommended on Dr. Oz and was glad this contains both.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for an effective Vitamin C serum, you will enjoy this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do like the idea of this however, and hopefully I will see results with more time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles on my face</li>
            <li> When I had the opportunity to try Viva Vitamin C serum, I was sure I would like it just because of the hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love, love this item.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t been using the product for more than a week.</li>
            <li> Pleasant feel and certainly has a soothing feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love the easy application for this serum.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this review for a complimentary review bottle of this serum I received in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> This winter will be the best test but so far, I think I found the serum I cannot live without. :)</li>
            <li> My face breaks out in rashes easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s colorless and seems to applies easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, no skin reactions whatsoever aside from improved texture and firmness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it absorbs very quickly (fewer than 30 seconds).</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time in the sun with our sons&#x27; sports (I do use sunscreen) and combating the damage to my skin is as easy as smoothing on this serum once</li>
            <li> but nothing compares,  simply the most pure and best.</li>
            <li> just about 2 weeks, my acne looks more better right away.</li>
            <li> Overall a very good product that is worth a try!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been fine.  </li>
            <li> I will say that using this product twice a day for a month brightened my complexion &amp; diminished my fine lines &amp; wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My skin is noticeable brighter and my fine lines aren&#x27;t as noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is bottled in amber glass to protect it from the light, with a dropper cap for easy application that comes sealed in a zipper bag.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and firmer.</li>
            <li> The genuine article, will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> and I got it free.</li>
            <li> Cruelty free.</li>

            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this product free so that I could write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is no oil, and the vitamin serum genuinely seems to nourish the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fragrant free is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Because this product is so light, it could get into my pore-</li>

            <li> product is really unique.</li>
            <li> Thanks for producing such an incredible product XO</li>
            <li> As I have aged, I have more of an interest in keeping my skin looking as good as I can.  </li>
            <li> It went on clean</li>
            <li> She found that the best way to apply the product to keep it from running down the face was to apply it to her fingertips first then apply to the face.  </li>
            <li> , it soaked right in, and I think it&#x27;s helping with the fine lines I have everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s definitely helping me to take good care of my skin, though,</li>
            <li> , to sum everything up: if you would like a pleasant-smelling, effective Vitamin C Serum that will last for a good while, the Viva Natural Vitamin C Serum is the way to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , to sum everything up: if you would like a pleasant-smelling, effective Vitamin C Serum that will last for a good while, the Viva Natural Vitamin C Serum is the way to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Several good features about the packaging:  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the full ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels nice on the skin, and I was also relieved to see that I didn&#x27;t break out from the product although I have sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying multiple products to try to reverse the aging process, my problem is my skin is very fair and very sensitive, so when a product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and seems to be doing what it is supposed to, I&#x27;m happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just starting using Pacific Rim Vitamin C Serum  has a nice non greasing feel, goes on easy.</li>
            <li> But Viva is very light and absorbs almost instantly, which I love.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick  delivery.  </li>
            <li> I like the feel of it and the quick absorption.</li>
            <li> This product is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback was the watery nature of the product, which made it more challenging to apply than some others.  </li>
            <li> They are more like &#x27;creases&#x27; and this is what I mainly used them on.</li>
            <li> mostly botanical formula has ingredients known to benefit the skin such as vitamin C, vegetarian hyaluronic acid, aloe, jojoba oil, and glycerin, many of organic source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use about 5 drops on my face and it gets absorbed really quickly</li>
            <li> VIVA Vitamin C Serum contains many ingredients that are proven to not only brighten your complexion,  but improve the elasticity of your skin, and diminish fine lines &amp; wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product for younger women dealing with under eye wrinkles, and I think it has great potential for older women struggling with beautiful age marks</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product for younger women dealing with under eye wrinkles, and I think it has great potential for older women struggling with beautiful age marks</li>
            <li> It appears to both smooth and even out my skin and because of that, I really like using it before applying foundation.  </li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> No artificial smell</li>
            <li> a woman in my mid-40s, I have become more conscious incorporating anti-aging products into my skincare regimen.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps my skin may have gotten used to this serum eventually, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it for me to find out.  </li>
            <li> still gave this product 3 stars because I believe my own response to it was a very individual one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a constant quest to find effective face products.  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about this serum is that, unlike others I&#x27;ve used, this one isn&#x27;t oily or full of &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34; (silicone, dimethicone and the like).</li>
            <li> It calms any irritations and leaves my face feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of Via Vitamin C Serum for testing and review purposes.  </li>
            <li> I really liked: this product is not greasy at all, but it definitely moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li> The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li> As skin care products go, this is right up there.</li>
            <li> We are transitioning between seasons right now (summer to fall)</li>
            <li> an goes right on using you finger</li>
            <li> now, my verdict is: WORTH TRYING if you have dryness, fine lines, hyperpigmentation and have sensitive skin ,but with caution if you are breakout/dermatitis</li>
            <li> Very much like this product and can tell a difference after just a week.  </li>
            <li> It feels like a very light facial mask in that it tightens the area that you apply the serum on.</li>
            <li> My skin did break out the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a couple of months now and my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have just ordered more and this will remain an essential item in my beauty kit forever.</li>
            <li> first, I used it all over my face.</li>
            <li> It is 99% naturally derived, and 72% organic according to the label.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free bottle for purposes of review.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use this product at first, since the bottle was not sealed.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if there was a big result, but when I stopped using it, I noticed a change in the elasticity of my skin.</li>
            <li> As our ancestors settled into permanent dwellings and had more time to dedicate toward leisure, so too came the interests in personal care and beauty regimens.</li>
            <li> This is the first serum I have ever tried, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I love this product and intend to buy it when my current bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The amber bottle helps prevent breakdown of the vitamin C. I also store it away from natural light in order to retain its efficacy.</li>
            <li> First, there are ZERO parabens.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s the first three ingredients that give it the power to transform and improve your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it now for a few weeks, with good results.</li>
            <li> I was not asked or expected to leave a positive review, and this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and break out easily, so I was a bit worried using a new product on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months.  </li>
            <li> This serum absorbs quickly into the skin with no greasy residue and no discernible smell which may be off-putting to those with a sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li> There is a scent, but it&#x27;s very mild, and I can&#x27;t even distinguish it enough to describe it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to work good, just haven&#x27;t had it long enough yet.  </li>
            <li> , but it certainly did help wake my eyes up a bit.</li>
            <li> , but it certainly did help wake my eyes up a bit.</li>
            <li> but it certainly didn&#x27;t &#x27;vanish&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Upon trying this VIVA serum, I liked that it applied easily from the dropper with a thin, spreadable consistency</li>
            <li> Wrinkles and fine lines are diminished, my skin is visibly brighter, and as mentioned earlier, any incidental cuts and abrasions healed amazingly fast, with no signs they were ever there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> The shipment came really fast.  </li>
            <li> It is readily absorbed with no piling on the skin, it just leaves the skin quite soft.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how it worked-</li>
            <li> It really has helped me out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a couple of weeks once a day, as it was given to me for review,  and I have notice my skin color seems more pink and youthful.</li>
            <li> using this product at night before I go to bed, and I really like the fact that it is odorless.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> as it really does &#x27;plump&#x27; up your skin around the area you apply the serum on.</li>
            <li> ,  I found my skin to be much smoother, brighter with many of these rough patches from sun damage to be almost gone.  </li>
            <li> enjoyed good results with this serum both when applied after washing my face with cold water and cleanser and just leaving the serum as is, and also when applying a follow-up moisturizing lotion afterward.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this would work better for someone with drier skin, not someone who is prone to adult acne such as myself.</li>
            <li> After just a few weeks I have noticed that this natural product hydrates my skin, reduces fine lines and helps it to look more vibrant.  </li>
            <li> This was so unique, because unlike with lotions that are heavy and oily, this was really light and airy.</li>
            <li> This comes in a brown bottle that protects the liquid from light, and an eyedropper that&#x27;s rounded on the end.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit thin, and very easy to apply-</li>
            <li> Lastly, since the Serum is “98% Naturally Derived” I am more comfortable recommending this mixture than some other creams and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lastly, since the Serum is “98% Naturally Derived” I am more comfortable recommending this mixture than some other creams and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> serum is worth the money, especially when you see how much the department stores charge for their serums($100 and up).  </li>
            <li> Wow!!!!!, After using Viva Natural Vitamin C Serum for only one month , My skin is soft, fresh and smoother than its ever been.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum on the advice of a friend who highly recommended the product-</li>
            <li> Because of the high quality ingredients, this product doesn&#x27;t deteriorate over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and will be replacing it when it runs out.</li>
            <li> but I have had no issues with this product so far really like using it.</li>
            <li> skin seems much smoother, and it is helping to make the fine lines around my eyes less pronounced.  </li>
            <li> I really like this Vitamin C Serum from Viva Natural Skin Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had no negative reaction to this serum at all.  </li>
            <li> however I do have &#x27;laugh&#x27; marks between the nose and upper lip.</li>
            <li> Viva-Vitamin C serum goes on slightly thicker than water, and it soaked right into my skin leaving it ready for the next round of moisturizers I use every day, including a 50-block sunscreen, which was very nice.  </li>
            <li> I may simply have used TOO much at first, but I don&#x27;t want to test using less in those areas and risk more bumpies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may simply have used TOO much at first, but I don&#x27;t want to test using less in those areas and risk more bumpies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have some slight acne scarring that it seems to be helping to fade also, but I think I need to keep using it longer to see more of a clear improvement in that area.  </li>
            <li> serum feels lighter than the other one I&#x27;ve used, which feels better on my skin (not as sticky), but I&#x27;m not sure if it is quite a strong.</li>
            <li> I have uneven skin tone and rough dry patches on my skin, however, also tend to be sensitive to the ingredients in many serums of this kind.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping around for serums to find one that I cannot live without.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any spots diminish on my face, but didn&#x27;t notice any new ones forming.  </li>
            <li> I started a new regimen of products for my face and it works well with a peptide moisturizer I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> It had a nice, non-greasy texture, and it dried relatively quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Natural Skincare has followed in the footsteps of early civilization by using ingredients found in nature combined with the ingenuity of modern science in the creation of their Vitamin C Premium Anti-Aging Serum.</li>
            <li> I also used it while on a boat all summer and didn&#x27;t come back with any extra sunspots and in fact in some light, they seemed to have faded</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be a little rough feeling, but when I smooth this on after washing my skin, it feels so smooth and there is no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a Vitamin C serum and will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> This serum is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried this past summer.  </li>
            <li> advertised, the product shines up the skin slightly and expands the area that you choose to use it on--for fine wrinkles it will help reduce visibility.</li>
            <li> I have been particularly interested in trying something with Vitamin C given the positive things I have had about this ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serums are still relatively new to me; I have yet to find one that I like enough to use on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about two weeks now and have only had positive results.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to know these days with so many choices....</li>
            <li> The bottle and dropper arrived quickly in the mail and were extremely well packaged.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product to help clear up acne.</li>
            <li> Recommended to those who like myself are looking to try a natural way to avoid using invasive treatments for aging skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and found that the serum did not irritate my skin at all-</li>
            <li> , I will purchase a serum for my 21 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, hydrated, and even looks smoother.  </li>
            <li> but so far, everything is working well.  </li>
            <li> Early days yet</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, then I think this is one you should</li>
            <li> I purchased Viva Vitamin C Serum a month ago and already notice visible improvements in my 58year old skin.</li>
            <li> the Viva Natural Vitamin C serum beats them all.  </li>
            <li> At 22, my mother always told me &amp;#34;It&#x27;s never too early to care about your skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> but it did, and it actually worked really efficiently.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and my old acnes marks are fading.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have sensitive skin &amp; didn&#x27;t have any problems using this</li>
            <li> Chasing eternal youth has been an obsession of humanity dating back to the creation of modern civilization.</li>
            <li> Instant skin softness, with a very silky feel.  </li>
            <li> The glass bottle allows you to see how much you have left</li>
            <li> I do like the serum since it&#x27;s not heavy and does seem to make my complexion look brighter.</li>
            <li> When I checked the list of ingredients, I was pleasantly surprised that there was no &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; or</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is listed as 98% naturally derived / 72% organic.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve never had acne, so</li>
            <li> almost immediately(I am really sensitive to smells).  </li>
            <li> The hyaluronic acid may help repair and replace damaged protein structures in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pacific Rim 1001 provided a bottle of VIVA Natural Skincare vitamin C serum for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a pricey product, but if you can&#x27;t get these qualities elsewhere and really need a face moisturizer, do consider this product especially if it&#x27;s still on sale at the time.</li>
            <li> you can save the cap and place it back on the bottle when traveling with your serum to help prevent spillage waste, AND, the dropper allows you better control of the amount you are using.  </li>
            <li> Also, a small amount goes a long way, which is nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a nice product that moisturizes well without a greasy after film and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t mean that your skin will look swollen because it is more in the &#x27;feel&#x27; than the look of the &#x27;plumped&#x27; skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only a few small drops go a long way, and I enjoyed using the dropper applicator both as a dropper and also as a spreading applicator, using it to smooth the extremely fluid serum quickly in the areas I wish it to be applied before it has a chance to run or drip off the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Rather than endure the typical slow healing cycle of waiting to see facial cuts scabbing and possibly leaving scars, I witnessed a most remarkable high-speed healing of these minor facial lacerations.</li>
            <li> Coincidentally, at the exact time I was starting my trial of this product, I received two accidental facial abrasions.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and firm after using it and I have noticed some improvement around my eyes; also I notice the slight bagginess under my eyes has pretty much disappeared.</li>
            <li> In comparing to other products, my wife indicates that this is better than the average in effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> Once dried it feels slightly cool where it was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What impressed me the most was the small amount needed to achieve such good results; no more burning through expensive face creams that require glob-after-glob and leave behind a greasy mess.</li>

            <li> far as packaging goes, it&#x27;s a dark (&amp;#34;amber&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a while, I want to say I noticed a slight change in appearance for the laugh marks</li>
            <li> This vitamin C skin serum is slightly milky with the fresh scent of witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> The small bottle will last a lot longer then lotion, and can easily be taken on trips (it&#x27;s under the ounce requirement for US airport liquid regulations!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not familiar with the benefits of vitamin C, just know that it is a powerful antioxidant that helps prevent premature</li>
            <li> /&gt;The serum moisturizes and protects the skin and will improve its appearance with regular use over time by increasing hydration, reducing the visual effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> Overall I would highly recommend this product and would definitely encourage others to purchase it.</li>
            <li> You can check my other reviews and note that receiving a product for review does not always result in a positive review.</li>
            <li> My old vitamin C serum would sting just a tiny</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and looks younger.</li>
            <li> In which, it&#x27;s only natural that you could fight them</li>
            <li> aged marks is much prettier).ning and tightening in a way that opens your eyes up (eliminating under-eye wrinkles from tiredness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have used it daily for one month on my 54 year old skin.</li>
            <li> 98 % naturally derived, 72 % organic.&amp;#34;  The 1 fluid oz./30ml container is made in the USA, and provides a website for additional information.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My cheeks, which are excessively dry due to a medical condition, feel much smoother and do not “burn” as much.</li>
            <li> BUT I do have VERY tired eyes (the kind that ALWAYS have bags underneith)</li>
            <li> When I compare the skin on the other half of my face, there is a huge difference.</li>
            <li> When I use paper to blot the area of application, there is absolutely no trace of oil on the paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the delivery route is an eyedropper, it&#x27;s easy to use just a small amount.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions given are to apply a small amount with fingertips to freshly cleansed and toned skin.</li>
            <li> It has roughly the viscosity of water and has a slightly sticky feel when it is rubbed in that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Mind you, this product is not advertised as a healing serum, so I tried it cautiously at first, waiting to see if any negative reaction would occur--but to my surprise, not only was there no negative reaction, but the fastest healing I&#x27;ve yet seen for any facial injuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product to evaluate at little or no cost, I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.</li>
            <li> to slightly sensitive, and dry skin (these are my qualities).</li>
            <li> Simply apply a small amount on your fingertip and spread on your freshly cleansed face.  </li>
            <li> 72% of the ingredients are organic, which is very high, since so many items are impossible to get in organic form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is no longer necessary, at least during these last lovely weeks of summer, as this little bottle does it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> decided to use it on half of my face and really focus on old acne scars since other reviews have noted that these fade with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When applying to wrinkles it would certainly aid to make fine ones very faint</li>
            <li> A little does seem to go a long way - 2 drops will cover the whole neck.</li>
            <li> and it darkened a lot and on my neck where a nearly 2 year rash caused big spots of hyperpigmentation--but only HALF (ie one side).</li>
            <li> Small bottle and dropper dispenser packaged separately and arrived in a large padded envelope.</li>
            <li> I applied two drops to my face and neck and was surprised by how such a little amount spread over the entire area.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way: since only a droplet is required to gain the full benefits of the Serum per application, one bottle is sufficient to last at least a month, if not longer (depending of course, upon which areas you use the Serum for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Vitamin C Serum is clear to a bit cloudy and has a slight orange-ish smell to it.</li>
            <li> I let the serum dry, then applied my regular moisturizer as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;One thing to note:  if you have dry skin, you may not want to use this daily or in the colder months, since it might be too drying for your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert and fan of Hyaluronic acid, and I like the improvement in my middle aged skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no perfume smell, and no burning sensation, as with several other similar products.  </li>
            <li> It can be kept in the refrigerator for a cooling, soothing, and slightly tingling sensation when applied to dry, irritated, or sensitive</li>
            <li> As a breast cancer survivor who has read about possible negative health impact of using products with parabens, I avoid products containing parabens, particularly when they are things that remain on my skin for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> but after a few days it was clear again and haven&#x27;t had any problems since.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin usually turn&#x27;s red</li>
            <li> (wrinkles is such a negative word- aged marks is much prettier).</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and have been using vitamin C serums for a few years.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used a lot of moisturizers on my face, mostly for the fact that they are pretty greasy, and I already have issues with having a greasy face and hated to exacerbate that problem.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well, leaves no oiliness on my hands, and seems to be a good base for applying under moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and will be replacing it when it runs out.back of my hands where I have uneven skin due to sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> mean, I can&#x27;t say this product is a miracle worker (are there really miracle-working products out there?</li>
            <li> mean, I can&#x27;t say this product is a miracle worker (are there really miracle-working products out there?</li>
            <li> Instead of all over, I used it in two places where I have issues a hyperpigmented and dry area where I had a long bout of eczema</li>
            <li> With other silicone- and oil-heavy products, I had to limit application to only nighttime because of how it shortened makeup wear.</li>
            <li> It also contains Jojoba oil, Aloe, and several other beneficial ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40s and still have hormonal acne and occasional cystic acne, even having a course of Accutane in my mid-30s, I am very careful about what products I use because my skin will break out.</li>
            <li> The cracks and dry skin around my fingertips has healed, including the cuticle and my nails.</li>
            <li> They still have the dark blue color (thank goodness for foundation!), but the sleepy wrinkles are gone.</li>
            <li> They still have the dark blue color (thank goodness for foundation!), but the sleepy wrinkles are gone.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and note that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> experience of the product is that it feels slightly cold going on and it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> so I only need to wait less than a minute before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Same with the forehead spot (which was previously kinda dry/scaly.</li>
            <li> The instructions indicate that only a small amount is needed; one droplet is enough to rub across both hand’s</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so I have to be careful with what I put on</li>
            <li> I only started using the serum for a few days now</li>
            <li> so I expected some dryness</li>
            <li> With vitamin c, I was expecting a sort of citrus smell, but there is no real fragrance at all that I notice.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and one bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I not only apply to my face, neck and decollete, but also theback of my hands where I have uneven skin due to sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are looking for a Vitamin C Serum that both heals cracked skin and moisturizes it, alleviating painful cracks around the fingers and softening rough skin with as few as three applications, then the Viva Natural Vitamin C Serum is definitely worth the investment.</li>

            <li> It does make my skin feel slightly tight and dry immediately after application.</li>
            <li> Have tried other Serums</li>
            <li> I use it in the evening after I have cleansed my face and find that I no longer need any other night creams.</li>
            <li> The side I used the serum on has not lightened in relation to the other side.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unlike any other product I&#x27;ve seen before.</li>
            <li> (in fact, it was almost TOO thin--be careful not to drip it from the dropper by accident!).  </li>
            <li> There is no burning, itching, or other adverse reaction to the Serum.</li>
            <li> Allow absorption before applying other face creams or makeup.  </li>
            <li> That slimy feeling I had using other vitamin C serums is not an issue with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As mentioned earlier, this serum doesn&#x27;t leave a slick or oily film, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with makeup or make you feel slimy.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum--among other nutrients found in this bottle--is supposed to plump and tighten your skin as well as reduce wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not gone, but noticeably less dry and dark.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 4 weeks and see very little, if any, changes in my skin and definitely no changes in dark spots caused by sun damage.  </li>
            <li> It does leave my skin a bit tight after application dry down.</li>
            <li> (wrinkles is such a negative word-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a dark brown glass bottle, which protects the ingredients from sunlight.</li>
            <li> After using this product only a few weeks, I was asked I look so much younger, what is my secret?</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t wear down my skin.</li>
            <li> My neck is muck smoother and is already looking tighter with less wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less</li>
            <li> It has a slight, citrus scent, which disappears</li>
            <li> After applying the skin feels slightly &#x27;plumped&#x27;--it performs as advertised in this regard.</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes does feel a little tight-</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually guessed at being at least 10 years younger, and I believe it&#x27;s because I use products like this Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li> It is a little watery and takes some practice to apply efficiently.  </li>
            <li> The effects weren&#x27;t instant, but over a few weeks my eyes did begin to look way less tired.</li>
            <li> At age 54 my face can use help, and I am using this product to help me avoid going to injectables and harsh treatments.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll return here again to update this review after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> theory on why anti-aging products work on my tired eyes is the fact that essentially my eyes form wrinkles under them from sleepiness.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it was extremely frustrating that upon each application of the VIVA serum (I tried numerous times), my skin would up breaking out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it in the summer and also just every few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no product waste, and you can keep the product bacteria-free by not having contact with the tip of the eyedropper.</li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning with glowing, nourished skin, and I can see improvements in the elasticity of my skin after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and I can attest to how it helps me to rarely get sick, so</li>
            <li> Although I was a little nervous to use this product based on my past experiences, I wanted to try the Vitamin C serum and see how it worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Very little scent which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I have found a small amount is all you need.  </li>
            <li> did not get breakouts in the small forehead spot I used, but I did on my cheeks and jawline.</li>
            <li> However, I have a small age spot there that I was hoping this might lighten, and I saw no</li>
            <li> It also was packaged in a small plastic bag for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The result is a small brown bottle with an eyedropper that is used to apply a small droplet onto a fingertip or palm.</li>
            <li> product comes in a small brown glass bottle, with a cap.  </li>
            <li> When I apply this serum, my skin just absorbs it without leaving an oily or slick feeling on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used anti-aging products in the past and had some negative reactions to them including burning and redness.  </li>
            <li> In the past,  I would apply a moisturizer and than one of my other two expensive night creams.  </li>
            <li> product is stated to be &amp;#34;18 % vitamin C, with vitamin E and jojoba in a concentrated base of pure vegan hyaluronic acid to plump skin cells and protect and restore.  </li>
            <li> The one area which I used it that did not have a negative reaction was the bridge of my nose.  </li>
            <li> It also has a very subtle fragrance (not sweet).  </li>
            <li> so used to companies putting unnecessary fragrances in their products, and this one has no added fragrances.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I got a breakout along my cheeks and jawline, so I stopped using it all over.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It has jojoba in it also, so I was afraid it might be greasy, but it was not at all greasy.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The right product at the right time. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered quickly. I began using it immediately. I really like it I find my skin is more radiant since I began using this product.&lt;br /&gt;The way I look at it is.....applying Vitamin C to my face can only help. It&#x27;s like taking a multivitamin daily for your health....it&#x27;s just Vitamin C for your face!</li>
            <li> Very much like this product and can tell a difference after just a week.  No artificial smell and it is nice and light going on skin....my skin just drinks it in.  A friend told me my skin tone looked more even.  For me I notice a smoother face and my wrinkles are not as pronounced.  Definately a VALUE. It is hard to know these days with so many choices....but Viva Vitamin C Serum was recommended to me and I am VERY glad I tried it.  Robin</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a Vitamin C serum and will definitely continue to use. My skin did break out the first time I used it but after a few days it was clear again and haven&#x27;t had any problems since. Have been using it for a couple of months now and my skin is soft and smooth. It seems to be quite moisturizing but not oily at all. I use about 5 drops on my face and it gets absorbed really quickly so I only need to wait less than a minute before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a girlfriend with aging skin.  At age 54 my face can use help, and I am using this product to help me avoid going to injectables and harsh treatments.  After just a few weeks I have noticed that this natural product hydrates my skin, reduces fine lines and helps it to look more vibrant.  Recommended to those who like myself are looking to try a natural way to avoid using invasive treatments for aging skin.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!!, After using Viva Natural Vitamin C Serum for only one month , My skin is soft, fresh and smoother than its ever been.&lt;br /&gt;Really happy i have discovered this Product. I have just ordered more and this will remain an essential item in my beauty kit forever. Have tried other Serums but nothing compares,  simply the most pure and best. Thanks for producing such an incredible product XO</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum on the advice of a friend who highly recommended the product- I was not disappointed! The bottle and dropper arrived quickly in the mail and were extremely well packaged.  I applied two drops to my face and neck and was surprised by how such a little amount spread over the entire area.  I have sensitive skin and found that the serum did not irritate my skin at all- it is unscented which I also like.  Overall I would highly recommend this product and would definitely encourage others to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Lovely product, easy to apply and absorbs beautifully into the skin. My skin feels smooth and firmer. I will definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> I have used anti-aging products in the past and had some negative reactions to them including burning and redness.  Although I was a little nervous to use this product based on my past experiences, I wanted to try the Vitamin C serum and see how it worked for me.  I&#x27;ve used it for about two weeks now and have only had positive results.  My skin tends to be a little rough feeling, but when I smooth this on after washing my skin, it feels so smooth and there is no irritation at all. It appears to both smooth and even out my skin and because of that, I really like using it before applying foundation.  I have some slight acne scarring that it seems to be helping to fade also, but I think I need to keep using it longer to see more of a clear improvement in that area.  I feel like it&#x27;s definitely helping me to take good care of my skin, though, and I will continue to use it as a effective healing product.</li>
            <li> Just starting using Pacific Rim Vitamin C Serum  has a nice non greasing feel, goes on easy. I have sensitive skin usually turn&#x27;s red but I have had no issues with this product so far really like using it.</li>
            <li> I have found Viva Vitamin C Serum to be one of the best products I have ever used in my many years of experimenting with skin products. This serum has Vitamin C and E as well as Hyaluronic Acid and Jojoba.  The combination is awesome.  This serum comes in a liquid glass bottle with a very easy and convenient eye dropper.  I have uneven skin tone and rough dry patches on my skin, however, also tend to be sensitive to the ingredients in many serums of this kind.  One week later, (no exaggeration),  I found my skin to be much smoother, brighter with many of these rough patches from sun damage to be almost gone.  This serum absorbs quickly into the skin with no greasy residue and no discernible smell which may be off-putting to those with a sensitive nose.  I use it in the evening after I have cleansed my face and find that I no longer need any other night creams. In the past,  I would apply a moisturizer and than one of my other two expensive night creams.  This is no longer necessary, at least during these last lovely weeks of summer, as this little bottle does it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be more pleased and wholeheartedly recommend this product. I am in my 50&#x27;s, however, I will purchase a serum for my 21 year old daughter.  I know she could not be bothered with going through the nightly ritual of a 2-3 step  beauty regimen.  This product she will use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was furnished a sample for review.</li>
            <li> As skin care products go, this is right up there. Very happy. The genuine article, will be ordering again. Arrived promptly, beautiful to use, i fell better and have stopped using other well known products in favour of this high quality, simple but almost perfect product. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I love the easy application for this serum.  The dropper allows you to get only the amount you need.  I have found a small amount is all you need.  It is very lightweight and goes on smoothly.  My neck is muck smoother and is already looking tighter with less wrinkles.  I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> The serum feels good on the skin; feels like it&#x27;s getting absorbed nicely.  The shipment came really fast.  I only started using the serum for a few days now and so far so good.  My face breaks out in rashes easily and it&#x27;s been fine.  I&#x27;ve been shopping around for serums to find one that I cannot live without.  I&#x27;ll return here again to update this review after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/14/14 UPDATE:  It&#x27;s been weeks now and my skin still feels really great.  It&#x27;s soft, hydrated, and even looks smoother.  We are transitioning between seasons right now (summer to fall) so I expected some dryness but so far, everything is working well.  My old vitamin C serum would sting just a tiny but I feel nothing with this one.  This winter will be the best test but so far, I think I found the serum I cannot live without. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tiny background: I&#x27;ve been switching out my beauty products in favor of the cruelty-free ones.  This product is not only works, but a bunny didn&#x27;t have to suffer for me to get it.  WIN-WIN in my book! :)</li>
            <li> Note: I was given a bottle of this to try and I got it free. My review is honest and a result of my own trial of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I got this a few weeks ago to try. I&#x27;m 54 and have issues with hyperpigmentation (eczema issues). I have supersensitive skin and can only use a handful of cleansers, creams, and beauty products (ie, Kinerase, Cerave, Cetaphil) without problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I used it all over my face. Unfortunately, I got a breakout along my cheeks and jawline, so I stopped using it all over. (If you are acne or dermatitis prone, test a spot before using all over) I changed how I used it. Instead of all over, I used it in two places where I have issues a hyperpigmented and dry area where I had a long bout of eczema and it darkened a lot and on my neck where a nearly 2 year rash caused big spots of hyperpigmentation--but only HALF (ie one side). I wanted to see if the side of my neck I used became clearer than the side I did not use the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:  The hyperpigmented spot that had been plaguing my forehead for more than a year is lighter. Not gone, but noticeably less dry and dark. Nothing on the neck. The side I used the serum on has not lightened in relation to the other side. No difference in color. HOWEVER, the side where I used the serum is SOFTER. Same with the forehead spot (which was previously kinda dry/scaly. It&#x27;s much less so.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told by the company that it might take 9 weeks to see drastic differences, so I will continue to use it. If I notice any big changes, I will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, my verdict is: WORTH TRYING if you have dryness, fine lines, hyperpigmentation and have sensitive skin ,but with caution if you are breakout/dermatitis prone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not get breakouts in the small forehead spot I used, but I did on my cheeks and jawline. I haven&#x27;t had zits  or bumps like that since menopause, so I know it&#x27;s the serum. When I stopped it, the breakout calmed and healed and did not return. I may simply have used TOO much at first, but I don&#x27;t want to test using less in those areas and risk more bumpies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several good points for buyers: No stink or strong fragrance (I hate that in lotions/serums). Cruelty free. Made in USA. Hygienic dropper (I drop a few drops on my fingertips and then recap. The oil is pleasant to apply and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.d not return.

            <li> There&#x27;s something magical about the healing quality of this rejuvenating serum, that must have something to do with the combination of Vitamins C and E with Jojoba. Coincidentally, at the exact time I was starting my trial of this product, I received two accidental facial abrasions. I decided to go ahead with my product trial anyway, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! Rather than endure the typical slow healing cycle of waiting to see facial cuts scabbing and possibly leaving scars, I witnessed a most remarkable high-speed healing of these minor facial lacerations. Mind you, this product is not advertised as a healing serum, so I tried it cautiously at first, waiting to see if any negative reaction would occur--but to my surprise, not only was there no negative reaction, but the fastest healing I&#x27;ve yet seen for any facial injuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is easily applied with the dropper, which I found to be the perfect applicator. Only a few small drops go a long way, and I enjoyed using the dropper applicator both as a dropper and also as a spreading applicator, using it to smooth the extremely fluid serum quickly in the areas I wish it to be applied before it has a chance to run or drip off the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed good results with this serum both when applied after washing my face with cold water and cleanser and just leaving the serum as is, and also when applying a follow-up moisturizing lotion afterward. It&#x27;s a credit to the quality of this serum that it doesn&#x27;t seem to require a moisturizer afterward, and can stand on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several weeks of using this serum, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results! Wrinkles and fine lines are diminished, my skin is visibly brighter, and as mentioned earlier, any incidental cuts and abrasions healed amazingly fast, with no signs they were ever there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this review for a complimentary review bottle of this serum I received in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> This comes in a brown bottle that protects the liquid from light, and an eyedropper that&#x27;s rounded on the end.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit thin, and very easy to apply- it has aloe in it so it&#x27;s quite soothing.  It has jojoba in it also, so I was afraid it might be greasy, but it was not at all greasy.  It is readily absorbed with no piling on the skin, it just leaves the skin quite soft.  It plumps up find lines a bit, and it&#x27;s moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;Some Vitamin C formulas will make my skin red, especially if I am out in the sun, but this has not had that effect.  I&#x27;ve also not had any breakouts.  I like to follow it with my standard moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that it contains both Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid with Aloe.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is Made in the USA.  It&#x27;s cruelty free.  It is 99% naturally derived, and 72% organic according to the label.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free bottle for purposes of review.  I&#x27;m not affiliated with or paid by this company.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Early days yet but I&#x27;m feeling that this is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I bought Viva vitamin C by chance when i was looking for facial serum, i gave it a try, and just about 2 weeks, my acne looks more better right away. I think vitamin C helped a lot for my face, i recommend it from then</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use this product at first, since the bottle was not sealed. I didn&#x27;t trust that as It could have been a return to Amazon and tampered with.  After writing to the company and reading their packaging procedure, I decided to try it. It&#x27;s colorless and seems to applies easily. Only used it a time or two, still trying it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product to help clear up acne. It&#x27;s helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C serum is known to be good for skin and I guess people use it for a lot of reasons. Some use it to stimulate collagen production. Some use it to repair damage to skin. Some use it to tighten skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the above, I can say it does tighten the skin. This is something one can feel. Also, I believe the 18% C serum helps to cleanse the skin, and that helps against acne. It also has hyaluronic acid and vitamin E, both known to have good effects on the skin.</li>
            <li> Quick  delivery.  Skin feels soft and looks younger.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this product free so that I could write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Vit C serum before. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if there was a big result, but when I stopped using it, I noticed a change in the elasticity of my skin. It definitely seems firmer when I am using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum feels lighter than the other one I&#x27;ve used, which feels better on my skin (not as sticky), but I&#x27;m not sure if it is quite a strong. If you have sensitive skin, then I think this is one you should try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend Vitamin C serum for your skin!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent serum that reduces wrinkles and age spots. I have used it now for a few weeks, with good results. There is no oil, and the vitamin serum genuinely seems to nourish the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I purchased Viva Vitamin C Serum a month ago and already notice visible improvements in my 58year old skin. I use it daily and note that a little goes a long way. Fragrant free is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this Vitamin C Serum!  My skin has never felt so good and looked so clear.  I have tried other products but the Viva Natural Vitamin C serum beats them all.  It goes on smoothly, is quickly absorbed and provides just wonderful results.  I am definitely a huge fan of this product!</li>
            <li> At 22, my mother always told me &amp;#34;It&#x27;s never too early to care about your skin&amp;#34;. Both of us love organic products and after talking about it, I decided to try this one out. Obviously- at 22, I don&#x27;t need to prevent wrinkles. BUT I do have VERY tired eyes (the kind that ALWAYS have bags underneith) and I&#x27;ve noticed that some (not all) anti-aging products actually help my under eye bag doess and circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My theory on why anti-aging products work on my tired eyes is the fact that essentially my eyes form wrinkles under them from sleepiness. The wrinkles are probably very similar to wrinkles associated with aging. In which, it&#x27;s only natural that you could fight them the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is really unique. It&#x27;s unlike any other product I&#x27;ve seen before. It&#x27;s not a cream- it&#x27;s a liquid glass bottle that comes with a liquid dropper (similar to an eye dropper). You use this to drip the liquid onto your skin. This was so unique, because unlike with lotions that are heavy and oily, this was really light and airy. It didn&#x27;t wear down my skin. And it was surprisingly convenient to use. The small bottle will last a lot longer then lotion, and can easily be taken on trips (it&#x27;s under the ounce requirement for US airport liquid regulations!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of acne and I&#x27;m always scared of using creams that are too oily and will cause me to break out. Because this product is so light, it could get into my pore- but it didn&#x27;t block them or cause me to break out. I only used this product around my eyes. The effects weren&#x27;t instant, but over a few weeks my eyes did begin to look way less tired. Essentially what this supplement did was tighten the skin under my eyes- without drying it out. I really don&#x27;t know how it worked- but it did, and it actually worked really efficiently. The skin under my eyes does feel a little tight- but it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable. It&#x27;s similar to the spa effect you&#x27;d get from using cucumbers on your eyes. It&#x27;s refreshening and tightening in a way that opens your eyes up (eliminating under-eye wrinkles from tiredness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, I can&#x27;t say this product is a miracle worker (are there really miracle-working products out there? no.), but it certainly did help wake my eyes up a bit. They still have the dark blue color (thank goodness for foundation!), but the sleepy wrinkles are gone. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product for younger women dealing with under eye wrinkles, and I think it has great potential for older women struggling with beautiful age marks (wrinkles is such a negative word- aged marks is much prettier).ning and tightening in a way that opens your eyes up (eliminating under-eye wrinkles from tiredness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, I can&#x27;t say this product is a miracle worker (are there really miracle-working products out there? no.), but it certainly did help wake my eyes up a bit.

            <li> I am 50 years old and have been using vitamin C serums for a few years.  I tried this serum on the recommendation of a friend.  I am almost finished with the bottle and can say it is a nice product.  It does leave my skin a bit tight after application dry down. It does not interfere with foundation application.  As for as freckles and age spots, I noticed the best results on the back of my hands.  I didn&#x27;t see any spots diminish on my face, but didn&#x27;t notice any new ones forming.  I like that this product has HA in addition to the Vitamin C.  I would repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and my old acnes marks are fading. It&#x27;s light on the skin too. I put it on every morning. Definitely going to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I received this serum as a gift and I have used it daily for one month on my 54 year old skin. I like the feel of it and the quick absorption. Its not greasy and is very easy to use. My skin feels fresh and firm after using it and I have noticed some improvement around my eyes; also I notice the slight bagginess under my eyes has pretty much disappeared. I would definitely recommend this to my friends as a daily boost to their skin regime.</li>
            <li> NOTE:  I received a free sample of this product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a woman in my mid-40s, I have become more conscious incorporating anti-aging products into my skincare regimen.  I have been particularly interested in trying something with Vitamin C given the positive things I have had about this ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serums are still relatively new to me; I have yet to find one that I like enough to use on a regular basis.  Upon trying this VIVA serum, I liked that it applied easily from the dropper with a thin, spreadable consistency (in fact, it was almost TOO thin--be careful not to drip it from the dropper by accident!).  It had a nice, non-greasy texture, and it dried relatively quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it seemed that wherever I placed this product on my face, I wound up with blemishes soon after!  I do still struggle with breakouts, although these have been MUCH better controlled since I began using [[ASIN:B000052YM7 Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Lotion]] several years ago.  Therefore, it was extremely frustrating that upon each application of the VIVA serum (I tried numerous times), my skin would up breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps my skin may have gotten used to this serum eventually, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it for me to find out.  The one area which I used it that did not have a negative reaction was the bridge of my nose.  However, I have a small age spot there that I was hoping this might lighten, and I saw no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still gave this product 3 stars because I believe my own response to it was a very individual one--yours might not be the same.  Perhaps this would work better for someone with drier skin, not someone who is prone to adult acne such as myself.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It really has helped me out. Buy it!</li>
            <li> This product is good.i saw changes in 3 days.i had to order for more bottles and recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> VIVA Vitamin C Serum contains many ingredients that are proven to not only brighten your complexion,  but improve the elasticity of your skin, and diminish fine lines &amp; wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the ingredients and their benefits are listed in Amazon&#x27;s product description so I won&#x27;t repeat them here. I will say that using this product twice a day for a month brightened my complexion &amp; diminished my fine lines &amp; wrinkles. My deeper wrinkles still remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing my face, I tilted my head back &amp; used the dropper to apply the serum &amp; spread it around with the dropper &amp; my fingers. I let the serum dry, then applied my regular moisturizer as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin &amp; didn&#x27;t have any problems using this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
            <li> Small bottle and dropper dispenser packaged separately and arrived in a large padded envelope. A little does seem to go a long way - 2 drops will cover the whole neck. Pleasant feel and certainly has a soothing feel on the skin. Very little scent which is a plus for me. Purchased from Amazon on the recommendation of a friend. Will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, you just feel good applying it to your skin.  After using this product only a few weeks, I was asked I look so much younger, what is my secret?</li>
            <li> This serum is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried this past summer.  It absorbs well, leaves no oiliness on my hands, and seems to be a good base for applying under moisturizers.  It also has a very subtle fragrance (not sweet).  I have not seen any changes in my skin, though, only that it feels softer in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum never irritated my skin.  The brown bottle comes with a convenient eye dropper since the serum is runny.  It also was packaged in a small plastic bag for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a free sample for an honest review</li>
            <li> Chasing eternal youth has been an obsession of humanity dating back to the creation of modern civilization. As our ancestors settled into permanent dwellings and had more time to dedicate toward leisure, so too came the interests in personal care and beauty regimens. After all, when you are no longer running from a wooly mammoth, you have time to notice that Ugga has fewer wrinkles than Ook, but Ook smells better and has softer skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viva Natural Skincare has followed in the footsteps of early civilization by using ingredients found in nature combined with the ingenuity of modern science in the creation of their Vitamin C Premium Anti-Aging Serum. The result is a small brown bottle with an eyedropper that is used to apply a small droplet onto a fingertip or palm. The instructions indicate that only a small amount is needed; one droplet is enough to rub across both hand’s fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vitamin C Serum is clear to a bit cloudy and has a slight orange-ish smell to it. It has roughly the viscosity of water and has a slightly sticky feel when it is rubbed in that dissipates quickly. If the Serum sits for a period of time, it can become whitish in color and leave residue on the inside of the bottle. A good shake will redistribute the ingredients and clarify the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Efficacy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for several weeks, I have noticed the following results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• There is no burning, itching, or other adverse reaction to the Serum. Once dried it feels slightly cool where it was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The cracks and dry skin around my fingertips has healed, including the cuticle and my nails. While I haven’t noticed a difference in the strength of my nails, they do feel smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• My cheeks, which are excessively dry due to a medical condition, feel much smoother and do not “burn” as much. Minute cracks on the surface of my skin have disappeared, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The skin around my chin, neck, and collarbones is smoother and feels softer. While I do not have wrinkles, the smoother skin is definitely more moisturized and “plump”, leading me to believe that this Serum will be more than effective against wrinkles around the mouth and crows feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• A little bit goes a long way: since only a droplet is required to gain the full benefits of the Serum per application, one bottle is sufficient to last at least a month, if not longer (depending of course, upon which areas you use the Serum for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The End&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a Vitamin C Serum that both heals cracked skin and moisturizes it, alleviating painful cracks around the fingers and softening rough skin with as few as three applications, then the Viva Natural Vitamin C Serum is definitely worth the investment. What impressed me the most was the small amount needed to achieve such good results; no more burning through expensive face creams that require glob-after-glob and leave behind a greasy mess. Lastly, since the Serum is “98% Naturally Derived” I am more comfortable recommending this mixture than some other creams and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to sum everything up: if you would like a pleasant-smelling, effective Vitamin C Serum that will last for a good while, the Viva Natural Vitamin C Serum is the way to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

            <li> Very nice product!  Instant skin softness, with a very silky feel.  I can feel it tightening and firming.  Simply apply a small amount on your fingertip and spread on your freshly cleansed face.  Allow absorption before applying other face creams or makeup.  (Directions do not specify a time but I allow about 5 minutes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no perfume smell, and no burning sensation, as with several other similar products.  It is non-oily and lightweight on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is stated to be &amp;#34;18 % vitamin C, with vitamin E and jojoba in a concentrated base of pure vegan hyaluronic acid to plump skin cells and protect and restore.  98 % naturally derived, 72 % organic.&amp;#34;  The 1 fluid oz./30ml container is made in the USA, and provides a website for additional information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a small brown glass bottle, with a cap.  The glass bottle allows you to see how much you have left so you know when it&#x27;s time to reorder.  The dropper is packaged seperately.  Several good features about the packaging:  you can save the cap and place it back on the bottle when traveling with your serum to help prevent spillage waste, AND, the dropper allows you better control of the amount you are using.  This product is a KEEPER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that my age 65 skin loves it.  (I didn&#x27;t say I am 65, but my skin is...:)</li>
            <li> It seems to work good, just haven&#x27;t had it long enough yet.  Goes on smooth and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> This product is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  It is a little watery and takes some practice to apply efficiently.  My wife saw positive results (firmer skin and reduce wrinkles) in about two weeks, which was impressive.  She found that the best way to apply the product to keep it from running down the face was to apply it to her fingertips first then apply to the face.  In comparing to other products, my wife indicates that this is better than the average in effectiveness.  The only drawback was the watery nature of the product, which made it more challenging to apply than some others.  Overall a very good product that is worth a try! I received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a couple of weeks once a day, as it was given to me for review,  and I have notice my skin color seems more pink and youthful. My cheeks are rosy.  The ingredients are superb: Vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, Vitamin E, jojoba, MSM (great for skin and hair), horsetail and more. 72% of the ingredients are organic, which is very high, since so many items are impossible to get in organic form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn&#x27;t Work</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I do like the serum since it&#x27;s not heavy and does seem to make my complexion look brighter. I started a new regimen of products for my face and it works well with a peptide moisturizer I&#x27;m using. I like that it has vitamin C as well as Hyaluronic Acid.  Saw both ingredients recommended on Dr. Oz and was glad this contains both.  I&#x27;m happy with the way my skin looks after using this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Very nice this has organic ingredients. Felt great after using this. I have been using home made vitamin C serum using Ascorbic Acid which can be a time consuming process. When offered a sample, I immediately agreed after looking at the contents. This had no side effects in me and the bottle came neatly packed with stopper separately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying multiple products to try to reverse the aging process, my problem is my skin is very fair and very sensitive, so when a product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and seems to be doing what it is supposed to, I&#x27;m happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this product at night before I go to bed, and I really like the fact that it is odorless.  It goes on smooth, and my skin absorbs it instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin seems much smoother, and it is helping to make the fine lines around my eyes less pronounced.  To say I&#x27;m thrilled would be an understatement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I received a sample of this product to evaluate at little or no cost, I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback. I choose to review this product  in order to inform others of my experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a constant quest to find effective face products.  As I have aged, I have more of an interest in keeping my skin looking as good as I can.  I really like this Vitamin C Serum from Viva Natural Skin Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works.  My skin is noticeable brighter and my fine lines aren&#x27;t as noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s gentle on my skin.  I have dry skin, so I have to be careful with what I put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The quality ingredients.  Some of the ingredients in this product include:  Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E and Jojoba.  All of these ingredients do good things for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Stable serum.  Because of the high quality ingredients, this product doesn&#x27;t deteriorate over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note:  if you have dry skin, you may not want to use this daily or in the colder months, since it might be too drying for your skin.  I use it in the summer and also just every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an effective Vitamin C serum, you will enjoy this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free sample of this product for testing and review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for only a week now, but my skin already feels smoother and tighter. Very nice. Easy to apply, no skin reactions whatsoever aside from improved texture and firmness.</li>
            <li> This is the first serum I have ever tried, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. But Viva is very light and absorbs almost instantly, which I love. No greasy residue remains. With vitamin c, I was expecting a sort of citrus smell, but there is no real fragrance at all that I notice. It does make my skin feel slightly tight and dry immediately after application. But I follow up with moisturizer, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of this to review, and this represents my honest opinion. You can check my other reviews and note that receiving a product for review does not always result in a positive review. I love this product and intend to buy it when my current bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using another brand&#x27;s Vitamin C serum for some time now in an effort to help reduce brown spots and freckles on my face as well as help prevent wrinkles. If you&#x27;re not familiar with the benefits of vitamin C, just know that it is a powerful antioxidant that helps prevent premature aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this serum is that, unlike others I&#x27;ve used, this one isn&#x27;t oily or full of &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34; (silicone, dimethicone and the like). I&#x27;m in my 40s and still have hormonal acne and occasional cystic acne, even having a course of Accutane in my mid-30s, I am very careful about what products I use because my skin will break out. When I apply this serum, my skin just absorbs it without leaving an oily or slick feeling on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Viva Vitamin C Serum doesn&#x27;t interfere with my makeup, either. With other silicone- and oil-heavy products, I had to limit application to only nighttime because of how it shortened makeup wear. That slimy feeling I had using other vitamin C serums is not an issue with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so used to companies putting unnecessary fragrances in their products, and this one has no added fragrances. There is a scent, but it&#x27;s very mild, and I can&#x27;t even distinguish it enough to describe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as packaging goes, it&#x27;s a dark (&amp;#34;amber&amp;#34;) bottle with an eyedropper. There&#x27;s no product waste, and you can keep the product bacteria-free by not having contact with the tip of the eyedropper. The amber bottle helps prevent breakdown of the vitamin C. I also store it away from natural light in order to retain its efficacy. The bottle bears the stamp that it has a 12-month shelf life after it is opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients just can&#x27;t be beaten. First, there are ZERO parabens. As a breast cancer survivor who has read about possible negative health impact of using products with parabens, I avoid products containing parabens, particularly when they are things that remain on my skin for long periods of time. When I checked the list of ingredients, I was pleasantly surprised that there was no &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; or cheap fillers in the list. Here&#x27;s the full ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deionized aqua (water)&lt;br /&gt;organic aloe barbadensis leaf (aloe)&lt;br /&gt;sodium ascorbyl phosphate (vitamin c)&lt;br /&gt;methylsulfonymethane (MSM)&lt;br /&gt;cassia angustifolia seed polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid)&lt;br /&gt;hamamelis virginia (witch hazel)&lt;br /&gt;kosher vegetable glycerin&lt;br /&gt;carbomer&lt;br /&gt;arginine&lt;br /&gt;organic simmondsia chinesis (jojoba oil)&lt;br /&gt;tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e)&lt;br /&gt;phenoxyethanol&lt;br /&gt;ethyl hexyl glycerin&lt;br /&gt;organic centella asiatica (gotu kola extract)&lt;br /&gt;organic equisetum arvense (horsetail plant extract)&lt;br /&gt;organic pelagonium gravoleons (geranium extract)&lt;br /&gt;organic taracum officinale&lt;br /&gt;dandelion extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is listed as 98% naturally derived / 72% organic. It bears the stamp that it is certified organic and not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions given are to apply a small amount with fingertips to freshly cleansed and toned skin. The directions state to allow time for the product to absorb before applying moisturizer. I&#x27;ve found that it absorbs very quickly (fewer than 30 seconds). As mentioned earlier, this serum doesn&#x27;t leave a slick or oily film, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with makeup or make you feel slimy. When I use paper to blot the area of application, there is absolutely no trace of oil on the paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the delivery route is an eyedropper, it&#x27;s easy to use just a small amount. A little goes a long way, and one bottle lasts a very long time. I not only apply to my face, neck and decollete, but also theback of my hands where I have uneven skin due to sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated in the headline, this is the best vitamin C serum I have ever used. I highly recommend it and will be replacing it when it runs out.back of my hands where I have uneven skin due to sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated in the headline, this is the best vitamin C serum I have ever used.

            <li> Viva-Vitamin C serum goes on slightly thicker than water, and it soaked right into my skin leaving it ready for the next round of moisturizers I use every day, including a 50-block sunscreen, which was very nice.  It&#x27;s almost like I didn&#x27;t put anything on my face at all, though I&#x27;d read the list of ingredients so I knew I was putting all kinds of nourishing things on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve never had acne, so all I&#x27;m contending with is age and time. I had no negative reaction to this serum at all.  It went on clean, it soaked right in, and I think it&#x27;s helping with the fine lines I have everywhere.  I also used it while on a boat all summer and didn&#x27;t come back with any extra sunspots and in fact in some light, they seemed to have faded somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m almost 57, and I&#x27;m usually guessed at being at least 10 years younger, and I believe it&#x27;s because I use products like this Vitamin C serum.  I also take vitamin C internally and I can attest to how it helps me to rarely get sick, so I know it&#x27;s wonderful stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is worth the money, especially when you see how much the department stores charge for their serums($100 and up).  It has a slight, citrus scent, which disappears almost immediately(I am really sensitive to smells).  I would buy this again and recommend it to all of my friends, and even to my younger friends to prevent damage.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 4 weeks and see very little, if any, changes in my skin and definitely no changes in dark spots caused by sun damage.  Therefore I am giving it just 3 stars.  I do like the idea of this however, and hopefully I will see results with more time.</li>
            <li> * I received this product in exchange for my opinion of it *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used this product for a while now and can you give a very good picture of what it does to slightly sensitive, and dry skin (these are my qualities). I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles on my face however I do have &#x27;laugh&#x27; marks between the nose and upper lip. They are more like &#x27;creases&#x27; and this is what I mainly used them on. Vitamin C Serum--among other nutrients found in this bottle--is supposed to plump and tighten your skin as well as reduce wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The experience of the product is that it feels slightly cold going on and it dries very quickly. It feels like a very light facial mask in that it tightens the area that you apply the serum on. After applying the skin feels slightly &#x27;plumped&#x27;--it performs as advertised in this regard. For this experience you only need &#x27;1&#x27; drop to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a while, I want to say I noticed a slight change in appearance for the laugh marks but it certainly didn&#x27;t &#x27;vanish&#x27;. When applying to wrinkles it would certainly aid to make fine ones very faint as it really does &#x27;plump&#x27; up your skin around the area you apply the serum on. Sort of a &#x27;mini&#x27; spot-facelift. This doesn&#x27;t mean that your skin will look swollen because it is more in the &#x27;feel&#x27; than the look of the &#x27;plumped&#x27; skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As advertised, the product shines up the skin slightly and expands the area that you choose to use it on--for fine wrinkles it will help reduce visibility.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert and fan of Hyaluronic acid, and I like the improvement in my middle aged skin since I started using it. When I had the opportunity to try Viva Vitamin C serum, I was sure I would like it just because of the hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a dark brown glass bottle, which protects the ingredients from sunlight. It has a glass dropper, which allows perfect placement of drops of the product. It&#x27;s fragrance free, cruelty free (not tested on animals), made in the USA from FDA-certified organic ingredients. Organic ingredients are important to me, and something I look for when buying food or cosmetics. In addition to the Hyaluronic acid, it also contains Vitamins C &amp; E, both of which are known to help combat the signs of aging or sun damage. It also contains Jojoba oil, Aloe, and several other beneficial ingredients. But it&#x27;s the first three ingredients that give it the power to transform and improve your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks now, and I am very impressed. I smooth it on my clean face and neck before bed, and it leaves my skin moisturized without feeling oily. It calms any irritations and leaves my face feeling soft and healthy. I wake up in the morning with glowing, nourished skin, and I can see improvements in the elasticity of my skin after just a few weeks. I spend a lot of time in the sun with our sons&#x27; sports (I do use sunscreen) and combating the damage to my skin is as easy as smoothing on this serum once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of Via Vitamin C Serum for testing and review purposes.  I was not asked or expected to leave a positive review, and this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C skin serum is slightly milky with the fresh scent of witch hazel.  It is bottled in amber glass to protect it from the light, with a dropper cap for easy application that comes sealed in a zipper bag.  It can be kept in the refrigerator for a cooling, soothing, and slightly tingling sensation when applied to dry, irritated, or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum moisturizes and protects the skin and will improve its appearance with regular use over time by increasing hydration, reducing the visual effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells.  It also minimizes the appearance of enlarged pores and decreases shininess in oily areas.  It is intended for use on the face, but is equally effective on problem areas like elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mostly botanical formula has ingredients known to benefit the skin such as vitamin C, vegetarian hyaluronic acid, aloe, jojoba oil, and glycerin, many of organic source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months.  The hyaluronic acid may help repair and replace damaged protein structures in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pacific Rim 1001 provided a bottle of VIVA Natural Skincare vitamin C serum for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Deionized Aqua (Water), Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (Hyalurosmooth(tm)), Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel), Kosher Vegetable Glycerin Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Organic Aloe barbadensis Leaf (Aloe Vera Extract), Organic Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola Extract), Phenoxyethanol, Organic Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Plant Extract), Organic Pelargonium Graveolens (Geranium Extract), Organic Taraxacum Officinale (Dandelion Extract).</li>
            <li> I love, love this item. I also love the smell of it. its not greasy an goes right on using you finger tip.&lt;br /&gt;I follow this up with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was given the product in exchange for an honest review; this does not affect my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used a lot of moisturizers on my face, mostly for the fact that they are pretty greasy, and I already have issues with having a greasy face and hated to exacerbate that problem. I also have sensitive skin and break out easily, so I was a bit worried using a new product on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use it on half of my face and really focus on old acne scars since other reviews have noted that these fade with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really liked: this product is not greasy at all, but it definitely moisturizes the skin. When I compare the skin on the other half of my face, there is a huge difference. Also, a small amount goes a long way, which is nice. It feels nice on the skin, and I was also relieved to see that I didn&#x27;t break out from the product although I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any difference in my acne scars however-- they haven&#x27;t faded at all. But I haven&#x27;t been using the product for more than a week. If I see a difference coming up, I will edit the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nice product that moisturizes well without a greasy after film and a small amount goes a long way. This is a pricey product, but if you can&#x27;t get these qualities elsewhere and really need a face moisturizer, do consider this product especially if it&#x27;s still on sale at the time.</li>
