            <li>Excellent product at excellent price.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo!</li>
            <li>Should be used along with a toner for best results</li>
            <li>This has a wonderful fragrance</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s a losing battle) and Nexxus is the best.  </li>
            <li>.. makes my hair smell good though!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this shampoo, but do have some concerns about the packaging.</li>
            <li>and I am happy to say my hair has stopped falling out.  </li>
            <li>Great price, shampoo that does the trick.</li>
            <li>great price...</li>
            <li>and this has worked great on my hair for that.  </li>
            <li>I have always favored the Nexxus line.  </li>

            <li>This shampoo works great on my very fine colored hair and this was a great purchase price.  </li>
            <li>: It smells good.  </li>
            <li>I wish the fragrance lingered, it smells so good to wash your hair with this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo in the store because it smelled good, it was sulfate-free, and it was marketed as being color-safe.</li>
            <li>but i think the product works as described and it is a good product i bought two of these for about 9 dollars each with the 50% discount</li>
            <li>so I thought this would color my hair good</li>
            <li>I bought this because the price was really good</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>Got this in my Birchbox and loved the smell</li>
            <li>I guess there is nothing more to add, this shampoo is very nice for colored hair.</li>
            <li>There is  nothing more to add, this shampoo is very nice for colored hair.</li>
            <li>Color Assure, specifically, is a favorite sulfate-free shampoo of mine!  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>This shampoo and condition from Nexxus is amazing</li>
            <li>it leave my hair nice and shiny</li>
            <li>Like I said, the smell is awesome but it leaves your hair greasy no matter how much you rinse it.</li>
            <li>I liked it for the most part that is until my hair started to fall out in clumps.  </li>
            <li>I might prefer the moisture one more because this one is kind of wierd</li>
            <li>Nexxus has great products and although they are pricey sometimes, Amazon generally offers a good deal on them.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so when I first started using it thought I loved the shampoo, because it smells really good, I love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The item description was very accurate.</li>
            <li>This product has been great on my curly hair and provides superior curl definition and conditioning without having to use an extra conditioning product.</li>
            <li>It does as it advertises, preserves highlights and dye in a most satisfactory way.</li>
            <li>I have been using Nexxuss Color Assure shampoo for years, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I thought ordering here was a better deal, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this shampoo, makes my hair so smooth and soft and smells so good!!</li>
            <li>, that is for sure.</li>
            <li>I used to love Nexxus.</li>
            <li>They leave my hair SO oily on the roots, and I don&#x27;t tend to have oily hair unless I don&#x27;t wash it for more than 3 days.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Sulfates are detergents and that&#x27;s why shampoos with sulfates in them have more sudsy lather.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it I honestly thought I had forgotten to rinse the conditioner out of my hair!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many</li>
            <li>Oftentimes it takes weeks to get your scalp and hair used to the sulfate-free formulas which are better for you and your hair.</li>
            <li>I reallly love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite BRAND...</li>
            <li>And spend more money.&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li>I have been doing, which alleviated the problem as well,</li>
            <li>Better than what my salon uses and better than Matrix.</li>
            <li>Yes, your hair is not going to feel &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean, but it will still be clean, and it will still be good to put your conditioner in afterwards.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I had my hair colored at a salon, where I normally do it at home, and I thought the color was very nice</li>
            <li>When I used this shampoo I had high expectations because of many good experiences with this brand.</li>
            <li>I have a full size of this untouched!  </li>
            <li>After blowing it out, my hair was softer but it tangles too easily.</li>
            <li>makes getting the shampoo in your hands easy.</li>
            <li>first of all it did keep my color beautiful for sure, but I also had another unexpected side effect!  </li>
            <li>Hair is clean, soft and my curls are happy once again.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure that I had not rinsed it well the first time and decided to try it one more time.</li>
            <li>fine-</li>
            <li>and my hair washed fine.</li>
            <li>the zero sulfates seems to keep the coloring in my hair longer as i have used the color assure with sulfates and the color washes away more quickly</li>
            <li>I have excellent water pressure, but after rinsing and rinsing, my hair still felt heavy with the product</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t create a lot of suds because it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Fantastic shampoo.</li>
            <li>; that has nothing to do with it being sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>This is an OIL based product that is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this shampoo because I know how to use it, and the benefits of using a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good, but I can tell you I&#x27;ll never buy this Nexus product again.</li>
            <li>I loved the old Nxxus color shampoo in a gray bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing like the Nexxus shampoo I&#x27;m used to, the original.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and this duo does a great job cleansing while not stripping my hair of color.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it was on vacation because it came with a free travel size bottle (yippee!), and I thought it was the water there or something.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to rinse until your hair feels squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Sulfates are an inexpensive filler ingredient in shampoos that leaves your hair feeling squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>I bought this Shampoo because I needed clean hair.</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean after I use the shampoo</li>
            <li>I had to use another shampoo to clean this product out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Stripped the color right out of my hair!  </li>
            <li>But my hair is much softer and more manageble with this shampoo than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nexxus Color Assure shampoo for several years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair immediately unsnarled, soft, blows out nicely.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for quite some time and loved it until recently.</li>
            <li>I gave this one star only because it still smells good.</li>
            <li>Back to good ole Dove shampoo and conditioner for $5.00 each.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to try the full size.</li>
            <li>The rich tones in my freshly colored hair faded to a mousey brassy bronde color</li>
            <li>God Bless Amazon for quickly refunding my money.</li>
            <li>I love this brand, but I had never gotten this particular shampoo.</li>
            <li>I would almost say that my hair color is more vibrant since&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will never use this again and would not recommend to anyone who wants clean hair!  </li>
            <li>rinsing out more color by the amount of time I need to take to TRY and get this junk out than if I just used normal shampoo</li>
            <li>I purchased for my wife who uses the product daily - very satisfied with the product, packaging and delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks Nexxus!!</li>
            <li>Sulfate free does not mean it won&#x27;t clean your hair.</li>
            <li>Plus is smells amazing and does its job, keeping your color lush and vibrant and repairing the damage the coloring process causes!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have a larger  bottle.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work like a toner where it semi restores the highlights to brighter, freshly colored hair but this maintains your color if used as soon as hair is bleached.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try something different and liked the smell.  </li>
            <li>I always loved this shampoo until I got the pink bottle instead of the gray one.</li>
            <li>Fun getting it in the mail.</li>
            <li>This shampoo definitely has an ingredient that causes you to feel like you aren&#x27;t getting all the shampoo out when rinsing, but for me, I noticed right away that my hair texture was more smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Nexxus Therappe Shampoo daily and love it, so I was excited to try their color formula when I saw it.  </li>
            <li>No complains, work much better than many other shampoos.</li>
            <li>purchased this in hope that it would be as good as other Nexxus products</li>
            <li>My shampoo is in a bottle that looks like Nexxus Color Assure, but the Nexxus logo isn&#x27;t quite right.  </li>
            <li>What arrived just didn&#x27;t look right.  </li>
            <li>Well, this product makes it look like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in 3 days right after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair feel greasy right after I wash it.</li>
            <li>IMHO the true test of a color safe shampoo is on red hair dye and Nexxus makes the cut.  </li>
            <li>My hair has been dyed many many times, permanent dye, and I had some damage from a black dye I used to use that</li>
            <li>I have normal hair, and prefer it to be grease free, so this went into the trash.</li>
            <li>... let me first say I do not ordinarily buy shampoo that costs $15, I normally buy cheap shampoo and conditioner because after years and years of trying many shampoos and conditioners I never noticed a difference with anything I used really.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t contacted amazon or nexus to determine if my bottle is counterfeit or not because I am happy with the product, but it is definitely a reminder to me (and you if you&#x27;re reading this) that the potential for counterfeiting on the amazon platform does exist</li>
            <li>my hair is still kind of dry</li>
            <li>No complains, works much better than other shampoos for fine, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is ombre with very light blonde towards the ends.</li>
            <li>I used this in conjunction with the pre wash primer and conditioner and my shoulder length fine hair is soft, hydrated and manageable.</li>
            <li>I decided to invest in a good shampoo in hopes that it would protect my color a little longer.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal on these hard to find products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great quality product, and this is a great price for it, especially considering how long this bottle lasts when you can wash your hair less frequently!</li>
            <li>It is the first time I have had a real measurable noticeable effect from a shampoo/conditioner!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the price because it left my hair looking healthy, even though I hadn&#x27;t cut my hair in 2 years.</li>
            <li>I especially like the way the conditioner leaves my hair feeling healthy and nourished.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought, no way, so tried it again and again.  </li>
            <li>decide to order from amazon for first time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And for this price it was very upsetting!</li>
            <li>I double checked to make sure I hadn&#x27;t accidently used conditioner.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was because I didn&#x27;t rinse it all out</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll sit under the water for a good few minutes (way longer than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used in my life) and then get out</li>
            <li>I thought I used too much and wasn&#x27;t rinsing it out right</li>
            <li>, many other reviewers have mentioned that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t wash off, and they are quite right.</li>
            <li>This is a large pump bottle of clean-rinsing shampoo for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>The container is HUGE, it will last me so so long, I&#x27;m so pleased.</li>
            <li>Nope, and it left my fine hair feeling greasy and stringy.  </li>
            <li>I will never use another sulfate free shampoo again, especially this one.</li>
            <li>I regret spending so much on these products.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I rinse out my hair, it leaves a residue and makes my hair feel and look dirty/oily.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the whole system, just shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>No matter how much I rinse and rinse, still sticky hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I searched a sulfate-free color-safe shampoo and switched to Enjoy Luxury last week.</li>
            <li>Back to Bert&#x27;s Bees sulfate free even though it isn&#x27;t for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>was using Redkin, and I didn&#x27;t really like it and was running</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>dont use conditoner, it ends up making my hair really greasy</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I find that my color does not fade as fast and my hair feels a lot softer than it used to.  </li>
            <li>At least it smells good...</li>
            <li>As a new mother I really convinced myself of this, I just assumed I was that absent minded!</li>
            <li>If your hair is dry, maybe, but I am sure there are better products, at less cost that won&#x27;t leave it feeling like I just oiled up my head.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling greasy and never was clean.</li>
            <li>I recently colored my hair bright red and, as I have had red hair before, knew enough to get a sulfate free shampoo and to wash in the coldest water I can stand.</li>
            <li>if your hair is dry, this is fine.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this shampoo my hair was so soft the</li>
            <li>normally like Nexxus but never noticed the same clean shimmer from this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nexxus shampoo and conditioner for more years than I care to admit and the pink color assure stands tall right next to all of the Nexxus products.  </li>
            <li>is I first use my old shampoo, then for my second quick wash</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re lucky enough to get an old bottle of the creamy white shampoo enjoy it while it lasts.</li>
            <li>The dispensing bottle is so much better than the typical squeeze bottles.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I mean, I&#x27;m 40, surely I know how to do that, right?  </li>
            <li>I like the large bottles and the pump action</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the regular Nexxus shampoo and conditioner from Costco for the past 2 years and loved how it left my hair soft, clean, and undamaged.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and it really cleans it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a total convert, I will be buying Nexxus Color Assure shampoo and conditioner, because the price is SO WORTH</li>
            <li>normal to oily hair</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair &amp; have found that this is the only shampoo that keeps my color fresh between salon visits</li>
            <li>My hair is soft &amp; healthy and not weighted down like it is with the Humectress product line.</li>
            <li>This often leads to the necessity of washing your hair super frequently because the over production of oil makes your hair look extra oily sooner than it</li>
            <li>I tried this Shampoo just to try something new.</li>
            <li>So creamy and takes some work to lather up but keeps my hair color shiny and vibrant and doesn&#x27;t shed my hair from it&#x27;s natural oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these products for many years, and even though I try other stuff, I always end up coming back to Nexxus Therappe and Color Assure Shampoo and Humectress conditioner.</li>
            <li>This product works as weel or better than any shampoo I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>At first I thought that I had simply missed rinsing all the shampoo out of my hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I thought I hadn&#x27;t rinsed well enough so</li>
            <li>the second and third time I used it I made sure I rinsed it extra well - also</li>
            <li>I think if you have fine hair that tends to be a little on the greasy side anyways, avoid this one.</li>
            <li>I think so many had a bad first use with this because they had never used a sulfate free shampoo before.  </li>
            <li>and I used just enough to lather the top half and bottom (two pumps)</li>
            <li>I purchase this large bottle, but I refill a smaller squeeze bottle to have in my shower.</li>
            <li>The next day I used it again and made certain I rinsed well.</li>
            <li>Steer clear.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft, like silk, really it is SO SOFT, that I cannot believe it.  </li>
            <li>Now, unexpectedly, my hair is so lush and supple</li>
            <li>It also strips your hair of its natural oils, which can lead to your scalp over producing oil.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sulfate-free products are gentler on hair and do not over-strip your natural oils.  </li>
            <li>Wow is all I can say.</li>
            <li>I will just have to stock up on the old formula, then look for another brand when that runs out.</li>
            <li>This formal is completely off.</li>
            <li>You either have greasy hair anyway, aren&#x27;t properly washing your hair, or are using way too much conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser was very concerned during my last visit, so said to quit using the stuff.</li>
            <li>It does not rinse out completely and it made may hair stick &amp; greasy.</li>
            <li>I hope this helps people looking into this shampoo, because it truly does wonders for keeping your colored hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I had to throw it in the trash and see my stylist for early color application.</li>
            <li>Tried rinsing extra much.  </li>
            <li>not waste your money on this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There is no way to tell if it&#x27;s really the same stuff without a laboratory test, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even add water because it&#x27;s so thick that it works better diluted.</li>
            <li>, I used even less thinking perhaps the first time I may have used too much - but no, it&#x27;s nothing I did.  </li>
            <li>I was shocked because I normally use Nexxus Therappe shampoo, and have always been happy with it.</li>
            <li>have normal hair with gentle partial highlights.</li>
            <li>Other products have way more water, and you can tell when you squeeze out the shampoo and its soft and running down your hand.  </li>
            <li>but after several tries, it always leaves my hair super greasy.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t bother to publicly review hair products, but I figured people needed a warning for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>then any other shampoo, there is much less water in it, so I&#x27;m convinced its actually a much better value then you would expect.  </li>
            <li>The problem with switching to a new sulfate formula is that your hair continues to produce the oils that it used to produce after it was stripped of them using traditional shampoos.</li>
            <li>I shampoo my hair once per week, so the over-drying problem is not due to over-washing.</li>
            <li>first bottle was normal, but the second bottle of shampoo ( both are grey bottles ) has no lather  !!!!!</li>
            <li>The product itself goes a lot farther than other shampoo products and leaves your hair and scalp with little residue --  your hair and scalp will feel very clean</li>
            <li>Too bad, they screwed up a great product.</li>
            <li>I can barely even run my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li>Apparently it doesn&#x27;t do it to everyone, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>I notice this I immediately switched back to my old Head n&#x27;Shoulders and the problems dissapeared immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My color started washing out in about 3 weeks just like normal shampoo, so I am not sure it was worth extra money</li>
            <li>I loved the old version of this shampoo and was SO disappointed when I tried this new formula.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that is normal to dry.</li>
            <li>My shiny clean hair is now dull and waxy.</li>
            <li>have used this brand of shampoo many times in the past, and have always noticed how thick it is, and how it makes almost too much lather.</li>
            <li>It actually looked worse the more</li>
            <li>First I thought the shampoo was so mousturizing, that that&#x27;s why it left the hair feeling heavy, like if you put conditioner</li>
            <li>No matter how much I rinsed my hair, I still looked like a greasy mess.</li>
            <li>The shampoo in the silver bottle was creamy white, the shampoo in the big pink bottle is clear.  </li>

            <li> This has a wonderful fragrance</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a losing battle) and Nexxus is the best.  </li>
            <li> .. makes my hair smell good though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this shampoo, but do have some concerns about the packaging.</li>

            <li> Great price, shampoo that does the trick.</li>
            <li> great price...</li>

            <li> Excellent product, has always been my favorite....</li>
            <li> Best sulfate free shampoo out there for this price!  </li>
            <li> This shampoo works great on my very fine colored hair and this was a great purchase price.  </li>
            <li> : It smells good.  </li>
            <li> I wish the fragrance lingered, it smells so good to wash your hair with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo in the store because it smelled good, it was sulfate-free, and it was marketed as being color-safe.</li>
            <li> but i think the product works as described and it is a good product i bought two of these for about 9 dollars each with the 50% discount</li>
            <li> so I thought this would color my hair good</li>
            <li> I bought this because the price was really good</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> Got this in my Birchbox and loved the smell</li>
            <li> I guess there is nothing more to add, this shampoo is very nice for colored hair.</li>
            <li> There is  nothing more to add, this shampoo is very nice for colored hair.</li>
            <li> Color Assure, specifically, is a favorite sulfate-free shampoo of mine!  </li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and condition from Nexxus is amazing</li>
            <li> it leave my hair nice and shiny</li>
            <li> Like I said, the smell is awesome but it leaves your hair greasy no matter how much you rinse it.</li>
            <li> I liked it for the most part that is until my hair started to fall out in clumps.  </li>
            <li> I might prefer the moisture one more because this one is kind of wierd</li>
            <li> Nexxus has great products and although they are pricey sometimes, Amazon generally offers a good deal on them.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so when I first started using it thought I loved the shampoo, because it smells really good, I love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The item description was very accurate.</li>
            <li> This product has been great on my curly hair and provides superior curl definition and conditioning without having to use an extra conditioning product.</li>
            <li> It does as it advertises, preserves highlights and dye in a most satisfactory way.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nexxuss Color Assure shampoo for years, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I thought ordering here was a better deal, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo, makes my hair so smooth and soft and smells so good!!</li>
            <li> , that is for sure.</li>
            <li> I used to love Nexxus.</li>
            <li> They leave my hair SO oily on the roots, and I don&#x27;t tend to have oily hair unless I don&#x27;t wash it for more than 3 days.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Sulfates are detergents and that&#x27;s why shampoos with sulfates in them have more sudsy lather.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it I honestly thought I had forgotten to rinse the conditioner out of my hair!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many</li>
            <li> Oftentimes it takes weeks to get your scalp and hair used to the sulfate-free formulas which are better for you and your hair.</li>
            <li> I reallly love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite BRAND...</li>
            <li> And spend more money.&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li> I have been doing, which alleviated the problem as well,</li>
            <li> Better than what my salon uses and better than Matrix.</li>
            <li> Yes, your hair is not going to feel &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean, but it will still be clean, and it will still be good to put your conditioner in afterwards.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had my hair colored at a salon, where I normally do it at home, and I thought the color was very nice</li>
            <li> When I used this shampoo I had high expectations because of many good experiences with this brand.</li>
            <li> I have a full size of this untouched!  </li>
            <li> After blowing it out, my hair was softer but it tangles too easily.</li>
            <li> makes getting the shampoo in your hands easy.</li>
            <li> first of all it did keep my color beautiful for sure, but I also had another unexpected side effect!  </li>
            <li> Hair is clean, soft and my curls are happy once again.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure that I had not rinsed it well the first time and decided to try it one more time.</li>
            <li> fine-</li>
            <li> and my hair washed fine.</li>
            <li> the zero sulfates seems to keep the coloring in my hair longer as i have used the color assure with sulfates and the color washes away more quickly</li>
            <li> I have excellent water pressure, but after rinsing and rinsing, my hair still felt heavy with the product</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t create a lot of suds because it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo.</li>
            <li> ; that has nothing to do with it being sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> This is an OIL based product that is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy this shampoo because I know how to use it, and the benefits of using a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good, but I can tell you I&#x27;ll never buy this Nexus product again.</li>
            <li> I loved the old Nxxus color shampoo in a gray bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing like the Nexxus shampoo I&#x27;m used to, the original.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and this duo does a great job cleansing while not stripping my hair of color.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it was on vacation because it came with a free travel size bottle (yippee!), and I thought it was the water there or something.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to rinse until your hair feels squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Sulfates are an inexpensive filler ingredient in shampoos that leaves your hair feeling squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Shampoo because I needed clean hair.</li>
            <li> My hair felt clean after I use the shampoo</li>
            <li> I had to use another shampoo to clean this product out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Stripped the color right out of my hair!  </li>
            <li> But my hair is much softer and more manageble with this shampoo than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nexxus Color Assure shampoo for several years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair immediately unsnarled, soft, blows out nicely.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for quite some time and loved it until recently.</li>
            <li> I gave this one star only because it still smells good.</li>
            <li> Back to good ole Dove shampoo and conditioner for $5.00 each.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted to try the full size.</li>
            <li> The rich tones in my freshly colored hair faded to a mousey brassy bronde color</li>
            <li> God Bless Amazon for quickly refunding my money.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, but I had never gotten this particular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would almost say that my hair color is more vibrant since&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will never use this again and would not recommend to anyone who wants clean hair!  </li>
            <li> rinsing out more color by the amount of time I need to take to TRY and get this junk out than if I just used normal shampoo</li>
            <li> I purchased for my wife who uses the product daily - very satisfied with the product, packaging and delivery.</li>
            <li> Thanks Nexxus!!</li>
            <li> Sulfate free does not mean it won&#x27;t clean your hair.</li>
            <li> Plus is smells amazing and does its job, keeping your color lush and vibrant and repairing the damage the coloring process causes!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to have a larger  bottle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like a toner where it semi restores the highlights to brighter, freshly colored hair but this maintains your color if used as soon as hair is bleached.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something different and liked the smell.  </li>
            <li> I always loved this shampoo until I got the pink bottle instead of the gray one.</li>
            <li> Fun getting it in the mail.</li>
            <li> This shampoo definitely has an ingredient that causes you to feel like you aren&#x27;t getting all the shampoo out when rinsing, but for me, I noticed right away that my hair texture was more smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Nexxus Therappe Shampoo daily and love it, so I was excited to try their color formula when I saw it.  </li>
            <li> No complains, work much better than many other shampoos.</li>
            <li> purchased this in hope that it would be as good as other Nexxus products</li>
            <li> My shampoo is in a bottle that looks like Nexxus Color Assure, but the Nexxus logo isn&#x27;t quite right.  </li>
            <li> What arrived just didn&#x27;t look right.  </li>
            <li> Well, this product makes it look like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in 3 days right after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair feel greasy right after I wash it.</li>
            <li> IMHO the true test of a color safe shampoo is on red hair dye and Nexxus makes the cut.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been dyed many many times, permanent dye, and I had some damage from a black dye I used to use that</li>
            <li> I have normal hair, and prefer it to be grease free, so this went into the trash.</li>
            <li> ... let me first say I do not ordinarily buy shampoo that costs $15, I normally buy cheap shampoo and conditioner because after years and years of trying many shampoos and conditioners I never noticed a difference with anything I used really.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t contacted amazon or nexus to determine if my bottle is counterfeit or not because I am happy with the product, but it is definitely a reminder to me (and you if you&#x27;re reading this) that the potential for counterfeiting on the amazon platform does exist</li>
            <li> my hair is still kind of dry</li>
            <li> No complains, works much better than other shampoos for fine, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is ombre with very light blonde towards the ends.</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with the pre wash primer and conditioner and my shoulder length fine hair is soft, hydrated and manageable.</li>
            <li> I decided to invest in a good shampoo in hopes that it would protect my color a little longer.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal on these hard to find products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great quality product, and this is a great price for it, especially considering how long this bottle lasts when you can wash your hair less frequently!</li>
            <li> It is the first time I have had a real measurable noticeable effect from a shampoo/conditioner!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the price because it left my hair looking healthy, even though I hadn&#x27;t cut my hair in 2 years.</li>
            <li> I especially like the way the conditioner leaves my hair feeling healthy and nourished.  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought, no way, so tried it again and again.  </li>
            <li> decide to order from amazon for first time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And for this price it was very upsetting!</li>
            <li> I double checked to make sure I hadn&#x27;t accidently used conditioner.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was because I didn&#x27;t rinse it all out</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll sit under the water for a good few minutes (way longer than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used in my life) and then get out</li>
            <li> I thought I used too much and wasn&#x27;t rinsing it out right</li>
            <li> , many other reviewers have mentioned that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t wash off, and they are quite right.</li>
            <li> This is a large pump bottle of clean-rinsing shampoo for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> The container is HUGE, it will last me so so long, I&#x27;m so pleased.</li>
            <li> Nope, and it left my fine hair feeling greasy and stringy.  </li>
            <li> I will never use another sulfate free shampoo again, especially this one.</li>
            <li> I regret spending so much on these products.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I rinse out my hair, it leaves a residue and makes my hair feel and look dirty/oily.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the whole system, just shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> No matter how much I rinse and rinse, still sticky hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I searched a sulfate-free color-safe shampoo and switched to Enjoy Luxury last week.</li>
            <li> Back to Bert&#x27;s Bees sulfate free even though it isn&#x27;t for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> was using Redkin, and I didn&#x27;t really like it and was running</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> dont use conditoner, it ends up making my hair really greasy</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I find that my color does not fade as fast and my hair feels a lot softer than it used to.  </li>
            <li> At least it smells good...</li>
            <li> As a new mother I really convinced myself of this, I just assumed I was that absent minded!</li>
            <li> If your hair is dry, maybe, but I am sure there are better products, at less cost that won&#x27;t leave it feeling like I just oiled up my head.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling greasy and never was clean.</li>
            <li> I recently colored my hair bright red and, as I have had red hair before, knew enough to get a sulfate free shampoo and to wash in the coldest water I can stand.</li>
            <li> if your hair is dry, this is fine.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this shampoo my hair was so soft the</li>
            <li> normally like Nexxus but never noticed the same clean shimmer from this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nexxus shampoo and conditioner for more years than I care to admit and the pink color assure stands tall right next to all of the Nexxus products.  </li>
            <li> is I first use my old shampoo, then for my second quick wash</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re lucky enough to get an old bottle of the creamy white shampoo enjoy it while it lasts.</li>
            <li> The dispensing bottle is so much better than the typical squeeze bottles.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;m 40, surely I know how to do that, right?  </li>
            <li> I like the large bottles and the pump action</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the regular Nexxus shampoo and conditioner from Costco for the past 2 years and loved how it left my hair soft, clean, and undamaged.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and it really cleans it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a total convert, I will be buying Nexxus Color Assure shampoo and conditioner, because the price is SO WORTH</li>
            <li> normal to oily hair</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair &amp; have found that this is the only shampoo that keeps my color fresh between salon visits</li>
            <li> My hair is soft &amp; healthy and not weighted down like it is with the Humectress product line.</li>
            <li> This often leads to the necessity of washing your hair super frequently because the over production of oil makes your hair look extra oily sooner than it</li>
            <li> I tried this Shampoo just to try something new.</li>
            <li> So creamy and takes some work to lather up but keeps my hair color shiny and vibrant and doesn&#x27;t shed my hair from it&#x27;s natural oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these products for many years, and even though I try other stuff, I always end up coming back to Nexxus Therappe and Color Assure Shampoo and Humectress conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product works as weel or better than any shampoo I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> At first I thought that I had simply missed rinsing all the shampoo out of my hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I thought I hadn&#x27;t rinsed well enough so</li>
            <li> the second and third time I used it I made sure I rinsed it extra well - also</li>
            <li> I think if you have fine hair that tends to be a little on the greasy side anyways, avoid this one.</li>
            <li> I think so many had a bad first use with this because they had never used a sulfate free shampoo before.  </li>
            <li> and I used just enough to lather the top half and bottom (two pumps)</li>
            <li> I purchase this large bottle, but I refill a smaller squeeze bottle to have in my shower.</li>
            <li> The next day I used it again and made certain I rinsed well.</li>
            <li> Steer clear.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so soft, like silk, really it is SO SOFT, that I cannot believe it.  </li>
            <li> Now, unexpectedly, my hair is so lush and supple</li>
            <li> It also strips your hair of its natural oils, which can lead to your scalp over producing oil.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sulfate-free products are gentler on hair and do not over-strip your natural oils.  </li>
            <li> Wow is all I can say.</li>
            <li> I will just have to stock up on the old formula, then look for another brand when that runs out.</li>
            <li> This formal is completely off.</li>
            <li> You either have greasy hair anyway, aren&#x27;t properly washing your hair, or are using way too much conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser was very concerned during my last visit, so said to quit using the stuff.</li>
            <li> It does not rinse out completely and it made may hair stick &amp; greasy.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps people looking into this shampoo, because it truly does wonders for keeping your colored hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I had to throw it in the trash and see my stylist for early color application.</li>
            <li> Tried rinsing extra much.  </li>
            <li> not waste your money on this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is no way to tell if it&#x27;s really the same stuff without a laboratory test, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even add water because it&#x27;s so thick that it works better diluted.</li>
            <li> , I used even less thinking perhaps the first time I may have used too much - but no, it&#x27;s nothing I did.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked because I normally use Nexxus Therappe shampoo, and have always been happy with it.</li>
            <li> have normal hair with gentle partial highlights.</li>
            <li> Other products have way more water, and you can tell when you squeeze out the shampoo and its soft and running down your hand.  </li>
            <li> but after several tries, it always leaves my hair super greasy.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t bother to publicly review hair products, but I figured people needed a warning for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> then any other shampoo, there is much less water in it, so I&#x27;m convinced its actually a much better value then you would expect.  </li>
            <li> The problem with switching to a new sulfate formula is that your hair continues to produce the oils that it used to produce after it was stripped of them using traditional shampoos.</li>
            <li> I shampoo my hair once per week, so the over-drying problem is not due to over-washing.</li>
            <li> first bottle was normal, but the second bottle of shampoo ( both are grey bottles ) has no lather  !!!!!</li>
            <li> The product itself goes a lot farther than other shampoo products and leaves your hair and scalp with little residue --  your hair and scalp will feel very clean</li>
            <li> Too bad, they screwed up a great product.</li>
            <li> I can barely even run my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li> Apparently it doesn&#x27;t do it to everyone, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I notice this I immediately switched back to my old Head n&#x27;Shoulders and the problems dissapeared immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My color started washing out in about 3 weeks just like normal shampoo, so I am not sure it was worth extra money</li>
            <li> I loved the old version of this shampoo and was SO disappointed when I tried this new formula.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that is normal to dry.</li>
            <li> My shiny clean hair is now dull and waxy.</li>
            <li> have used this brand of shampoo many times in the past, and have always noticed how thick it is, and how it makes almost too much lather.</li>
            <li> It actually looked worse the more</li>
            <li> First I thought the shampoo was so mousturizing, that that&#x27;s why it left the hair feeling heavy, like if you put conditioner</li>
            <li> No matter how much I rinsed my hair, I still looked like a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> The shampoo in the silver bottle was creamy white, the shampoo in the big pink bottle is clear.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the hair a little oily and does not feel clean SHOULD HAVE SHOPPED a little longer</li>
            <li> The other reviews are complaining that it&#x27;s clear and slimy and makes their hair oily.....</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it, which made it very difficult to get a decent lather.</li>
            <li> new formula doesn&#x27;t clean my hair at all, and leaves a really, really heavy residue behind.</li>
            <li> Made my hair flat and build up was bad..would not buy.</li>
            <li> The only thing it is fine at is shaving my legs--and thats some expensive &amp;#34;shaving cream&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and after shampooing my hair felt greasy and dirty afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to hunt down what&#x27;s left of the silver bottle shampoo and then find a new one, because there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to use the stuff in the pink bottle.  </li>
            <li> Sad, I don&#x27;t even want to give away the full bottle!</li>
            <li> But once you do your hair looks and feels healthier, and you can wash it a lot less frequently.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel soft bu almost a little greasey.  </li>
            <li> I put some of the shampoo from the big pink bottle on my hands, added some water, and then rubbed my hands to make some foam.  </li>
            <li> The pink version is different-</li>
            <li> I began looking both bottle of shampoo over and found that the pink one is &amp;#34;Sulfate Free&amp;#34; and contains all different ingredients from the gray bottle.</li>
            <li> Typically I buy a much smaller bottle (if I can find it) at a local store</li>
            <li> Now that I know I can purchase this product from Amazon for half the price, I will definitely be purchasing from Amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> My hair color never lasts very long, and this hasn&#x27;t improved that problem.  </li>
            <li> and when my hair dries it&#x27;s greasy and dry and stuck together like straw or as if I put gel in my hair.</li>
            <li> After running my hands through my hair my hands felt like they had a film of dry shampoo on them.</li>
            <li> Also makes it feel conditioned and not so dry...</li>
            <li> And now my hands are stinging and excessively dry!  </li>
            <li> it actually does is fail to clean or rinse out, and leave a heavy buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do not wash my hair everyday, because I like to have my natural oils help condition my hair, it feels softer, healthier and my color lasts much longer since I started doing that, BUT with this shampoo, you won&#x27;t last an extra day because your scalp will feel dirty, itchy, oily &amp; dandruff-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was \\&quot;natural\\&quot; but for some reason made my hair very dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Amazon does not adequately describe this product for you to know this other than the bottle color being different.  </li>
            <li> and it has changed ingredients before, but this new change is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using sulfate free shampoo for years and didn&#x27;t have any of the greasiness or dirty feeling</li>
            <li> It leaves a residue behind, no matter how much I try to rinse.</li>
            <li> got my hair highlighted with 3 different colors a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was at Target and they no longer carried the silver bottle Nexxus shampoo nor it&#x27;s conditioner mate, so I purchased the pink bottle shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It might be my imagination, but this batch seems thinner, and does not lather up the way I expected.</li>
            <li> History: professional dye job, thick curly hair that gets blown out every other day, hypothyroid</li>
            <li> Even without using the accompanying Color Assure conditioner, I came out of the shower and dried my hair to find it dull, lank, and a little crusty, as though too much product had been applied, just from using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> At first I was thinking the stuff I bought from Amazon is fake, but then I went to the Nexxus web site and it looks like Nexxus changed the product.  </li>
            <li> I literally have to use other shampoo to get it out of my hair</li>
            <li> other reviewers stated.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as other reviewers have stated, it leaves my hair feeling dirtier than before I showered.</li>
            <li> Will stick to the other types of Nexxus shampoo.</li>
            <li> From reading some of the other comments, it seems that they may have changed their formula.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s counterfeit or no quality control wherever it was manufactured, but not using further.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was old or fake or what, but it is not the same as what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> I had to transfer the shampoo into an empty bottle from a previous purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems like it will not wash out at all and leaves my hair feeling greasy and weighed down.  </li>
            <li> It is oily, it does not rinse out, there are no suds, and my hair looks stringy and dirty right</li>
            <li> I have very thin straight hair</li>
            <li> I bought this for a lot less than buying it in the store.  </li>
            <li> I have to use way less of this stuff</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how disappointed I am to have wasted close to $20 on a large bottle of this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I ordered Nexxus Color Assure shampoo and ended up with this pink bottle rather than my usual silver bottle.</li>
            <li> It finally arrived in a thin padded envelope, which was not suitable for such a heavy item.</li>
            <li> My hair feels greasy, it makes it hard to blow dry cause</li>
            <li> extremely thick, so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> as others have stated, this product leaves my hair looking disgustingly greasy, and for the price it pretty much pisses me off.</li>
            <li> The Nexxus is very thick, I have to squeeze the bottle hard to get the product out, and when I use it I only need about a quarter size, maybe 1.5 quarters, to wash my very long</li>
            <li> no matter how little I use</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned when I ordered Nexxus Color Assure Shampoo from Amazon based on another person&#x27;s experience of getting a knock off version.  </li>
            <li> After spending all that money I not only had horribly limp weighed down greasy hair, my color became brassy!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair greasy and limp.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> What it means is that there aren&#x27;t any harsh detergents that can strip your hair of its color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo three times now, and after drying my hair, it feels like I have a heavy product in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the hair heavy, almost greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often take the trouble to review products because I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m that educated a consumer.  </li>
            <li> Trying to be optimistic, I dried my hair as usual, figuring maybe the end result would be favorable...</li>
            <li> I gave over half the bottle to my sister who has thick and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> wife and kids claim its heavy and hard to rinse</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s usual pearly-white), the smell was off (lemon-like), and it didn&#x27;t make my hair as silky-textured.</li>
            <li> Not sure why?  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> No more luxurious lather.</li>
            <li> I contacted Nexxus and was told there was a packaging (no more silver/gray bottle) and formula change in December.</li>
            <li> I had another bottle of the shampoo in the silver bottle, I used it along with my usual Humectress and my hair no longer has the coating.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s heavy, greasy, just yuck!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> I have coloured hair and it tends to get very dried out.</li>
            <li> be hunting down the old bottles :(</li>
            <li> and hence it is really hard to use.</li>
            <li> I am a little confused by the reviews this product got.  </li>
            <li> but my experience has been different, my hair felt greasy and dirty after shampooing with this product.</li>
            <li> and i was furious as i tried delicately to comb the tangles out.</li>
            <li> It leaves a thick, greasy-feeling residue at the roots of your hair.  </li>
            <li> do have really thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Nexxus products in the past and have never had such a bad experience.  </li>
            <li> Hate to shop in high priced hair product stores.</li>
            <li> I have a giant bottle of it, but it doesn&#x27;t rinse out and leaves my hair completely impossible to style.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sulfate-free shampoos before, so I wasn&#x27;t shocked at the lack of lather, but I was NOT expecting my hair to be left with an oily coating that just wouldn&#x27;t rinse out!</li>
            <li> As usual, it smells FAB!!</li>
            <li> I am soooooooo angry that I spent 16 bucks on a bottle of shampoo that makes my hair feel dirty.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is the absolute WORST.  </li>
            <li> I am NOT HAPPY.  </li>
            <li> This was worse than 4th day hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to even review such a terrible product.  </li>
            <li> The new formulation is awful!  </li>
            <li> Apparently they reformulated in 2014 to this awful stuff.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not save the receipt and have now wasted almost $40. :(((</li>
            <li> The doctor found nothing wrong.</li>
            <li> Plus, day two hair (a necessity if you&#x27;re sporting a red dye job) is just disgusting ...</li>
            <li> I never buy expensive products and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> WRONG.  </li>
            <li> My hair was thickly coated and when I tried to brush it my hair began breaking off!!!</li>
            <li> Wash your hair with this &amp; you&#x27;ll feel the need to wash it  over &amp; over in an attempt to wash out that sticki and dirty feeling.  </li>
            <li> I agree with everyone saying the shampoo does not rinse out and leaves hair oily and dirty looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> My hair looks dirty and stringy and feels so greasy.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will not be buying this again nor recommending this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This time it was even worse!!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel hard and disgusting.</li>
            <li> shampoo is very difficult to lather.  </li>
            <li> Very weird, and</li>
            <li> it was very difficult to rinse off, too.  </li>
            <li> Also makes your hair impossible to blowdry and makes my bangs look greasy and unwashed.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the bad reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely difficult to rinse out and, worst of all, since I started using it, I&#x27;ve been getting painful acne on my scalp.</li>
            <li> As others have said, it made my hair feel dirty and greasy!</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I was quickly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Truly disappointed in this product.  </li>

            <li> The shampoo does not rinse out, leaving your hair feeling dirty &amp; disgusting.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve never had a flaky scalp ever and 1 week of using this crap</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product!! As others have said, it made my hair feel dirty and greasy! I thought for sure that I had not rinsed it well the first time and decided to try it one more time. The second time I used it, I had the same results. :( Needless to say, I will not be buying this again nor recommending this to anyone!</li>
            <li> NOT recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Nexxus Therappe Shampoo daily and love it, so I was excited to try their color formula when I saw it.  What a let-down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Color Assure claims to protect color by keeping water out of your hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it actually does is fail to clean or rinse out, and leave a heavy buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is very difficult to lather.  I have excellent water pressure, but after rinsing and rinsing, my hair still felt heavy with the product (I guess this is where the &#x27;keeps water out&#x27; thing comes in).  Even without using the accompanying Color Assure conditioner, I came out of the shower and dried my hair to find it dull, lank, and a little crusty, as though too much product had been applied, just from using this shampoo.  So NOT a fresh-washed feel.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a lot less than buying it in the store.  Very impressed with the product and price.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> My color started washing out in about 3 weeks just like normal shampoo, so I am not sure it was worth extra money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this shampoo, but do have some concerns about the packaging. My shampoo is in a bottle that looks like Nexxus Color Assure, but the Nexxus logo isn&#x27;t quite right.  Instead of having 2 Xs that are in an elingated script, my bottle has 2 Xs that are in an arial style font.  I haven&#x27;t contacted amazon or nexus to determine if my bottle is counterfeit or not because I am happy with the product, but it is definitely a reminder to me (and you if you&#x27;re reading this) that the potential for counterfeiting on the amazon platform does exist</li>
            <li> A lot of people are complaining that this shampoo makes your hair feel greasy. I have curly hair that is normal to dry. This shampoo definitely has an ingredient that causes you to feel like you aren&#x27;t getting all the shampoo out when rinsing, but for me, I noticed right away that my hair texture was more smooth. I would definitely not classify it at greasy. This product has been great on my curly hair and provides superior curl definition and conditioning without having to use an extra conditioning product. It doesn&#x27;t create a lot of suds because it is sulfate free. Don&#x27;t try to rinse until your hair feels squeaky clean. I don&#x27;t feel this shampoo leaves any residue. Hair is clean, soft and my curls are happy once again.</li>
            <li> I purchase this shampoo because I use coloring products - highlights and hair dye on my hair by a professionsl hair stylist.  It does as it advertises, preserves highlights and dye in a most satisfactory way.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and condition from Nexxus is amazing... let me first say I do not ordinarily buy shampoo that costs $15, I normally buy cheap shampoo and conditioner because after years and years of trying many shampoos and conditioners I never noticed a difference with anything I used really.  I bought this because I had my hair colored at a salon, where I normally do it at home, and I thought the color was very nice so I wanted to try to buy a salon brand in hopes that it would make the color keep longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well first of all it did keep my color beautiful for sure, but I also had another unexpected side effect!  It made my hair so soft, like silk, really it is SO SOFT, that I cannot believe it.  My hair has been dyed many many times, permanent dye, and I had some damage from a black dye I used to use that was \\&quot;natural\\&quot; but for some reason made my hair very dry and brittle.  Now, unexpectedly, my hair is so lush and supple, you would never guess my hair was dyed.  Also I have a lot of sensitivities, but I have had no reaction to the shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its extremely thick, so a little goes a long way.  I have to use way less of this stuff then any other shampoo, there is much less water in it, so I&#x27;m convinced its actually a much better value then you would expect.  Other products have way more water, and you can tell when you squeeze out the shampoo and its soft and running down your hand.  The Nexxus is very thick, I have to squeeze the bottle hard to get the product out, and when I use it I only need about a quarter size, maybe 1.5 quarters, to wash my very long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m a total convert, I will be buying Nexxus Color Assure shampoo and conditioner, because the price is SO WORTH IT.  It is the first time I have had a real measurable noticeable effect from a shampoo/conditioner!  Plus is smells amazing and does its job, keeping your color lush and vibrant and repairing the damage the coloring process causes!</li>
            <li> Nexxus has great products and although they are pricey sometimes, Amazon generally offers a good deal on them.  I would suggest using the Humectress conditioner with this product as the combination leaves your hair with a lot of body and no frizz. The product itself goes a lot farther than other shampoo products and leaves your hair and scalp with little residue --  your hair and scalp will feel very clean but it is not astringent. I&#x27;ve used these products for many years, and even though I try other stuff, I always end up coming back to Nexxus Therappe and Color Assure Shampoo and Humectress conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nexxuss Color Assure shampoo for years, and I love it. I thought ordering here was a better deal, but you get what you pay for. I don&#x27;t know if this was old or fake or what, but it is not the same as what I&#x27;m used to. The color of the shampoo was yellow (it&#x27;s usual pearly-white), the smell was off (lemon-like), and it didn&#x27;t make my hair as silky-textured. I contacted the seller last week but still haven&#x27;t received a response. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried this Shampoo just to try something new. I liked it for the most part that is until my hair started to fall out in clumps.  I actually went to the doctor because I had bald spots from the severe hair loss.  The doctor found nothing wrong. I thought no way it could be the shampoo until I read another review stating the same thing.  I stopped using this two weeks ago and I am happy to say my hair has stopped falling out.  I will never use another sulfate free shampoo again, especially this one.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo, makes my hair so smooth and soft and smells so good!! This one bottle lasted months!!</li>
            <li> Pros: It smells good.  Cons: It leaves a thick, greasy-feeling residue at the roots of your hair.  Will not buy again, that is for sure.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE SHAMPOO!  This left my hair so greasy.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My hair color never lasts very long, and this hasn&#x27;t improved that problem.  But my hair is much softer and more manageble with this shampoo than others I&#x27;ve tried.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchase this large bottle, but I refill a smaller squeeze bottle to have in my shower. I even add water because it&#x27;s so thick that it works better diluted.</li>
            <li> as others have stated, this product leaves my hair looking disgustingly greasy, and for the price it pretty much pisses me off. terrible shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I read reviews but my experience has been different, my hair felt greasy and dirty after shampooing with this product. I dont recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing like the Nexxus shampoo I&#x27;m used to, the original.  My hair is very fine and after shampooing my hair felt greasy and dirty afterwards.  I gave over half the bottle to my sister who has thick and curly hair.  Her hair doesn&#x27;t feel anything like that and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;So I think if you have fine hair that tends to be a little on the greasy side anyways, avoid this one.</li>
            <li> After seeing the low reviews for this product I felt compelled to write a review.  This is a sulfate-free product which a lot of shampoo-users may not be used to using.  Sulfates are an inexpensive filler ingredient in shampoos that leaves your hair feeling squeaky clean.  It also strips your hair of its natural oils, which can lead to your scalp over producing oil.  This often leads to the necessity of washing your hair super frequently because the over production of oil makes your hair look extra oily sooner than it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate-free products are gentler on hair and do not over-strip your natural oils.  They often require an adjustment period to balance out your oil production.  But once you do your hair looks and feels healthier, and you can wash it a lot less frequently.  I went from daily shampooing to only shampooing once or twice a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Color Assure, specifically, is a favorite sulfate-free shampoo of mine!  It&#x27;s a great quality product, and this is a great price for it, especially considering how long this bottle lasts when you can wash your hair less frequently!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is terrible. It makes my hair feel greasy and gross. My hair actually feels dirtier after I wash it. Don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nexxus Color Assure shampoo for several years and loved it.  I always bought the regular sized silver bottle.  I decided to get the big 34 ounce bottle to save some money.  What arrived just didn&#x27;t look right.  The shampoo in the silver bottle was creamy white, the shampoo in the big pink bottle is clear.  I put some of the shampoo from the big pink bottle on my hands, added some water, and then rubbed my hands to make some foam.  What I got instead was slime!  Very weird, and it was very difficult to rinse off, too.  And now my hands are stinging and excessively dry!  This has never happened to me with the silver bottle shampoo.  At first I was thinking the stuff I bought from Amazon is fake, but then I went to the Nexxus web site and it looks like Nexxus changed the product.  There are lots of complaints on the Nexxus web site.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to hunt down what&#x27;s left of the silver bottle shampoo and then find a new one, because there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to use the stuff in the pink bottle.  Too bad, they screwed up a great product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo never washes out. I literally have to use other shampoo to get it out of my hair&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll sit under the water for a good few minutes (way longer than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used in my life) and then get out and when my hair dries it&#x27;s greasy and dry and stuck together like straw or as if I put gel in my hair. It&#x27;s awful.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is greasier than if I never took a shower at all.&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t seem to get it out of my hair!!&lt;br /&gt;I do have really thick hair. But I&#x27;ve never had this issue in all my life of hair washing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rinsing out more color by the amount of time I need to take to TRY and get this junk out than if I just used normal shampoo</li>
            <li> Shampoo does not wash off my hair.  Not sure why?  I used to love Nexxus. Leaves my hair in clumps. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great price, shampoo that does the trick. Cleans without drying. I wish the fragrance lingered, it smells so good to wash your hair with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this Shampoo because I needed clean hair. It leaves the hair a little oily and does not feel clean SHOULD HAVE SHOPPED a little longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the regular Nexxus shampoo and conditioner from Costco for the past 2 years and loved how it left my hair soft, clean, and undamaged. I didn&#x27;t mind the price because it left my hair looking healthy, even though I hadn&#x27;t cut my hair in 2 years. I recently dyed my hair, and since I trusted the regular shampoo and conditioner, I bought the Color Assure brand shampoo and conditioner. I regret spending so much on these products. They leave my hair SO oily on the roots, and I don&#x27;t tend to have oily hair unless I don&#x27;t wash it for more than 3 days. Well, this product makes it look like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in 3 days right after getting out of the shower. It&#x27;s gross.</li>
            <li> This product works as weel or better than any shampoo I have used in the past. It is Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the bad reviews for this product.  I think so many had a bad first use with this because they had never used a sulfate free shampoo before.  Your hair goes through a learning curve when switching so it takes some getting used to.  I&#x27;ve been using sulfate free shampoo for years and didn&#x27;t have any of the greasiness or dirty feeling other reviewers stated.  I used this in conjunction with the pre wash primer and conditioner and my shoulder length fine hair is soft, hydrated and manageable.</li>
            <li> it leave my hair nice and shiny I love it</li>
            <li> I guess there is nothing more to add, this shampoo is very nice for colored hair. No complains, works much better than other shampoos for fine, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> too oily. if your hair is dry, this is fine. normal to oily hair - skip this one</li>
            <li> YUCK! If you want dirty greasy Nasty hair then this is for you! It&#x27;s truly horrible! Don&#x27;t waste your money! Buy AVEDA or another trusted brand</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo in the store because it smelled good, it was sulfate-free, and it was marketed as being color-safe. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have stated, it leaves my hair feeling dirtier than before I showered. It leaves a residue behind, no matter how much I try to rinse. At least it smells good...</li>
            <li> This is the BEST shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I have coloured hair and it tends to get very dried out. The first time I used this shampoo my hair was so soft the I had to reread the label as I thought it might have been a conditioner. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I suppose this shampoo works better with some hair types more than others, but this was just awful! I have fine hair, but a lot of it, which made it very difficult to get a decent lather. I&#x27;ve used sulfate-free shampoos before, so I wasn&#x27;t shocked at the lack of lather, but I was NOT expecting my hair to be left with an oily coating that just wouldn&#x27;t rinse out! Trying to be optimistic, I dried my hair as usual, figuring maybe the end result would be favorable... but my hair and scalp felt like I had washed it with Vaseline. I was shocked because I normally use Nexxus Therappe shampoo, and have always been happy with it.</li>
            <li> I decided to invest in a good shampoo in hopes that it would protect my color a little longer. Wow is all I can say. At first I thought that I had simply missed rinsing all the shampoo out of my hair. It was so greasy! After running my hands through my hair my hands felt like they had a film of dry shampoo on them. The next time I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed but I just couldn&#x27;t get it out of my hair!  Again after drying my hair it was greasy and clumpy. I ended up using another shampoo to help wash this shampoo out of my hair.  Sad, I don&#x27;t even want to give away the full bottle!</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this from Amazon. I purchased it at Walmart... but regardless, it&#x27;s the same product. lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this in hope that it would be as good as other Nexxus products but I was quickly disappointed. No matter how much I rinse out my hair, it leaves a residue and makes my hair feel and look dirty/oily. Unfortunately I did not save the receipt and have now wasted almost $40. :(((</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo in hopes it would save my color.  Nope, and it left my fine hair feeling greasy and stringy.  Never again!  I had used another product before trying this.  I have a full size of this untouched!  I will never use this again and would not recommend to anyone who wants clean hair!  If your hair is dry, maybe, but I am sure there are better products, at less cost that won&#x27;t leave it feeling like I just oiled up my head.  I&#x27;m still experiencing breakout on my scalp from this stuff!  And I stopped using it a week ago!</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo. My hairdresser uses this one.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at excellent price. Leaves my hair immediately unsnarled, soft, blows out nicely. This is a great shampoo!</li>
            <li> my hair is still kind of dry but i think the product works as described and it is a good product i bought two of these for about 9 dollars each with the 50% discount</li>
            <li> my mom said I couldn&#x27;t dye my hair blue so I thought this would color my hair good but it didn&#x27;t work so I drank it</li>
            <li> The pink version is different- it&#x27;s sulphate-free.  Amazon does not adequately describe this product for you to know this other than the bottle color being different.  DO NOT BUY THIS.  Terrible.  Leaves my hair greasy and limp.</li>
            <li> AWEFUL! History: professional dye job, thick curly hair that gets blown out every other day, hypothyroid so my hair is getting even dryer! I had hopes for this stuff... but it made my hair feel like STRAW! I didn&#x27;t use the whole system, just shampoo and conditioner and i was furious as i tried delicately to comb the tangles out. And I&#x27;m talking sheer frustration here. After blowing it out, my hair was softer but it tangles too easily. Plus, day two hair (a necessity if you&#x27;re sporting a red dye job) is just disgusting ... greasy looking and gross. Nexxus is out for me.</li>
            <li> I was astonished at how this shampoo doesn&#x27;t rinse out, and my hair feels even grittier after I use it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves a sticky residue in my hair, therefore also dullness. No matter how much I rinse and rinse, still sticky hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nexxus shampoo and conditioner for more years than I care to admit and the pink color assure stands tall right next to all of the Nexxus products.  love it. cleans my hair to squeaky.</li>
            <li> The new formulation is awful!  It seems like it will not wash out at all and leaves my hair feeling greasy and weighed down.  I will just have to stock up on the old formula, then look for another brand when that runs out.</li>
            <li> I had to return this. It left my hair feeling greasy and never was clean.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair &amp; have found that this is the only shampoo that keeps my color fresh between salon visits</li>
            <li> Truly disappointed in this product.  It leaves my hair greasy!</li>
            <li> wife and kids claim its heavy and hard to rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;leaves their hair feeling greasy</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for quite some time and loved it until recently. No more luxurious lather. My shiny clean hair is now dull and waxy. I contacted Nexxus and was told there was a packaging (no more silver/gray bottle) and formula change in December. If you&#x27;re lucky enough to get an old bottle of the creamy white shampoo enjoy it while it lasts. If you get the opaque waxy looking shampoo send it back. God Bless Amazon for quickly refunding my money. I gave this one star only because it still smells good.</li>
            <li> great price... the zero sulfates seems to keep the coloring in my hair longer as i have used the color assure with sulfates and the color washes away more quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to even review such a terrible product.  The shampoo does not rinse out, leaving your hair feeling dirty &amp; disgusting.  I tried for 2 weeks to make it work.  I&#x27;m stuck with this.  Wash your hair with this &amp; you&#x27;ll feel the need to wash it  over &amp; over in an attempt to wash out that sticki and dirty feeling.  Gross!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t bother to publicly review hair products, but I figured people needed a warning for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal hair with gentle partial highlights. I shampoo my hair once per week, so the over-drying problem is not due to over-washing. I&#x27;m religious about conditioner usage. I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair. I used Nexus Color Assure Shampoo+Conditioner for 2 mos (maximum of 12 washes), and my hair turned to straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched a sulfate-free color-safe shampoo and switched to Enjoy Luxury last week. So far so good, but I can tell you I&#x27;ll never buy this Nexus product again.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, but I had never gotten this particular shampoo. It does not lather at all and hence it is really hard to use. Will not be getting this again. Will stick to the other types of Nexxus shampoo.</li>
            <li> There is  nothing more to add, this shampoo is very nice for colored hair. No complains, work much better than many other shampoos.</li>
            <li> This is the WORST shampoo I have ever tried! It makes my hair feel hard and disgusting. I loved the old Nxxus color shampoo in a gray bottle. This is completely different. And the worst part is - I can&#x27;t return it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it would help my color treated hair and it is the worst shampoo I have ever tried. It smells fine- but after several tries, it always leaves my hair super greasy. I  have tried washing it out for longer periods of time and nothing. This formal is completely off. Don&#x27;t waste your money. The only thing it is fine at is shaving my legs--and thats some expensive &amp;#34;shaving cream&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Sulfate free does not mean it won&#x27;t clean your hair. What it means is that there aren&#x27;t any harsh detergents that can strip your hair of its color. Sulfates are detergents and that&#x27;s why shampoos with sulfates in them have more sudsy lather. My hair felt clean after I use the shampoo and it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who said their hair felt, &amp;#34;greasy,&amp;#34; that has nothing to do with it being sulfate free.  You either have greasy hair anyway, aren&#x27;t properly washing your hair, or are using way too much conditioner.</li>
            <li> The one star reviewers are not reading what this product is.  This is an OIL based product that is sulfate free.  The other reviews are complaining that it&#x27;s clear and slimy and makes their hair oily..... Are you kidding? It&#x27;s OIL BASED..... I have kinky curly hair and recently got a keratin treatment and this has worked great on my hair for that.  Also makes it feel conditioned and not so dry...maybe from the oil.</li>
            <li> normally like Nexxus but never noticed the same clean shimmer from this</li>
            <li> Have been using this system for 3 months, and now my hair is falling out! This is the only routine I have changed, so has to be Nexus. My hair dresser was very concerned during my last visit, so said to quit using the stuff. Back to Bert&#x27;s Bees sulfate free even though it isn&#x27;t for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo ever. I only bought this shampoo on a whim as my regular shampoo was out. It was equal in price so I thought why not. The first day I used it I honestly thought I had forgotten to rinse the conditioner out of my hair! As a new mother I really convinced myself of this, I just assumed I was that absent minded! Ha! The next day I used it again and made certain I rinsed well. It didn&#x27;t matter. My hair was disgusting. If I ran my fingers through my hair my hair literally would stick in place. Nasty. Reminded me of that Something About Mary scene...</li>
            <li> I agree with everyone saying the shampoo does not rinse out and leaves hair oily and dirty looking and feeling. It took me three months of use to pin point the issue. I would not recommend purchasing this product</li>
            <li> I hate this shampoo! It does not rinse out completely and it made may hair stick &amp; greasy. I will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great on my very fine colored hair and this was a great purchase price.  Typically I buy a much smaller bottle (if I can find it) at a local store so it&#x27;s nice to have a larger  bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the price was really good and I LOVE Nexxus.&lt;br /&gt;I got my hair highlighted with 3 different colors a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I was using Redkin, and I didn&#x27;t really like it and was running out.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this stuff. I would almost say that my hair color is more vibrant since&lt;br /&gt;I started to use this stuff. It makes my hair so soft and it really cleans it&lt;br /&gt;with out stripping it. As usual, it smells FAB!! Thanks Nexxus!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo. I have a giant bottle of it, but it doesn&#x27;t rinse out and leaves my hair completely impossible to style. From reading some of the other comments, it seems that they may have changed their formula. If that is the case, I recommend that they fix it before they sell another bottle. It&#x27;s horrible stuff.</li>
            <li> Made my hair flat and build up was bad..would not buy.</li>
            <li> The item description was very accurate. I purchased for my wife who uses the product daily - very satisfied with the product, packaging and delivery. The dispensing bottle is so much better than the typical squeeze bottles. We will purchase this and the conditioner again.</li>
            <li> I loved the old version of this shampoo and was SO disappointed when I tried this new formula. My hair looked and felt so greasy after using this shampoo, it was as if I hadn&#x27;t washed it for days, and I wash my hair daily. It actually looked worse the more I used it! I had to use another shampoo to clean this product out of my hair. Horrible shampoo. Definitely not recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, has always been my favorite....</li>
            <li> I tried posting a review on Nexxus&#x27; website and they wouldn&#x27;t publish it because &amp;#34;it did not meet all our website guidelines&amp;#34;. Here is what I wrote verbatim:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingerdients have Changed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new formula doesn&#x27;t clean my hair at all, and leaves a really, really heavy residue behind. I had to wash my hair twice with a clarifying shampoo to get it out! I&#x27;ve been using assure/ensure since the 80&#x27;s and it has changed ingredients before, but this new change is ridiculous. Did anyone at Nexxus try using it before they put it on the market?</li>
            <li> Best sulfate free shampoo out there for this price!  I have tried so many and I&#x27;m never using anything else!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner on Friday and have given it 5 days.  My hair is stuck to my head with a greasy film. I am so disappointed.  I never buy expensive products and thought I would give it a try. WRONG.  Back to good ole Dove shampoo and conditioner for $5.00 each.  This is really a terrible formula. I can barely even run my hands through my hair. Will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Target.  I paid just under $50.00 for both 33.8 of Shampoo and Conditioner.  I have long hair and this duo does a great job cleansing while not stripping my hair of color.  I especially like the way the conditioner leaves my hair feeling healthy and nourished.  Now that I know I can purchase this product from Amazon for half the price, I will definitely be purchasing from Amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the worst example of shampoo I&#x27;ve ever encountered. I kept thinking I was washing my hair incorrectly. I mean, I&#x27;m 40, surely I know how to do that, right?  No matter how much I rinsed my hair, I still looked like a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind.... &amp;#34;Sulfate-free.&amp;#34; Sulfates are what &amp;#34;pump up&amp;#34; regular shampoo to make it lather and produce the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing. The reason this leaves hair feeling heavy is because you are probably using too much. Yes, your hair is not going to feel &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean, but it will still be clean, and it will still be good to put your conditioner in afterwards. I enjoy this shampoo because I know how to use it, and the benefits of using a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner set. The problem with switching to a new sulfate formula is that your hair continues to produce the oils that it used to produce after it was stripped of them using traditional shampoos. Oftentimes it takes weeks to get your scalp and hair used to the sulfate-free formulas which are better for you and your hair. How I switched without having to endure greasy strands was alternate traditional shampoo with the sulfate-free shampoo until I was eventually rid of traditional shampoo. I hope this helps people looking into this shampoo, because it truly does wonders for keeping your colored hair soft and manageable. PS. My hair is ombre with very light blonde towards the ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo three times now, and after drying my hair, it feels like I have a heavy product in my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t feel soft bu almost a little greasey.  Will give it away for someone eles to try.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I am a little confused by the reviews this product got.  I have very thin straight hair and I used just enough to lather the top half and bottom (two pumps) and my hair washed fine. No oily feeling or residue my hair isn&#x27;t clumping together..my hair is sofylt and silky I reallly love this shampoo. The smell is fantastic also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s&lt;br /&gt;I dont use conditoner, it ends up making my hair really greasy no matter how little I use.. I deffiantly recomend this shampoo</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the absolute WORST.  I thought I used too much and wasn&#x27;t rinsing it out right or that I bought conditioner instead but NO.  It makes your hair feel gross!  And I&#x27;ve never had a flaky scalp ever and 1 week of using this crap and I have flakes.  Also makes your hair impossible to blowdry and makes my bangs look greasy and unwashed.  I want my money back!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite BRAND... I might prefer the moisture one more because this one is kind of wierd.. makes my hair smell good though!</li>
            <li> I like this for my color treated hair. I&#x27;ve highlighted my hair for years and this keeps my hair from Turing gold. It doesn&#x27;t work like a toner where it semi restores the highlights to brighter, freshly colored hair but this maintains your color if used as soon as hair is bleached. Should be used along with a toner for best results</li>
            <li> I ordered Nexxus Color Assure shampoo and ended up with this pink bottle rather than my usual silver bottle. I just assumed they had changed the packaging. However, when I used it I got a terrible waxy coating on my hair. Thinking that maybe I hadn&#x27;t rinsed the Humectress conditioner out of my hair good I rewashed it using only the shampoo and no conditioner. This time it was even worse!! My hair was thickly coated and when I tried to brush it my hair began breaking off!!! I had another bottle of the shampoo in the silver bottle, I used it along with my usual Humectress and my hair no longer has the coating. I began looking both bottle of shampoo over and found that the pink one is &amp;#34;Sulfate Free&amp;#34; and contains all different ingredients from the gray bottle. Now to figure out how to order Nexxus Color Assure shampoo and get the correct one!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so luxurious, it feels like a conditioner. I use it along with the Colour Assure Conditioner, Nexxus weightless leave in conditioner, follow the instructions and voila..... Hair of a goddess</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!! My hair is soft &amp; healthy and not weighted down like it is with the Humectress product line. This is a great deal on these hard to find products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my imagination that this shampoo actually works to keep color on my hair stays a bit longer than regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shampoo ever. Why they changed it is a mystery. It is oily, it does not rinse out, there are no suds, and my hair looks stringy and dirty right after I wash it. Just awful.</li>
            <li> Stripped the color right out of my hair!  Wanted to try something different and liked the smell.  The shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling great--soft and silky, but it stripped the color.  At first, I thought, no way, so tried it again and again.  I had to throw it in the trash and see my stylist for early color application.</li>
            <li> This is a large pump bottle of clean-rinsing shampoo for color treated hair. I like the large bottles and the pump action makes getting the shampoo in your hands easy. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I always loved this shampoo until I got the pink bottle instead of the gray one. The formula is obviously different and now I know what everyone is complaining about. I rinse my hair 4 times longer and it&#x27;s heavy, greasy, just yuck! Tried 4 times so it&#x27;s consistent.&lt;br /&gt;Will be hunting down the old bottles :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened !!&lt;br /&gt;ive been using nexus product for over ten years.&lt;br /&gt;I decide to order from amazon for first time.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 2 of each . first bottle was normal, but the second bottle of shampoo ( both are grey bottles ) has no lather  !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I never seen a shampoo with no lather !!</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst shampoos I have ever tried.  My hair feels absolutely disgusting after using this product.  I wash, rinse and blowdry my hair and it comes out feeling dirtier than before I washed it.  The first time I used this product, I thought I hadn&#x27;t rinsed well enough so the second and third time I used it I made sure I rinsed it extra well - also, I used even less thinking perhaps the first time I may have used too much - but no, it&#x27;s nothing I did.  It&#x27;s the shampoo.  TERRIBLE.  I can&#x27;t say enough how disappointed I am to have wasted close to $20 on a large bottle of this stuff!  I am NOT HAPPY.  I have used Nexxus products in the past and have never had such a bad experience.  DO NOT BUY THIS SHAMPOO unless you want your hair to feel like a greasy dirt pile.</li>
            <li> I recently colored my hair bright red and, as I have had red hair before, knew enough to get a sulfate free shampoo and to wash in the coldest water I can stand. When I used this shampoo I had high expectations because of many good experiences with this brand. However, my hair looked insanely greasy after using! It&#x27;s like the shampoo coats all of your hair and then just won&#x27;t wash out: AWFUL. And I am one of those people that can go 4 days without washing my hair if I have to... This was worse than 4th day hair. I will never use this shampoo again.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair feel greasy right after I wash it. It&#x27;s extremely difficult to rinse out and, worst of all, since I started using it, I&#x27;ve been getting painful acne on my scalp. It&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> I was at Target and they no longer carried the silver bottle Nexxus shampoo nor it&#x27;s conditioner mate, so I purchased the pink bottle shampoo and conditioner. It is awful. Leaves the hair heavy, almost greasy. I actually went online to see if anyone else had this problem and ran across this site. I am going to look for the receipt and take back. What a shame, I have been using Nexxus for years and now this; I don&#x27;t trust it. Not sure if it&#x27;s counterfeit or no quality control wherever it was manufactured, but not using further.</li>
            <li> Got this in my Birchbox and loved the smell so I wanted to try the full size. Like I said, the smell is awesome but it leaves your hair greasy no matter how much you rinse it. Apparently it doesn&#x27;t do it to everyone, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY! This is the worst shampoo I have ever used. My hair has never felt so gritty. And for this price it was very upsetting!</li>
            <li> So creamy and takes some work to lather up but keeps my hair color shiny and vibrant and doesn&#x27;t shed my hair from it&#x27;s natural oil. The container is HUGE, it will last me so so long, I&#x27;m so pleased.</li>
            <li> I am a retired hairdresser.  I have always favored the Nexxus line.  This product is great for colored hair.  I purchase it for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Seriously. I don&#x27;t know how they can claim that this is shampoo. My hair feels disgusting after using it. The first time I tried it was on vacation because it came with a free travel size bottle (yippee!), and I thought it was the water there or something. Nope, tried numerous times at home. How can you sell a product that fails so miserably??? My hair feels so gross.</li>
            <li> Got the shampoo and conditioner. Great price for the volume. Fun getting it in the mail. Hate to shop in high priced hair product stores.</li>
            <li> This has a wonderful fragrance</li>
            <li> Beware!  This shampoo is terrible!  I double checked to make sure I hadn&#x27;t accidently used conditioner.  Nope.  Tried rinsing extra much.  Didn&#x27;t work.  My hair looks dirty and stringy and feels so greasy.  DO NOT BUY THIS.  Apparently they reformulated in 2014 to this awful stuff.  Steer clear.</li>
            <li> If I could give this a ZERO STAR I would!!  I am soooooooo angry that I spent 16 bucks on a bottle of shampoo that makes my hair feel dirty.  At first I thought it was because I didn&#x27;t rinse it all out but no, it&#x27;s this nasty shampoo.  My hair feels greasy, it makes it hard to blow dry cause it feels like you have conditioner in your hair you didn&#x27;t rinse out.  It&#x27;s that gross.  I will never purchase this product again and feel like demanding my money back.  Regular drugstore shampoo runs circles around this garbage.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo as well as the conditioner and pre-wash primer/protective serum and was horrified at the results! After spending all that money I not only had horribly limp weighed down greasy hair, my color became brassy!!!! The rich tones in my freshly colored hair faded to a mousey brassy bronde color and I had to shamefully call my colorist to fix it. And spend more money.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money on this product!&lt;br /&gt;I tried it several times thinking I had left some in like others have said, but it&#x27;s the product. Look else where for results.</li>
            <li> Oh, you will never believe how greasy this makes your hair.  If you like greasy hair, then this is the shampoo for you.  I have normal hair, and prefer it to be grease free, so this went into the trash.</li>
            <li> Ok, so when I first started using it thought I loved the shampoo, because it smells really good, I love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, many other reviewers have mentioned that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t wash off, and they are quite right. First I thought the shampoo was so mousturizing, that that&#x27;s why it left the hair feeling heavy, like if you put conditioner and you didn&#x27;t wash it off well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not wash my hair everyday, because I like to have my natural oils help condition my hair, it feels softer, healthier and my color lasts much longer since I started doing that, BUT with this shampoo, you won&#x27;t last an extra day because your scalp will feel dirty, itchy, oily &amp; dandruff-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I notice this I immediately switched back to my old Head n&#x27;Shoulders and the problems dissapeared immediately.&lt;br /&gt;What I have been doing, which alleviated the problem as well, is I first use my old shampoo, then for my second quick wash I use this one (as a conditioner), this way I don&#x27;t have to throw away the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for over a year now and I find that my color does not fade as fast and my hair feels a lot softer than it used to.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned when I ordered Nexxus Color Assure Shampoo from Amazon based on another person&#x27;s experience of getting a knock off version.  But I&#x27;ve compared my Amazon Nexxus to the same product from CVS and it&#x27;s the same color, smell and it doesn&#x27;t take my color out.  IMHO the true test of a color safe shampoo is on red hair dye and Nexxus makes the cut.  I don&#x27;t often take the trouble to review products because I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m that educated a consumer.  In this area, however, I have had years of experience trying to keep auburn on my naturally white hair (yeah, I know it&#x27;s a losing battle) and Nexxus is the best.  Better than what my salon uses and better than Matrix.</li>
            <li> This product took forever to arrive. It finally arrived in a thin padded envelope, which was not suitable for such a heavy item. The spout had torn through the envelope and did not work properly. I had to transfer the shampoo into an empty bottle from a previous purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this brand of shampoo many times in the past, and have always noticed how thick it is, and how it makes almost too much lather. It might be my imagination, but this batch seems thinner, and does not lather up the way I expected. There is no way to tell if it&#x27;s really the same stuff without a laboratory test, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will  not order from this seller again.</li>
