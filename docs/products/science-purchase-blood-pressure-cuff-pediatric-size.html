            <li>It was a very good purchase on my part, I was very pleased with the actual product.</li>
            <li>It was more the size for an infant than a child size.</li>
            <li>My grandsons understand the process so much more now.</li>
            <li>Love this pediatric cuff.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping for more of a child</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li>I would have been able to return it</li>
            <li>Packed nicely  and was received quickly.</li>
            <li>Not high quality, but perfect for the home user.</li>
            <li>It works great and not had any problems with it so far</li>
            <li>Face plate unscrews easily.</li>
            <li>The rubber smell is strong, but I would assume this will go over with time.</li>
            <li>The cuff worked fine for a month ..</li>
            <li>his BP was fine.  </li>
            <li>This was a huge hit in the toy kit as pumping up the cuff is always something he is trying to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was cheap but so accurate.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made you get what you pay for</li>
            <li>These are great and work better than expected.</li>
            <li>pretty ok for beginners</li>
            <li>also functions well as a real BP cuff and not just a toy :)</li>
            <li>Got product quickly, item as described.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and item was just as described.</li>
            <li>The price was great (less that $10 at the time) and it does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li>Because the price was so low, it was much better than buying a pretend one!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packaging fit the item.</li>
            <li>EASY TO CLEAN, I USE IT ON SKINNY ADULT PATIENTS WHO ARE LOOSING WT AND MUSCLE MASS.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a bit harder to control than the nicer ones, but a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>he wants to be a doctor and follow in his grandmoa footsteps he love the fact that it was the real deal not toys</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and small, perfect for little hands to use.</li>
            <li>B/P cuff was the right size for pediatrics.</li>
            <li>Took this with me down to the Dominican Republic on a missionary medical trip doing 50 family physicals a day - this worked perfectly; each time, every time without a problem.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so tiny, the perfect size for little arms.</li>
            <li>It was missing the key for adjusting, but otherwise perfect</li>
            <li>filled a real Medic bag with real items.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It is well made and really works!  </li>
            <li>Grandkids will love this addition to their medical play kit!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The tag to hold the gage up broke after first week of use.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well for taking BP&#x27;s at home.</li>
            <li>Bought for my  pre teen grand daughter.</li>
            <li>Received it fast before time and just the right size for a child</li>
            <li>Great to use on my adult patients with small arms</li>
            <li>Works great this way on old lady&#x27;s small arm</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t just buy him a &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; doctor kit, he had to have the real deal.</li>
            <li>She feels like a real doctor/nurse (depending on her day).  </li>
            <li>I never knew I could find a real blood pressure cuff on line.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say how well it works in real life</li>
            <li>but it was cheap enough to buy for a child&#x27;s doctor kit and it does work!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>She wants to be a vet.</li>
            <li>It has a nice functional range for children use; and came back home to be used again on the next trip.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and is smaller than I had expected, but works very well and although smaller in width, it has good area for adjustment in length.</li>
            <li>but the fact that it is real makes her feel extra special.  </li>
            <li>i wish i didn&#x27;t waste my money and got a better quality one the first time.</li>
            <li>decided to purchse the real medical items rather investing in the cheap plastic medical toys for babies.&lt;br /&gt;The low priced real tools will last much longer and the children can play with them for many years to come.</li>
            <li>Too small for most kids.</li>
            <li>pretty much what we expected, no complaints and no compliments.</li>
            <li>A fine little instrument and well represented on the site.  </li>
            <li>It works ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for hard use.  </li>
            <li>but wow it reeks.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for professional use</li>
            <li>It comes in its own small bag and is small enough to fit well into your bags.</li>
            <li>The kids kits were plastic and too young for her.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Perfect size for the little ones and adults with very thin arms.</li>
            <li>I work at a high volume optometric office and use this cuff constantly for our pediatric patients.</li>
            <li>I needed a smaller cuff for little arms and this one is fine.  </li>
            <li>It appears to work fine but doesn&#x27;t meet my need real well -- I am involved with a BP/blood sugar screening clinic and was really looking for what would work for a larger child and a very thin arm of an elderly person.  </li>
            <li>Basic pediatric blood pressure cuff to accompany my adult one.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the actual functioning of the cuff; we bought it only for a doctor kit I made for my 2.5 yr old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a better peds cuff for less than $70.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a better peds cuff for less than $70.</li>
            <li> The guage goes down very fast, no matter how little you open the valve.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> just long enough to miss the return window, when the ball part stopped inflating.</li>
            <li> My son has a minor orthopedic problem which requires a lot of doctor visits.</li>
            <li> It is way smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this (and other medical equipment) for my 5-year-old for her Doctor&#x27;s Bag.</li>
            <li> it has a terrible odor; similar to an item kept in  moth balls, but way more intense.  </li>
            <li> Very poor quality, did not work right, and I only received back about half of what I paid when I returned it.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for pediatric patients over the age of 6 years old.</li>
            <li> After curiously attending all of my prenatal appointments, we gave him this blood pressure cuff and stethoscope as his &amp;#34;big brother&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Purchased 5 months ago and used minimally.  </li>
            <li> Not good for actual medical use!</li>
            <li> Im not sure how this would work for actual patient use as I bought it for my daughter&#x27;s veterenarian play kit.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t open the package until it was past the time to return.</li>
            <li> I wanted a smaller than usual BP cuff so ordered this one!  </li>
            <li> Cuff was half the size of product featured in image.  </li>
            <li> I dont know where to take it to fix it and it scared the mess outta me when I took his blood pressure</li>
            <li> It is a little heavier than she is use to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to air it out on the deck for a few days and see if it helps.  </li>
            <li> My elderly mom has tiny, thin arms..</li>
            <li> waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly but the tubing was dried out and cracked.  </li>
            <li> This is for Christmas, learning about health, and taking care of each other!!!  </li>
            <li> Extremely small.</li>
            <li> If they do fail to operate properly, we&#x27;ll let &#x27;ya know after Christmas!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with a useless cuff..</li>
            <li> The costs were not much more that the kid</li>
            <li> Not accurate!</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT ISN&#x27;T SQUEEZING SO HARD.</li>
            <li> THOSE ARE HARD TO FIND.</li>
            <li> There were others that were less expensive and some that even included a stethoscope.</li>
            <li> It is not good quality</li>
            <li> The product was of poor quality.  </li>
            <li> I did not listen to others who rated it poorly</li>
            <li> It has been a hit at play dates, and the fact that everything is removable keeps it from getting broken.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> With about the 5th use the valve broke, rendering it useless.  </li>
            <li> STINKS.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> The chemical fumes should not be that bad.</li>
            <li> Read that the Sphygmomanometer had bad reviews.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed about the condition received.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Was a gift for a grandchild.  He seemed happy when he opened it.</li>
            <li> works good for play.  my girls loved it</li>
            <li> Good product for price.</li>
            <li> Great product and good price!</li>
            <li> I like it for my daughter&#x27;s doctor&#x27;s bag to play with.  HOWEVER, I just opened the package and it STINKS.  Smells like it was doused in chemicals.  I&#x27;m hoping I can put it outside and air it out but wow it reeks.</li>
            <li> Really good deal for the money!</li>
            <li> We purchased this for our Daughter&#x27;s play Dr. Kit.  It&#x27;s perfect in sign and quality.  The rubber smell is strong, but I would assume this will go over with time.</li>
            <li> Cuff was half the size of product featured in image.  Not suitable for pediatric patients over the age of 6 years old.</li>
            <li> pretty ok for beginners</li>
            <li> The product was of poor quality.  They did give an instant refund without fuss but it took forever and then it didn&#x27;t even work!!!!</li>
            <li> Great deal on supplies</li>
            <li> Purchased for my youngest as part of a &amp;#34;doctor kit.&amp;#34;  I purchased several &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; items, including this BP cuff.  It was perfect!</li>
            <li> purchased for a gift for a child to play vet.  It&#x27;s real</li>
            <li> A gift for my granddaughters medical bag to help her learn and understand&lt;br /&gt;about our bodies and what the Blood Pressure Cuff does.</li>
            <li> We had to return it because it would not hold the pressure. Wanted to get another but it was out of stock.</li>
            <li> just a warning.  it should be advertised as for babies. Extremely small.</li>
            <li> I bought this (and other medical equipment) for my 5-year-old for her Doctor&#x27;s Bag. The cuff worked fine for a month ..just long enough to miss the return window, when the ball part stopped inflating. (I&#x27;m not a nurse or doctor, so I don&#x27;t know the proper terminology). We put the cuff on her arm and went to squeeze the ball to inflate the cuff and it only put in one puff of air and then stayed deflated.</li>
            <li> Not high quality, but perfect for the home user. I would not recommend for professional use</li>
            <li> It did not meet my expectations, feels very cheap in quality</li>
            <li> This was perfect!  Took this with me down to the Dominican Republic on a missionary medical trip doing 50 family physicals a day - this worked perfectly; each time, every time without a problem.  It has a nice functional range for children use; and came back home to be used again on the next trip.</li>
            <li> I did not listen to others who rated it poorly-Don&#x27;t make the same mistake. It is not good quality</li>
            <li> The cuff is not the best quality.  It works ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for hard use.  The strap to hold the gauge on broke after maybe 3 uses.</li>
            <li> It pumps up easily, seems very accurate, and the velcro works great!</li>
            <li> Our son loves everything medical at age 4!  After curiously attending all of my prenatal appointments, we gave him this blood pressure cuff and stethoscope as his &amp;#34;big brother&amp;#34; gift when he came to the hospital.  He loves them!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed. Basic pediatric blood pressure cuff to accompany my adult one. I spruced mine up a bit with animal clips for pediatric patients.</li>
            <li> It appears to work fine but doesn&#x27;t meet my need real well -- I am involved with a BP/blood sugar screening clinic and was really looking for what would work for a larger child and a very thin arm of an elderly person.  Is it possible to send the one back in exchange for a larger size, pediatric cuff.  Please let me know.</li>
            <li> Good for a play doctor kit!</li>
            <li> Great quality for a great price.</li>
            <li> Bought this as part of a doctor kit for my son&#x27;s birthday. My son has a minor orthopedic problem which requires a lot of doctor visits. I couldn&#x27;t just buy him a &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; doctor kit, he had to have the real deal. This BP cuff was medical grade, looks just like any cuff that you&#x27;d see at a doctors office. This was a huge hit in the toy kit as pumping up the cuff is always something he is trying to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also functions well as a real BP cuff and not just a toy :)</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and fit the needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> Product works as designed. The product arrived on time, but the glass was broken.&lt;br /&gt;I still use it but I was disappointed about the condition received.</li>
            <li> Great to use on my adult patients with small arms</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the intention of putting it in a doctor kit I&#x27;m making for my children for Christmas.  I received it today and out of the box it has a terrible odor; similar to an item kept in  moth balls, but way more intense.  I don&#x27;t even want to take it out and touch it to see if it works.  I&#x27;m going to try to air it out on the deck for a few days and see if it helps.  I can&#x27;t give this to my children like this.  I&#x27;m dissapointed because this was recommended on a blog which is why I chose it.  There were others that were less expensive and some that even included a stethoscope.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves having an actual cuff to play doctor with.  It is a little heavier than she is use to but the fact that it is real makes her feel extra special.  The price was great (less that $10 at the time) and it does it&#x27;s job.  It also happens to come with a stethoscope!  This made her even more thrilled, and me too.  She feels like a real doctor/nurse (depending on her day).  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I wanted a smaller than usual BP cuff so ordered this one!  It came quickly and is smaller than I had expected, but works very well and although smaller in width, it has good area for adjustment in length. It Is accurate and very good quality.  I am very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> my granddaughter loves it.</li>
            <li> it actually works! and great too!</li>
            <li> I  was very.please  with my  order it arrived  on timr. gd quariy for the  price</li>
            <li> This was not calibrated :( I dont know where to take it to fix it and it scared the mess outta me when I took his blood pressure</li>
            <li> It is well made and really works!  Grandkids will love this addition to their medical play kit!&lt;br /&gt;I decided to purchse the real medical items rather investing in the cheap plastic medical toys for babies.&lt;br /&gt;The low priced real tools will last much longer and the children can play with them for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Not using it for what it was intended for but works perfectly. Packed nicely  and was received quickly.</li>
            <li> I understood this to be a pediatric size cuff but was not expecting an infant size cuff.  It should be specified that this is not a child size cuff.</li>
            <li> My elderly mom has tiny, thin arms..this cuff fits well and gives accuratereadings</li>
            <li> THE FLIMSY COVER ON THE ANEROID FALLS OFF ALL THE TIME. EASY TO CLEAN, I USE IT ON SKINNY ADULT PATIENTS WHO ARE LOOSING WT AND MUSCLE MASS. IT ONLY REQUIRES 2-3 PUMPS TO GET A READING WHICH PATIENTS LIKE BECAUSE IT ISN&#x27;T SQUEEZING SO HARD. I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE 1 INCH WIDER THOUGH. THE LENGTH IS PERFECT. THE VELCRO IS GREAT. ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SINGE TUBE BLADDER WITH ANEROID ATTACHED TO THE BULB. THOSE ARE HARD TO FIND.</li>
            <li> I got this as a toy for my daughter who loves playing doctor. Great price for the quality.  Face plate unscrews easily.</li>
            <li> B/P cuff was the right size for pediatrics. Price paid was good.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for the little ones and adults with very thin arms. I work at a high volume optometric office and use this cuff constantly for our pediatric patients. Would purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I needed a smaller cuff for little arms and this one is fine.  Shipping was fast and packaging fit the item.</li>
            <li> The gauge is not like the photo. I cut it up and threw it away.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my job in the Hospital with childrens . I am happy</li>
            <li> It was more the size for an infant than a child size. It is way smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I never knew I could find a real blood pressure cuff on line.  My grandsons understand the process so much more now.</li>
            <li> This item was bought for my granddaughter to play with all of her doctor things so I can&#x27;t say how well it works in real life but it was cheap enough to buy for a child&#x27;s doctor kit and it does work!</li>
            <li> My wife, who was medical assisting training, purchased this for my son whose BP was elevate at his last check up.  His doctor recommend that my wife take his BP at home (knowing about her training).  This cuff worked perfect ... his BP was fine.  Also, this worked out great as training for my 3 year.  At his 3 year check up, he would be getting is BP checked so this was a great way to &amp;#34;train&amp;#34; him with this cuff.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price</li>
            <li> Got product quickly, item as described.</li>
            <li> Bought this as part of a doctor kit for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She loved it and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a better peds cuff for less than $70. For the price it works well, it&#x27;s a bit harder to control than the nicer ones, but a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Im not sure how this would work for actual patient use as I bought it for my daughter&#x27;s veterenarian play kit. It does function fully.</li>
            <li> Love this pediatric cuff. The therapist and I use it every day for my mother. It was cheap but so accurate. A+++++++++</li>
            <li> It was missing the key for adjusting, but otherwise perfect</li>
            <li> Works for what I bought it for.  Seems like a well put together product and it should last awhile, I hope.</li>
            <li> A fine little instrument and well represented on the site.  However, It should have been made clearer that a stethoscope also needed to be purchased.</li>
            <li> This is for Christmas, learning about health, and taking care of each other!!!  If they do fail to operate properly, we&#x27;ll let &#x27;ya know after Christmas!!!</li>
            <li> Works for my kids, whom I like to take their bp for practice. I&#x27;m in nursing school and I figure if I am doing others, they should have theirs done correctly, too.</li>
            <li> This is a great, affordable product!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be very well made, and works great!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and very accurate.</li>
            <li> Not good for actual medical use! Not accurate!</li>
            <li> just what was needed....good quality</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter to play doctor and so far everything is great very good quality and they even come with a stethicope.</li>
            <li> broke the second time we used it.not made well at all. i wish i didn&#x27;t waste my money and got a better quality one the first time. sorry but i would not recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> This blood pressure cuff was just what I was looking for when putting together a play doctor&#x27;s kit for my children. It has been a hit at play dates, and the fact that everything is removable keeps it from getting broken.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the actual functioning of the cuff; we bought it only for a doctor kit I made for my 2.5 yr old. She loves taking our blood pressure. It&#x27;s nice and small, perfect for little hands to use. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This item works and is child size so that is sorta  what I was looking for. Actually it was for a Christmas gift and I was hoping for more of a child look to it - but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Took an EMT course and everybody kept asking to use my cuffs. These are great and work better than expected. 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> It was a very good purchase on my part, I was very pleased with the actual product. It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> it is just what i need to get the bp of my frail tiny hospice patients. my office does not provide them .</li>
            <li> Purchased 5 months ago and used minimally.  With about the 5th use the valve broke, rendering it useless.  I could not return it as it had passed the cutoff date.. I&#x27;m left with a useless cuff..</li>
            <li> The tag to hold the gage up broke after first week of use.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, did not work right, and I only received back about half of what I paid when I returned it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for mission work in Africa. It comes in its own small bag and is small enough to fit well into your bags.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well for taking BP&#x27;s at home.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Just as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a baby cuff.  Too small for most kids. The guage goes down very fast, no matter how little you open the valve.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so tiny, the perfect size for little arms.</li>
            <li> Bought for my  pre teen grand daughter. She wants to be a vet. The kids kits were plastic and too young for her.&lt;br /&gt;I filled a real Medic bag with real items. The costs were not much more that the kid kits.&lt;br /&gt;She loves this. I love the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this to place in my granddaughter&#x27;s doctor kit. She loved the cuff and the kit. It was a Christmas present. Because the price was so low, it was much better than buying a pretend one!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and item was just as described.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible. I&#x27;m almost afraid to use it. I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;airing&amp;#34; it out outside for almost a week and the smell is still very strong. I purchased it for my toddler&#x27;s Dr. kit, but don&#x27;t think I should give it to him. The chemical fumes should not be that bad. Makes me wonder what the heck is in it. Pass on this, especially if you&#x27;re buying it for a child.</li>
            <li> Received it fast before time and just the right size for a child</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly but the tubing was dried out and cracked.  By the time I cut it off it was too short to use.  I would have been able to return it but I didn&#x27;t open the package until it was past the time to return.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife who is a hospice nurse. She loves it. The perfect size for what she needs.</li>
            <li> pretty much what we expected, no complaints and no compliments.</li>
            <li> Read that the Sphygmomanometer had bad reviews. Thus I decided to just you the cuff with my Sphygmomanometer. Works great this way on old lady&#x27;s small arm</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who&#x27;s arms are very tiny.  It works great and not had any problems with it so far</li>
            <li> he wants to be a doctor and follow in his grandmoa footsteps he love the fact that it was the real deal not toys</li>
