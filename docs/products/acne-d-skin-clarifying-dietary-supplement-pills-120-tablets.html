    <ol>

            <li>The supplements came in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what nature can do!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and the product :-)</li>
            <li>I cannot believe that it is working so good.  </li>
            <li>This product seems good to me.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether its the cream the fiber or Acne D to be honest but</li>
            <li>any kind of ) break out since I started taking the supplement(knock on wood).</li>
            <li>Alone, not so effective.</li>
            <li>I use it more as a vitamin supplement works good</li>
            <li>These types of vitamins seem to be the best way to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this product about a month ago, as a recommendation from a friend who had great results.  </li>
            <li>I am a month into taking this supplement and so far so very good.</li>
            <li>i just ordered 2 more bottles of this stuff.</li>
            <li>but it did cause me to break out even more.</li>
            <li>Rather than buying Acne-d, I&#x27;d recommend looking for zinc and pantothenic acid supplements from reputable manufacturers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use up the bottle and hope that it gets better soon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best acne treatment that actually works.  </li>
            <li>Plus it makes me feel a lot better about taking them knowing that I&#x27;m not smearing some chemical on my skin like proactiv.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I could not be more greatful for this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d take all the precautions to make sure the area was clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>make sure to drink LOTS of water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of the best pills I have ever took that actually work.</li>
            <li>These pills have worked better than all the prescribed medications and over the counter remidies combined.  </li>
            <li>Panothenic acid is sometimes a better alternative though.</li>
            <li>So many years</li>
            <li>and I do feel alot better about it because they are vitamins.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to see any change now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Ok with that</li>
            <li>This product is pretty fair</li>
            <li>worked pretty good for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as easy as taking a vitamin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Immediately I resumed my regimen and one week back in, I can happily say 80% of my hot-spots are acne-free once more.</li>
            <li>Very high B5 intake has been shown to reduce sebum production, and unlike zinc, it appears to be safe even in doses an order of magnitude greater than the 100mg in each of these pills.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Primarily my face and chin.</li>
            <li>They work great and will defiantly purchase them again when my current bottle runs out!</li>
            <li>You skin get so clear and healthly looking that you will feel so good about youself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m eating healthy, excersizing, treating my face very gently and taking Acne-D.</li>
            <li>The first 2 weeks of taking the pills, I was having more breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have noticed SIGNIFICANT improvements in my acne...</li>
            <li>If I recommend this to my own family, take this as a token of confidence that this product will help your acne problems, adult or teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the size of these pills are TOO LARGE!!  </li>
            <li>but this product is definitely worth a try if you are struggling with acne like I was.</li>
            <li>People have always told me that your diet can affect your skin and they are right.</li>
            <li>I take one right before bed</li>
            <li>I am no stranger to taking large pills and do not normally suffer from any &amp;#34;gag reflexes&amp;#34; as many people do (I took gigantic fish oil pills for years on end with no problem), but with these HUGE pills I did struggle with a gag reflex for the first time in my life!  </li>
            <li>I was taking Cefadroxil and Benzaclyn (the most powerful regiment before accutane) for 5 years prior to this with no improvement.  </li>
            <li>sure to drink a lot of water, it really helps Acne D clear</li>
            <li>I was using Pantothen which was really working for me and decided to try Acne-D because of it being more affordable but MAJOR</li>
            <li>At first i didn&#x27;t feel like it was working</li>
            <li>For comparison, the Institute of Medicine suggests 40mg/day as a Tolerable Upper Limit (TUL) for healthy adults.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have much more control over dosage, and you won&#x27;t have to be concerned over the provenance and safety of numerous inactive ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have tried similar products that cost much more</li>
            <li>but it will keep you from getting future acne by keeping your skin healthy from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>He will continue using it, Thanks!</li>
            <li>This product works very well for me right away.</li>
            <li>I tried proactiv, clean and clear and prescriptions from my doctor.</li>
            <li>but then now i feel like its really working</li>
            <li>Gave the product over of month to work but didn&#x27;t really notice any results</li>
            <li>Nothing really seemed to work for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a change over the course of the two months I was taking them, so I decided to stop.</li>
            <li>but we really notice a difference now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i bought this product for my son and it is really working.  </li>
            <li>His face has gotten alot better, so I&#x27;m surmising that it&#x27;s due to them.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from adult acne (that tends to be cystic in nature), and I did notice that my acne would dry out more quickly and be less severe while taking this product, but I do not feel that it made a significant impact on the frequencies of my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>i noticed a little bit of change in my skin complexion howevrer i would recommend vita clear by proactiv its nice</li>
            <li>Not %100, but much better non the less.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has high amounts of vitamin B</li>
            <li>and it worked great, but got a bit expensive.</li>
            <li>I have moderate acne and rarely get a break out taking three of these a day.</li>
            <li>The fact that these pills have a rough finish (vs. gel or gelatin caps) add insult to injury, and I absolutely would dread taking them every day...especially for just minimal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched over to Clearzine pills after my negative experience with this product, and I am VERY HAPPY with my results using that product!!  </li>
            <li>so  I think its definitely having a positive effect on my skin.</li>
            <li>I can remember having my skin this clear like 2 times during those 5 years.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly enough they really helped to clear up my acne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Clear Skin Vitamin Pack by Innate Skin for about a year now</li>
            <li>My face is a complete warzone.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>so it will make your urine really yellow or really dark,&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li>Im about to turn 40 years old</li>
            <li>and I have been struggling with adult acne for over 15 years.</li>
            <li>Works very well with a topical acne treatment like Clinque&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this to a family member as well, for her adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I would highly suggest that product instead of this one for both results and ease of ingestion (the Clearzine capsules are much smaller and gel encased).  </li>
            <li>I tried Acne-D, not working for me, I&#x27;m going back to the Clear Skin Vitamin Pack.</li>
            <li>I am 25 yr old Male .. Does not work for me.</li>
            <li>A smattering of horsetail extract and rose hips is extremely unlikely to do anything for you.</li>
            <li>For the first month, I tried the typical remedies of face washing and toner twice a day and changing my diet.</li>
            <li>started taking these as soon as I got them, however I did have to cut the pills in half as they are HUGE- and ended up reducing the dosage to just half a pill twice a day.</li>
            <li>Acne D cleared up that right away, a problem she has had for the past 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have to say I only saw minor changes in my adult acne.  </li>
            <li>(Swallowing such large pills, even when cut in half, twice a day was</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The only reason that long list of herbal ingredients is on the bottle is to create the illusion of value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slowly but surely the acne dissappeared and within a month it was under control so well that you could hardly tell it was even there.</li>
            <li> effects are not instantaneous (on a halved regimen) and quite subtle if you aren&#x27;t checking the mirror thoroughly every day, but definitely worth it- especially if you&#x27;re not up for shelling out the cash needed for &amp;#34;clearin&amp;#34; or other name-brands.</li>

            <li> It was so bad that all the photo editing in the world wouldn&#x27;t be able to mask the issue.</li>
            <li> This was a side effect that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> I have had acne ever since I was in middle school and being in my twenties now, up until a few weeks ago I was still trying to fight out the remainder of that acne.  </li>
            <li> after only 3-4 weeks, my frequency of breakouts improved drastically (I only had 1 small breakout!), and the size and redness of my acne have improved basically 100 percent.  </li>
            <li> Huge pills, tastes bad....</li>
            <li> black heads went away by the time I was</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d still get all sorts of random breakout on my back, face, and chest.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re lazy like me, take it ever 2-4 days.</li>
            <li> But i am not sure it is working</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only like 25 dollars you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The other ingredient here with some serious evidence behind it is pantothenic acid (vitamin B5).</li>
            <li> but they freaking went away within like 3 days!!Acne D started off slow for me</li>
            <li> I take these when I get that occasional bad break out.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> started using this like a month n a week,i hav had acne for like 5yrs now, i did some research, didn&#x27;t know wether to get this or pantothen. I decided to get this, cuz it was cheaper. At first i didn&#x27;t feel like it was working i would still get breakouts, it sucked. Now a month later i still got like 2-3 pimples but they freaking went away within like 3 days!!Acne D started off slow for me but then now i feel like its really working I can remember having my skin this clear like 2 times during those 5 years.  I am also using some topical creams and drinking fiber like 2 times a day. I don&#x27;t know whether its the cream the fiber or Acne D to be honest but all of those things put together have cleared my skin up quite a bit may b its all 3 of them put together idk but man its working. U should try all 3 fight acne inside and out ive been researching acne for quite a bit now, this is whats working for me i just ordered 2 more bottles of this stuff. Would give it a 5 but don&#x27;t know if this is whats curing it.Just know its helping.</li>
            <li> Gave the product over of month to work but didn&#x27;t really notice any results but it did cause me to break out even more.</li>
            <li> Any time you see the phrase \\&quot;proprietary blend,\\&quot; you should be wary. A smattering of horsetail extract and rose hips is extremely unlikely to do anything for you. The only reason that long list of herbal ingredients is on the bottle is to create the illusion of value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not to say that these pills don&#x27;t work. There&#x27;s a simple reason why they work: zinc. Zinc is the only nutrient that&#x27;s been shown scientifically, in randomized trials, to reduce acne. And these pills contain a lot of zinc: 25mg per pill, with a recommended dosage of 2 pills/day. For comparison, the Institute of Medicine suggests 40mg/day as a Tolerable Upper Limit (TUL) for healthy adults. See \\&quot;Health Risks from Excessive Zinc\\&quot; at [...]&lt;br /&gt;The other ingredient here with some serious evidence behind it is pantothenic acid (vitamin B5). Very high B5 intake has been shown to reduce sebum production, and unlike zinc, it appears to be safe even in doses an order of magnitude greater than the 100mg in each of these pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: Rather than buying Acne-d, I&#x27;d recommend looking for zinc and pantothenic acid supplements from reputable manufacturers. You&#x27;ll have much more control over dosage, and you won&#x27;t have to be concerned over the provenance and safety of numerous inactive ingredients.</li>
            <li> It realy does seem to work. My skin is clearer. Not %100, but much better non the less. I have been taking one pill in the AM and one pill in the PM.</li>
            <li> I am 25 yr old Male .. Does not work for me. Had 2 tablets after food once a day, everyday for past 2 months. No difference at all. I stopped eating fried food, and that&#x27;s what is helping me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd week taking this product, and my skin is now at it&#x27;s worse! I have never broken out this bad in my life. My face is a complete warzone. It&#x27;s so bad that I don&#x27;t even want to go out! I&#x27;m eating healthy, excersizing, treating my face very gently and taking Acne-D. So not sure what is going on. I&#x27;m going to use up the bottle and hope that it gets better soon.</li>
            <li> Did not do ANYTHING. Skin didn&#x27;t change at all</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a week and omg there is such a difference in the oil production.  I cannot believe that it is working so good.  I wish I had this in my teenage years.  I tell anyone who suffers with acne to try it.  It&#x27;s the best acne treatment that actually works.  You skin get so clear and healthly looking that you will feel so good about youself.</li>
            <li> I was really insecure about my acne for several years. Nothing really seemed to work for me. I tried proactiv, clean and clear and prescriptions from my doctor. People have always told me that your diet can affect your skin and they are right. But that wasn&#x27;t enough for me, so when I saw these pills I decided I would try them since I had nothing to lose. Amazingly enough they really helped to clear up my acne and I&#x27;m not as disgusted with my face anymore. Plus it makes me feel a lot better about taking them knowing that I&#x27;m not smearing some chemical on my skin like proactiv. It&#x27;s as easy as taking a vitamin and I love it. I know everyone&#x27;s skin types are different but this product is definitely worth a try if you are struggling with acne like I was.</li>
            <li> Hesitant  to start using do to disclaimer that came  with bottle that product may initially make my acne worse.</li>
            <li> Wow. I could not be more greatful for this product. About 2 months before an appointment for senior pictures, my face started breaking out worse than ever. It was so bad that all the photo editing in the world wouldn&#x27;t be able to mask the issue. For the first month, I tried the typical remedies of face washing and toner twice a day and changing my diet. None of which seemed to work. Then, about a month before the pictures were to be taken, my parents handed me some of this Acne-d. It worked like a charm. Slowly but surely the acne dissappeared and within a month it was under control so well that you could hardly tell it was even there. It&#x27;s amazing what nature can do! Thank you to the makers of Acne-d.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for me right away. I have tried similar products that cost much more and this works just as well if not better. These types of vitamins seem to be the best way to keep my skin clear. I have moderate acne and rarely get a break out taking three of these a day. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne, since I was twelve (but calmed from what was damn-near cystic to just perpetual hot-spots here and there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started taking these as soon as I got them, however I did have to cut the pills in half as they are HUGE- and ended up reducing the dosage to just half a pill twice a day. ...I didn&#x27;t really notice a change over the course of the two months I was taking them, so I decided to stop. (Swallowing such large pills, even when cut in half, twice a day was a chore.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of a sudden, I noticed &amp;#34;more&amp;#34; spots popping up on my face, chin and chest- I began to freak out, thinking this was some weird reaction... Until I realized these were my usual spots- which had been clearing up, flaring back up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately I resumed my regimen and one week back in, I can happily say 80% of my hot-spots are acne-free once more. (Primarily my face and chin. My chest is noticeably healing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effects are not instantaneous (on a halved regimen) and quite subtle if you aren&#x27;t checking the mirror thoroughly every day, but definitely worth it- especially if you&#x27;re not up for shelling out the cash needed for &amp;#34;clearin&amp;#34; or other name-brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a mix of every acne. (Cystic, white heads, black heads)&lt;br /&gt;My black heads went away by the time I was 15.&lt;br /&gt;I had to go on Acutane twice and that got rid of my cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;That leaves white heads as my last nemesis.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d get breakouts in concentrated areas and I&#x27;d take all the precautions to make sure the area was clean.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d still get all sorts of random breakout on my back, face, and chest.&lt;br /&gt;I got Ance-d and it worked for me. Take it as it&#x27;s instructed or once every 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;It has high amounts of vitamin B so it will make your urine really yellow or really dark,&lt;br /&gt;so make sure to drink LOTS of water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This won&#x27;t help with acne scaring but it will keep you from getting future acne by keeping your skin healthy from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;If you take Acne-d during a break out, don&#x27;t expect Acne-d to do all the work for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re acne-prone take it regardless of whether or not you have a break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re lazy like me, take it ever 2-4 days.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for my daughter! She broke out worse than ever and after using it for 3 months...it never cleared her skin up. I wish I had kept my money!!!</li>
            <li> I am a month into taking this supplement and so far so very good. I have noticed a difference in the clarity of my skin and I haven&#x27;t gotten a cystic acne (or any kind of ) break out since I started taking the supplement(knock on wood). Also, I have gone thru a lady cycle with no breakouts so  I think its definitely having a positive effect on my skin. Now if I can only stop picking at my face to minimize my scars. Do they make a pill for that too? lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take two pills a day with breakfast and will continue to do so until I have a build up in my system, I then may go to just one pill a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and the product :-)</li>
            <li> No signs of product doing anything. Returned during 30-day trial period. A+ for customer service, product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best pills I have ever took that actually work. The first 2 weeks of taking the pills, I was having more breakouts. This was a side effect that was to be expected. However im over 3 weeks into taking them and my skin is clearing up like never before. Im about to turn 40 years old and I have been struggling with adult acne for over 15 years. These pills have worked better than all the prescribed medications and over the counter remidies combined.  I wish I knew about these pills years ago. Two thumbs up and five stars from me!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my nephew who has a severe acne problem.  2 weeks in and we&#x27;re already seeing results!</li>
            <li> I was using Pantothen which was really working for me and decided to try Acne-D because of it being more affordable but MAJOR mistake! I broke out like crazy. It was horrible and painful. Lots of cysts that wouldn&#x27;t come to an end. Wish u the best. As for me, i will go back to Pantothen.</li>
            <li> Huge pills, tastes bad....does not work!&lt;br /&gt;I was very unhappy and just tossed them in the trash after 2 weeks of trying it out.</li>
            <li> Notice improvement in preventing pimples.</li>
            <li> bought this for my teen Age son who has moderate acne. took a few weeks to really see improvement but we really notice a difference now.&lt;br /&gt;works great I recommend this product</li>
            <li> Works very well with a topical acne treatment like Clinque&#x27;.  Alone, not so effective.</li>
            <li> I take these when I get that occasional bad break out. Only reason I do not take them regularly is because they have a tendency to give me diarrhea. They seem to aid in the redness and severity of breakouts. Panothenic acid is sometimes a better alternative though.</li>
            <li> I have had acne ever since I was in middle school and being in my twenties now, up until a few weeks ago I was still trying to fight out the remainder of that acne.  I first purchased this product about a month ago, as a recommendation from a friend who had great results.  I was taking Cefadroxil and Benzaclyn (the most powerful regiment before accutane) for 5 years prior to this with no improvement.  Started taking Acne D and it cleared up my acne 95% within two weeks.  Woah.  So many years wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this to a family member as well, for her adult acne.  With her it was of the type where a rogue pimple comes, but takes weeks to go.  Acne D cleared up that right away, a problem she has had for the past 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s three 5-star reviews coming from my friend, myself and my family member.  If I recommend this to my own family, take this as a token of confidence that this product will help your acne problems, adult or teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to drink a lot of water, it really helps Acne D clear you up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1 Feb 2013:&lt;br /&gt;I continue to take AcneD to this day, but I only take one pill a day (actually 2 pills every three days).  If I get an acne flare, taking 2 pills in a day for two or three days will handle everything well.</li>
            <li> I am nursing mom . Can i use this acne-d ? This product seems good to me. But i am not sure it is working</li>
            <li> Decided to try this because it&#x27;s a bit cheaper but my acne started coming back. I&#x27;ve been using the Clear Skin Vitamin Pack by Innate Skin for about a year now and it worked great, but got a bit expensive. I tried Acne-D, not working for me, I&#x27;m going back to the Clear Skin Vitamin Pack.</li>
            <li> I purchased these viatmins for my son who&#x27;s had facial acne since last summer..  It had really gotten really bad and I took him to see a dermatologist, but my son wasn&#x27;t faithful with the topical &amp; medication.&lt;br /&gt;Well; he&#x27;s been using these capsules and I do feel alot better about it because they are vitamins.  His face has gotten alot better, so I&#x27;m surmising that it&#x27;s due to them.  Yay!</li>
            <li> i bought this product for my son and it is really working.  He will continue using it, Thanks! Good product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to see any change now I use it more as a vitamin supplement works good I&#x27;m Ok with that</li>
            <li> I took these pills for approximately 4 to 5 weeks and I have to say I only saw minor changes in my adult acne.  I suffer from adult acne (that tends to be cystic in nature), and I did notice that my acne would dry out more quickly and be less severe while taking this product, but I do not feel that it made a significant impact on the frequencies of my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the size of these pills are TOO LARGE!!  I am no stranger to taking large pills and do not normally suffer from any &amp;#34;gag reflexes&amp;#34; as many people do (I took gigantic fish oil pills for years on end with no problem), but with these HUGE pills I did struggle with a gag reflex for the first time in my life!  The fact that these pills have a rough finish (vs. gel or gelatin caps) add insult to injury, and I absolutely would dread taking them every day...especially for just minimal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched over to Clearzine pills after my negative experience with this product, and I am VERY HAPPY with my results using that product!!  I have noticed SIGNIFICANT improvements in my acne...after only 3-4 weeks, my frequency of breakouts improved drastically (I only had 1 small breakout!), and the size and redness of my acne have improved basically 100 percent.  I would highly suggest that product instead of this one for both results and ease of ingestion (the Clearzine capsules are much smaller and gel encased).  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Have had acne for 7 years and these finally knocked it out. I take one right before bed and when I wake up. Occasionally take two at once if skin is breaking out bad. They work great and will defiantly purchase them again when my current bottle runs out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.  The supplements came in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> i noticed a little bit of change in my skin complexion howevrer i would recommend vita clear by proactiv its nice</li>
            <li> This product is pretty fair I used it because I was tired of breaking out and using antibiotics and putting toxic medicine into my body. I decided to go with vitamins and that&#x27;s basically what this product is. I look at it as a acne multivitamin worked pretty good for me. It&#x27;s only like 25 dollars you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
