    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am really impressed with this peel.</li>
            <li>peel smells deliciously fruity and is a cherry/raspberry color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35 and my skin is showing signs of living in the Texas heat and sun as well as aging and this product is remarkable!</li>
            <li>This is a great at home peel.</li>
            <li>I saw a youtube video about how great this product is</li>
            <li>Its scent is good.  </li>
            <li>Best no chemical light scrub.</li>
            <li>But after this peel, I feel like I have done something good for my skin, which is then softer and</li>
            <li>I was a devout Mychelle buyer and loved their products.  </li>
            <li>often start with the Mychelle Fruit Enzyme Scrub, which also smells delightfully fruity and has just the right amount of scrub for my 30-something combination skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS LINE OF PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this peel, it&#x27;s so good for my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great, quick peel for improving your skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this mask to those who do NOT have sensitive skin, but for those who do, probably best to stay away from this one.</li>
            <li>I am now going to try FarmHouse Fresh Splendid Dirt pumpkin mask and see if that is better suited to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started using this two months ago and love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I started having all pigmentations darker and increased, also even moles started showing up more and darker.  </li>
            <li>I am not one to leave reviews, but I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product as well as their pumpkin peel.  </li>
            <li>I definitely felt the \\&quot;peel\\&quot; effect... Rinsed it off and followed with toner and Mychelle&#x27;s Pumpkin Renew Cream (best.</li>
            <li>the smell and texture of the peel feels luxerious.  :-)</li>
            <li>I used this for about a year and it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>The peel tingles a little, smells tasty, works perfectly, and is paraben free!</li>
            <li>Somehow, this product does not have detailed instruction or warning.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks fantastic after using it.</li>
            <li>and the products were about the same performance wise, but greater in quantity.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>This product is 100% natural, smells delicious, and my skin glows and looks so fresh and new after I wash it off!</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous and is this deliciously rich raspberry color...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quick and easy pick-me-up for your skin without going to a salon.</li>
            <li>I still have a jar of the original stuff and have searched the internet to find some of the original but cant.  </li>
            <li>All Mychelle products are first class-paraben free and they deliver</li>
            <li>I also noticed the new one didnt smell anywhere as good as the old one, and was loaded with xantham gum!  </li>
            <li>My skin looks fresh for the first time in over a year!  </li>
            <li>Great ingredients, which I have heavily scrutinized.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much more effective than much more expensive peels that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I purchased this peel after a recommendation, I was searching for a strong natural enzyme peel</li>
            <li>I got very much depressed and stopped going out.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive oily skin and wanted a toxic free product to help maintain a youthful look to my hormonally changing skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought and returned this item recently when I noticed most of the ingrediants had been changed to cheaper ones.  </li>
            <li>I use this weekly and noticed a difference after my first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>but when I went online to search for more reviews I noticed that all reviews prior to 2010 are great and after 2010 were not good at all.  </li>
            <li>The fruit fiesta peel (used alternatively with the pumpkin peel) has taken years off my appearance, reduced wrinkles, eliminated blackheads, and has pretty much eliminated acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and did make my skin look brighter/better the next day.</li>
            <li>This fruit peel does work pretty good and doesn&#x27;t have a burning sensation...at least on me.</li>
            <li>well, I can see certain progress.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few OTC peels and plenty of gritty exfoliating products this really did the job beautifully.  </li>
            <li>far it is pretty good enough to use at home without big charge at a dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Therefore,  I really cannot say if this product does work.</li>
            <li>This product works really well.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this product but</li>
            <li>and she said much of their line has changed to cheaper componets.</li>
            <li>( I have very oily skin and acne marks)</li>
            <li>I notice a sensation (almost a burning), but I think that is because it is working -- just make sure you do a patch test, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and usually have no problem with peels or enzyme masks of any kind.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I may have had an allergic reaction, but I highly recommend that people start with a sample.</li>
            <li>This peel rivals the high end department store at home peels plus it smells yummy.  </li>
            <li>I am really sad because I had high hopes for this product line because it seemed to have great reviews, but I am continually unimpressed each time I try something by them.</li>
            <li>so in other words, your still paying a very high price for something that has changed significantly, and without them notifying it on the jar.      </li>
            <li>I see a few reviews that are greater than 5 years old with the reviewer wondering if the ingredients were changed.  </li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for my skin; no peeling, no glow, barely a tingle.  </li>
            <li>my skin was a little rosy for a little while after (an hour at most) but it glowed and was smooth, soft, and renewed as baby skin.  </li>
            <li>I always seemed to get a few breakouts after, but overall it gave my skin a nice soft feeling and made it glow.</li>
            <li>It reduces large pores, fades sun damage, and generally makes your skin look like you have had a professional peel.</li>
            <li>after learning about the new ingredients and reading the reviews after 2010 I will continue my search for a natural peel product.  </li>
            <li>This product might be too strong to apply a couple or few times a week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also small, light, and thin and a good toss-in-the-bag peel for travel.</li>
            <li>Here are some of the first ingrediants in the original one:  cherry puree, d-cranberry complex puree, pumpkin puree, apple puree, blueberry puree, jasmine alchohol...</li>
            <li>The directions clearly say to leave on 1-3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The old posts give glowing praises - the newer ones NOT.</li>
            <li>I was nervous to use this peel because I have had professional peels before at the spa</li>
            <li>Recommend this product for anyone looking for something natural and cruelty-free in a skincare line</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but immediately upon applying this mask, my skin started to burn.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for 5 minutes and my skin is soft, supple and like glass.</li>
            <li>and wow-</li>
            <li>After using it for a few minutes, my skin definitely looks better.</li>
            <li>the new jar has the first ingrediant of water and other inexpensive ingreds.  </li>
            <li>Love the peel.extremely gentle and non-irritating unlike other peels I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I alternate depending on what yummy natural product I feel like pampering my skin with.  </li>
            <li>Bought both MyChelle Fruit Fiesta Peel and the pumpkin peel, so far I have tried each product alternately twice per week, since my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive, i left it on for about 10mins.</li>
            <li>I love it...when my skin is tired and needs to glow ,this is my go to,  </li>
            <li>MY low star review is not due to my using the product -</li>
            <li>The peel is easy to apply, and all you need is a thin layer.</li>
            <li>It feels good to look so radiant and young with out all the harmful chemicals of phthalates, parabens, propylene glycol, ureas, EDTA and formulated fragrance and artificial colors!</li>

            <li> Periodically I try other products, but always come back to these 2 brands because they are natural and work well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I have used a few MyChelle products and I usually have the same reaction; they work great for the few few uses and then my skin reacts to it.</li>
            <li> it shrinks my pores and makes my skin look a little close to normal</li>
            <li> ] I have been going through the kit and trying new Mychelle products slowly to discover which ones I like (so far, all of them).  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have only felt a slight tingling.</li>
            <li> Maybe I left it on too long?</li>
            <li> Plan on being a little red for a few hours, so don&#x27;t do it right before you are going out somewhere.</li>
            <li> I doubt I will purchase any of their other products and definitely would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> but rather the fact that the product has obviously changed formulation over time and all the newer reviews claim that the it  is different than in the past - now using cheaper ingredients.</li>
            <li> Works really well for dissolving out dull dead skin layers and preventing break-outs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item due to my skin defect after birth contol pills.  </li>
            <li> My OB-GYN doctor recommended birth control pills due to my age, almost 40.  </li>
            <li> It works extremely well</li>
            <li> I use it with other MyChelle products.  </li>
            <li> other than all that....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my skin has just become more sensitive, but the last time I used it I got a horrible break out reaction.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just too harsh.</li>
            <li> has resurfaced my skin, cut down on black heads and gives me a youthful glow!!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t say the same as the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Not sure, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very small amount.</li>
            <li> The only negative was the amount they give you for the price you pay :(  </li>
            <li> Although rather expensive, when using this 1-2x/wk, the container lasts me for months, usually at least 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> -- of course not; the results are not that dramatic.</li>
            <li> After taking BCP for three months, my facial condition became terrible.  </li>
            <li> However, this broke me out terribly after using it.</li>
            <li> Quite nasty.</li>

            <li> How you do rate a product you have not used? MY low star review is not due to my using the product - but rather the fact that the product has obviously changed formulation over time and all the newer reviews claim that the it  is different than in the past - now using cheaper ingredients. The old posts give glowing praises - the newer ones NOT. So, I guess I will skip this product line and try something else.</li>
            <li> I bought this item from all the 5-star reviews it received on Amazon.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t say the same as the other reviewers.  This product did absolutely nothing for my skin; no peeling, no glow, barely a tingle.  I doubt I will purchase any of their other products and definitely would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t doing it for me. I get &#x27;brighter&#x27; results from a mud mask. when its gone, I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and usually have no problem with peels or enzyme masks of any kind. However, this broke me out terribly after using it. I tried it several times to see if my skin was just \\&quot;purging\\&quot; but my skin always had the same reaction. I am really sad because I had high hopes for this product line because it seemed to have great reviews, but I am continually unimpressed each time I try something by them. Perhaps it is because they have changed their formulas and are using cheaper ingredients? I&#x27;m not sure. All I know is this one does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to use this peel because I have had professional peels before at the spa and they have irritated my skin and caused breakouts afterward. So it was with trepidation that I used the trial-sized version of this peel yesterday. What a difference!  My skin looks fresh for the first time in over a year!  My recommendation to others who are nervous about buying skincare products is to get the travel kit: [[ASIN:B000Z978YC MyChelle Sampler Travel and Gift Set - 1 Kit(s)]] I have been going through the kit and trying new Mychelle products slowly to discover which ones I like (so far, all of them).  The peel tingles a little, smells tasty, works perfectly, and is paraben free!</li>
            <li> I am 40 with mixed oily and dry/wrinkled skin.  The fruit fiesta peel (used alternatively with the pumpkin peel) has taken years off my appearance, reduced wrinkles, eliminated blackheads, and has pretty much eliminated acne breakouts.  It burns a bit (which means it&#x27;s working).  I use it 1-2 times per week and the pumpkin peel 1-2 times per week.    This product is 100% natural, smells delicious, and my skin glows and looks so fresh and new after I wash it off!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item due to my skin defect after birth contol pills.  My OB-GYN doctor recommended birth control pills due to my age, almost 40.  After taking BCP for three months, my facial condition became terrible.  I started having all pigmentations darker and increased, also even moles started showing up more and darker.  My face became something else, not a human face, I thought.  I got very much depressed and stopped going out.  I have no idea, but my dermatologist never called me back either.  I started looking up all over internet and found this item.  So far so good.  Its scent is good.  Somehow, this product does not have detailed instruction or warning.  It only has instruction on the outer box.(no extra insert information).  I have no idea how often I need to use this.  No warnings of side affect either. So, I assumed and decided to use it once a month. Therefore,  I really cannot say if this product does work. I will update some months later.&lt;br /&gt;So far it is pretty good enough to use at home without big charge at a dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Best no chemical light scrub.</li>
            <li> Love the peel.extremely gentle and non-irritating unlike other peels I have used in the past.  I use this 2-3 times per week and skin feels softer and smoother afterwards.  Recommend this product for anyone looking for something natural and cruelty-free in a skincare line</li>
            <li> This product works really well. It tingles quite a bit when applied, but standing in front of a fan helps. It reduces large pores, fades sun damage, and generally makes your skin look like you have had a professional peel. I always glow after giving myself one. Plan on being a little red for a few hours, so don&#x27;t do it right before you are going out somewhere. I alternate between this and the pumpkin peel, and would purchase both items again.</li>
            <li> I am not one to leave reviews, but I absolutely love this product.  It works extremely well has resurfaced my skin, cut down on black heads and gives me a youthful glow!!  I&#x27;m 35 and my skin is showing signs of living in the Texas heat and sun as well as aging and this product is remarkable!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but immediately upon applying this mask, my skin started to burn. Not tingle, burn. I may have had an allergic reaction, but I highly recommend that people start with a sample. Obviously, my skin reaction meant that I can&#x27;t use the product, but even if that wasn&#x27;t a factor, the smell was putrid. It smells like decaying fruit. Quite nasty. Bottom line: Before potentially wasting your money on this, try to find a sample somewhere.</li>
            <li> This is one of my must-have beauty products.  Great ingredients, which I have heavily scrutinized.  Works really well for dissolving out dull dead skin layers and preventing break-outs.</li>
            <li> I saw a youtube video about how great this product is but when I went online to search for more reviews I noticed that all reviews prior to 2010 are great and after 2010 were not good at all.  I read that the company has changed over to inexpensive ingredients.  I was really looking forward to using this product but after learning about the new ingredients and reading the reviews after 2010 I will continue my search for a natural peel product.  Suggestions anyone?</li>
            <li> Love this product as well as their pumpkin peel.  I have sensitive oily skin and wanted a toxic free product to help maintain a youthful look to my hormonally changing skin.  I alternate depending on what yummy natural product I feel like pampering my skin with.  It feels good to look so radiant and young with out all the harmful chemicals of phthalates, parabens, propylene glycol, ureas, EDTA and formulated fragrance and artificial colors!</li>
            <li> This peel rivals the high end department store at home peels plus it smells yummy.  I leave it on for 5 minutes and my skin is soft, supple and like glass.All Mychelle products are first class-paraben free and they deliver</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous and is this deliciously rich raspberry color... Did the patch test as my skin tends towards sensitivity and followed directions... This is a speedy peel- just 5 minutes... Even though the patch test did not feel warm/tingly when it was all over my face I definitely felt the \\&quot;peel\\&quot; effect... Rinsed it off and followed with toner and Mychelle&#x27;s Pumpkin Renew Cream (best. ever.) and wow- my skin was a little rosy for a little while after (an hour at most) but it glowed and was smooth, soft, and renewed as baby skin.  I&#x27;ve tried a few OTC peels and plenty of gritty exfoliating products this really did the job beautifully.  I am really impressed with this peel.</li>
            <li> This is a great, quick peel for improving your skin. After using it for a few minutes, my skin definitely looks better. Is it the key to instant youth? -- of course not; the results are not that dramatic. But after this peel, I feel like I have done something good for my skin, which is then softer and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peel smells deliciously fruity and is a cherry/raspberry color. The peel is easy to apply, and all you need is a thin layer. I notice a sensation (almost a burning), but I think that is because it is working -- just make sure you do a patch test, especially if you have sensitive skin. Although rather expensive, when using this 1-2x/wk, the container lasts me for months, usually at least 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often start with the Mychelle Fruit Enzyme Scrub, which also smells delightfully fruity and has just the right amount of scrub for my 30-something combination skin. I am a fan of Mychelle products, although I also use Alba products often, too. Periodically I try other products, but always come back to these 2 brands because they are natural and work well.</li>
            <li> Love this peel, it&#x27;s so good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I used this for about a year and it was pretty good. I always seemed to get a few breakouts after, but overall it gave my skin a nice soft feeling and made it glow. I would use this for about 3 minutes once a week. I&#x27;m not sure if my skin has just become more sensitive, but the last time I used it I got a horrible break out reaction. Maybe I left it on too long? Not sure, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again. I think it&#x27;s just too harsh. I am now going to try FarmHouse Fresh Splendid Dirt pumpkin mask and see if that is better suited to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have used a few MyChelle products and I usually have the same reaction; they work great for the few few uses and then my skin reacts to it. I have read that they changed their ingredients, perhaps that&#x27;s what&#x27;s up. I would recommend this mask to those who do NOT have sensitive skin, but for those who do, probably best to stay away from this one.</li>
            <li> I was a devout Mychelle buyer and loved their products.  I bought and returned this item recently when I noticed most of the ingrediants had been changed to cheaper ones.  I still have a jar of the original stuff and have searched the internet to find some of the original but cant.  Here are some of the first ingrediants in the original one:  cherry puree, d-cranberry complex puree, pumpkin puree, apple puree, blueberry puree, jasmine alchohol...and so on.  the new jar has the first ingrediant of water and other inexpensive ingreds.  I also noticed the new one didnt smell anywhere as good as the old one, and was loaded with xantham gum!  so in other words, your still paying a very high price for something that has changed significantly, and without them notifying it on the jar.      p.s. talked to someone at wholefoods about it and she said much of their line has changed to cheaper componets.</li>
            <li> Bought both MyChelle Fruit Fiesta Peel and the pumpkin peel, so far I have tried each product alternately twice per week, since my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive, i left it on for about 10mins. Works well, I can see certain progress. The peel scent is yummy.</li>
            <li> I love it...when my skin is tired and needs to glow ,this is my go to,  it shrinks my pores and makes my skin look a little close to normal ( I have very oily skin and acne marks)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Fruit Fiesta Peel for several years now. It&#x27;s a quick and easy pick-me-up for your skin without going to a salon. I get regular facials but even so, I see the difference in my skin when I use this peel in between. It&#x27;s also small, light, and thin and a good toss-in-the-bag peel for travel.</li>
            <li> I definitely see a difference in my skin with this peel. I use it with other MyChelle products.  I LOVE THIS LINE OF PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for two weeks.....it does burn and feels itchy on the skin immediatly after applying the peel.....might want to sit in front of a fan to tolerate the 5 min your supposed to have this on the skin. I have acne prone skin with blotchy marks so I&#x27;m hoping with regular use.....I can get the blotchy marks to lighten up. My advise, use this product once a week...the first week, I used it 2 times and I noticed a small breakout around the corners of my chin. This product might be too strong to apply a couple or few times a week. other than all that....the smell and texture of the peel feels luxerious.  :-)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! My skin looks fantastic after using it. I wish it came in a bigger tube though. I will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> I purchased this peel after a recommendation, I was searching for a strong natural enzyme peel and I finally found it! I use this weekly and noticed a difference after my first couple of uses. It&#x27;s so much more effective than much more expensive peels that I have tried.</li>
