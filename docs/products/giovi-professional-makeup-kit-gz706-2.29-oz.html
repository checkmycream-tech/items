            <li>Not so great.</li>
            <li>this is a great make up kit.</li>
            <li>The colors are very beautiful and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The lipglosses are fine, and I especially love the golds.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my niece for Christmas and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>but for hteprice is it good</li>
            <li>But this compact is amazing you must buy it (just use your own brushes)!</li>
            <li>Lip colors are nice.  </li>
            <li>It does not go on nicely.</li>
            <li>so it was a nice set to get her started.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice presentation with lots of colors for her to try.  </li>
            <li>nice very happy , i choose because is my favorite, i like to much</li>
            <li>It needs a better presentation, perhaps along side of some kind of scale like a ruler.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice package with most of the basics and lots of versatility.  </li>
            <li>Eye colors are great, bright and vibrant, but when you apply them, they are very light.  </li>
            <li>love the colors, and the shades.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>and my friends love it to.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I just need to carry mascara</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute to look at, I like it</li>
            <li>its ok though.</li>
            <li>God I love this.</li>
            <li>The foundation/cover up is good ( by the way, there aren&#x27;t 2, the one on the right in the picture is the sponge), soread evenly and everything.</li>
            <li>My niece was very excited to get this kit as a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size for a backpack or a large purse.  </li>
            <li>I gave as a gift and didn&#x27;t really feel good about it.</li>
            <li>She is having so much fun with it! :)</li>
            <li>The compact case is easy when traveling.</li>
            <li>make up was easy to apply and stayed on well</li>
            <li>The powder is for a very light skin tone, which luckily for me, I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow applicators in the kit are fine, but I prefer brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t have a light skin tone though, you can still enjoy all of the rest of the kit.</li>
            <li>thing I do suggest is to invest in a brush kit, you can get one on here fairly cheap and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>everything else is all compact in one case, and it came really fast!!!</li>
            <li>It is just cheap makeup - nothing special.</li>
            <li>Used for the first time, and I love the colors.</li>
            <li>Nice durable packaging and all the different selections of colors with high quality makeup at a good price cant beat that.</li>
            <li>I great how much they fit in to this tiny thing, and its just the right size for me to take it anywhere.</li>
            <li>I loved the whole slide-out action.  </li>
            <li>feel like a found a super deal.</li>
            <li>though not waterproof) and washes off with mild makeup remover.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The picture is deceiving however, my niece was satisfied with her new makeup kit</li>
            <li>Plus, if you don&#x27;t have a light skin tone, you can use the light powder as a highlighter above the eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They can go on kind of sheer, but if you put a little more on it comes out fine</li>
            <li>Came fast colors are wonderful, may have to do second coat with some colors if you like the dark look but 2 thumbs up from me</li>
            <li>and it looked exactly as the picture.</li>
            <li>Nice colors, nice complete box and small enough to fit in handbag.</li>
            <li>it is very nice, i got it as a present, but it doesn&#x27;t withstand much weight on top of it or being pressed into small spaces, and the drawer on the bottom slides open really easily.</li>
            <li>This would be nice for a little girl to play dress up with.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the eye opener.....</li>
            <li>It is OK for the $$ spent on it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking into buying one I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use that much.</li>
            <li>The top clicks into the sliding drawer so that it stays securely closed.</li>
            <li>How much can you really say about makeup,</li>
            <li>I was surprised when one drawer would open and others would pop out with MORE colors to choose from, all in one convenient box.</li>
            <li>The other applicators are ok, I guess, but I haven&#x27;t really used them.</li>
            <li>the make up itself is a little cheap but for the price, it was so worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The colors are sheer, which (in my opinion) is appropriate for a teen.  </li>
            <li>The makeups are high quality.  </li>
            <li>The blushes and bronzers are also good, although I did have to put a little more on than I usually do, but that&#x27;s probably just because I&#x27;m using stuff from a different brand.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and was very surprised when it showed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are like 36 eyeshadows, and the colors are all so pretty, and there&#x27;s such a variety!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone as the color palette on here is pretty vast in colors.</li>
            <li>I layer them over a pink for a really pretty look!</li>
            <li>I was glad to see that you carried the brand, it is hard to find in my area..</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised with the sleek/quality look of it.  </li>
            <li>The kit came in the mail early and completely intact.</li>
            <li>My 12 yr old loves the varity of eyeshadows</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister as a gift and as far as I can tell she loves it.</li>
            <li>When I saw how cheap this set was, i was a little curious as to</li>

            <li> love the colors, and the shades. This makeup last all day. The compact case is easy when traveling. I was glad to see that you carried the brand, it is hard to find in my area..Thanks for the eye opener.....</li>
            <li> the make-up kit came with eyebrows broken... the box is very fragile.</li>
            <li> This thing is great! There are like 36 eyeshadows, and the colors are all so pretty, and there&#x27;s such a variety! They can go on kind of sheer, but if you put a little more on it comes out fine (I actually like the sheer look too, and it may have just been the brush I was using anyway!). The lipglosses are fine, and I especially love the golds. I layer them over a pink for a really pretty look! The foundation/cover up is good ( by the way, there aren&#x27;t 2, the one on the right in the picture is the sponge), soread evenly and everything. The blushes and bronzers are also good, although I did have to put a little more on than I usually do, but that&#x27;s probably just because I&#x27;m using stuff from a different brand. The lip brush was terrible; the only thing I didn&#x27;t like. It was hard, as if the hairs had congealed. I threw it away after using it. The other applicators are ok, I guess, but I haven&#x27;t really used them. But this compact is amazing you must buy it (just use your own brushes)!</li>
            <li> When I received the product, two sections of the powder were broken.  Eye colors are great, bright and vibrant, but when you apply them, they are very light.  Lip colors are nice.  It is OK for the $$ spent on it.</li>
            <li> I really love it. and my friends love it to. It is great for travel and the size is perfect.</li>

            <li> I love this product, I just need to carry mascara everything else is all compact in one case, and it came really fast!!!</li>
            <li> I looked over several make up kits before I purchased this one. The kit came in the mail early and completely intact. The colors are very beautiful and easy to apply. If you are looking into buying one I highly recommend this one! The size thew me off. It is a bit small. (makes for great travel)  No worries after using it.... the make up stays on all day and you don&#x27;t have to use that much.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. It looks like it would be bigger than it actually is. The picture is deceiving however, my niece was satisfied with her new makeup kit</li>
            <li> I gave this away to my niece. It is just cheap makeup - nothing special.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product!  All the colors one could possibly need for makeup. I was surprised when one drawer would open and others would pop out with MORE colors to choose from, all in one convenient box.</li>
            <li> the kit seemed much larger in the picture not what I was expecting... I gave as a gift and didn&#x27;t really feel good about it. Somethings should only be bought in person..</li>
            <li> poorly packed and arrived powders were shattered, but the shadows arrived safely, even so should be careful with this product.</li>
            <li> Used for the first time, and I love the colors. They stay on all day if u use a.good quality primer and brush.</li>
            <li> Not so great. The shadow does not stay on for very long. The blush is wierd. It does not go on nicely. This would be nice for a little girl to play dress up with.</li>
            <li> My 12 yr old loves the varity of eyeshadows</li>
            <li> such a variety of shadows at such a bargain price.  The shadows wear well without irritating my eyes.  feel like a found a super deal.</li>
            <li> product received , 100 % recommended . thank you</li>
            <li> Nice durable packaging and all the different selections of colors with high quality makeup at a good price cant beat that.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be bigger. It needs a better presentation, perhaps along side of some kind of scale like a ruler.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister as a gift and as far as I can tell she loves it. Arrived on time. Perfect size and the product looked just like the picture.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, nice complete box and small enough to fit in handbag. It&#x27;s cute to look at, I like it</li>
            <li> make up was easy to apply and stayed on well the colors were beautiful the make up was long lasting.</li>
            <li> this is a great make up kit. the make up itself is a little cheap but for the price, it was so worth it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece for Christmas and she loved it.  She&#x27;s just now starting to use makeup so it was a nice set to get her started.</li>
            <li> These is a great makeup set!!!!</li>
            <li> nice very happy , i choose because is my favorite, i like to much and i recommende 100 porcent .</li>
            <li> This arrived completely broken to the point everything was busted, including the actual kit. The only thing I can use is the eye shadow palate because it&#x27;s the only thing that came undamaged.</li>
            <li> Auntie was a hit! Bought this for my niece as a gift! She is having so much fun with it! :)</li>
            <li> It was a present for someone else but she sent me a picture when she got it and it looked exactly as the picture.</li>
            <li> I great how much they fit in to this tiny thing, and its just the right size for me to take it anywhere.</li>
            <li> this picture is misleading, its not that big and not a lot to it for the price! its ok though.</li>
            <li> My niece was very excited to get this kit as a Christmas gift.  It&#x27;s a nice presentation with lots of colors for her to try.  It&#x27;s a nice package with most of the basics and lots of versatility.  The makeups are high quality.  None were broken or damaged upon arrival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are sheer, which (in my opinion) is appropriate for a teen.  A second application adds depth to the color without being too crazy.  It has staying power (though not waterproof) and washes off with mild makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package is slightly smaller than I expected.  It&#x27;s about six inches long and four inches wide.  It&#x27;s a good size for a backpack or a large purse.  The top clicks into the sliding drawer so that it stays securely closed.</li>
            <li> it is very nice, i got it as a present, but it doesn&#x27;t withstand much weight on top of it or being pressed into small spaces, and the drawer on the bottom slides open really easily.</li>
            <li> When I saw how cheap this set was, i was a little curious as to it&#x27;s quality. I only had little money, but needed some new makeup. I ordered this and was very surprised when it showed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality to the eyeshadows, and all the other makeup on the palette is above average. The powder is for a very light skin tone, which luckily for me, I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&#x27;t have a light skin tone though, you can still enjoy all of the rest of the kit. Plus, if you don&#x27;t have a light skin tone, you can use the light powder as a highlighter above the eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do suggest is to invest in a brush kit, you can get one on here fairly cheap and you won&#x27;t regret it. The eyeshadow applicators in the kit are fine, but I prefer brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for a quality kit with plenty of makeup in a compact size. I would recommend it to anyone as the color palette on here is pretty vast in colors.</li>
            <li> God I love this. Came fast colors are wonderful, may have to do second coat with some colors if you like the dark look but 2 thumbs up from me</li>
            <li> arrived on time. And my niece loves it has everything she needs. thank you.</li>
            <li> How much can you really say about makeup, yes it looks much bigger on the computer but for hteprice is it good</li>
