            <li>So I&#x27;m happy to have found the aerosol here on Amazon and the price is also excellent!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apart from that it&#x27;s really great</li>
            <li>great results with Binaca.</li>
            <li>Happy to find a place to buy it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and works great just like I remember.</li>
            <li>Ordering online makes it easier to find &amp; price is great.</li>
            <li>Perfect for your purse &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leak around the cap a huge bonus!</li>
            <li>They stopped offering this - love it!</li>
            <li>This spray was so effective that people thought I was chewing gum or eating mint candy</li>
            <li>Love this breath spray its refreshing and tastes great</li>
            <li>Good stuff, easy to carry.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and a very good price with the free shipping.    </li>
            <li>I love Binaca, it reminds me of being a kid in the 90&#x27;s at the mall.  </li>
            <li>I see a hottie coming out of Merry-Go-Round:)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen this for sale in any stores in forever, I used to love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It was just as I remembered, this is the aerosol stuff not just a pump spray like most sprays you see now.  </li>
            <li>The 3 package deal is wonderful: it allows you to keep it in various places ~</li>
            <li>The dispenser is excellent, only one on market that I like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like it was back in the day, and perfect if you don&#x27;t like to chew gum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The flavor of scent is so strong that one time I ate food that contained garlic</li>
            <li>yeah, I would highly suggest this to anyone looking for a great high effective breath spray</li>
            <li>If you just want a quick mint spray this is the product!</li>
            <li>Also you can spray it into a flame and it makes cool fire balls.</li>
            <li>Gives you a great smell if fresh breath when you need it and is useful for when you eat something that had an odd odor.</li>
            <li>If your in a public place and around a lot of germ carriers, this can help keep you from catching their illness.</li>
            <li>keeping your breath fresh.</li>
            <li>The price was right and the delivery was prompt.  </li>
            <li>is that it doesn&#x27;t have any hook or thing to be able to put it in a keychain or key holder</li>
            <li>It does exactly what you expect it to do.</li>
            <li>Sadly, many places only carry the junk in the plastic pump.  </li>
            <li>A single spray lasts roughly an hour and tastes great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also really portable that you can carry it to everywhere</li>
            <li>Highly recommend ...</li>
            <li>This is the only breath spray that works consistently for me and lasts throughout a meeting or event.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t spray it directly on your tongue.</li>
            <li>I used to use this when I was younger and cannot find in any stores anymore where I live.  </li>
            <li>Quick, spray a few blasts in your mouth....</li>
            <li>after spraying in mouth, have a longer experience with taste, no other spray does this.</li>

            <li> This spray was so effective that people thought I was chewing gum or eating mint candy&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even landed it to someone to use for a &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that I use this a lot, but it also lasted at least a month and two weeks&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also really portable that you can carry it to everywhere you go&lt;br /&gt;What I may dislike about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have any hook or thing to be able to put it in a keychain or key holder&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that it&#x27;s really great&lt;br /&gt;The flavor of scent is so strong that one time I ate food that contained garlic and I sprayed this afterwards&lt;br /&gt;No one could tell I ate something that had garlic in it&lt;br /&gt;Also I might say it has a little surgery aftertaste&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t worry&lt;br /&gt;You get used to it once you use it more&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, I would highly suggest this to anyone looking for a great high effective breath spray</li>
            <li> Some very good breath spray. A single spray lasts roughly an hour and tastes great. Very convenient and a very good price with the free shipping.    The only drawback is when placing the bottle in your jean pocket lint and fibers get underneath the cap and have to be cleaned out with each use.</li>
            <li> after spraying in mouth, have a longer experience with taste, no other spray does this. great results with Binaca. trouble finding product in stores because they quit selling the product. Happy to find a place to buy it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, easy to carry.</li>
            <li> I love Binaca, it reminds me of being a kid in the 90&#x27;s at the mall.  Quick, spray a few blasts in your mouth....I see a hottie coming out of Merry-Go-Round:)</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you expect it to do. Gives you a great smell if fresh breath when you need it and is useful for when you eat something that had an odd odor.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years but it has become difficult to find locally.  Also, I only like this Binaca spray as it has alcohol in it that I use to spray my throat when I feel a cold trying to set in.  If your in a public place and around a lot of germ carriers, this can help keep you from catching their illness. I also use it if anyone in my home gets sick and it seems to frequentally keep me from catching their colds.&lt;br /&gt;There is another binaca spray that comes in a plastic cylinder and is a pump instead of aerosol.  It lacks the germ fighting capabilities and is garbage in my opionion.  Sadly, many places only carry the junk in the plastic pump.  So I&#x27;m happy to have found the aerosol here on Amazon and the price is also excellent!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen this for sale in any stores in forever, I used to love this stuff.  It was just as I remembered, this is the aerosol stuff not just a pump spray like most sprays you see now.  came in a 3pack.  Flavor is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I was younger and cannot find in any stores anymore where I live.  It&#x27;s compact and works great just like I remember.</li>
            <li> It does what you want it to do- keeping your breath fresh. Not much else can be said about it. Just don&#x27;t spray it directly on your tongue. It burns.</li>
            <li> Great product! Use it daily! Highly recommend ... The 3 package deal is wonderful: it allows you to keep it in various places ~ the car, your bag, the house ...</li>
            <li> The best breath spray on the market.  The dispenser is excellent, only one on market that I like.</li>
            <li> Recommend Bianca breath spray to everyone.  I keep one in my purse, car, &amp; home. Ordering online makes it easier to find &amp; price is great.</li>
            <li> I always look for binaca in stores and can never find it anywhere, but i knew i would find it on here. It&#x27;s just like it was back in the day, and perfect if you don&#x27;t like to chew gum.</li>
            <li> The product was NOT the one I ordered.  Received DIET Peppermint Binaca Breath Spray.&lt;br /&gt;So the product I ordered was NOT the one I received.  I hate DIET products.&lt;br /&gt;It does not taste the same in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this breath spray its refreshing and tastes great and it also works. Also you can spray it into a flame and it makes cool fire balls.</li>
            <li> If you just want a quick mint spray this is the product! Perfect for your purse &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leak around the cap a huge bonus!</li>
            <li> I cannot find this product in my local stores and amazon bailed me out once again.  The price was right and the delivery was prompt.  This is the only breath spray that works consistently for me and lasts throughout a meeting or event.</li>
            <li> This was the best value - not even Walmart could give me this! They stopped offering this - love it!</li>
