            <li>I think this is so adorable</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush holder for many reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>More sanitary than placing a toothbrush in a toothbrush holder cup.</li>
            <li>I ordered this cute toothbrush holder that I can put up on the mirror</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to worry about their toothbrush getting knocked out and into the trash bin by accident :).  </li>
            <li>(OK, well, almost never).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This little thing is so cute in my bathroom and fits my toothbrush perfectly.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush holder is absolutely adorable, and works perfectly to keep my toothbrush attached firmly to my bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li>The snap in snap out feature is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The girls are into Hello Kitty and they can easily take their toothbrush in/out with no problem.  </li>
            <li>And the suction is really strong.</li>

            <li>quickly and work well!</li>
            <li>easy to clean (</li>
            <li>I was so excited to when I received my package in the mail today.  </li>
            <li>I also have this in the pinkbunny suit and I love both of the holders very much.&lt;br /&gt;Great for HK lovers!</li>
            <li>This is so cute and very functional!  </li>
            <li>It has helped keep the sink area clean.  </li>
            <li>love these so much</li>
            <li>If you are a big HK fan like I am, you will enjoy this adorable toothbrush holder.</li>
            <li>My daughter enjoys it very much.</li>
            <li>The body flips open easily just by twisting the toothbrush handle out and snaps close by tapping either side so very easy to do that one handed which is important when you&#x27;re dealing with an active toddler at bedtime.</li>
            <li>The first opening is the hardest, but after that it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>Sour cute!</li>
            <li>This has held up very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>not that you need to very often)&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Suction holds really well.</li>
            <li>Sticks very well to my tiled bathroom walls.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely adorable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted something that can hold their tootbrush but not by the sink in a cup because we don&#x27;t have much space around the sink and they end up getting knocked out all the time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Incidentally, it took my 3-year old son about 10 seconds to figure out how to &amp;#34;break it&amp;#34; -- but the pieces do snap back together fairly easily (unless of course the plastic is really cracked).</li>
            <li>This is a REALLY cute little toothbrush holder.</li>
            <li>and we noticed they had these cute little toothbrush holders.</li>
            <li>If you have a small bathroom and need to save space, or if you just like cute, unconventional things, then I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
            <li>We have a granite bath so even with a scrub down and alcohol to wipe clean, the suctions don&#x27;t stay put.</li>
            <li>I ordered this toothbrush holder because I love Hello Kitty and pandas, and a combination of the two was hard to resist.  </li>
            <li>So far has not came off since the day I put it on.</li>
            <li>For some reason it looked like it would be big from the ad picture but its actually really small and cute.</li>
            <li>It was bigger than i expected for a toothbrush cap, but well worth it.</li>

            <li> This toothbrush holder is absolutely adorable, and works perfectly to keep my toothbrush attached firmly to my bathroom mirror. It opens and closes very easily, and seems like it will be easy to clean as well. My only issue is the fact that every time I hang my toothbrush up, water drips down the mirror. Still...totally a sacrifice I&#x27;m willing to make to have this adorable/awesome Hello Kitty toothbrush holder! :D</li>
            <li> I was so excited to when I received my package in the mail today.  I love how quickly it came but when I opened the box it wasn&#x27;t even a Hello Kitty tooth brush holder.  It was just a regular panda one.  I was very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Sticks on my mirror well! So far has not came off since the day I put it on. Sour cute!</li>
            <li> The tooth-brush holder is cute and works well after installation.  The first opening is the hardest, but after that it works like a charm.  I would recommend the hold to panda fanatics like myself.</li>
            <li> This is the cutest toothbrush holder I have ever seen. I love Hello Kitty and I love pandas, so this is absolutely perfect for me. Hard for me to open in the beginning but then I realized that all you need to do is pull on your toothbrush to open it. It sticks perfectly to my bathroom wall and is a cute accent piece. You will not regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> This has held up very good.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s easy to clean ( not that you need to very often)&lt;br /&gt;and it just hangs there on my mirror it never fell off&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s suuuuuuuuuuuper cute!! &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;would deffo buy more!</li>
            <li> Slightly bigger than our non hello kitty panda but it works great. Comes apart for cleaning, but doesn&#x27;t fall apart with use. Suction holds really well.</li>
            <li> Super cute! If you are a big HK fan like I am, you will enjoy this adorable toothbrush holder. My daughter enjoys it very much.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold my toddler&#x27;s toothbrush in the bath. We have a granite bath so even with a scrub down and alcohol to wipe clean, the suctions don&#x27;t stay put. Every night we hear a &#x27;crash&#x27; of the panda Hello Kitty and her toothbrush falling down. I think this is so adorable but the suctions just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Functional, durable and cute!</li>
            <li> Very cute item and wanted to have for a work toothbrush.It feel apart the first day I used it and was unable to put back together :(</li>

            <li> I love this toothbrush holder for many reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s absolutely adorable.&lt;br /&gt;2. More sanitary than placing a toothbrush in a toothbrush holder cup. Say goodbye to moldy toothbrush bottoms!&lt;br /&gt;3. The vents on the sides allow for the toothbrush to dry properly.&lt;br /&gt;4. The snap in snap out feature is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I love these so much I bought one for everyone in the family. You should too!</li>
            <li> I also have this in the pinkbunny suit and I love both of the holders very much.&lt;br /&gt;Great for HK lovers!</li>
            <li> Sticks to my mirror well. Use it for my Oral B electric toothbrush head. Cute and works well!</li>
            <li> My daughters will leave their tootbrush lying by the sink.  I wanted something that can hold their tootbrush but not by the sink in a cup because we don&#x27;t have much space around the sink and they end up getting knocked out all the time.  I ordered this cute toothbrush holder that I can put up on the mirror and we love it!  The girls are into Hello Kitty and they can easily take their toothbrush in/out with no problem.  And the best thing is that it doesn&#x27;t take space on the counter so I don&#x27;t have to worry about their toothbrush getting knocked out and into the trash bin by accident :).  The price is great for the function it does.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> And these are a great way to get the kids engaged in brushing, and they NEVER forget to put their toothbrushes away.  (OK, well, almost never).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, it took my 3-year old son about 10 seconds to figure out how to &amp;#34;break it&amp;#34; -- but the pieces do snap back together fairly easily (unless of course the plastic is really cracked).</li>
            <li> so my roommate and I were watching some video on YouTube with some of our fave kpop girls going about their lives and we noticed they had these cute little toothbrush holders. theirs were just regular animals though. so we went online to find some because its a cute idea, and i don&#x27;t care what age you are... you are never too old for cute things!! anyways came across hello kitty&#x27;s line of toothbrush holders and my inner fangirl had to have it!&lt;br /&gt;shipped quickly and work well!</li>
            <li> Sticks to the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Holds my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s adorable. It MUST be hung on a mirror, though. It will not stick to tile. Also, sometimes one of the sides will come off if I&#x27;m not careful, but they slide back into place with a little pressure.</li>
            <li> This little thing is so cute in my bathroom and fits my toothbrush perfectly. And the suction is really strong. No problems!</li>
            <li> very nice and funny holder. Quality is also good.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrush holder because I love Hello Kitty and pandas, and a combination of the two was hard to resist.  I was worried that the suction cups may not work, but once I stuck her on the mirror, she stayed and has not fallen once.  If you have a small bathroom and need to save space, or if you just like cute, unconventional things, then I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
            <li> AWESOME. This is so cute and very functional!  The suction is very strong and has not fallen off of my bathroom mirror.  A great way to protect my toothbrush from poo-poo particles.</li>
            <li> It was bigger than i expected for a toothbrush cap, but well worth it. Plus the suction cups make it easy for a locker, mirror, or shower placement!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> My kids had to get this after a friend of ours had it.  It has helped keep the sink area clean.  They love it.</li>
