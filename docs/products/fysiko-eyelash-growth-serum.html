            <li>I am truly impressed with Fysiko Eyelash Growth Serum</li>
            <li>Works great for eyebrows too!!</li>
            <li>and you have to figure out how to best apply it to your lashes with one of your eyeliner brushes.</li>
            <li>It &#x27;s the best lash enhancer and growth serum I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Great deal for the price!</li>
            <li>I tried this product and after a month of using it my eyelashes have doubled, I even use it on my lower lids and it&#x27;s awesome, I have lashes growing in spots that havent exsisted inYEARS...</li>
            <li>Buy this product and you will be happy, it is wonderful and it did not cause any irritation to my eyes or eye area</li>
            <li>I ordered Fysiko after reading great reviews online and on their website.</li>
            <li>, my friends use it and the results are great.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the results I’ve seen</li>
            <li>Shipping and service was great.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say those are filling in too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great results.</li>
            <li>All it takes is patience and you will be happy with the results.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve never been great and after that i lost almost all of them.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Their website is loaded with great before and after pictures.</li>
            <li>I still think this is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are filling in very nicely and I no longer need any brow definer or brow powder, and my eyelashes are darker and thicker.  </li>
            <li>but If you are wiling to wait it out the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>Now I have beautiful and healthy eyelashes!</li>
            <li>Either way I am very pleased with the results, have experienced zero side effects and will continue to use the serum.</li>
            <li>loved that</li>
            <li>Everything I read was good</li>
            <li>but the ends of the existing lashes are so fair that I won&#x27;t be getting rid of my mascara anytime soon.</li>
            <li>Happy with the product :-)</li>
            <li>So, I invested, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>This was a worthwhile purchase!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I do not have that kind of time</li>
            <li>Where they were thinning to almost nothing, they are a nice line that doesn&#x27;t need any pencil.</li>
            <li>it is equally effective on eyebrows.</li>
            <li>so I decided to test it and write my own review.</li>
            <li>Sure she&#x27;ll be thrilled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied w my purchase..</li>
            <li>Now I know better.</li>
            <li>Most of all, I love not having to wear mascara</li>
            <li>sure how to link to it,</li>
            <li>I love this product and have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li>They are longer, fuller and more noticeable.</li>
            <li>The best part about Fysiko Eyelash Growth Serum is that it actually works!Love this product!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results of [[ASIN:B0086I34UG Fysiko Eyelash Growth Serum]].</li>
            <li>Okay so I kinda love it.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes look much better too.</li>
            <li>I will see if it gets better in the coming months.</li>
            <li>I took the risk to take this chance, I&#x27;m glad, it work for me.</li>
            <li>do not know if applying the serum twice a day would have produce better results.</li>
            <li>It’s stated that too many applications may cause irritation.</li>
            <li>so it is certainly safe to use.</li>
            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>I think water would have worked better in growing longer eyelahes.</li>
            <li>I had hoped to see more improvement by this stage for the price, but maybe I still need to give it more time and consistency.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I did, and it looks a lot more balanced then compared to just applying it to the top lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I totally love it.</li>
            <li>By the time my product ran out, my eyelashes were touching my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please let me know if you found this review helpful and feel free to comment if you have any questions!</li>
            <li>I was about to quit using it, but I am glad I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>This serum lengthened my lashes by 1/3 to 1/2 more than they were.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t get the effect of more lashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Latisse and it didn&#x27;t take many days to decide this was no Latisse.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing this product again for sure.</li>
            <li>Fysiko Eyelash Serum customers\\&quot; on the top</li>
            <li>Obviously I am pleased and repurchased.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Had OK results.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>and I am really pleased.</li>
            <li>After 16 weeks I can honestly say, I have significantly longer eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I started to look into Fysiko and was happy to find out that their eyelash serum is made in USA with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>eyelashes seem stronger and don&#x27;t fall out as easily as before&lt;</li>
            <li>When I first got it, I right away loved how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>I don’t know who said it first, but this definitely says it best – “What you don’t see is what you get.”  </li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>While I am satisfied with he results of both of the products, I&#x27;m back to get the Fysiko for the amazing length it gave me!</li>
            <li>BUT it was nice that he at least saw them! :D</li>
            <li>anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge fan of the Fysiko Eyelash Serum.  </li>
            <li>Product is touted as a &#x27;natural and amazing serum&#x27; &amp; I believe many are suckered in by the price  - believing</li>
            <li>Now after 16 weeks I can genuinely see the difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It says \\&quot;read genuine reviews of</li>
            <li>but after using Fysiko, my left eye&#x27;s lashes started curving up and getting longer which looks great.  </li>
            <li>Only two responded, but they both said they had great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took about a year, but my lashes have filled in.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was not born with beautiful long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are fair, so results are more noticeable after I put mascara on, but my eyelashes are definitely thicker and significantly longer than they used to be.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the type to use stuff like this, but the difference is significant and brightens my face quite a bit--it&#x27;s definitely worth the long-term investment, and I will be buying more.  </li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please let me know if you found this review helpful and feel free to comment if you have any questions!atisfied with he results of both of the products, I&#x27;m back to get the Fysiko for the amazing length it gave me!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>To say I was excited when offered the opportunity to test and review</li>
            <li>Makes the price more reasonable!</li>
            <li>At this point my lashes are significantly longer than when I started using the product</li>
            <li>I read many positive reviews however my experience was a lot of irritation.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice more lashes or thicker lashes; but they certainly were longer.</li>
            <li>To be honest, and I mean very honest, I noticed results within four days.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really hoping to see a lot more after 16 weeks.</li>
            <li>I much prefer Lil Lash, which must have more of the growth ingredient.  </li>
            <li>There was a comment about it on their Facebook website and I checked to see if it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I have used many eyelash serums and they all seem to work some better than others revitalash advanced gave my super long lashes and a six month supply is about $75.</li>
            <li>Luckily there is more product in the tube than with the prescription lash product so it will still last a couple more months</li>
            <li>and it last for several months and best of all IT WORKS!</li>
            <li>I found this really frustrating and felt like it wasn&#x27;t as effective this way, so I loved that my Fysiko serum came with a built in brush that worked FANTASTICALLY for applying the right amount to the right part of the lasH, so that you get the most bang for your buck!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE my new eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It is recommended that once you are satisfied with your lash length to maintain the appearance of your new eyelashes you should continue using the product 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>The price scared me a bit, but I thought hey, if it really does work (and it does!!)</li>
            <li>I recently (a few months ago) started using Revitalash and find that I saw my first results MUCH quicker (within 7-10 days) than either the Fysiko or the Latisse, but the long-term results are not as impressive as either product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>That one works great, my lashes are darker, fuller and a little bit longer.  </li>
            <li>In a few weeks I noticed great results.</li>
            <li>I think it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>And I guess it proves that this stuff works.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth that price.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>As far as my eyebrows, more of them grew in, and the color became darker, but they didn&#x27;t get much longer, which is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look like Latisse super long, but it is a good improvement so far.</li>
            <li>Curious to see how much better they will get!  </li>
            <li>My lashes really did grow!</li>
            <li>The first sign was the darkening of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>As much as I would like to lash out, it just didn’t seem worth it.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and lasts longer than it says...!</li>
            <li>Wow this product is fantastic, within 1 week I noticed results.</li>
            <li>and I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li>but you won&#x27;t see the results in the first month and</li>
            <li>Latisse is only about $20 more and that is the route I will be going.  </li>
            <li>I never used under eye concealer on a regular basis before using this, and since I ran out of Fysiko, I&#x27;ve been able to stop using the concealer.</li>
            <li>You know I find it funny when reviews relay, and freq, a time frame of  &#x27;16 wks etc to see results&#x27; or  &#x27;</li>
            <li>3- 6 mos before you see growth&#x27; - this tips me off that they&#x27;re fabricated Most of the products I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>and I am still using that first tube.</li>
            <li>They are definitely longer and there are more lashes.</li>
            <li>YOU GET 2 THUMBS UP FROM ME... but do know that you have to use it twice a day and be consistent with it.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR $!!!!</li>
            <li>For my right eye&#x27;s lashes, it just grew straight out</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is made with natural ingredients, I have extremely sensitive skin and did not experience any irritation at all.</li>
            <li>next the top pictures to make you believe the picture was taken of some real customer&#x27;s eye.</li>
            <li>My experience with it says you won&#x27;t notice much difference until 8 weeks of CONSISTENT use.</li>
            <li>Fysiko is much better.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer accused all positive reviewers of being affiliated with Fysiko.  </li>
            <li>You know it works when new baby growth is gray!!  </li>
            <li>would&#x27;ve had doubts, but I had fine hairs growing on my inner and outer corners of my eye on the bottom that were never there before.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation or really even notice it was there.</li>
            <li>It really does work.  </li>
            <li>and with mascara on - people often ask if my eyelashes are real.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants longer, thicker eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, but I am really liking it and am going to get a tube for my sister for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making it easier for me and thanks for those leaving some review.</li>
            <li>I had real doubts about this product.</li>
            <li>I started using it in August, and noticed real growth in 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>and hopefully I will see a real difference.</li>
            <li>and so I thought I would share that the product has performed very well for me.  </li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t really noticeable to others.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are now so much thicker and even a bit</li>
            <li>because they got so much thicker and darkened up some, I did find I could just curl my eyelashes for the day and leave the house without mascara, but I&#x27;m a mascara girl</li>
            <li>I have very sparse eyelashes and have always considered trying Latisse.</li>
            <li>bottom line is … the stuff really works.</li>
            <li>So, fast forward two months.</li>
            <li>That was when I started to really see the results that I wanted from the get go.</li>
            <li>I had eyelash extention and my real eyelashes were damaged a lot.</li>
            <li>I have tried cheaper eyelash serums and they either did not work as well or irritated my eyes too much.  </li>
            <li>Fysiko eyelash serum really does the trick for me.  </li>
            <li>so my lashes grow straight out instead of curving up</li>
            <li>They actually even list the ingredients and are very open and honest about what is in their product, which I</li>
            <li>My short, stubby eyelashes never really bothered me since I would just slap some mascara on and call it good.</li>
            <li>The only reason I chose Fysiko over Latisse at the time is because I was under the impression that it would cost far more to get a prescription for Latisse.</li>
            <li>Also, my eyelids turned a copper tint, which I believe is supposed to be a side-effect, but I thought it looked like I put eyeshadow on everyday and complimented me nicely.</li>
            <li>I had some good luck with RapidLash (which took about 10 weeks to see longer lashes but at least after a month</li>
            <li>I was excited enough to use it every day!  </li>
            <li>I have no affiliation or connection to Fysiko other than as a legitimate, pleased customer....</li>
            <li>Less is more.</li>
            <li>It has been almost 5 weeks, and my lashes are a lot thicker and a decent amount longer.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading all the reviews on Makeup Alley and it sounded like Fysiko (in spite of the high price tag) was the closest eyelash serum to Latisse</li>
            <li>I have now been using this serum for a little over 6 weeks and am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>My eyes lashes are long and full</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I wanted to share my experience with Fysiko.  </li>
            <li>I now have long, full eyelashes</li>
            <li>Of course they were barely noticeable, but enough for me to get excited over.</li>
            <li>Now, do you think their other reviews are genuine?</li>
            <li>Nice for long lashes, but not worth the side effect.</li>
            <li>so I naturally still used it!</li>
            <li>so I cut back to every other day which it helped my eyes much better.  </li>
            <li>no longer struggle to look alive!  </li>
            <li>Then after about 5 weeks I noticed lots of new lashes growing in, completely covering the bald spots and making my lashes appear fuller.</li>
            <li>And I went on to use it another 8 weeks (16 total) to reach my full potential.</li>
            <li>I find that my eyelashes are much thicker than they were with Fysiko but not nearly as long!</li>
            <li>I mean, my eyes are pretty darn important to me</li>
            <li>They are certainly longer &amp; thicker in this very short time.  </li>
            <li>All of the gaps from the missing eyelashes were filled in completely</li>
            <li>This serum is all natural and did not cause me any eye irratation or redness.  </li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin and eyes.  </li>
            <li>As far as the product reviewers who gave this product one star, please note that none of them used this product for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>As far as the product reviewers who gave this product one star, please note that none of them used this product for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any difference so far with product use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for  4 wks and the benefits I&#x27;d garnered from another eyelash serum have been completely reversed .</li>
            <li>I bought the serum directly from the company-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 6 weeks</li>
            <li>was doing lash extensions and all the technicians would tell me how short and straight my lashes are.  </li>
            <li>Fysiko claims to be all natural though, but no information about their ingredients on their website either.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;ll last her the whole year.</li>
            <li>They definitely didn&#x27;t appear as long or as full.  </li>
            <li>do you know how lucky you are to have such long eyelashes?\\&quot; and I looked at him and said;</li>
            <li>not sure if it&#x27;s better than revitalash which is half the price of course true results take about four months if you use it regularly.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re blonde, so I wear mascara, but I used to wear three coats of it to have them look halfway decent.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice the difference in length and the thickness of my eyelash for a long time, about 5-6 months.  </li>
            <li>started using the Fysiko Eyelash Serum right away and quickly became addicted.</li>
            <li>I did get a little red line above my eyelashes, but easily covered it w/concealer.  </li>
            <li>I originally started using Fysiko after most of my eyelashes fell out from a bad experience with eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li>I had some bald spots in my lashes and they were generally sparse.  </li>
            <li>FYSIKO (pronounced [fi-zi-ko&#x27;]) is “natural” in Greek</li>
            <li>When this would happen to me I would stop use for a couple of days, then it would be back to normal shortly, but I found it quite annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I would say there were more eyelashes overall, even though they were thin lashes.</li>
            <li>So far its working, but it is more expensive.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the fact that most of my eyelashes had recently fallen out, my main issue that I have with my eyelashes is that they are very thin and blonde.</li>
            <li>I used it for 2 months straight and had long very long eye lashes, I applied at the bottome lash line too and my lower lashes grew longer too.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes naturally curl upward now, they are so long that I don&#x27;t even have to wear mascara anymore.</li>
            <li>I had a bit of sensitivity to it for the first few days</li>
            <li>For the first few weeks I didn&#x27;t notice anything happening and was beginning to think I had been scammed.</li>
            <li>I love how dark and thick they are.</li>
            <li>Also, I have green eyes and sensitive skin and worried about color change or allergic reactions but because I apply carefully and follow directions, I have had no ill effects or color change at all.</li>
            <li>A few months ago, and to be exact several years prior to that, my eyelashes closely resembled the lashes on my avatar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The active ingredient is: Methylamido Dihydro Noralfaprostal which is found in several cheaper eyelash serums, and I think it is latin for \\&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Their website is loaded with great before and after pictures.</li>
            <li> I still think this is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are filling in very nicely and I no longer need any brow definer or brow powder, and my eyelashes are darker and thicker.  </li>
            <li> but If you are wiling to wait it out the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> Now I have beautiful and healthy eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Either way I am very pleased with the results, have experienced zero side effects and will continue to use the serum.</li>
            <li> loved that</li>
            <li> Everything I read was good</li>
            <li> but the ends of the existing lashes are so fair that I won&#x27;t be getting rid of my mascara anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product :-)</li>
            <li> So, I invested, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> This was a worthwhile purchase!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I do not have that kind of time</li>
            <li> Where they were thinning to almost nothing, they are a nice line that doesn&#x27;t need any pencil.</li>
            <li> it is equally effective on eyebrows.</li>
            <li> so I decided to test it and write my own review.</li>
            <li> Sure she&#x27;ll be thrilled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied w my purchase..</li>
            <li> Now I know better.</li>
            <li> Most of all, I love not having to wear mascara</li>
            <li> sure how to link to it,</li>
            <li> I love this product and have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> They are longer, fuller and more noticeable.</li>
            <li> The best part about Fysiko Eyelash Growth Serum is that it actually works!Love this product!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results of [[ASIN:B0086I34UG Fysiko Eyelash Growth Serum]].</li>
            <li> Okay so I kinda love it.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes look much better too.</li>
            <li> I will see if it gets better in the coming months.</li>
            <li> I took the risk to take this chance, I&#x27;m glad, it work for me.</li>
            <li> do not know if applying the serum twice a day would have produce better results.</li>
            <li> It’s stated that too many applications may cause irritation.</li>
            <li> so it is certainly safe to use.</li>
            <li> I just love it</li>
            <li> I think water would have worked better in growing longer eyelahes.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to see more improvement by this stage for the price, but maybe I still need to give it more time and consistency.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I did, and it looks a lot more balanced then compared to just applying it to the top lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I totally love it.</li>
            <li> By the time my product ran out, my eyelashes were touching my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please let me know if you found this review helpful and feel free to comment if you have any questions!</li>
            <li> I was about to quit using it, but I am glad I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> This serum lengthened my lashes by 1/3 to 1/2 more than they were.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t get the effect of more lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Latisse and it didn&#x27;t take many days to decide this was no Latisse.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this product again for sure.</li>
            <li> Fysiko Eyelash Serum customers\\&quot; on the top</li>
            <li> Obviously I am pleased and repurchased.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Had OK results.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> and I am really pleased.</li>
            <li> After 16 weeks I can honestly say, I have significantly longer eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I started to look into Fysiko and was happy to find out that their eyelash serum is made in USA with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> eyelashes seem stronger and don&#x27;t fall out as easily as before&lt;</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I right away loved how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> I don’t know who said it first, but this definitely says it best – “What you don’t see is what you get.”  </li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> While I am satisfied with he results of both of the products, I&#x27;m back to get the Fysiko for the amazing length it gave me!</li>
            <li> BUT it was nice that he at least saw them! :D</li>
            <li> anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge fan of the Fysiko Eyelash Serum.  </li>
            <li> Product is touted as a &#x27;natural and amazing serum&#x27; &amp; I believe many are suckered in by the price  - believing</li>
            <li> Now after 16 weeks I can genuinely see the difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It says \\&quot;read genuine reviews of</li>
            <li> but after using Fysiko, my left eye&#x27;s lashes started curving up and getting longer which looks great.  </li>
            <li> Only two responded, but they both said they had great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took about a year, but my lashes have filled in.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was not born with beautiful long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are fair, so results are more noticeable after I put mascara on, but my eyelashes are definitely thicker and significantly longer than they used to be.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the type to use stuff like this, but the difference is significant and brightens my face quite a bit--it&#x27;s definitely worth the long-term investment, and I will be buying more.  </li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please let me know if you found this review helpful and feel free to comment if you have any questions!atisfied with he results of both of the products, I&#x27;m back to get the Fysiko for the amazing length it gave me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> To say I was excited when offered the opportunity to test and review</li>
            <li> Makes the price more reasonable!</li>
            <li> At this point my lashes are significantly longer than when I started using the product</li>
            <li> I read many positive reviews however my experience was a lot of irritation.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice more lashes or thicker lashes; but they certainly were longer.</li>
            <li> To be honest, and I mean very honest, I noticed results within four days.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really hoping to see a lot more after 16 weeks.</li>
            <li> I much prefer Lil Lash, which must have more of the growth ingredient.  </li>
            <li> There was a comment about it on their Facebook website and I checked to see if it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I have used many eyelash serums and they all seem to work some better than others revitalash advanced gave my super long lashes and a six month supply is about $75.</li>
            <li> Luckily there is more product in the tube than with the prescription lash product so it will still last a couple more months</li>
            <li> and it last for several months and best of all IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> I found this really frustrating and felt like it wasn&#x27;t as effective this way, so I loved that my Fysiko serum came with a built in brush that worked FANTASTICALLY for applying the right amount to the right part of the lasH, so that you get the most bang for your buck!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE my new eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It is recommended that once you are satisfied with your lash length to maintain the appearance of your new eyelashes you should continue using the product 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> The price scared me a bit, but I thought hey, if it really does work (and it does!!)</li>
            <li> I recently (a few months ago) started using Revitalash and find that I saw my first results MUCH quicker (within 7-10 days) than either the Fysiko or the Latisse, but the long-term results are not as impressive as either product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> That one works great, my lashes are darker, fuller and a little bit longer.  </li>
            <li> In a few weeks I noticed great results.</li>
            <li> I think it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> And I guess it proves that this stuff works.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth that price.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> As far as my eyebrows, more of them grew in, and the color became darker, but they didn&#x27;t get much longer, which is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look like Latisse super long, but it is a good improvement so far.</li>
            <li> Curious to see how much better they will get!  </li>
            <li> My lashes really did grow!</li>
            <li> The first sign was the darkening of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> As much as I would like to lash out, it just didn’t seem worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and lasts longer than it says...!</li>
            <li> Wow this product is fantastic, within 1 week I noticed results.</li>
            <li> and I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t see the results in the first month and</li>
            <li> Latisse is only about $20 more and that is the route I will be going.  </li>
            <li> I never used under eye concealer on a regular basis before using this, and since I ran out of Fysiko, I&#x27;ve been able to stop using the concealer.</li>
            <li> You know I find it funny when reviews relay, and freq, a time frame of  &#x27;16 wks etc to see results&#x27; or  &#x27;</li>
            <li> 3- 6 mos before you see growth&#x27; - this tips me off that they&#x27;re fabricated Most of the products I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> and I am still using that first tube.</li>
            <li> They are definitely longer and there are more lashes.</li>
            <li> YOU GET 2 THUMBS UP FROM ME... but do know that you have to use it twice a day and be consistent with it.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR $!!!!</li>
            <li> For my right eye&#x27;s lashes, it just grew straight out</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is made with natural ingredients, I have extremely sensitive skin and did not experience any irritation at all.</li>
            <li> next the top pictures to make you believe the picture was taken of some real customer&#x27;s eye.</li>
            <li> My experience with it says you won&#x27;t notice much difference until 8 weeks of CONSISTENT use.</li>
            <li> Fysiko is much better.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer accused all positive reviewers of being affiliated with Fysiko.  </li>
            <li> You know it works when new baby growth is gray!!  </li>
            <li> would&#x27;ve had doubts, but I had fine hairs growing on my inner and outer corners of my eye on the bottom that were never there before.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation or really even notice it was there.</li>
            <li> It really does work.  </li>
            <li> and with mascara on - people often ask if my eyelashes are real.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants longer, thicker eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but I am really liking it and am going to get a tube for my sister for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making it easier for me and thanks for those leaving some review.</li>
            <li> I had real doubts about this product.</li>
            <li> I started using it in August, and noticed real growth in 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> and hopefully I will see a real difference.</li>
            <li> and so I thought I would share that the product has performed very well for me.  </li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t really noticeable to others.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are now so much thicker and even a bit</li>
            <li> because they got so much thicker and darkened up some, I did find I could just curl my eyelashes for the day and leave the house without mascara, but I&#x27;m a mascara girl</li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyelashes and have always considered trying Latisse.</li>
            <li> bottom line is … the stuff really works.</li>
            <li> So, fast forward two months.</li>
            <li> That was when I started to really see the results that I wanted from the get go.</li>
            <li> I had eyelash extention and my real eyelashes were damaged a lot.</li>
            <li> I have tried cheaper eyelash serums and they either did not work as well or irritated my eyes too much.  </li>
            <li> Fysiko eyelash serum really does the trick for me.  </li>
            <li> so my lashes grow straight out instead of curving up</li>
            <li> They actually even list the ingredients and are very open and honest about what is in their product, which I</li>
            <li> My short, stubby eyelashes never really bothered me since I would just slap some mascara on and call it good.</li>
            <li> The only reason I chose Fysiko over Latisse at the time is because I was under the impression that it would cost far more to get a prescription for Latisse.</li>
            <li> Also, my eyelids turned a copper tint, which I believe is supposed to be a side-effect, but I thought it looked like I put eyeshadow on everyday and complimented me nicely.</li>
            <li> I had some good luck with RapidLash (which took about 10 weeks to see longer lashes but at least after a month</li>
            <li> I was excited enough to use it every day!  </li>
            <li> I have no affiliation or connection to Fysiko other than as a legitimate, pleased customer....</li>
            <li> Less is more.</li>
            <li> It has been almost 5 weeks, and my lashes are a lot thicker and a decent amount longer.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading all the reviews on Makeup Alley and it sounded like Fysiko (in spite of the high price tag) was the closest eyelash serum to Latisse</li>
            <li> I have now been using this serum for a little over 6 weeks and am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> My eyes lashes are long and full</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I wanted to share my experience with Fysiko.  </li>
            <li> I now have long, full eyelashes</li>
            <li> Of course they were barely noticeable, but enough for me to get excited over.</li>
            <li> Now, do you think their other reviews are genuine?</li>
            <li> Nice for long lashes, but not worth the side effect.</li>
            <li> so I naturally still used it!</li>
            <li> so I cut back to every other day which it helped my eyes much better.  </li>
            <li> no longer struggle to look alive!  </li>
            <li> Then after about 5 weeks I noticed lots of new lashes growing in, completely covering the bald spots and making my lashes appear fuller.</li>
            <li> And I went on to use it another 8 weeks (16 total) to reach my full potential.</li>
            <li> I find that my eyelashes are much thicker than they were with Fysiko but not nearly as long!</li>
            <li> I mean, my eyes are pretty darn important to me</li>
            <li> They are certainly longer &amp; thicker in this very short time.  </li>
            <li> All of the gaps from the missing eyelashes were filled in completely</li>
            <li> This serum is all natural and did not cause me any eye irratation or redness.  </li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin and eyes.  </li>
            <li> As far as the product reviewers who gave this product one star, please note that none of them used this product for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> As far as the product reviewers who gave this product one star, please note that none of them used this product for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference so far with product use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for  4 wks and the benefits I&#x27;d garnered from another eyelash serum have been completely reversed .</li>
            <li> I bought the serum directly from the company-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 6 weeks</li>
            <li> was doing lash extensions and all the technicians would tell me how short and straight my lashes are.  </li>
            <li> Fysiko claims to be all natural though, but no information about their ingredients on their website either.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;ll last her the whole year.</li>
            <li> They definitely didn&#x27;t appear as long or as full.  </li>
            <li> do you know how lucky you are to have such long eyelashes?\\&quot; and I looked at him and said;</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s better than revitalash which is half the price of course true results take about four months if you use it regularly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re blonde, so I wear mascara, but I used to wear three coats of it to have them look halfway decent.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice the difference in length and the thickness of my eyelash for a long time, about 5-6 months.  </li>
            <li> started using the Fysiko Eyelash Serum right away and quickly became addicted.</li>
            <li> I did get a little red line above my eyelashes, but easily covered it w/concealer.  </li>
            <li> I originally started using Fysiko after most of my eyelashes fell out from a bad experience with eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> I had some bald spots in my lashes and they were generally sparse.  </li>
            <li> FYSIKO (pronounced [fi-zi-ko&#x27;]) is “natural” in Greek</li>
            <li> When this would happen to me I would stop use for a couple of days, then it would be back to normal shortly, but I found it quite annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would say there were more eyelashes overall, even though they were thin lashes.</li>
            <li> So far its working, but it is more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that most of my eyelashes had recently fallen out, my main issue that I have with my eyelashes is that they are very thin and blonde.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 months straight and had long very long eye lashes, I applied at the bottome lash line too and my lower lashes grew longer too.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes naturally curl upward now, they are so long that I don&#x27;t even have to wear mascara anymore.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of sensitivity to it for the first few days</li>
            <li> For the first few weeks I didn&#x27;t notice anything happening and was beginning to think I had been scammed.</li>
            <li> I love how dark and thick they are.</li>
            <li> Also, I have green eyes and sensitive skin and worried about color change or allergic reactions but because I apply carefully and follow directions, I have had no ill effects or color change at all.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, and to be exact several years prior to that, my eyelashes closely resembled the lashes on my avatar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is: Methylamido Dihydro Noralfaprostal which is found in several cheaper eyelash serums, and I think it is latin for \\&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were still long, but after a while, I was never able to achieve the same lengths that I had during my first 6-12 months of use.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were still long, but after a while, I was never able to achieve the same lengths that I had during my first 6-12 months of use.</li>
            <li> which will be a very,very long time since you use such a tiny amount each time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am at a point now where I no longer need an eyelash curler which is something I thought I would always need to use as they usually stick straight out, but they are curling up in addition to getting longer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use any hormone-based serums that give the effect only as long as you use them, so I decided on this one.</li>
            <li> I loved that I could use it everyday (and did almost every single day of the 4 month trial) and never got weird puffy redness, or anything that made me feel like i should stop using it for a few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fysiko is also made with natural ingredients so you can feel better about using it, and this may be why I never got any weird eyelid side effects like I have had with other brands.</li>
            <li> I think Fysiko actually paid others to write those reviews because the product sucks so much.</li>
            <li> As you might expect, not only was I lacking in the eyelash department, but my eyebrows have been missing in action for almost 30 years.  </li>
            <li> My husband has long eyelashes, my two sons have long curly lashes and my daughter has Minnie Mouse’s lashes.  </li>
            <li> I even had to cut some of my eyelashes  because it grew out too long that it touched my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My lases are ridiculously long.  </li>
            <li> with long eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps it took longer because I was using the product every other day and also I am an Asian.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about it changing my eye color like with some other similar products.</li>
            <li> The package says it takes 4 months of continuous use to see the end results; I can&#x27;t wait to see how long my eyelashes will be by then!</li>
            <li> Aside from my grandmother, I can’t think of a single woman who wouldn’t want longer lashes!</li>
            <li> I will use it until it is gone just because of the 100 bucks I flushed down the toilet.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair with blond eyelashes and a few bald spots after an unfortunate late night incident with fake eyelash glue last Halloween.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised about these negative comments here...</li>
            <li> was surprised to see there were negative reviews here.  </li>
            <li> and, my lashes did not grow as much as I expected.</li>
            <li> but my lashes never really fall.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged my eyelashes have thinned and gotten lighter.</li>
            <li> I expected NOTHING.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO change in my eyelashes, or eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Have tried this product for 5 weeks, and have seen absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> I received mine on 10/4/12 and have been using it everyday but only in the morning since I tend to forget about it at night.  </li>
            <li> It took a little longer because my lashes are naturally stubby, short, and thin.</li>
            <li> It is pricey for such a small thing -</li>
            <li> some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past, I found that a lot of them would leave a red puffy mark around your eyelids after continued use.</li>
            <li> which is not exactly what I wanted in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This compares extremely well &amp; may even exceed the other.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, too.  </li>
            <li> I sadly had to stop getting them because my eyelashes were becoming so weak from the extensions.  </li>
            <li> I actually prefer it because I don&#x27;t have to wear eyeliner hardly at all</li>
            <li> It did help my lashes grow, but it gave me dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I needed something and latisse causes dark lines on my eyes, so that wasn&#x27;t an option.  </li>
            <li> It was somewhat expensive but lasts a long time and being natural</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t waste applicators with each use, which is a plus or minus depending on how you feel about it.</li>
            <li> I fear it is money down the drain.[[ASIN:B0086I34UG Fysiko Eyelash Growth Serum]]</li>
            <li> then all I have to lose is wearing less eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for half a year</li>
            <li> My friend recommended me this product about half a year ago</li>
            <li> I have less lashes now than I have had in years .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, It expensive</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product because it is the least irritating of all that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 6 months now and my lashes are longer and a little thicker than what they were.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if one or the other caused grown</li>
            <li> When I decided to try Fysiko I was a little hesitant.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes might be a little darker, but Latisse has made them grow longer than Fysiko did</li>
            <li> My eyes started to itch a little</li>
            <li> Her long, very thick, dark eyelashes sold me and I decided to give Latisse a shot.</li>
            <li> I’ve thought about wearing fake eyelashes in order to fit in, but they always look a little TOO fake.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I noticed that my eyelashes seemed to be longer and darker.</li>
            <li> few things I have noticed...</li>
            <li> I am still using it a few times a week and will continue to do so until my supply runs out (</li>
            <li> I started seeing results after just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> After about 3-4 weeks I noticed a few of them getting longer</li>
            <li> It does, however, burn if it gets in your eyes, leaving them red and tired looking.</li>
            <li> I wonder about the bad reviews if maybe you didn&#x27;t get a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; tube - in which case you are right the company should do something about that.  </li>
            <li> My tip to anyone who buys this is to apply it 1-3 times a day, and to delicately trace it along your lower lid line if you want to see longer lashes down there too.</li>
            <li> not sure if it is my imagination, but maybe they are jealous of the eyelashes</li>
            <li> I have to tweeze them out, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> But, besides the fact that a prescription is needed for that one, I&#x27;d heard about some rather disturbing side effects associated with it such as permanent darkening of your eye color.</li>
            <li> It is an expensive product only to trick us into believing it is a legit product.</li>
            <li> I could have bought a years worth of that for what this worthless stuff costs.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it faithfully every evening for the past three weeks.  </li>
            <li> I picked 3 Fysiko \\&quot;friends\\&quot; randomly and sent them a private message.  </li>
            <li> I use to have false lashes, I do it every day or other day to replace it.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any eye irritation or dark coloring as also mentioned in the products warning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what are all the negative reviews about.</li>
            <li> I slowly started noticing  a difference in my eyelashes after about 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am slowly seeing progress.</li>
            <li> You seriously have to have patience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, buy this if you&#x27;re seriously thinking about it, because it&#x27;s literally Miracle-Gro for the eyes.</li>
            <li> I wish there was way folks could have some sort of recourse when cheated out of their hard earned money !.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used latisse in the past but it became to expensive to keep up with</li>
            <li> I was one of those dumb people duped by this product.</li>
            <li> I opted for a pricier product in the hopes of growing my weak and frail lashes.</li>
            <li> Trust me, if you wait until at least week four, they&#x27;ll start coming in!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are thin and weak with bald spots.  </li>
            <li> When i started using this, my lashes were so thin</li>
            <li> My eyelash color did not change at all and my eyelashes were just as thin as they had always been.</li>
            <li> But now, I no longer use false lashes anymore since my lash grown.</li>
            <li> One of them even thought I was wearing false</li>
            <li> What I expected was to feel like an idiot for believing in yet another product that didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27; - unfortunately in this instance I was screwed twice - bilked out a substantive amount of money and given false hope that the  product would make a difference ; it does not.</li>
            <li> When I say it doesn&#x27;t work,I mean it doesn&#x27;t work at all!!</li>
            <li> I put a little on the base of my lashes (like liquid eyeliner) twice a day and began seeing a change by week 3 and now they are the longest and thickest they have ever been.</li>
            <li> and there was no way I was going to put some random chemical on my eyelids just to get thicker eyelashes.</li>
            <li> When I wear mascara I have had people ask me if I am wearing fake eyelashes-</li>
            <li> I see this product from now on warning people not to spend the time and MONEY on this useless product.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of bald spots before from fake lashes and the overuse of mascara  after using it for 6 months there are no longer any bald spots.</li>
            <li> I used my Fysiko eyelash growth serum, I never experienced this problem!</li>

            <li> I was afraid the product wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments and sometimes people would ask if I&#x27;m even wearing fake lashes!</li>
            <li> /&gt;To tell the truth, they weren’t THAT bad, but if you would have compared my lashes to my family’s; they were basically nonexistent.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It will be a month on 11/21 that I&#x27;ve been using and I do see some difference but I&#x27;m really hoping to see a lot more after 16 weeks.</li>
            <li> My eyes lashes are long and full I have been using it for almost 4 months. I recommend it. I&#x27;m satisfied w my purchase..</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a bit hesitant to try out Fysiko Eyelash Serum. I mean, my eyes are pretty darn important to me and there was no way I was going to put some random chemical on my eyelids just to get thicker eyelashes. So, I started to look into Fysiko and was happy to find out that their eyelash serum is made in USA with all natural ingredients. Whoo hoo! They actually even list the ingredients and are very open and honest about what is in their product, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the Fysiko Eyelash Serum right away and quickly became addicted. It feels like you are just putting water on your lash line and I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation or really even notice it was there. After a few weeks I noticed that my eyelashes seemed to be longer and darker. I thought it might just be wishful thinking, but as I continued to use it, my friends and family began to notice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not born with beautiful long eyelashes. My short, stubby eyelashes never really bothered me since I would just slap some mascara on and call it good. Now I know better. I absolutely LOVE my new eyelashes. I love how dark and thick they are. Most of all, I love not having to wear mascara every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things I have noticed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes are definitely longer, darker and thicker&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes seem stronger and don&#x27;t fall out as easily as before&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows seem to grow back faster after I pluck... not sure if it is my imagination, but maybe they are jealous of the eyelashes LOL!&lt;br /&gt;My upper eyelid is noticeably darker than before.  I read that this is one of the possible side effects.  I actually prefer it because I don&#x27;t have to wear eyeliner hardly at all anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge fan of the Fysiko Eyelash Serum.  I am still using it a few times a week and will continue to do so until my supply runs out (which will be a very,very long time since you use such a tiny amount each time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how to link to it, but I added a picture to the gallery of my results- http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo369PBRI7XUTXM/B0086I34UG/ref&#x3D;cm_ciu_images_pl_linkit, but I added a picture to the gallery of my results- http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo369PBRI7XUTXM/B0086I34UG/ref&#x3D;cm_ciu_images_pl_link</li>
            <li> It really does work.  I have been using it for about a year or so....and with mascara on - people often ask if my eyelashes are real.  It is pricey for such a small thing - so that is the reason for the 4 stars.  I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Because I wear contacts the products says to wait 15-20 minutes if applying in the morning. I do not have that kind of time so I only use this once at night before I go to bed. I have not experienced any eye irritation or dark coloring as also mentioned in the products warning. I have used it for 6 months now and my lashes are longer and a little thicker than what they were. When I wear mascara I have had people ask me if I am wearing fake eyelashes- I love this product and have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 weeks and I have finally started to see results. I&#x27;ve used latisse in the past but it became to expensive to keep up with and, my lashes did not grow as much as I expected. But this product definitely helped with my growth. I have also used this product with the mavala double-lash treatment so I am not sure if one or the other caused grown but I know the combination of both resulted in longer lashes. I do not have eye irritation or redness. I apply this product twice daily and the mavala only at night.</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum for 16 weeks and am majorly impressed. Before using Fysiko Eyelash Growth Serum, my eyelashes were short and sparse.I slowly started noticing  a difference in my eyelashes after about 8 weeks. Now after 16 weeks I can genuinely see the difference in my lashes. They are longer, fuller and more noticeable.I am truly impressed with Fysiko Eyelash Growth Serum I love the fact that it is made with natural ingredients, I have extremely sensitive skin and did not experience any irritation at all. The best part about Fysiko Eyelash Growth Serum is that it actually works!Love this product! Melinda Dunne</li>
            <li> I have been using Fysiko for 16 weeks and it does work.  My lashes are noticably longer and thicker.  I started seeing results after just a few weeks.  It is as simple to use as applying your mascara.  This serum is all natural and did not cause me any eye irratation or redness.  I am pleased with the results of [[ASIN:B0086I34UG Fysiko Eyelash Growth Serum]].</li>
            <li> I received this product to test drive and I didn&#x27;t believe it would work but it definitely does, i am an over tweezer for my brows and within 6 weeks I could see the once bald spots that had quit growing filling out again. Would recommend this highly. I also used it on my lashes to find them coming in thicker, longer and darker.</li>
            <li> Okay so I kinda love it. One week after constant using, I saw difference. After one month, people complimenting on my eyelashes. IT REALLY WORKS!!! I used it for 2 months straight and had long very long eye lashes, I applied at the bottome lash line too and my lower lashes grew longer too. Now I have stopped using it and my lashes start falling out. I dont know if its because of Fysiko but my lashes never really fall. Now that I have stopped, eye lashes are falling, Am I suppose to use it forever? This wouldnt make sense.</li>
            <li> When i started using this, my lashes were so thin and i had been losing them like crazy. I have now been using this serum for a little over 6 weeks and am extremely pleased with the results. I can&#x27;t wait to see the max results at 16 weeks! I put a little on the base of my lashes (like liquid eyeliner) twice a day and began seeing a change by week 3 and now they are the longest and thickest they have ever been. I am at a point now where I no longer need an eyelash curler which is something I thought I would always need to use as they usually stick straight out, but they are curling up in addition to getting longer. Also, I have green eyes and sensitive skin and worried about color change or allergic reactions but because I apply carefully and follow directions, I have had no ill effects or color change at all. I highly recommend this product, It expensive but I don;t mind paying for something when it exceeds my expectations!</li>
            <li> When I decided to try Fysiko I was a little hesitant. I was afraid the product wouldn&#x27;t work. Well... it did! After just a couple of weeks I noticed a difference in the thickness of my lashes and my eyebrows. Sixteen weeks later the difference was undeniable. My lashes really did grow! I recommend this product to anyone who wants longer, thicker eyelashes. Works great for eyebrows too!! It&#x27;s well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I ordered Fysiko after reading great reviews online and on their website. I was one of those dumb people duped by this product. I think Fysiko actually paid others to write those reviews because the product sucks so much. After trying Rapidlash and SmartLash I opted for a pricier product in the hopes of growing my weak and frail lashes. I am Asian and I have short and sparse lashes. I didn&#x27;t want to buy Latisse because I wanted to give the underdog a try, thus Fysiko. Let me tell you I used it for a month and it didn&#x27;t make a difference. I even contacted customer service in hopes of them refunding my money since it was still in the 30 day money back guaranteed. But these people are the biggest joke in the world when it comes to customer service, THERE ISN&#x27;T ANY! There is no one to answer phones or emails! I hate them, if I can expose them to the world what an evil company they are I would! I will write a review everytime I see this product from now on warning people not to spend the time and MONEY on this useless product. Please everyone just buy Latisse, my friends use it and the results are great. SKIP ON BUYING THIS! Does not work, No customer Service, No refund (even though on their website it promises it!). You&#x27;ve been warned, if I can give it ZERO stars I would!</li>
            <li> It has been almost 5 weeks, and my lashes are a lot thicker and a decent amount longer.  Curious to see how much better they will get!  I wonder about the bad reviews if maybe you didn&#x27;t get a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; tube - in which case you are right the company should do something about that.  Or, maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work for whatever reason for all people.  I don&#x27;t know, but I am really liking it and am going to get a tube for my sister for Christmas.  I think it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fysiko for 2 1/2 months and my eyebrows are darker and thicker. Where they were thinning to almost nothing, they are a nice line that doesn&#x27;t need any pencil. I have had to pluck them to shape them! This hasn&#x27;t happened in years. My eye lashes look much better too. I have eye lashes to put mascara on now. They don&#x27;t look like Latisse super long, but it is a good improvement so far. I will see if it gets better in the coming months. Happy with the product :-) I am approaching 60, by the way.</li>
            <li> Received, 100% Satisfaction, it works for me. It takes a while to see the result. I used it twice a day, morning &amp; evening...after 8months my lash grown. You can tell the differences when after you apply the fysiko by morning after 15 or 20minutes I will apply mascara just brush my lashes. I have very thin hair &amp; my lashes so I have no choice but to used mascara to see the result growing. I&#x27;ve been buying this fysiko for a while. I bought 4,  for me and for my friends. They saw the result, I guess the price didn&#x27;t matter for them. I use to have false lashes, I do it every day or other day to replace it. But now, I no longer use false lashes anymore since my lash grown. Thanks for making it easier for me and thanks for those leaving some review. I took the risk to take this chance, I&#x27;m glad, it work for me. I hope it work to others..</li>
            <li> I had real doubts about this product. I bought it because it was way cheaper than anything else. I started using it in August, and noticed real growth in 8 weeks. It took a little longer because my lashes are naturally stubby, short, and thin. I used to get lash extensions but I no longer feel like I need it. I apply once a day now instead of twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve had doubts, but I had fine hairs growing on my inner and outer corners of my eye on the bottom that were never there before. I have to tweeze them out, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay. And I guess it proves that this stuff works.</li>
            <li> I much prefer Lil Lash, which must have more of the growth ingredient.  That one works great, my lashes are darker, fuller and a little bit longer.  When I tried the Fysiko for about 6 weeks, I think my lashes were going back to the way they were.  They definitely didn&#x27;t appear as long or as full.  I&#x27;m sticking with Lil Lash.</li>
            <li> this works, used it once a day for two months, now I use it three times a week.</li>
            <li> I used Lilash before giving Fysiko a try.  I read many positive reviews however my experience was a lot of irritation. I had to toss the bottle and I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have only tried this products for 3 weeks but I have already noticed my lashes are thicker.  I am hoping it will lengthen my lashes too</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged my eyelashes have thinned and gotten lighter. I&#x27;ve been using the Fysiko Eyelash Growth Serum since September 2012. Within four weeks I started to notice change. The first sign was the darkening of my eyelashes. By three months there was a definite difference in my eyelash length and the fullness. I recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a change in the look of your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: This is a sponsored post.  However, all thoughts and opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve had eyelash envy for years.  My husband has long eyelashes, my two sons have long curly lashes and my daughter has Minnie Mouse’s lashes.  A few months ago, and to be exact several years prior to that, my eyelashes closely resembled the lashes on my avatar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re there – you just can’t see them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To tell the truth, they weren’t THAT bad, but if you would have compared my lashes to my family’s; they were basically nonexistent. I’ve thought about wearing fake eyelashes in order to fit in, but they always look a little TOO fake. Mascara, after a couple of hours, irritates my eyes; eventually leaving me looking a bit raccoonish. As much as I would like to lash out, it just didn’t seem worth it. I don’t know who said it first, but this definitely says it best – “What you don’t see is what you get.”  You don’t see any eyelashes and you won’t get any eyelashes. To say I was excited when offered the opportunity to test and review Fysiko Eyelash Growth Serum would be an understatement.  Aside from my grandmother, I can’t think of a single woman who wouldn’t want longer lashes! She used to pluck hers monthly. FYSIKO (pronounced [fi-zi-ko&#x27;]) is “natural” in Greek language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYSIKO Eyelash Growth Serum is made with all natural ingredients, created by a dermatologist frustrated with her own eyelashes, and has been clinically proven to help improve the appearance and to help lengthen eyelashes within 6-8 weeks, while doubling the length and thickness of eyelashes in 8-16 weeks. After 16 weeks I can honestly say, I have significantly longer eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my husband validated my eyelash growth, acknowledging that he could see a difference (before I asked the million dollar question, of course) and when I asked my daughter if she notice any growth she said, “Yeah – I can see them now.” (while laughing hysterically!). I applied the serum each night as suggested, although it can be applied twice a day – morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if applying the serum twice a day would have produce better results. It’s stated that too many applications may cause irritation. Less is more. It is recommended that once you are satisfied with your lash length to maintain the appearance of your new eyelashes you should continue using the product 2-3 times a week. I am happy with the results I’ve seen and I will continue using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has FYSIKO Eyelash Growth Serum been clinically proven to grow eyelashes it is equally effective on eyebrows. As you might expect, not only was I lacking in the eyelash department, but my eyebrows have been missing in action for almost 30 years.  So once again, it’s on! Let the brow enhancement and growth begin.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and lasts longer than it says...!</li>
            <li> Wow this product is fantastic, within 1 week I noticed results. My eyebrows are filling in very nicely and I no longer need any brow definer or brow powder, and my eyelashes are darker and thicker.  Buy this product and you will be happy, it is wonderful and it did not cause any irritation to my eyes or eye area and I have sensitive skin so it is certainly safe to use. I just love it and I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Used this product for almost 4 weeks just like the directions say. Waste of time. This products is absolutely worthless. I think water would have worked better in growing longer eyelahes.</li>
            <li> Shipping and service was great. The product itself I have been using almost every night for about two months or so and there has been some noticeable lengthening. I had hoped to see more improvement by this stage for the price, but maybe I still need to give it more time and consistency. Luckily there is more product in the tube than with the prescription lash product so it will still last a couple more months and hopefully I will see a real difference.</li>
            <li> There seem to be mixed reviews for this product and so I thought I would share that the product has performed very well for me.  I had some bald spots in my lashes and they were generally sparse.  After about 3-4 weeks I noticed a few of them getting longer and then around 6 weeks they were all longer overall.  Now at about 13 weeks all of the bald spots are gone and they are noticeably thicker.  I also have used it on my eye brows which were non-existant towards the outer part of my eye and I&#x27;m happy to say those are filling in too.  I may have some darkening of my eyelid where you apply it but it isn&#x27;t really noticeable to others.  I had a bit of sensitivity to it for the first few days but now it&#x27;s fine and I have sensitive skin and eyes.  I would highly recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve had great results.</li>
            <li> I used fysiko for  almost two month and my eyelashes are darker and longer !Big change ! I love this product</li>
            <li> This product works so well! it lasts me up to about 6 months..but you won&#x27;t see the results in the first month and maybe even the second I saw my results about the third month and my eyelashes grew almost double the length. Around the second month I noticed a lot of baby lashes that were growing out that weren&#x27;t there before.  I even had to cut some of my eyelashes  because it grew out too long that it touched my eyebrows. I had a lot of bald spots before from fake lashes and the overuse of mascara  after using it for 6 months there are no longer any bald spots. I always get compliments and sometimes people would ask if I&#x27;m even wearing fake lashes! If you aren&#x27;t patient then I wouldn&#x27;t suggest you buying this item but If you are wiling to wait it out the results are amazing! All it takes is patience and you will be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on week number four and I am starting to see a change in my eyebrows!  Tonight, my friend told me that she noticed that my eyelashes were thicker as well, yay!  I&#x27;ve been putting it on every night like the instructions said. You seriously have to have patience. I never write reviews, but I felt bad about the bad reviews on here.  Trust me, if you wait until at least week four, they&#x27;ll start coming in!</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I right away loved how easy it is to use. If you&#x27;ve ever gotten generic Latisse or PRX eyelash growth serums, a lot of them are just in a bottle and you have to figure out how to best apply it to your lashes with one of your eyeliner brushes. I found this really frustrating and felt like it wasn&#x27;t as effective this way, so I loved that my Fysiko serum came with a built in brush that worked FANTASTICALLY for applying the right amount to the right part of the lasH, so that you get the most bang for your buck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past, I found that a lot of them would leave a red puffy mark around your eyelids after continued use. When this would happen to me I would stop use for a couple of days, then it would be back to normal shortly, but I found it quite annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used my Fysiko eyelash growth serum, I never experienced this problem! I loved that I could use it everyday (and did almost every single day of the 4 month trial) and never got weird puffy redness, or anything that made me feel like i should stop using it for a few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fysiko is also made with natural ingredients so you can feel better about using it, and this may be why I never got any weird eyelid side effects like I have had with other brands. It is also of course, clinically proven to work, but I still wanted to test it out for myself and show you my results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My lashes are now so much thicker and even a bit darker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that because they got so much thicker and darkened up some, I did find I could just curl my eyelashes for the day and leave the house without mascara, but I&#x27;m a mascara girl so I naturally still used it!</li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyelashes and have always considered trying Latisse. But, besides the fact that a prescription is needed for that one, I&#x27;d heard about some rather disturbing side effects associated with it such as permanent darkening of your eye color. That didn&#x27;t sit well with me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Fysiko. Everything I read was good so I decided to test it and write my own review. It can be viewed here: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth? I expected NOTHING. What I expected was to feel like an idiot for believing in yet another product that didn&#x27;t deliver. So imagine my surprise when two of my friends actually called me on using an eyelash growth serum. (I had told no one.) One of them even thought I was wearing false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is … the stuff really works. My experience with it says you won&#x27;t notice much difference until 8 weeks of CONSISTENT use. That&#x27;s when my friends noticed. And I went on to use it another 8 weeks (16 total) to reach my full potential. Now I&#x27;m in the maintenance period where you only need to use it about 2-3 times a week (instead of daily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend this product to a friend. Actually, I already have. Repeatedly.</li>
            <li> To be honest, and I mean very honest, I noticed results within four days. Of course they were barely noticeable, but enough for me to get excited over. :)  So, fast forward two months. And yes, TWO months. That was when I started to really see the results that I wanted from the get go. My eyelashes naturally curl upward now, they are so long that I don&#x27;t even have to wear mascara anymore. Even my parents noticed..... my dad told me, \\&quot;Kat, do you know how lucky you are to have such long eyelashes?\\&quot; and I looked at him and said; \\&quot;Dad. I&#x27;m using eyelash growth.\\&quot; My Dad looked at me, giggled, then walked away BUT it was nice that he at least saw them! :D The price scared me a bit, but I thought hey, if it really does work (and it does!!) then all I have to lose is wearing less eye makeup. So, I invested, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! My tip to anyone who buys this is to apply it 1-3 times a day, and to delicately trace it along your lower lid line if you want to see longer lashes down there too. That&#x27;s what I did, and it looks a lot more balanced then compared to just applying it to the top lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, buy this if you&#x27;re seriously thinking about it, because it&#x27;s literally Miracle-Gro for the eyes.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work. It is an expensive product only to trick us into believing it is a legit product. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR $!!!! When I say it doesn&#x27;t work,I mean it doesn&#x27;t work at all!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for half a year and I totally love it. I didn&#x27;t want to use any hormone-based serums that give the effect only as long as you use them, so I decided on this one. I use it every night and it still has a lot of roduct left. My lashes are darker and longer now and everybody notices it. So yes, I will definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I originally started using Fysiko after most of my eyelashes fell out from a bad experience with eyelash extensions. The only reason I chose Fysiko over Latisse at the time is because I was under the impression that it would cost far more to get a prescription for Latisse. Aside from the fact that most of my eyelashes had recently fallen out, my main issue that I have with my eyelashes is that they are very thin and blonde. My eyebrows have the same issue (I looked like I had none from a distance), so I began using Fysiko on both my lashes and my eyebrows. I used Fysiko for 3 months until my bottle ran out (probably lasts 6 months if you use only on eyelashes). My results started showing around 6 weeks (just like the product label says it will) and took off from there! By the time my product ran out, my eyelashes were touching my eyebrows. All of the gaps from the missing eyelashes were filled in completely and I would say there were more eyelashes overall, even though they were thin lashes. My eyelash color did not change at all and my eyelashes were just as thin as they had always been. Also, my eyelids turned a copper tint, which I believe is supposed to be a side-effect, but I thought it looked like I put eyeshadow on everyday and complimented me nicely. As far as my eyebrows, more of them grew in, and the color became darker, but they didn&#x27;t get much longer, which is exactly what I wanted! I was about to buy the product again when it ran out when my friend introduced me to a website that sold Latisse for cheaper than I paid for the Fysiko. Her long, very thick, dark eyelashes sold me and I decided to give Latisse a shot. I&#x27;ve now been using Latisse for about 3 months. I find that my eyelashes are much thicker than they were with Fysiko but not nearly as long! They are also darker than they were with Fysiko. My eyelashes might be a little darker, but Latisse has made them grow longer than Fysiko did which is not exactly what I wanted in my eyebrows. While I am satisfied with he results of both of the products, I&#x27;m back to get the Fysiko for the amazing length it gave me! As far as the product reviewers who gave this product one star, please note that none of them used this product for an extended period of time. With both of the products, it takes time! I give this product a 4 star rating only because it did not make my eyelashes any thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I stopped using all products for a while because with both of these products, I found that the effect was diminished after continued use. My eyelashes were still long, but after a while, I was never able to achieve the same lengths that I had during my first 6-12 months of use. I recently (a few months ago) started using Revitalash and find that I saw my first results MUCH quicker (within 7-10 days) than either the Fysiko or the Latisse, but the long-term results are not as impressive as either product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if you found this review helpful and feel free to comment if you have any questions!atisfied with he results of both of the products, I&#x27;m back to get the Fysiko for the amazing length it gave me!

            <li> I purchased this product in August 2012 and now writing this review in June 2013.  When I started using this, I applied it every evening. My eyes started to itch a little so I cut back to every other day which it helped my eyes much better.  I really didn&#x27;t notice the difference in length and the thickness of my eyelash for a long time, about 5-6 months.  I was about to quit using it, but I am glad I didn&#x27;t.  Perhaps it took longer because I was using the product every other day and also I am an Asian.  Now my eyelash is longer and thicker than I have ever had in my life!  I just hope that it stays the way it is.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 5 weeks. I have not noticed any difference so far with product use. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended me this product about half a year ago and I never regreted that I purchased it! I had eyelash extention and my real eyelashes were damaged a lot. They&#x27;ve never been great and after that i lost almost all of them. In a few weeks I noticed great results. Now I have beautiful and healthy eyelashes! Now I&#x27;m purchasing Fysico for my sister. I am really surprised about these negative comments here...</li>
            <li> This serum lengthened my lashes by 1/3 to 1/2 more than they were.  Unfortunately it did not increase the number of lashes so I didn&#x27;t get the effect of more lashes.  They definately are longer though.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I wanted to share my experience with Fysiko.  I bought a tube of this in October of 2012 for my wedding in January 2013, and after 2X daily use after 5 months, I still have about 1/4 tube left.  This is a great product.  It does take TIME to work; I noticed results about 6 weeks into constant use.  I did get a little red line above my eyelashes, but easily covered it w/concealer.  My eyelashes are fair, so results are more noticeable after I put mascara on, but my eyelashes are definitely thicker and significantly longer than they used to be.  I&#x27;ve tapered off using it, maybe 4X/ week to maintain my current results.  I&#x27;m not the type to use stuff like this, but the difference is significant and brightens my face quite a bit--it&#x27;s definitely worth the long-term investment, and I will be buying more.  Give it a try--you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I get comments often about my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have tried cheaper eyelash serums and they either did not work as well or irritated my eyes too much.  Fysiko eyelash serum really does the trick for me.  My eyelashes are thin and weak with bald spots.  I used this serum only when I thought about it and within a month I was amazed to see such a noticable difference!  I was excited enough to use it every day!  I now have long, full eyelashes but you have to keep up the process. I am so relieved with the results and no longer struggle to look alive!  I highly recommend this product because it is the least irritating of all that I have tried.</li>
            <li> 3 weeks in and ZERO results.  I know these things take time but this stuff is WAYYYYY overpriced!  Latisse is only about $20 more and that is the route I will be going.  I would not recommend this product.  I had some good luck with RapidLash (which took about 10 weeks to see longer lashes but at least after a month, I could see the beginnings of lashes trying to grow) but after using that for over a year, it stopped working.  I could have bought a years worth of that for what this worthless stuff costs.  I will use it until it is gone just because of the 100 bucks I flushed down the toilet.  Not optimistic.  Word of advice:  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS STUFF and watch out for bogus 5 star reviews.........I would give it ZERO stars if that was an option.</li>
            <li> I decided to try based on reviews as the type of applicator appealed to me. I&#x27;ve used Latisse and it didn&#x27;t take many days to decide this was no Latisse. Wish there was a money back guarantee!</li>
            <li> It &#x27;s the best lash enhancer and growth serum I&#x27;ve ever used. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> It did help my lashes grow, but it gave me dark circles under my eyes. I never used under eye concealer on a regular basis before using this, and since I ran out of Fysiko, I&#x27;ve been able to stop using the concealer. I didn&#x27;t make the connection until I stopped using it and saw a drastic change within a couple weeks. Nice for long lashes, but not worth the side effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for  4 wks and the benefits I&#x27;d garnered from another eyelash serum have been completely reversed . I have less lashes now than I have had in years . Product is touted as a &#x27;natural and amazing serum&#x27; &amp; I believe many are suckered in by the price  - believing &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27; - unfortunately in this instance I was screwed twice - bilked out a substantive amount of money and given false hope that the  product would make a difference ; it does not. I bought the serum directly from the company- You know I find it funny when reviews relay, and freq, a time frame of  &#x27;16 wks etc to see results&#x27; or  &#x27;3- 6 mos before you see growth&#x27; - this tips me off that they&#x27;re fabricated Most of the products I&#x27;ve used - if they work at all  show something with in a 2- 3 wks if not sooner.  I wish there was way folks could have some sort of recourse when cheated out of their hard earned money !.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a while before giving this product a rating to give it a chance to work. I did not see immediate results...it took a couple of months but now and I can definitely see a difference in my eyelashes. They are longer as well as thicker. I will be purchasing this product again for sure. It was somewhat expensive but lasts a long time and being natural I don&#x27;t have to worry about it changing my eye color like with some other similar products. This was a worthwhile purchase!</li>
            <li> I have been using Fysiko for about a month now and have definitely noticed a difference! My eyelashes are longer! The package says it takes 4 months of continuous use to see the end results; I can&#x27;t wait to see how long my eyelashes will be by then! Love it!</li>
            <li> I gave this product four stars not five only for the price. I have used many eyelash serums and they all seem to work some better than others revitalash advanced gave my super long lashes and a six month supply is about $75. I have used this for a month and can see it works well not sure if it&#x27;s better than revitalash which is half the price of course true results take about four months if you use it regularly. I will post in another three months for my ultimate decision weather it&#x27;s worth that price.</li>
            <li> Does it work?  Yes. For me, it took almost 6 weeks to see any changes.  After about 3 months, my lashes are longer and thicker, although not a match for lash extensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, RapidLash yielded the same results when I tried it a couple of years ago.  The cost was substantially less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is causing darkening of the area around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Have been using it faithfully every evening for the past three weeks.  Absolutely NO change in my eyelashes, or eyebrows.  I fear it is money down the drain.[[ASIN:B0086I34UG Fysiko Eyelash Growth Serum]]</li>
            <li> Have tried this product for 5 weeks, and have seen absolutely no results. Nothing, Nada, Zilch. It does, however, burn if it gets in your eyes, leaving them red and tired looking. The active ingredient is: Methylamido Dihydro Noralfaprostal which is found in several cheaper eyelash serums, and I think it is latin for \\&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat Emptor: Buyer Beware!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 6 weeks and it&#x27;s fantastic.  I use it twice a day and noticed a change at week 5.  My husband actually noticed.  That alone is impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was doing lash extensions and all the technicians would tell me how short and straight my lashes are.  I sadly had to stop getting them because my eyelashes were becoming so weak from the extensions.  I needed something and latisse causes dark lines on my eyes, so that wasn&#x27;t an option.  Researched and found this stuff.  I can&#x27;t imagine not using this stuff. My lases are ridiculously long.  They&#x27;re blonde, so I wear mascara, but I used to wear three coats of it to have them look halfway decent.  Now it&#x27;s one application and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey, but extensions were costing me 100 a month.</li>
            <li> Watch out, folks! Their website is loaded with great before and after pictures. It says \\&quot;read genuine reviews of Fysiko Eyelash Serum customers\\&quot; on the top and there&#x27;s a name and town next the top pictures to make you believe the picture was taken of some real customer&#x27;s eye. But all those pictures come from the Latisse website!!! There was a comment about it on their Facebook website and I checked to see if it&#x27;s true. It is and the comment was deleted shortly after! We know Latisse works because of the prostaglandins in the serum. Fysiko claims to be all natural though, but no information about their ingredients on their website either. Now, do you think their other reviews are genuine? I don&#x27;t! Do you believe in this product? I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what are all the negative reviews about. My girlfriend loves it. Bought it in spa salons all the time. I bought it for her birthday now. Sure she&#x27;ll be thrilled. And it&#x27;ll last her the whole year. Great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> Have been using for 5 weeks and have not seen any results yet. I have been using every night faithfully.</li>
            <li> I received mine on 10/4/12 and have been using it everyday but only in the morning since I tend to forget about it at night.  I didn&#x27;t see any results til the end of November 2012 and it&#x27;s continuing to grow.  I&#x27;m Asian so my lashes grow straight out instead of curving up but after using Fysiko, my left eye&#x27;s lashes started curving up and getting longer which looks great.  For my right eye&#x27;s lashes, it just grew straight out so I have to use an eyelash curler to make it curl like my left eye&#x27;s lashes.  For the price, it&#x27;s worth it and it last for several months and best of all IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> I am slowly seeing progress. It has been a month and it looks like my lashes are indeed growing. It&#x27;s not an overnight process but there is definitely visible improvement.</li>
            <li> Began using this 2 times a day 11 days ago.  You know it works when new baby growth is gray!!  They are certainly longer &amp; thicker in this very short time.  I used to use LiLash which is not sold by US sellers any longer.  This compares extremely well &amp; may even exceed the other.  At 1/2 the price, I will continue to have it as part of my routine.</li>
            <li> I started using Fysiko in August.  Took about a month to notice growth.  By the the beginning of October, my lashes were definitely longer. I didn&#x27;t notice more lashes or thicker lashes; but they certainly were longer. It&#x27;s over 6 months and I am still using that first tube. Obviously I am pleased and repurchased.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see there were negative reviews here.  I was skeptical at first, too.  But I went onto FaceBook.  There is a Fysiko page with over 800 \\&quot;likes\\&quot;.  I picked 3 Fysiko \\&quot;friends\\&quot; randomly and sent them a private message.  Only two responded, but they both said they had great results.&lt;br /&gt;Though I have never tried Latisse, I have used Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s Lashes to Die For.  Had OK results.  Fysiko is much better.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer accused all positive reviewers of being affiliated with Fysiko.  I have no affiliation or connection to Fysiko other than as a legitimate, pleased customer.... with long eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  June 2014.  I have been using Fysiko for almost two years. It took about a year, but my lashes have filled in.  They are definitely longer and there are more lashes. I still think this is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wanted to add that I find a tube lasts a year.  And yes, I do use it every day.  I toss it because of the expiration date, not because it&#x27;s run out. Makes the price more reasonable!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY growth serum besides Latisse that works for me. My eye lashes are darker and longer . Love this stuff</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace the two Rx&#x27;s I used for Latisse.  So far its working, but it is more expensive.  You don&#x27;t waste applicators with each use, which is a plus or minus depending on how you feel about it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading all the reviews on Makeup Alley and it sounded like Fysiko (in spite of the high price tag) was the closest eyelash serum to Latisse but without the price tag to match. I am very fair with blond eyelashes and a few bald spots after an unfortunate late night incident with fake eyelash glue last Halloween. I have been applying the serum religiously every night for the last 8 weeks. For the first few weeks I didn&#x27;t notice anything happening and was beginning to think I had been scammed. Then after about 5 weeks I noticed lots of new lashes growing in, completely covering the bald spots and making my lashes appear fuller. At this point my lashes are significantly longer than when I started using the product and I am really pleased. With mascara on, they almost reach to my eyelids and several friends have asked if I got extensions. I was hoping that they would grow in darker and I think they are starting to but the ends of the existing lashes are so fair that I won&#x27;t be getting rid of my mascara anytime soon. Either way I am very pleased with the results, have experienced zero side effects and will continue to use the serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with my eyelashes not growing because I used to get styes a lot and I used to wear fake eyelashes, so I tried this product and after a month of using it my eyelashes have doubled, I even use it on my lower lids and it&#x27;s awesome, I have lashes growing in spots that havent exsisted inYEARS... YOU GET 2 THUMBS UP FROM ME... but do know that you have to use it twice a day and be consistent with it.</li>
