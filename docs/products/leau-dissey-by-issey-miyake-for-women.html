            <li>I love the men&#x27;s smell of Issey Miyake, so I saw this good price on the women&#x27;s cologne and bought it.  </li>

            <li>Love it,love it.</li>
            <li>I will deff.order again from this seller :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never received as many compliments on a perfume as this one.</li>
            <li>Its more alcohol than anything.</li>
            <li>The price point was outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Should have known better to by at reputable department store or boutique.</li>
            <li>I love being able to purchase it from Amazon, and having it arrive in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to wear it every day.  </li>
            <li>But this seller made Issey much more affordable.</li>
            <li>I love to wear this as my &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey by Issey Miyake.</li>
            <li>My favorite, will used all my life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than in Nordstorm Rack and Perfumania.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and so does my wife.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>One of my two favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>I suggest you just wander out and smell it :)</li>
            <li>Nice and light for summer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite smell.</li>
            <li>AND THE MEN LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I really like the scent a lot, although it is not my favorite, I feel good wearing it.</li>
            <li>It easily retails for $80-90 at higher-end stores.</li>
            <li>-- it stays low-key but is wonderfl and non-offensive for those who have allergies to strong odors.</li>
            <li>Sweet, innocent smell.  </li>
            <li>This perfume is so wonderfully light and floral.</li>
            <li>Scent is perfectly light and feminine.</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous, just like I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh &amp; light fragrance &amp; my favorite.  </li>
            <li>,it come in its original package made in france and the smell holds all day.</li>
            <li>I was excited about my cologne was I got for under $35.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of her very favorite scents and she was surprised when she received it for her birthday.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, clean, fresh, and distinctively oriental.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason the combination of notes in Issey:&lt;br /&gt;Lotus, Freesia, Cyclamen, Rose Water, Fresh Peonies, Carnation, White Lilies, Precious Woods, Osmanthus, Tuberose, Amberseed, Musk just do it for me.</li>
            <li>Issey Miyake is my absolute favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in sealed packaging.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate the seller&#x27;s thoughtfulness (that bottle alone could have easily sold for $20 by itself).</li>
            <li>Arrived in original packaging &amp; was exactly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Understated elegance for those who cannot take the powerful perfume smells that will envelope a room</li>
            <li>That is so worth the price.</li>
            <li>I wish I would&#x27;ve ordered the larger size - love it so much!!!</li>
            <li>Very, very pleased to find this at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey is quite simply my all time favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Such an elegant, floral scent.</li>
            <li>And the package came with a lovely surprise: an extra purse-sized bottle!</li>
            <li>While I can not say that you, too will get free surprises, I think what you will get is a professional, prompt, and affordable experience.</li>
            <li>It does wear off more quickly than some other perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I feel classy, feminine, and clean.</li>
            <li>I should have know that I could not get the real L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey by Issey Miyake at this price of 39.99.</li>
            <li>The packaging it came is was very sturdy</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying it here on Amazon because it will save you a ton of money too!</li>
            <li>Ridiculously fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Was hesitant to order this online because of horror stories on products not being the real thing....</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my step mother and this was very embarrassing.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon, and it is the real product.</li>
            <li>good fragrance but not so lasting as I expected</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY reccomend it.</li>
            <li>She compared the new bottle with my older one I bought at a department store.  </li>
            <li>This is my new spot for buying Issey.</li>
            <li>Not usually my thing,</li>
            <li>Appears to be exactly the same as the bottle my wife got 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>Came in a completely different type of bottle first of all.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, since I haven&#x27;t won the lottery or come into a substantial inheritance from a loving relative, I can rarely afford it.</li>
            <li>A little goes a LONG way :)</li>
            <li>Same exact item as in the stores, for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>The scent smells very similar but I can barely even smell it after it&#x27;s sprayed and does not last at all.</li>
            <li>And after that, I noticed that I didn&#x27;t have the same head-turning scent I previously had when I had the real one.  </li>
            <li>This perfume has a subtle floral scent with a hint of sweet nectar.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very long lasting and has become one of her favorites.</li>
            <li> She spotted it as a fake, especially with how the silver part near where it sprays out looks slightly different from the real one.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth getting tricked for it, while paying comparable prices.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this.</li>
            <li> In the past, this fragrance was a little hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I was not pleased with what I ordered.</li>
            <li> It is subtle and stays on you for hours.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Hi.Just wanted to say thank you for your great perfume and fast shipping.I was a little scared I didn&#x27;t know if I will receive the original or fake,but I was very pleased,it come in its original package made in france and the smell holds all day.Love it,love it.I will deff.order again from this seller :-)</li>
            <li> This perfume is so wonderfully light and floral. I&#x27;ve never received as many compliments on a perfume as this one.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it, it&#x27;s wonderful she says.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with what I ordered. I should have know that I could not get the real L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey by Issey Miyake at this price of 39.99. Its more alcohol than anything. Not the same smell as the ones in Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! It&#x27;s smells great...kind of like flowers and spices; plus it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it that&#x27;s all you can ask for</li>
            <li> I love this scent! It has been my go to perfume for about 13 years. For whatever reason the combination of notes in Issey:&lt;br /&gt;Lotus, Freesia, Cyclamen, Rose Water, Fresh Peonies, Carnation, White Lilies, Precious Woods, Osmanthus, Tuberose, Amberseed, Musk just do it for me. My husband loves it and I get compliments on it just about every time I wear it. It must work great with my body chemistry! Also, this Amazon price is the best. Its double the price anywhere else. The packaging it came is was very sturdy and I don&#x27;t think the bottle could have a chance to break in transit. Very, very pleased to find this at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and exactly as expected.  The price point was outstanding.  I have seen the same thing go for double the price elsewhere.</li>
            <li> very nice fragrance. The packaging design is great. The product was described by the seller perfection. A good investment for the good price, the best in the market. I recommend it</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey for my wife. It is an excellent Eau De Toilette. Very long lasting and has become one of her favorites. I HIGHLY reccomend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fresh &amp; light fragrance &amp; my favorite.  Arrived in original packaging &amp; was exactly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Never again, Why I thought I was getting a deal. Should have known better to by at reputable department store or boutique.</li>
            <li> LOVEEEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey is quite simply my all time favorite fragrance.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over 10 years.  In the past, this fragrance was a little hard to find.  I love being able to purchase it from Amazon, and having it arrive in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> good fragrance but not so lasting as I expected</li>
            <li> I was excited about my cologne was I got for under $35.  Then my sister (who LOVES perfume and collects them) visited me.  She compared the new bottle with my older one I bought at a department store.  She spotted it as a fake, especially with how the silver part near where it sprays out looks slightly different from the real one.  And after that, I noticed that I didn&#x27;t have the same head-turning scent I previously had when I had the real one.  It&#x27;s close, but not 100%.  I will stick to going to places like Perfumania or Burlington Coat Factory.  It&#x27;s not worth getting tricked for it, while paying comparable prices.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend smells really nice with it!</li>
            <li> Up to my expectation.</li>
            <li> This is 3rd bottle I purchased.  I keep trying different perfumes and this is one of the perfume that you reapet buying it.</li>
            <li> Such an elegant, floral scent. Not usually my thing, but I fell in love with this! I feel classy, feminine, and clean. Highly recommend buying it here on Amazon because it will save you a ton of money too!</li>
            <li> Issey Miyake is my absolute favorite scent. It&#x27;s light, clean, fresh, and distinctively oriental. It does wear off more quickly than some other perfumes.  However, I fix that problem by spraying it on my clothes. I&#x27;d love to wear it every day.  Unfortunately, since I haven&#x27;t won the lottery or come into a substantial inheritance from a loving relative, I can rarely afford it. It easily retails for $80-90 at higher-end stores. But this seller made Issey much more affordable. And the package came with a lovely surprise: an extra purse-sized bottle! I really appreciate the seller&#x27;s thoughtfulness (that bottle alone could have easily sold for $20 by itself). Generosity and reliability are traits I look for when buying products. I hope you visit this seller&#x27;s page, and if you do, that your experience will be as good as mine was. This is my new spot for buying Issey. While I can not say that you, too will get free surprises, I think what you will get is a professional, prompt, and affordable experience.</li>
            <li> Great packaging, in original box. Same exact item as in the stores, for a lot less money. I wish I would&#x27;ve ordered the larger size - love it so much!!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it!!!</li>
            <li> Sweet, innocent smell.  A little goes a LONG way :)</li>
            <li> Ridiculously fast delivery.  Scent is perfectly light and feminine. The price was great, too. I love to wear this as my &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful smell on application to your skin.  It is subtle and stays on you for hours.  Understated elegance for those who cannot take the powerful perfume smells that will envelope a room -- it stays low-key but is wonderfl and non-offensive for those who have allergies to strong odors.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Excellent quality(the scent stays on all day) and great value. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey by Issey Miyake. This scent is great for me. It smells very nice on my skin, but as with any perfume, it might not be the case with all people. I would always try it at the store before buying online.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in sealed packaging.  Smells fabulous, just like I remember!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been out of it and have missed it!!  And at a great price!</li>
            <li> My favorite, will used all my life.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant to order this online because of horror stories on products not being the real thing....Well guess what????&lt;br /&gt;This product is not even close to what it should smell like and would never recommend anyone ordering it from this site.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Issey Miyake for 15 years and I know what is smells like..shame on these people</li>
            <li> I love the men&#x27;s smell of Issey Miyake, so I saw this good price on the women&#x27;s cologne and bought it.  I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to replace her other bottle that she had used completely up.  It&#x27;s one of her very favorite scents and she was surprised when she received it for her birthday.</li>
            <li> The best deal I&#x27;ve seen on the website. It&#x27;s even better than in Nordstorm Rack and Perfumania.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> This perfume has a subtle floral scent with a hint of sweet nectar.  I put about 4sprays at 4:30am and even at 9pm  can still smell the remains of it. I always get asked which perfume it is. The bottle is a lil shorter than a 20oz bottle of soda. That is so worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and so does my wife.  :)  She was so happy that I got it for her that she is still thanking me.</li>
            <li> Came wrapped in bubble wrap! It was a gift for my step mother and this was very embarrassing. Not even a gift wrapping was an option.</li>
            <li> Great perfume, love it. Size is perfect for travel!</li>
            <li> One of my two favorite scents.  Can only find it through Amazon.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent a lot, although it is not my favorite, I feel good wearing it. It last&#x27;s just about all day long, with fading of course but you can still smell a hint of it in the evening when you come home from work. I think it is a very nice light scent for women. Describing a scent is not easy and I will not even attempt it really I suggest you just wander out and smell it :)</li>
            <li> Nice and light for summer.  Can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon, and it is the real product.</li>
            <li> Appears to be exactly the same as the bottle my wife got 20 years ago. It&#x27;s my favorite smell.</li>
            <li> THIS IS WHAT I&#x27;VE BEEN LOOKING FOR AND THE PRICE BEATS ALL OTHERS WHO SALE IT! AND THE MEN LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I&#x27;ve loved this fragrance for years and this is the best price I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Came in a completely different type of bottle first of all. The scent smells very similar but I can barely even smell it after it&#x27;s sprayed and does not last at all. Definitely not the same/real one from the store. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this.</li>
