    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>A great value for the money!</li>
            <li>excellent product meets its specification and arrived at the stipulated time</li>
            <li>Price was great, as was shipping!</li>
            <li>Great price for product!</li>
            <li>I ordered the travel size and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, great color, anything</li>
            <li>Great Buy.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips look great</li>
            <li>Great for carrying in your handbag.</li>
            <li>so if I get one in a more rosy shade, like strawberry or watermelon, it will be perfect!!  </li>
            <li>It still looks good</li>
            <li>Stays on fairly well, but the CoverGirl version seems just as good.</li>
            <li>I love the colors they have!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to buy more colors!</li>
            <li>Mega Melon is a nice color for blondes (my case) and brunettes.</li>
            <li>Expect more of the product, the color is well off and the duration is not as good as expected.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy again.</li>
            <li>I always love Clinique products.</li>
            <li>I do not see it as a lip color balm, but more of a lipstick in itself because it does give you color and stays on just like a lipstick.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I really do love this product but it makes my lips feel like a raisen.</li>
            <li>Clinique is a thumbs up! :-)</li>
            <li>It is moist, creamy, smooth, and soothing.  </li>
            <li>Loved my Clinique lipstick because it&#x27;s moisturizing and makes it look natural .</li>
            <li>Nothing special, just easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite happy with the color on me, I usually wear something more rosy, but I do love wearing it.  </li>
            <li>Great color and good for moisturising the lips too... have to keep reapplying every couple of hours as the color does not last long...</li>
            <li>Will re-review when I am more clear about that.</li>
            <li>It is a really pretty color.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that they are smaller and more reasonable than purchasing the full-size lip colour.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, sheer color.</li>
            <li>It works as a lipstick while delineating the contour is much easier.</li>
            <li>This item works very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Clinique and all their products!</li>
            <li>I also purchased revlon just bitten stain and that is more long lasting than this stick.</li>
            <li>A nice addition of a little color with the same properties a a lip balm for moisture.</li>
            <li>As an Asian I normally lean towards a peachy tone and think this color fits me well.</li>

            <li> Oh, and the bottom screws up like a standard lipstick tube so there is plenty in the tube to last a long time</li>
            <li> The travel size (even though bulky in its design) allows me to try out different colors without getting stuck for too long.</li>

            <li> Great Buy. Fulfill every expectations. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I saw this product showcased on a TV program ,and purchased it! I was very disappointed how dry and Matt this product turned out to be! Will not use!</li>
            <li> Loved my Clinique lipstick because it&#x27;s moisturizing and makes it look natural .</li>
            <li> Great color and good for moisturising the lips too... have to keep reapplying every couple of hours as the color does not last long... the reason I have taken off a star is bcos I also purchased revlon just bitten stain and that is more long lasting than this stick.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, sheer color.</li>
            <li> It works as a lipstick while delineating the contour is much easier. Mega Melon is a nice color for blondes (my case) and brunettes.</li>
            <li> Big fan of chubby stiks !</li>
            <li> Expect more of the product, the color is well off and the duration is not as good as expected.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I always love Clinique products. The travel size (even though bulky in its design) allows me to try out different colors without getting stuck for too long. As an Asian I normally lean towards a peachy tone and think this color fits me well. I do not see it as a lip color balm, but more of a lipstick in itself because it does give you color and stays on just like a lipstick.</li>
            <li> It had a rancid smell. But I returned with no hassle.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, just easy to use.</li>
            <li> This item works very well. I love it. It is a really pretty color. It&#x27;s sort of a pinkish peach color.</li>
            <li> I ordered a travel size of Clinique&#x27;s Chubby Sticks - Mega Melon Lip Color Balm.  It is moist, creamy, smooth, and soothing.  I&#x27;m not quite happy with the color on me, I usually wear something more rosy, but I do love wearing it.  It makes my lips look great so if I get one in a more rosy shade, like strawberry or watermelon, it will be perfect!!  Oh, and the bottom screws up like a standard lipstick tube so there is plenty in the tube to last a long time and you don&#x27;t have to sharpen them at all!  A great value for the money!</li>
            <li> I happened to see these on line  have never seen the for sale in a store.  I like the fact that they are smaller and more reasonable than purchasing the full-size lip colour.  Great for carrying in your handbag.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of a long lasting lip stain but I still like the creamy texture and moisturizing effect of lipsticks and this chubby stick gives me both. I highly recommend Clinique and all their products!</li>
            <li> excellent product meets its specification and arrived at the stipulated time</li>
            <li> And color, but unsure if these are as moisturizing as I need them to be. Will re-review when I am more clear about that. Price was great, as was shipping!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product.  I put lip gloss over it when I wore it.  If I didn&#x27;t, it looked like I have crayon on my lips.  Dries out your lips.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product but it makes my lips feel like a raisen. It still looks good but I feel like my lips are pruning. I recommend putting actual Chapstick on before. I love the colors they have! It says travel size but it&#x27;s actually bigger than lipsticks in the store and bigger than chapsticks. Great price for product!</li>
            <li> This goes on with sheer color and does not clump up. A nice addition of a little color with the same properties a a lip balm for moisture.</li>
            <li> I ordered the travel size and it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s still enough to use for awhile, but I&#x27;m not committed to the same color for years.  Stays on fairly well, but the CoverGirl version seems just as good.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, great color, anything Clinique is a thumbs up! :-) I can&#x27;t wait to buy more colors!</li>
