            <li>Very nice!</li>
            <li>As good as a beauty blender!</li>

            <li>My foundation has never looked more flawless and it blends my makeup perfectly for an amazing price!</li>
            <li>I found out about it on a beauty channel on youtube and am really happy that I purchased one.  </li>
            <li>Works great for applying liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great knockoff of the beautyblender.</li>
            <li>It works great with my foundations and bb creams.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for foundation with a thicker or thinner consistency.</li>
            <li>The great thing that it is affordable.  </li>
            <li>This works great in place of the $20 Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li>, it has a point and an angle great for working under the eye area.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the very popular make up sponge that everyone talks about (BB).  </li>
            <li>This sponge is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t stomach spending $20 for a beauty blender, so I wanted to find a good alternative, which this is.</li>
            <li>The sponge is soo good</li>
            <li>Works just as good as the Beta Blender for  fraction of the cost</li>
            <li>but after a while (9 months or so - and I took good care of it, cleansing it in soap &amp; olive oil, which I read is a good way to preserve the brushes) but the fibers started coming out - every day</li>
            <li>Good deal</li>
            <li>Good dupe</li>
            <li>Mine is the real deal, works beautifully for a flawless airbrushed look.</li>
            <li>Just as good, or even better, than the $25 Beauty Blender sold at Sephora!  </li>
            <li>so great better then the beauty blender and cheaper.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this works BETTER than the Beauty Blender!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that it is a perfect swap, but is pretty close.</li>
            <li>Better than my beauty blender!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This sponge is amazing, even better than the beauty blender for 1/3 of the cost!</li>
            <li>But this is amazing</li>
            <li>This sponge works great, my foundation and concealer go on smooth and it makes everything look nice</li>
            <li>start off by using warm water to soak my sponge</li>
            <li>Real techniques is a great company with great products.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I liked it a lot</li>
            <li>Even if you soak them in warm water over &amp; over, they won&#x27;t soften so</li>
            <li>and it gives me very even coverage that looks flawless.  </li>
            <li>Applies and blends perfect, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but mine is bran new and already is peeling while hers is perfect cut edges</li>
            <li>Very please with purchase :) Makes your make up flawless.</li>
            <li>So I looked online for recommendations for a good dupe and found many Youtube makeup women say this one was almost better.  </li>
            <li>Cons; the sponge was very easy to tear.</li>
            <li>however, this is the best one I&#x27;ve had thus far.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this sponge!</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to get out the excess soap before you use it on your skin again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this sponge.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this, makeup must have...</li>
            <li>and I like some more than others....</li>
            <li>this is way better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love the way it blends my foundation ..</li>
            <li>Provides a flawless application, blends like a dream and definitely exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I like it better than the Beauty Blender.  </li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I quite love this sponge.  </li>
            <li>Better than the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>And a way better price.</li>
            <li>and I do love it.</li>
            <li>but I will gladly repurchase another one without hesitation.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite beauty blender and I have try them</li>
            <li>My favorite out of all sponges</li>
            <li>so I can use the &#x27;$3.50 off $10 or more item&amp;#34; coupon.  </li>
            <li>it a try am sure you&#x27;ll be converted.</li>
            <li>Love the sponge needed a replacement.</li>
            <li>Love this and such a great price!!</li>
            <li>I bought it better then</li>
            <li>I love it.% 100 recomend.</li>
            <li>It smooths and blends better than any brush.</li>
            <li>I feel that it absorbs more of my foundation but applies it well.  </li>
            <li>I love this make up sponge.</li>
            <li>and they took off more product</li>
            <li>IMHO, the denser sponges provide better coverage of your foundation, concealer and contour. 2.)</li>
            <li>It gives a better finish with bb creams and foundations than my fingers or a brush.</li>
            <li>And I think it&#x27;s sturdier than the beauty blender, so I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>A great product from Real Techniques.</li>
            <li>I bought so many alternatives to the BeautyBleder because I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend $20 on it.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, it gives you a flawless application, and it&#x27;s easy to clean and disinfect.</li>
            <li>and it had pretty good reviews.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So easy to use, so easy to clean, I really do love these!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So easy to use, so easy to clean, I really do love these!</li>
            <li>It gave me a flawless finish with my full coverage Kat von d makeup and almost airbrushed finish with my sheer Revlon foundation...</li>
            <li>And the reviews on this Real Techniques is, across the board, generally as good as Beauty Blender reviews.</li>
            <li>Original beauty blender is much much MUCH better with blending.</li>
            <li>so amazing I love all Real Techniques products and look forward to owning all the line.</li>
            <li>Easy as pie to use.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and the makeup blends amazing!</li>
            <li>this sponge is nice, but it ripped with the first wash.</li>
            <li>I use to put my liquid foundation with my finger and comparing it to this sponge is a huge difference and improvement, just dab it on your face and it looks so pressional.</li>
            <li>I use it to apply my under eye concealer and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>Smooth application</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean with Dawn dish washing liquid or baby shampoo.  </li>
            <li>THE FLAT SIDE IS INGENIOUS!!  </li>
            <li>First off let me say that I absolutely love this sponge.</li>
            <li>clean my sponge</li>
            <li>I do not know how easily it clean yet.  </li>
            <li>a lot softer and easier to clean.</li>
            <li>However I use revlon CS foundation and it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to clean.</li>
            <li>easy to clean and use I love this sponge, i this sponge enhances your foundation to perfection I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They are not like makeup sponges I&#x27;ve had before, but rather they really do blend and perfect your foundation and other cream and liquid products, its amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it so much I bought another for a friend.  </li>
            <li>many months ago I bought this Real Techniques sponge.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of like using a soft plastic utensil to apply foundation.  </li>
            <li>It was nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and works as it should.</li>
            <li>I simply get it nice and soaked and use some antibacterial liquid handsoap to clean it....</li>
            <li>😃😃  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li>I was interested in trying this one since it is significantly cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Exactly how it was suppose to be!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled because it has quickly become one of my essential beauty tools.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little tool for applying my foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li>So worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Guess who&#x27;ll me ordering $30 worth of sponges to replace that one now-worthless brush?</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>This is good but be careful it rips when bloated with water.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t compare it to the real beauty blender, but I have tried cheaper no brand ones from the beauty supply store and this Real Techniques one is definitely better than those.</li>
            <li>This sponge, like many of its counterparts, is difficult to get completely clean, but is still a great makeup addition.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and the flat side really is great.</li>
            <li>Other dan price d sponge is good</li>
            <li>I find myself picking it up way more often than I thought I would, and it saves my more expensive beauty blender for my more important makeup days.</li>
            <li>To be honest, it&#x27;s the same as a beauty blender just shaped different and the price is much better.</li>
            <li>Great substitute for the more expensive Beauty Blender product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore these makeup sponges!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more sheer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried the beauty blender, and might never need to because Real Techniques gives me an airbrushed look!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen the more expensive versions, but Real Techniques makes a great make-up sponge.  </li>
            <li>It gives me such amazing FULL coverage (good if you wanna cover up acne or dark spots) Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>Great small sponge, gets the job done!</li>
            <li>It also has the nice flat side which I use to set my under eye concealer with a light yellow powder.  </li>
            <li>The beauty blender is a bit to stiff for me when blending out my foundation, but this one is so easy to use and smooth on my makeup!</li>
            <li>love this product and the flat side  </li>
            <li>While I do feel like it holds more water and doesn&#x27;t wring out as easily, I still like it and will use it instead of the more expensive version.</li>
            <li>and this was the only thing I could get a clean application with !</li>
            <li>, is super soft, and does not soak up the foundation!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that the sponge is as fine as the original beauty blender (pink), but the contouring on this guy - like the flat edge and the more rounded tip and the longer sides just make it SO much easier to work with.</li>
            <li>The flat end works good on my chin too if it happens to be red (which it often is).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased some very inexpensive, smaller (4-pack) of sponges recently just cuz the price was so good</li>
            <li>If you are going for more coverage I would suggest using it dry.  </li>
            <li>you must dampen slightly in order for the sponge to be effective.</li>
            <li>I could have paid less than this for the real one:/ these girls writing these amazing reviews</li>
            <li>wash after every use, I use a drop of facial cleanser and it works fine.</li>
            <li>and then i gently squeeze out the excess water.  </li>
            <li>and it worked really well</li>
            <li>Product got shipped fast and works well.</li>
            <li>really upgraded the quality of my makeup application and the sped as well</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>also fast shipping</li>
            <li>Much cheaper alternative to a beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I really like how your foundation never looks caked on or overdone.</li>
            <li>I just tap it beginning in the center of my face and working out, making sure to get every nook and cranny.  </li>
            <li>I really like this blender.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other knockoffs that are slightly better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>The price is better then other sponges and works just as well.</li>
            <li>the pointed tip is great for around your eyes, nostrils, and typical redness areas that tend to be harder to get into.  </li>
            <li>It stains quickly but thats the only downfall.</li>
            <li>I definitely will be buying more of these in the future!</li>
            <li>This sponge is more dense and easier to handle than the more expensive version out there.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the beauty bender is better than this one, although much more expensive.</li>
            <li>you have a cream blush I have found you can use the sharp angle coming off the flat end (and long side) to dip into a cream blush in a pinch and feather it out beautifully.  </li>
            <li>The positive reviews on this led me to try Real Techniques after it was time to switch out my 100% Pure Makeup Blender (looks and works similarly to the beauty blender from what I&#x27;ve read).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is nice because at this stage the sponge is most wet, so it makes my primer glide on effortlessly since they can be sort of thick, it also makes use of a tiny amount of product over my whole face, so I really do recommend it for this use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shape of it you can use on different areas of face (obviously) - and it&#x27;s super, super soft which makes it like heaven to work with.  </li>
            <li>i love it use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I normally used my fingers to apply foundation</li>
            <li>I bought this sponge more than a few months ago</li>
            <li>In places that need extra coverage I can go ahead and use the flat side to sort of blot in a little more coverage and have it still look smooth without caking on a ton of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling to master my new contour kit</li>
            <li>I have used those cheap white triangle looking ones that are sold at regular beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>I loved it more than my Beauty Blender and so much less expensive.</li>
            <li>The flat side is great for dabbing on foundation and the rounded side comes to a point to reach small places like the inner corner of your eye.  </li>
            <li>It provides a very natural and even finish.</li>
            <li>and hers is months old!</li>
            <li>I was accidentally sent two sponges( and charged for two), but after testing out the first one I had to keep the second.  </li>
            <li>You can pick this exact same sponge up at WALMART for $5.99!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Big fan of real techniques!</li>
            <li>It works good, but not very very good.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t recommend the little cheap ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps the product get into every little crevice and makes it all even and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This sponge is great and will definitely replace that expensive beauty sponge.</li>
            <li>obviously have never used a real one of these sponges.</li>
            <li>You can sometimes find these in stores on sale, such as Walgreens, but they sell out extremely fast.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and my makeup looks airbrushed afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and blends everything in with no streaks and no build-up at the hairline.  </li>
            <li>But WOW, this product blew me away.</li>
            <li>It sheers the coverage out so that it looks really natural</li>
            <li>Pro; natural looking makeup application.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be the first to say that I am not a fan of loose powder until now.</li>
            <li>but it takes less than a minute if you use a quick rinse soap/shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used regular latex sponges in the past but they always absorb too much makeup and don&#x27;t give me the same smooth, even coverage as this RT sponge.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super firm and just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>but this sponge helps the different shades of foundation blend seamlessly.</li>
            <li>I only wear makeup for special  occasions and second time using this sponge it ripped in half</li>
            <li>So it must be made from some other material because the old and new are nothing at all alike.  </li>
            <li>my guess is that it could be a fake product or real techniques might have changed the texture of the product , therefore I recommend that you order or buy directly from certified sellers eg: boots, ulta.com or directly from real techniques site .</li>

            <li> Wonderful!</li>
            <li> love this sponge!!!  </li>
            <li> Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice!</li>
            <li> As good as a beauty blender!</li>
            <li> It creates a beautiful finish - no streaks whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> My foundation has never looked more flawless and it blends my makeup perfectly for an amazing price!</li>
            <li> I found out about it on a beauty channel on youtube and am really happy that I purchased one.  </li>
            <li> Works great for applying liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great knockoff of the beautyblender.</li>
            <li> It works great with my foundations and bb creams.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for foundation with a thicker or thinner consistency.</li>
            <li> The great thing that it is affordable.  </li>
            <li> This works great in place of the $20 Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> , it has a point and an angle great for working under the eye area.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the very popular make up sponge that everyone talks about (BB).  </li>
            <li> This sponge is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t stomach spending $20 for a beauty blender, so I wanted to find a good alternative, which this is.</li>
            <li> The sponge is soo good</li>
            <li> Works just as good as the Beta Blender for  fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> but after a while (9 months or so - and I took good care of it, cleansing it in soap &amp; olive oil, which I read is a good way to preserve the brushes) but the fibers started coming out - every day</li>
            <li> Good deal</li>
            <li> Good dupe</li>
            <li> Mine is the real deal, works beautifully for a flawless airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> Just as good, or even better, than the $25 Beauty Blender sold at Sephora!  </li>
            <li> so great better then the beauty blender and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this works BETTER than the Beauty Blender!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that it is a perfect swap, but is pretty close.</li>
            <li> Better than my beauty blender!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This sponge is amazing, even better than the beauty blender for 1/3 of the cost!</li>
            <li> But this is amazing</li>
            <li> This sponge works great, my foundation and concealer go on smooth and it makes everything look nice</li>
            <li> start off by using warm water to soak my sponge</li>
            <li> Real techniques is a great company with great products.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I liked it a lot</li>
            <li> Even if you soak them in warm water over &amp; over, they won&#x27;t soften so</li>
            <li> and it gives me very even coverage that looks flawless.  </li>
            <li> Applies and blends perfect, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> but mine is bran new and already is peeling while hers is perfect cut edges</li>
            <li> Very please with purchase :) Makes your make up flawless.</li>
            <li> So I looked online for recommendations for a good dupe and found many Youtube makeup women say this one was almost better.  </li>
            <li> Cons; the sponge was very easy to tear.</li>
            <li> however, this is the best one I&#x27;ve had thus far.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this sponge!</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to get out the excess soap before you use it on your skin again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this sponge.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this, makeup must have...</li>
            <li> and I like some more than others....</li>
            <li> this is way better in my opinion.</li>

            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love the way it blends my foundation ..</li>

            <li> and I love it.  </li>

            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> I quite love this sponge.  </li>
            <li> Better than the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> And a way better price.</li>
            <li> and I do love it.</li>
            <li> but I will gladly repurchase another one without hesitation.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite beauty blender and I have try them</li>
            <li> My favorite out of all sponges</li>
            <li> so I can use the &#x27;$3.50 off $10 or more item&amp;#34; coupon.  </li>
            <li> it a try am sure you&#x27;ll be converted.</li>
            <li> Love the sponge needed a replacement.</li>

            <li> I bought it better then</li>
            <li> I love it.% 100 recomend.</li>
            <li> It smooths and blends better than any brush.</li>
            <li> I feel that it absorbs more of my foundation but applies it well.  </li>
            <li> I love this make up sponge.</li>
            <li> and they took off more product</li>
            <li> IMHO, the denser sponges provide better coverage of your foundation, concealer and contour. 2.)</li>
            <li> It gives a better finish with bb creams and foundations than my fingers or a brush.</li>
            <li> And I think it&#x27;s sturdier than the beauty blender, so I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> A great product from Real Techniques.</li>
            <li> I bought so many alternatives to the BeautyBleder because I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend $20 on it.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, it gives you a flawless application, and it&#x27;s easy to clean and disinfect.</li>
            <li> and it had pretty good reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So easy to use, so easy to clean, I really do love these!</li>
            <li> /&gt;So easy to use, so easy to clean, I really do love these!</li>
            <li> It gave me a flawless finish with my full coverage Kat von d makeup and almost airbrushed finish with my sheer Revlon foundation...</li>
            <li> And the reviews on this Real Techniques is, across the board, generally as good as Beauty Blender reviews.</li>
            <li> Original beauty blender is much much MUCH better with blending.</li>
            <li> so amazing I love all Real Techniques products and look forward to owning all the line.</li>
            <li> Easy as pie to use.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and the makeup blends amazing!</li>
            <li> this sponge is nice, but it ripped with the first wash.</li>
            <li> I use to put my liquid foundation with my finger and comparing it to this sponge is a huge difference and improvement, just dab it on your face and it looks so pressional.</li>
            <li> I use it to apply my under eye concealer and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> Smooth application</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean with Dawn dish washing liquid or baby shampoo.  </li>
            <li> THE FLAT SIDE IS INGENIOUS!!  </li>
            <li> First off let me say that I absolutely love this sponge.</li>
            <li> clean my sponge</li>
            <li> I do not know how easily it clean yet.  </li>
            <li> a lot softer and easier to clean.</li>
            <li> However I use revlon CS foundation and it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to clean.</li>
            <li> easy to clean and use I love this sponge, i this sponge enhances your foundation to perfection I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They are not like makeup sponges I&#x27;ve had before, but rather they really do blend and perfect your foundation and other cream and liquid products, its amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought another for a friend.  </li>
            <li> many months ago I bought this Real Techniques sponge.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of like using a soft plastic utensil to apply foundation.  </li>
            <li> It was nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and works as it should.</li>
            <li> I simply get it nice and soaked and use some antibacterial liquid handsoap to clean it....</li>
            <li> 😃😃  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> I was interested in trying this one since it is significantly cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Exactly how it was suppose to be!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled because it has quickly become one of my essential beauty tools.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little tool for applying my foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li> So worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Guess who&#x27;ll me ordering $30 worth of sponges to replace that one now-worthless brush?</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> This is good but be careful it rips when bloated with water.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t compare it to the real beauty blender, but I have tried cheaper no brand ones from the beauty supply store and this Real Techniques one is definitely better than those.</li>
            <li> This sponge, like many of its counterparts, is difficult to get completely clean, but is still a great makeup addition.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and the flat side really is great.</li>
            <li> Other dan price d sponge is good</li>
            <li> I find myself picking it up way more often than I thought I would, and it saves my more expensive beauty blender for my more important makeup days.</li>
            <li> To be honest, it&#x27;s the same as a beauty blender just shaped different and the price is much better.</li>
            <li> Great substitute for the more expensive Beauty Blender product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore these makeup sponges!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s more sheer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the beauty blender, and might never need to because Real Techniques gives me an airbrushed look!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the more expensive versions, but Real Techniques makes a great make-up sponge.  </li>
            <li> It gives me such amazing FULL coverage (good if you wanna cover up acne or dark spots) Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great small sponge, gets the job done!</li>
            <li> It also has the nice flat side which I use to set my under eye concealer with a light yellow powder.  </li>
            <li> The beauty blender is a bit to stiff for me when blending out my foundation, but this one is so easy to use and smooth on my makeup!</li>
            <li> love this product and the flat side  </li>
            <li> While I do feel like it holds more water and doesn&#x27;t wring out as easily, I still like it and will use it instead of the more expensive version.</li>
            <li> and this was the only thing I could get a clean application with !</li>
            <li> , is super soft, and does not soak up the foundation!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that the sponge is as fine as the original beauty blender (pink), but the contouring on this guy - like the flat edge and the more rounded tip and the longer sides just make it SO much easier to work with.</li>
            <li> The flat end works good on my chin too if it happens to be red (which it often is).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased some very inexpensive, smaller (4-pack) of sponges recently just cuz the price was so good</li>
            <li> If you are going for more coverage I would suggest using it dry.  </li>
            <li> you must dampen slightly in order for the sponge to be effective.</li>
            <li> I could have paid less than this for the real one:/ these girls writing these amazing reviews</li>
            <li> wash after every use, I use a drop of facial cleanser and it works fine.</li>
            <li> and then i gently squeeze out the excess water.  </li>
            <li> and it worked really well</li>
            <li> Product got shipped fast and works well.</li>
            <li> really upgraded the quality of my makeup application and the sped as well</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> also fast shipping</li>
            <li> Much cheaper alternative to a beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I really like how your foundation never looks caked on or overdone.</li>
            <li> I just tap it beginning in the center of my face and working out, making sure to get every nook and cranny.  </li>
            <li> I really like this blender.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other knockoffs that are slightly better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> The price is better then other sponges and works just as well.</li>
            <li> the pointed tip is great for around your eyes, nostrils, and typical redness areas that tend to be harder to get into.  </li>
            <li> It stains quickly but thats the only downfall.</li>
            <li> I definitely will be buying more of these in the future!</li>
            <li> This sponge is more dense and easier to handle than the more expensive version out there.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the beauty bender is better than this one, although much more expensive.</li>
            <li> you have a cream blush I have found you can use the sharp angle coming off the flat end (and long side) to dip into a cream blush in a pinch and feather it out beautifully.  </li>
            <li> The positive reviews on this led me to try Real Techniques after it was time to switch out my 100% Pure Makeup Blender (looks and works similarly to the beauty blender from what I&#x27;ve read).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is nice because at this stage the sponge is most wet, so it makes my primer glide on effortlessly since they can be sort of thick, it also makes use of a tiny amount of product over my whole face, so I really do recommend it for this use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shape of it you can use on different areas of face (obviously) - and it&#x27;s super, super soft which makes it like heaven to work with.  </li>
            <li> i love it use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I normally used my fingers to apply foundation</li>
            <li> I bought this sponge more than a few months ago</li>
            <li> In places that need extra coverage I can go ahead and use the flat side to sort of blot in a little more coverage and have it still look smooth without caking on a ton of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling to master my new contour kit</li>
            <li> I have used those cheap white triangle looking ones that are sold at regular beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> I loved it more than my Beauty Blender and so much less expensive.</li>
            <li> The flat side is great for dabbing on foundation and the rounded side comes to a point to reach small places like the inner corner of your eye.  </li>
            <li> It provides a very natural and even finish.</li>
            <li> and hers is months old!</li>
            <li> I was accidentally sent two sponges( and charged for two), but after testing out the first one I had to keep the second.  </li>
            <li> You can pick this exact same sponge up at WALMART for $5.99!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Big fan of real techniques!</li>
            <li> It works good, but not very very good.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend the little cheap ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps the product get into every little crevice and makes it all even and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This sponge is great and will definitely replace that expensive beauty sponge.</li>
            <li> obviously have never used a real one of these sponges.</li>
            <li> You can sometimes find these in stores on sale, such as Walgreens, but they sell out extremely fast.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and my makeup looks airbrushed afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and blends everything in with no streaks and no build-up at the hairline.  </li>
            <li> But WOW, this product blew me away.</li>
            <li> It sheers the coverage out so that it looks really natural</li>
            <li> Pro; natural looking makeup application.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to say that I am not a fan of loose powder until now.</li>
            <li> but it takes less than a minute if you use a quick rinse soap/shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used regular latex sponges in the past but they always absorb too much makeup and don&#x27;t give me the same smooth, even coverage as this RT sponge.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super firm and just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> but this sponge helps the different shades of foundation blend seamlessly.</li>
            <li> I only wear makeup for special  occasions and second time using this sponge it ripped in half</li>
            <li> So it must be made from some other material because the old and new are nothing at all alike.  </li>
            <li> my guess is that it could be a fake product or real techniques might have changed the texture of the product , therefore I recommend that you order or buy directly from certified sellers eg: boots, ulta.com or directly from real techniques site .</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical before buying this, but I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used much sponges usually just my hands.however</li>
            <li> Then I go ahead and apply my primer with the short long side and let it soak into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use the flat edge to blend under my eyes and the pointed tip to get around my nose and eye sockets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to make it hold water so it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the real thing which I feel is what it&#x27;s really lacking.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the infamous Beutyblender, but I can&#x27;t imagine that it&#x27;s any better than this little orange miracle sponge.  </li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s a fake, my friend bought a real one of these sponges and we wet them both and not only was mine smaller than hers</li>
            <li> I recently switched out my toxic cream to powder foundation to a less toxic loose powder foundation.</li>
            <li> The  item I recieved is different from the previous miracle sponge that I have ordered from boots ,</li>
            <li> It makes for a polished look with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> Be careful if you have a lot of product still on there if you do this.  </li>
            <li> I restrain from doing this too often as I find blush color harder to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trick is to wet it when you want to use it and blot it about your face to blend lines, streaks, and makeup.  </li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend asks if a makeup artist came over to do my makeup.it&#x27;s that good.simply wet and wring the sponge them dab the sponge unto the powder and apply and be amazed.mine is beginning to show some wear and tear</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money paying almost or double that on Amazon!!!!!</li>
            <li> I wet the sponge and use a towel to squeeze out almost all of the moisture.  </li>
            <li> I will go over the edges with the long side that I previously used for foundation to help blend it effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> Usually by the time I&#x27;m done with my foundation there isn&#x27;t much left in the sponge, so keep this in mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Denser feel, and a little harder to use but works just as well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical buying this sponge because I&#x27;ve never had too much luck with sponges</li>
            <li> Their Prime membership is turning into them working the shipping into the product base price and just not worth it on many things anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one for probably a year and it ripped slightly about halfway through.</li>
            <li> In WalMart it was less than $6.00.  </li>
            <li> Makes foundation less of a hassle.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s getting a little beat up</li>
            <li> I will be picking up a few extras because of the price</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t stiff at all</li>
            <li> I usually buy sponges in the $5 range</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I had been using a Sigma angled foundation brush to apply - usually a liquid foundation or a cream.  </li>
            <li> Not sure,</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;ve used a few beauty sponges and know that the one raved about is the Beauty Blender, but there is no way I am paying $20 for a sponge!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a MAC foundation brush for at least two years thinking that it was &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a lot less expensive in a drugstore like Walmart or Target.  </li>
            <li> Too tough.</li>
            <li> but it does thin the foundation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad</li>
            <li> However, there is nothing wrong.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Anyway, all the others were a disappointment except for this one.</li>
            <li> Because the price is outrageous for a SPONGE.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this sponge is nice, but it ripped with the first wash. it hasn&#x27;t torn any further since then. but i don&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
            <li> It works okay. I&#x27;ve used other knockoffs that are slightly better and cheaper. I&#x27;ve had this one for probably a year and it ripped slightly about halfway through. It&#x27;s difficult to make it hold water so it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the real thing which I feel is what it&#x27;s really lacking.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore these makeup sponges! They are not like makeup sponges I&#x27;ve had before, but rather they really do blend and perfect your foundation and other cream and liquid products, its amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start off by using warm water to soak my sponge and then i gently squeeze out the excess water.  Then I go ahead and apply my primer with the short long side and let it soak into my skin.  It is nice because at this stage the sponge is most wet, so it makes my primer glide on effortlessly since they can be sort of thick, it also makes use of a tiny amount of product over my whole face, so I really do recommend it for this use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I let my primer soak in I add my foundation using the longer side of the sponge.  In places that need extra coverage I can go ahead and use the flat side to sort of blot in a little more coverage and have it still look smooth without caking on a ton of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need concealer the pointed tip is great for around your eyes, nostrils, and typical redness areas that tend to be harder to get into.  The flat end works good on my chin too if it happens to be red (which it often is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I put my blush, highlighter, or bronzer on I will go over the edges with the long side that I previously used for foundation to help blend it effortlessly.  It makes for a polished look with minimal effort.  Be careful if you have a lot of product still on there if you do this.  Usually by the time I&#x27;m done with my foundation there isn&#x27;t much left in the sponge, so keep this in mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a cream blush I have found you can use the sharp angle coming off the flat end (and long side) to dip into a cream blush in a pinch and feather it out beautifully.  I restrain from doing this too often as I find blush color harder to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean my sponge I simply get it nice and soaked and use some antibacterial liquid handsoap to clean it....nothing fancy and it works well.  Just make sure to get out the excess soap before you use it on your skin again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So easy to use, so easy to clean, I really do love these! I like to pick them up when ulta has online sales (as I haven&#x27;t found them in store anywhere)!to get out the excess soap before you use it on your skin again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So easy to use, so easy to clean, I really do love these! I like to pick them up when ulta has online sales (as I haven&#x27;t found them in store anywhere)!</li>
            <li> I bought the beauty blender awhile ago and it worked really well and I thought I would give this &#x27;dupe&#x27; a try. I believe it&#x27;s a fake, my friend bought a real one of these sponges and we wet them both and not only was mine smaller than hers but mine is bran new and already is peeling while hers is perfect cut edges and hers is months old! I&#x27;m sad bc I could have paid less than this for the real one:/ these girls writing these amazing reviews obviously have never used a real one of these sponges. Sad:/</li>
            <li> It definitely speeds up my morning routine, however cleaning it often can be a pain.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge.  I love it so much I bought another for a friend.  I found out about it on a beauty channel on youtube and am really happy that I purchased one.  The flat side is great for dabbing on foundation and the rounded side comes to a point to reach small places like the inner corner of your eye.  Dampening it and squeezing out the excess water prior to using helps it spread evenly but it does thin the foundation so it&#x27;s more sheer.  If you are going for more coverage I would suggest using it dry.  I do not know how easily it clean yet.  I&#x27;ve only rinsed it each use and have not used any cleaners on it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a lot less expensive in a drugstore like Walmart or Target.  In WalMart it was less than $6.00.  I probably won&#x27;t purchase it from Amazon again just for that reason.  Their Prime membership is turning into them working the shipping into the product base price and just not worth it on many things anymore.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t stomach spending $20 for a beauty blender, so I wanted to find a good alternative, which this is. I use it to apply my under eye concealer and it looks fantastic. Would definitely recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Too tough. Original beauty blender is much much MUCH better with blending.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical before buying this, but I&#x27;m so glad I did! So worth the money I paid for it. I later on then bought the actual beauty blender it&#x27;s self and it didn&#x27;t compare. The beauty blender is a bit to stiff for me when blending out my foundation, but this one is so easy to use and smooth on my makeup!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this, makeup must have...</li>
            <li> love this sponge!!!  I usually buy sponges in the $5 range and I like some more than others....however, this is the best one I&#x27;ve had thus far.  I was accidentally sent two sponges( and charged for two), but after testing out the first one I had to keep the second.  It stains quickly but thats the only downfall.</li>
            <li> The  item I recieved is different from the previous miracle sponge that I have ordered from boots , the color &amp; texture is totally different , so my guess is that it could be a fake product or real techniques might have changed the texture of the product , therefore I recommend that you order or buy directly from certified sellers eg: boots, ulta.com or directly from real techniques site .</li>
            <li> This is a must for contouring! I&#x27;ve been struggling to master my new contour kit but this sponge helps the different shades of foundation blend seamlessly. You do need to wash the sponge often to prevent make up build-up but it takes less than a minute if you use a quick rinse soap/shampoo. You can sometimes find these in stores on sale, such as Walgreens, but they sell out extremely fast. I definitely recommend this both for novice and pros- it&#x27;s perfect for everyone!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> this sponge is the bomb.com. i love it use it everyday. i reach for it over my beauty blender. this is way better in my opinion. a lot softer and easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Not the beauty blender but it&#x27;ll get the job done !</li>
            <li> As good as a beauty blender!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is so soft and my makeup looks airbrushed afterwards. It only lasts a couple weeks before it starts falling apart.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works great for applying liquid foundation. Love it</li>
            <li> Smooth application but I prefer using my foundation brush instead. I felt like this soaked up all of my foundation.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described.  Mine is the real deal, works beautifully for a flawless airbrushed look.Seller was From LTRHOLDINGS (Fulfilled by Amazon).  Thank you...</li>
            <li> totally Innnnnnn loveeeee with ittt</li>
            <li> The sponge is soo good but it 5.47 in tomthumb ... So 4 stars.. Other dan price d sponge is good</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Loved it!!!!</li>
            <li> Product got shipped fast and works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great knockoff of the beautyblender. The sponge didn&#x27;t break me out or irritate my skin. It works great with my foundations and bb creams. It&#x27;s great for foundation with a thicker or thinner consistency. It made my foundation on my skin look flawless. The great thing that it is affordable.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on a recommendation from a MUA friend of mine.. excellent!! I love the way it blends my foundation .. really upgraded the quality of my makeup application and the sped as well</li>
            <li> I was looking for this sponge everytime I went to Ulta, and they were always sold out, so decided to buy it through Amazon because it was cheaper shipping than Ulta.com and I must say I cannot be happier with this buy. It is so soft and the makeup blends amazing!</li>
            <li> so great better then the beauty blender and cheaper. so amazing I love all Real Techniques products and look forward to owning all the line.</li>
            <li> This sponge is great and will definitely replace that expensive beauty sponge. Provides a flawless application, blends like a dream and definitely exceeded my expectations. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I love it.  The shape is awesome and I like it better than the Beauty Blender.  It&#x27;s soft and blends everything in with no streaks and no build-up at the hairline.  You can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality either.  I will DEFO repurchase this again when I need another.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as the Beta Blender for  fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> The Best beauty blender sponge!! Shaped specifically for applying different areas of the face</li>
            <li> This works great in place of the $20 Beauty Blender. While I do feel like it holds more water and doesn&#x27;t wring out as easily, I still like it and will use it instead of the more expensive version. It does what it should.</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool for applying my foundation and concealer. The price is better then other sponges and works just as well. I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This sponge is AMAZING!  The positive reviews on this led me to try Real Techniques after it was time to switch out my 100% Pure Makeup Blender (looks and works similarly to the beauty blender from what I&#x27;ve read). I&#x27;ve never tried the beauty blender, and might never need to because Real Techniques gives me an airbrushed look! I use it to blend my concealer, foundation, and even when I do the baking technique with powder! The shape is perfect and I can reach every corner of my face! The best part is it&#x27;s not $20. Love love love.</li>
            <li> Perfect for blending foundation!</li>
            <li> Item as described. Fast shipping. Great substitute for the more expensive Beauty Blender product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this sponge! I wanted the beauty blender, but didn&#x27;t want to spend the $$ on one. I normally used my fingers to apply foundation but it wasn&#x27;t working so well. But this is amazing it blends every well, is super soft, and does not soak up the foundation!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this works BETTER than the Beauty Blender!</li>
            <li> I quite love this sponge.  I&#x27;ve seen the more expensive versions, but Real Techniques makes a great make-up sponge.  The trick is to wet it when you want to use it and blot it about your face to blend lines, streaks, and makeup.  This sponge, like many of its counterparts, is difficult to get completely clean, but is still a great makeup addition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best of all sponges and brushes I&#x27;ve used to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> I do not see that it does what people say about it!! However, there is nothing wrong. It works good, but not very very good.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical buying this sponge because I&#x27;ve never had too much luck with sponges and I&#x27;m used to using brushes to apply my foundation. But WOW, this product blew me away. My foundation has never looked more flawless and it blends my makeup perfectly for an amazing price! I definitely will be buying more of these in the future!</li>
            <li> This sponge is amazing, even better than the beauty blender for 1/3 of the cost! It gave me a flawless finish with my full coverage Kat von d makeup and almost airbrushed finish with my sheer Revlon foundation... In about 2 minutes! It takes me about 3 times longer to achieve the same look with my $34 brush from sephora!! Guess who&#x27;ll me ordering $30 worth of sponges to replace that one now-worthless brush?</li>
            <li> Better than the beauty blender. And a way better price. Real techniques is a great company with great products.</li>
            <li> I bought this sponge more than a few months ago and I do love it. However I use revlon CS foundation and it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to clean. It&#x27;s starting to wear and tear but I will gladly repurchase another one without hesitation.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite beauty blender and I have try them all this will always be my go to in the future also fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very nice! My favorite out of all sponges</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!! I loved it more than my Beauty Blender and so much less expensive.😃😃😃  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Buy ASAP</li>
            <li> I had been using a Sigma angled foundation brush to apply - usually a liquid foundation or a cream.  Anyway, I liked it a lot but after a while (9 months or so - and I took good care of it, cleansing it in soap &amp; olive oil, which I read is a good way to preserve the brushes) but the fibers started coming out - every day when I&#x27;d use it, that was happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... many months ago I bought this Real Techniques sponge.  It is perfect for application!  The shape of it you can use on different areas of face (obviously) - and it&#x27;s super, super soft which makes it like heaven to work with.  It creates a beautiful finish - no streaks whatsoever.  And it&#x27;s simple to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every day now and it&#x27;s getting a little beat up so will order another one.  I&#x27;m going to see if Ulta has it in stock so I can use the &#x27;$3.50 off $10 or more item&amp;#34; coupon.  Not sure, but it&#x27;s worth a shot.  - Wait... I just pulled up Ulta website and these sell for $5.99 each.  I just don&#x27;t know which Ulta stores carry them....  Good deal tho!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend this sponge.  I purchased some very inexpensive, smaller (4-pack) of sponges recently just cuz the price was so good and it had pretty good reviews.  But no.... no.... no.....  They&#x27;re super firm and just don&#x27;t work.  Even if you soak them in warm water over &amp; over, they won&#x27;t soften so it&#x27;s kind of like using a soft plastic utensil to apply foundation.  No.  Don&#x27;t recommend the little cheap ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW I&#x27;ve not purchased the Beauty Blender and I won&#x27;t.  Ever.  Because the price is outrageous for a SPONGE.  And the reviews on this Real Techniques is, across the board, generally as good as Beauty Blender reviews.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used much sponges usually just my hands.however I have used those cheap white triangle looking ones that are sold at regular beauty supply stores. First off let me say that I absolutely love this sponge. I recently switched out my toxic cream to powder foundation to a less toxic loose powder foundation. I&#x27;ll be the first to say that I am not a fan of loose powder until now. I have never gotten a finish like this before. Even my boyfriend asks if a makeup artist came over to do my makeup.it&#x27;s that good.simply wet and wring the sponge them dab the sponge unto the powder and apply and be amazed.mine is beginning to show some wear and tear and I will have to purchase another.absolutely love this product and the flat side  is amazing.would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not affiliated with this product in anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try am sure you&#x27;ll be converted.</li>
            <li> This sponge works great, my foundation and concealer go on smooth and it makes everything look nice I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking cakey.</li>
            <li> I love this! Much cheaper alternative to a beauty blender. It is so soft and the flat side really is great. It gives me such amazing FULL coverage (good if you wanna cover up acne or dark spots) Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Just as good, or even better, than the $25 Beauty Blender sold at Sephora!  Very please with purchase :) Makes your make up flawless.</li>
            <li> As expected. Love the sponge needed a replacement. It came quickly and works as it should.</li>
            <li> This is good but be careful it rips when bloated with water.</li>
            <li> this spong shredded on me like a piece of paper after several washing ???</li>
            <li> This sponge is more dense and easier to handle than the more expensive version out there.  It also has the nice flat side which I use to set my under eye concealer with a light yellow powder.  Love this and such a great price!!</li>
            <li> Denser feel, and a little harder to use but works just as well. You just dab and roll the product onto your face rather than the beauty blender where you just dab dab dab. It&#x27;s a dab and roll dab and roll technique. Good dupe but I prefer B.B. over this.</li>
            <li> This is a great sponge! It provides a very natural and even finish. It feel dreamy. I really like how your foundation never looks caked on or overdone. But, that being said. You can pick this exact same sponge up at WALMART for $5.99!!!!!!!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money paying almost or double that on Amazon!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it better then beuthy.blender I love it.% 100 recomend.</li>
            <li> I use to put my liquid foundation with my finger and comparing it to this sponge is a huge difference and improvement, just dab it on your face and it looks so pressional. easy to clean and use I love this sponge, i this sponge enhances your foundation to perfection I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t compare it to the real beauty blender, but I have tried cheaper no brand ones from the beauty supply store and this Real Techniques one is definitely better than those. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a MAC foundation brush for at least two years thinking that it was &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34;. This blows it out of the water. It smooths and blends better than any brush. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Easy as pie to use. Makes foundation less of a hassle.</li>
            <li> This is a lifesaver I use kat con d lock it foundation and this was the only thing I could get a clean application with !</li>
            <li> I have purchased the very popular make up sponge that everyone talks about (BB).  I was interested in trying this one since it is significantly cheaper.  I feel that it absorbs more of my foundation but applies it well.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it is a perfect swap, but is pretty close.</li>
            <li> Product came on time, well packaged and as described. I love this make up sponge. I was hesitant to try because years ago I tried the &#x60;wedgef&#x27; type sponges and they took off more product then they left on.  You need to know several things about using a blender type sponge. 1.) They are not all the same.  IMHO, the denser sponges provide better coverage of your foundation, concealer and contour. 2.) you must dampen slightly in order for the sponge to be effective. 3.) wash after every use, I use a drop of facial cleanser and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;ve used a few beauty sponges and know that the one raved about is the Beauty Blender, but there is no way I am paying $20 for a sponge!  NO WAY!  So I looked online for recommendations for a good dupe and found many Youtube makeup women say this one was almost better.  I think I would agree.  THE FLAT SIDE IS INGENIOUS!!  I use that on all of my face and the pointed end for around eyes.  It&#x27;s perfect.  I bought mine at Ulta for $5.99 several weeks ago.  I was in there yesterday and they were sold out!  I will be picking up a few extras because of the price and I like to wash them often.  I&#x27;ve washed the one I have several times and it&#x27;s still in great condition, but I still want extras!  It gives a better finish with bb creams and foundations than my fingers or a brush.</li>
            <li> Dare I say it? Better than my beauty blender! It&#x27;s not that the sponge is as fine as the original beauty blender (pink), but the contouring on this guy - like the flat edge and the more rounded tip and the longer sides just make it SO much easier to work with. I find myself picking it up way more often than I thought I would, and it saves my more expensive beauty blender for my more important makeup days. And I think it&#x27;s sturdier than the beauty blender, so I love it. Total gem.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the infamous Beutyblender, but I can&#x27;t imagine that it&#x27;s any better than this little orange miracle sponge.  I wet the sponge and use a towel to squeeze out almost all of the moisture.  I then use it to blend my foundation.  It sheers the coverage out so that it looks really natural and it gives me very even coverage that looks flawless.  I just tap it beginning in the center of my face and working out, making sure to get every nook and cranny.  I use the flat edge to blend under my eyes and the pointed tip to get around my nose and eye sockets. It doesn&#x27;t absorb the makeup at all but buffs it out perfectly.  I also use it to blend concealer.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my concealer doesn&#x27;t get cakey when I use this sponge.  It helps the product get into every little crevice and makes it all even and smooth.  I&#x27;ve used regular latex sponges in the past but they always absorb too much makeup and don&#x27;t give me the same smooth, even coverage as this RT sponge.  So it must be made from some other material because the old and new are nothing at all alike.  I see no need to invest in a Beautyblender now.  I got this RT sponge with an Ulta coupon and I&#x27;m thrilled because it has quickly become one of my essential beauty tools.  I absolutely love it.  It&#x27;s easy to clean with Dawn dish washing liquid or baby shampoo.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Pro; natural looking makeup application.  Cons; the sponge was very easy to tear.</li>
            <li> Great small sponge, gets the job done! A great product from Real Techniques.</li>
            <li> Applies and blends perfect, easy to clean. To be honest, it&#x27;s the same as a beauty blender just shaped different and the price is much better.</li>
            <li> I bought so many alternatives to the BeautyBleder because I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend $20 on it. Anyway, all the others were a disappointment except for this one. It was nice and soft. I wasn&#x27;t stiff at all and it blended my makeup just as well as the Beauty Blender. I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li> I really like this blender. Not only does this work well, it has a point and an angle great for working under the eye area. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Exactly how it was suppose to be!</li>
            <li> Big fan of real techniques! Love it! I don&#x27;t think the beauty bender is better than this one, although much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I just love it. It&#x27;s soft, it gives you a flawless application, and it&#x27;s easy to clean and disinfect.</li>
            <li> Well, this sponge didn&#x27;t do anything for me but I probably don&#x27;t know how to use it. Waste of money for me. I should have sticked with my kabuki brushes</li>
            <li> It fell apart after I think 4 washes. I won&#x27;t repurchase this item.</li>
            <li> I only wear makeup for special  occasions and second time using this sponge it ripped in half</li>
