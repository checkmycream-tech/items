            <li>, it has a good grip to it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good brush to brush your waves this here is the one.</li>

            <li>I am happy with it, much better than cheaper ones that are just plastic bristles</li>
            <li>More energy is put into the retail box&lt;br /&gt;than finding the boars!</li>

            <li>nice brush,</li>
            <li>Brushes well, gives a nice tingly feel on the scalp with each stroke.</li>
            <li>Nice brush.  </li>
            <li>The brush is really great for short hair and just excellent for wave building.</li>
            <li>more for no hair or very fine hair people.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still an ok brush though.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>My hair looks much better after using it.  </li>
            <li>Probably there are much better quality out there.  </li>
            <li>His Mom and Dad are going to love it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy 2 more of the Diane #8118 100% Boar Sterilized brushes.  </li>
            <li>The price was awesome, and to be honest I love the black stained handle.</li>
            <li>the quailty of the brush is pretty good</li>
            <li>It replaced my old brush and was great value.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the best $4.00 I have ever spent.  </li>
            <li>This is a good brush for the price, but don&#x27;t expect a nice solid wood handle.  </li>
            <li>This brush was perfect for my hair, I have very straight Asian hair.</li>
            <li>It brushes my hair and beard just fine, and it isn&#x27;t feminine.  </li>
            <li>great brush for you beard or short hair</li>
            <li>a light touch up</li>
            <li>I use it primarily in my beard</li>
            <li>Great value for the price, and yes the brush bristles are actually 100% boar&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li>i felt like the brush was made cheap and the writing on the brush came off imeditely bristles</li>
            <li>Most boar bristle brushes on here are twice as much.</li>
            <li>It is very light, but still very sturdy, so it actually is nice in that sense as it will not add extra weight to your bag.  </li>
            <li>I expected to pay $15 to $20 for a comparable replacement, so this was a nice find and a fantastic value.</li>
            <li>The bristles are the perfect combination of stiff and soft.</li>
            <li>They feel Just right.</li>
            <li>It has a nice black and gray line pattern and it&#x27;s fairly light in weight.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have large hands, but I need to grip the body of the brush instead of the handle to get a good grip (when hands are wet).</li>
            <li>Great brush for short hair or facial hair.</li>
            <li>I thought fine ment hard but its more like medium, overall a good product</li>
            <li>My Husband likes it very much and uses every day.</li>
            <li>This is the first boar bristle brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i hoped for.</li>
            <li>This is more than enough fulsome praise, so accept it</li>
            <li>Not real wood but nice brush</li>
            <li>Seems pretty well constructed.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The brush was exactly what I asked for.</li>
            <li>but IF you have coarse, thick hair, this brush should be perfect.  </li>
            <li>The color is more grey than it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>This brush is much softer than most natural bristle brushes; however, with my thinning hair it does a better job than the stiff brushes..  </li>
            <li>The brush I received is not the pictured brand of Diane brush and certainly isn&#x27;t 100% boar hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re expecting the bristles that almost hurt and don&#x27;t bend much, this ain&#x27;t the brush for you.</li>
            <li>Always had a nylon brush; thought I&#x27;d try real bristle.  </li>
            <li>This works, but isn&#x27;t as much better as I expected.</li>
            <li>i really like this brush</li>
            <li>it makes my hair look very shiney and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for smoothing out hair but doesn&#x27;t detangle and can&#x27;t really penetrate a thick layer.</li>
            <li>was a bit concerned about the number of bristles that came out when I first opened it,  but after brushing them out of the loose bristles it seems to be just fine.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good brush if you have thin hair.</li>
            <li>Do like the boar bristles and it is holding up well, so far, and the price is so very reasonable.</li>
            <li>but the bristles are 2 short for my epic beard, it is a nice hair brush for short hair though.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t close enough to what we had, but not a bad brush.  </li>
            <li>and I had been looking for this particular brush for awhile.</li>
            <li>Only worth it for a dollar in a store.</li>
            <li>, bristles on this one are very soft.</li>
            <li>I use it now for my 18 month old!</li>
            <li>Its too soft for a medium brush</li>
            <li>This brush was bought for my 3 year old grandson.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my brush for 2 days so far</li>
            <li>The handle is wood and the bristles are medium soft....</li>
            <li>There are lots of bristles, and the brush is soft to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this brush mainly for my facial hair.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a true mix of stiff an soft boar bristle.</li>
            <li>I keep my facial hair short and it works very well.</li>
            <li>it works fine, but for styling thick hair, you might as well use a spatula.</li>
            <li>so I can say the bristles are soft enough to use on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Since my teenage sons &amp;#34;commandeered&amp;#34;  my  old boar bristle brush from me for their upstairs bathroom</li>
            <li>While they&#x27;re thick and probably real, these bristles do more &amp;#34;pushing&amp;#34; of the hair than &amp;#34;brushing.&amp;#34; Of course, I&#x27;m a man, so I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s supposed to work</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the brush that&#x27;s going to end world hunger, but it&#x27;s a perfectly good brush and for 5 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li>Surprised at such quality for this very low price</li>
            <li>As long as you a looking for a soft brush, you will be pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> As long as you a looking for a soft brush, you will be pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did initially lose several bristles, as is expected, but I haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> Firm but not hard.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff and the brush is very masculine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as soft as the 8119, but not as firm as the 8159.</li>
            <li> However, do expect it to shed quite a few bristles upon first few uses.</li>
            <li> performed as necessary, minor loss of bristles but that was be expected.</li>
            <li> Not too hard, not too soft.</li>
            <li> No real complaints.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning, and I wear it medium short, and this brush treats my poor old scalp with tenderness, while keeping me neat.</li>
            <li> Other than losing bristles, it&#x27;s a sturdy brush.</li>
            <li> and i have pretty thin hair!</li>
            <li> One draw back is that the handle is too small.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to buy this type of brush without holding it and feeling the bristles, as they are all so different.  </li>
            <li> Small and bristles were too long for us.</li>
            <li> not worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to lay it down.</li>
            <li> Professionalism and Craftsmanship down the drain.</li>
            <li> firm enough to reach through your hair to the scalp, but not so stiff stiff as to be abrasive.  </li>
            <li> But, it can be messy, do to bristles falling out when you brush.</li>
            <li> Too small, it is almost baby size</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he does use it because the teeth of the brush are too hard.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works on people with hard hair</li>
            <li> When I bought this brush I also bought the Diane Men&#x27;s Reinforced Boar Bristle #8158... and let me tell you the bristles on this brush are really hard, to the point of scratching my scalp...</li>
            <li> I use it at least 3 times per day.</li>
            <li> Very small and the bristles were coming out.</li>
            <li> Y&#x27;all in the wave game know the brand and know the quality.</li>
            <li> He has a head of thick hair!!</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t feel weird leaving it on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> felt bad i just didnt like it.</li>
            <li> The worst &amp;#34;Boar Bristles&amp;#34; I have EVER encountered.</li>
            <li> Brush was horrible.!!</li>

            <li> I thought this would be a good beard brush but the bristles are 2 short for my epic beard, it is a nice hair brush for short hair though.</li>
            <li> This is the first boar bristle brush I&#x27;ve used. I bought it to use with grooming my beard. It works good for smoothing it out and shaping it and taking the wildness out. Most boar bristle brushes on here are twice as much. I gave it three stars cause it seems to shed bristles here and there, but hey it was 5 bucks. No real complaints.</li>
            <li> This is a medium brush. I bought because it&#x27;s smaller than the 8119, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same feel to it. The bristles are too close together. It&#x27;s still an ok brush though. It&#x27;s not as soft as the 8119, but not as firm as the 8159.</li>
            <li> Great brush for short hair or facial hair. But, it can be messy, do to bristles falling out when you brush. I purchased this brush mainly for my facial hair. I keep my facial hair short and it works very well. Not too hard, not too soft.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought it would be.  Still nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the brush that&#x27;s going to end world hunger, but it&#x27;s a perfectly good brush and for 5 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> My Husband likes it very much and uses every day.</li>
            <li> I got this brush as an add on, and I must say it is great. Exactly what i hoped for. I can&#x27;t express how happy I am with this. The bristles are the perfect combination of stiff and soft. (yes I recognise the contradiction). They feel Just right. The price was awesome, and to be honest I love the black stained handle. Love this.</li>
            <li> Bristles kept falling out. This product is trash.</li>
            <li> great brush for you beard or short hair</li>
            <li> Very good.  My hair looks much better after using it.  This is more than enough fulsome praise, so accept it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he does use it because the teeth of the brush are too hard. Maybe it works on people with hard hair but he does not like it.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush for the price, but don&#x27;t expect a nice solid wood handle.  It is very light, but still very sturdy, so it actually is nice in that sense as it will not add extra weight to your bag.  I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Its too soft for a medium brush</li>
            <li> The worst &amp;#34;Boar Bristles&amp;#34; I have EVER encountered. More energy is put into the retail box&lt;br /&gt;than finding the boars!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good brush if you have thin hair. It&#x27;s good for smoothing out hair but doesn&#x27;t detangle and can&#x27;t really penetrate a thick layer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting the bristles that almost hurt and don&#x27;t bend much, this ain&#x27;t the brush for you. While they&#x27;re thick and probably real, these bristles do more &amp;#34;pushing&amp;#34; of the hair than &amp;#34;brushing.&amp;#34; Of course, I&#x27;m a man, so I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s supposed to work, I didn&#x27;t read the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a light touch up it works fine, but for styling thick hair, you might as well use a spatula.</li>
            <li> The brush I received is not the pictured brand of Diane brush and certainly isn&#x27;t 100% boar hair. This is Garbage, The seller is trying to con you.</li>
            <li> When I grow out my hair I use this brush to lay it down. I also use it to assist with washing my hair.</li>
            <li> As long as you a looking for a soft brush, you will be pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good bargain.</li>
            <li> Too small, it is almost baby size</li>
            <li> I thought fine ment hard but its more like medium, overall a good product</li>
            <li> Always had a nylon brush; thought I&#x27;d try real bristle.  Probably there are much better quality out there.  This works, but isn&#x27;t as much better as I expected.</li>
            <li> Brush was horrible.!!</li>
            <li> Great brush, works well.</li>
            <li> nice brush,well made,....thanks</li>
            <li> Very good brush works well as advertised seems to be good quality and excellent value for the price, bristles on this one are very soft.</li>
            <li> This brush was bought for my 3 year old grandson. His Mom and Dad are going to love it. He has a head of thick hair!! It really is a great brush for the money......now if his dad doesn&#x27;t take it!!!</li>
            <li> I am happy with it, much better than cheaper ones that are just plastic bristles</li>
            <li> Replaced this brush for my husband. He&#x27;s only used it for 2 weeks and the bristles are already falling out.</li>
            <li> Solid brush.  I like the feel of the handle, it has a good grip to it. I use it primarily in my beard so I can say the bristles are soft enough to use on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit concerned about the number of bristles that came out when I first opened it,  but after brushing them out of the loose bristles it seems to be just fine.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price, and yes the brush bristles are actually 100% boar&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> Brushes well, gives a nice tingly feel on the scalp with each stroke.I use it at least 3 times per day.No brush hairs have detached itself and the bristles feel sturdy.</li>
            <li> I like this brush alot.  It replaced my old brush and was great value.  The bristles are a true mix of stiff an soft boar bristle.</li>
            <li> This brush is just what I was looking for. However, do expect it to shed quite a few bristles upon first few uses. I&#x27;ve used my brush for 2 days so far and it&#x27;s finally starting to stop losing bristles. Other than losing bristles, it&#x27;s a sturdy brush. I am quite happy with it. It has a nice black and gray line pattern and it&#x27;s fairly light in weight. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this brush.  It brushes my hair and beard just fine, and it isn&#x27;t feminine.  So I don&#x27;t feel weird leaving it on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Maybe the best $4.00 I have ever spent.  The handle is wood and the bristles are medium soft....firm enough to reach through your hair to the scalp, but not so stiff stiff as to be abrasive.  Since my teenage sons &amp;#34;commandeered&amp;#34;  my  old boar bristle brush from me for their upstairs bathroom I needed a replacement.  I expected to pay $15 to $20 for a comparable replacement, so this was a nice find and a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> performed as necessary, minor loss of bristles but that was be expected. The feel and design were excellent so nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> Its not the worst brush ever but its def not the best either. Even the writing on the brush has spelling errors. Professionalism and Craftsmanship down the drain. But hey it was 4.99 or something like dat.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a brush we already had that was coming apart.  It&#x27;s hard to buy this type of brush without holding it and feeling the bristles, as they are all so different.  This wasn&#x27;t close enough to what we had, but not a bad brush.  Just wasn&#x27;t what we were hoping it would be.  Small and bristles were too long for us.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  The bristles are stiff and the brush is very masculine. The color is more grey than it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> i use it for my coat.&lt;br /&gt;..............................&lt;br /&gt; , , , ,, ,, , , ,, , , , ,, ,,</li>
            <li> This is a Diane 8119. What else needs to be said?  Y&#x27;all in the wave game know the brand and know the quality. I did initially lose several bristles, as is expected, but I haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 71. My hair is thinning, and I wear it medium short, and this brush treats my poor old scalp with tenderness, while keeping me neat.</li>
            <li> Not real wood but nice brush</li>
            <li> not worth it for the price. Very small and the bristles were coming out. Only worth it for a dollar in a store.</li>
            <li> more for no hair or very fine hair people. it cant get through mine and i have pretty thin hair! I use it now for my 18 month old!</li>
            <li> The Diane Men&#x27;s Club Brush 100% Boar Bristles is an excellent brush.  I do have fine hair, and this brush is absolutely perfect and does a great job.  There are lots of bristles, and the brush is soft to the scalp.  When I bought this brush I also bought the Diane Men&#x27;s Reinforced Boar Bristle #8158... and let me tell you the bristles on this brush are really hard, to the point of scratching my scalp... but IF you have coarse, thick hair, this brush should be perfect.  I&#x27;m going to buy 2 more of the Diane #8118 100% Boar Sterilized brushes.  Excellent Product and well made.</li>
            <li> Surprised at such quality for this very low price</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good brush to brush your waves this here is the one.</li>
            <li> Nice brush.  Medium stiffness.  Seems pretty well constructed.  If the bristles fall out I will update this reveiw.  Great price, was an add on item.</li>
            <li> i really like this brush it makes my hair look very shiney and the quailty of the brush is pretty good</li>
            <li> This brush was perfect for my hair, I have very straight Asian hair. I think you should consider the hair type when purchasing these kinds of brushes. I have had it for 3 days and I am completely happy with it.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for. The brush is really great for short hair and just excellent for wave building.</li>
            <li> This brush is much softer than most natural bristle brushes; however, with my thinning hair it does a better job than the stiff brushes..  One draw back is that the handle is too small.  I don&#x27;t have large hands, but I need to grip the body of the brush instead of the handle to get a good grip (when hands are wet).</li>
            <li> i felt like the brush was made cheap and the writing on the brush came off imeditely bristles felt bad i just didnt like it.</li>
            <li> The brush was exactly what I asked for. It worked well and I had been looking for this particular brush for awhile.</li>
            <li> i ordered this brush for someone else and they loved it and said that they would purchase another on just like it.</li>
