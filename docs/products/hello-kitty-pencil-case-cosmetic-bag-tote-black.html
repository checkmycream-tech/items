            <li> I bought this tote cosmetic bag and I love it. If you are a hello kitty fan you will love it. It has hello kitty signs all over it. It can be use for all purpose. Because right now I have my phone and phone accessories in mine :)</li>
            <li> Useful for carrying cosmetics or my chargers, earphones, Bluetooth when not in use, convenient for all those small things you don&#x27;t want to get lost or tangled in your purse surfing the day.</li>
            <li> wire sticks out like it is not finished....stupid design--do NOT give to a young person, could put an eye out.</li>
            <li> I have this bag in other colors because I love the designs and the bags are big enough for what i need.&lt;br /&gt;Problem with this one (and only this one) is that the zipper is off by a bit, so zipping it up decreases the volume on the inside of the bag on one side. Not worth returning because it shipped from China. Still cute, and i don&#x27;t zip these often enough for it to really make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I got this makeup bag fast i really did not like the way it smells i had to put purfume in it. Its a good size fits the makeup i use. My sisters love the bag. If you see this amd want it get it the price is good nice too pretty.</li>
            <li> it fits my daughters pencils and lip gloss. the bag is bigger than what I thought it was going to be</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She like Hello Kitty stuff and she loved this. I was just one of those simple &amp;#34;I&#x27;m thinking of you gifts&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this bag it&#x27;s so cute light weight and love the way it opens this is a must have makeup bag. It&#x27;s very roomy.</li>
            <li> Awesome gift for a really good friend. She absolutely loved it! She has ample amount of space for all her brushes and products.</li>
            <li> Looks good, good price a little cheaper made then i would of liked to see but again very cheap in price so can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this for her make-up. It travels well and is easy cleanup. Holds everything that you need for your complete look.</li>
            <li> It is very cute. It would make a good present for hello kitty lovers. I got it for my friend.</li>

            <li> Cute Hello Kitty bag . It was a Christmas gift and my niece loved it! It will be a big hit at school with all the girls!</li>
            <li> One bag got cut because I let my youngest daughter open the package.  :(  Other than that my children love them.  They are very nice and would make great gifts.</li>
            <li> I like it. beautiful color and cutie style. Only one thing&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like is I hope they will make bigger than this.</li>
            <li> This item is very well made and is much prettier than it shows on the site. Have been looking for an item like this and was very well satisfied with the way it was looked and how well it was made. Very beautiful.</li>
