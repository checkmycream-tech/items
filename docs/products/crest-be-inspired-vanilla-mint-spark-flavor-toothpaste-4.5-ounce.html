            <li>amazing!!!</li>
            <li>This has the perfect blend.</li>
            <li>The BEST Toothpaste I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>If it is beneficial to dental health, why aren&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s teeth perfect since they are covertly dumping fluoride into our water supply and our produce is being grown with it?  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed with the quality. .</li>
            <li>These Crest flavors have been awesome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderfully light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this might be the best bet.  </li>
            <li>quite awesome!  </li>
            <li>It is delicious!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is the best!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s got a very pleasant taste.  </li>
            <li>Great flavor.  </li>
            <li>The great &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; feature makes this affordable.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great one to use for kids since I know</li>
            <li>A great way to start the day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the texture but the taste is great.</li>
            <li>Very nice taste with the crest protection.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste, however, is absolutely magical and even makes your breath smell delicious.</li>
            <li>the combination isn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li>I was SO excited!!!</li>
            <li>The taste is great, the kids, my husband and I love the flavor!  </li>
            <li>Very good and flavorful, but the chocolate mint is still my favorite.</li>
            <li>The good news is that I switched to a xylitol toothpaste</li>
            <li>I am just delighted with it.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I anticipated.</li>
            <li>And the lime spearmint variety is almost as good, tasting like a mint mojito.</li>
            <li>I used to buy Crest Vanilla Mint toothpaste and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It is also not the best at keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>; Best tasting toothpaste I have ever found, makes your breath smell great - and since we have gotten back on it we are happy to report No Cavities! :-)</li>
            <li>and I remember remarking to her that she smelled delicious right before realizing that it was my toothpaste lending her that smell.</li>
            <li>I love those!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I ever glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love the Vanilla Mint flavor!  </li>
            <li>Would also love to see these flavors in the restoration toothpastes too!  </li>
            <li>If fluoride is so good, why did Hitler use it to poison innocent people in the concentration camps??</li>
            <li>When I saw that it was emerging again, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>I would be more happy about it if Crest had coupled the flavor with a bit more functionality, maybe some whitening or anticavity.</li>
            <li>as what I had loved before.&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product as far as flavor, and performance.</li>
            <li>So this has a warm vanilla flavor followed by what I thought was the weakest mint.  </li>
            <li>This may be good for kids, but be warned they may be more inclined to eat the paste because of the taste.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice creamy taste and goes nicely as a lead in to my morning latte.</li>
            <li>So, if you liked the origional, don&#x27;t hesitate to try it.</li>
            <li>The vanilla is nice, but I wish I could find toothpaste that isn&#x27;t mint (or cinnamon).</li>
            <li>that was nice</li>
            <li>This is a nice change for toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t over power your tastebuds.</li>
            <li>Favorite toothpaste, good price on amazon.</li>
            <li>When I found this under its new name I was very happy.  </li>
            <li>This product has a fresh minty taste that is a great way to start off the day.  </li>
            <li>I was at first very satisfied with this toothpaste and loved the flavour.</li>
            <li>I love this one as hell!!!&lt;br /&gt;cause</li>
            <li>When my husband went to brush his teeth that night, he came running out of the bathroom with a foamy toothpaste filled mouth and shouted &amp;#34;You found it!</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of the Chocolate Flavors and Vanilla.</li>
            <li>I love the vanilla mint flavor, and you can&#x27;t find it everywhere.</li>
            <li>We LOVE this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>OK so I tried all three</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d love this (it kinda taste like those vanilla tootsie rolls with a minty taste).</li>
            <li>The chocolate version is much better</li>
            <li>The Dr. Collins toothpaste sold on Amazon is OK, but this is better.</li>
            <li>no matter how much I enjoyed the flavor.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this toothpaste !</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I think it could use a tad more vanilla</li>
            <li>Favorite toothpaste every</li>
            <li>This one is more than tolerable.</li>
            <li>Even my teenagers love it, including my daughter who also doesn&#x27;t like mint because she says it burns her mouth.</li>
            <li>I love vanilla.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The flavor is not off putting nor is it inspiring.</li>
            <li>since bought the Mint Chocolate and found it to be much better.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my daughter&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>She loves the vanilla flavor and it gets her to brush her teeth more often.</li>
            <li>but this is better.</li>
            <li>Either way it&#x27;s a nice &amp; fun toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Good stuff, Simple fluoride toothpaste with a good taste/aftertaste.</li>
            <li>The flavor was mild and verging on delicious, and yet was perfect for both the adults and the sensitive toddler aged picky eater.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful flavor, and does not burn like many other toothpastes when you use them.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant, because, after all, it is still a mint toothpaste, but so many of the reviews said it was a light mint, so</li>
            <li>Good gentle taste, unlike the whitener varieties.</li>
            <li>Also, would love to see more flavors, as I really can&#x27;t stand the mint that is used in most toothpastes and it is so nice to be able to have fun flavors for adults and teens.  </li>
            <li>I need to put more on to get that clean feeling to my teeth.</li>
            <li>you haveissues with those strongly mint toothpastes that line the store shelves, give this a go.</li>
            <li>If you have kids or don&#x27;t like strong mint</li>
            <li>I do not like mint or strong flavored toothpaste</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fond of &#x27;vanilla coffee&#x27; in the morning but wasn&#x27;t fond of having a super minty taste in my mouth for an hour or more after brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>After years of lamenting the loss of a favorite flavor, I am happy to report that while this version of the vanilla mint is not as sweet (I found i had an old tube in my travel kit and was able to compare), it is much smoother.</li>
            <li>It IS minty, of course, but lightly so.</li>
            <li>the rest of my groceries is more than worth it.</li>
            <li>I used to get Crest Fresh Mint Baking Soda &amp; Peroxide Whitening, but like this product so much better</li>
            <li>We used it and liked it almost as much as the Crest brand.</li>
            <li>Beyond the great flavour, it&#x27;s pretty much normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It makes the mouth feel very clean and leaves your mouth feeling vanilla minty fresh.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh and very clean when I use Vanilla Mint Spark to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>I like the new mint chocolate much more!</li>
            <li>this one is about the same - great combo of mild mint and creamy vanilla...</li>
            <li>So maybe I&#x27;m easy to please, but finding my favorite toothpaste of all time really made my day.</li>
            <li>The texture is very nice in my mouth and the taste is not too sweet but just enough to know that it is vanilla.  </li>
            <li>I could not find anything else I liked and I tried many different kinds.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty bland but the flavor it does have is not the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a super strong mint which is great for someone with autism.</li>
            <li>So happy that Crest decided to return this to the market; it is the ONLY toothpaste I have ever truly liked since childhood and several decades of adulthood!</li>
            <li>reminds me of sweet mint orbits gum.  </li>
            <li>It tastes sweet to me but not to the point</li>
            <li>Some may find it a bit sweet</li>
            <li>Our whole family fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Then we weren&#x27;t able to get the Jason brand at a reasonable price anymore...</li>
            <li>They were used to their sweet kids&#x27; toothpastes but it saved her some room in the suitcase</li>
            <li>not bad</li>
            <li>my mouth feels so fresh and clean and the flavour</li>
            <li>But I still feel like I have a clean mouth and fresh breath afterwards</li>
            <li>(which is obviously super important).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I searched many stores hoping to find some last remaining inventory of what had become my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I quickly snatched up a tube to try at home.</li>
            <li>Luckily she likes it</li>
            <li>Like others I was a loyal buyer of the discontinued Expessions vanilla toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I started using the Tom&#x27;s of Maine strawberry kid&#x27;s toothpaste, which is sweet, but not overly so, but the one local store that carried it stopped carrying the kind with fluoride in it.</li>
            <li>For the first time in 6 years my mouth feels fresh and clean without me feeling queasy.</li>
            <li>but it seemed like any time I found one with a promising flavor, it was fluoride free.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to discover it was the same (or close to)</li>
            <li>I was able to try this flavor toothpaste through a BzzAgent campaign and I really enjoyed the flavor of this one and I expected to like it.</li>
            <li>and I am SO THRILLED that it is back!</li>
            <li>so I thought this would be something fun to try.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a super strong minty flavor, but it&#x27;s nice and mellow.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice change of pace from peppermint or plain spearmint toothpaste.</li>
            <li>since I dealt with hyperemesis gravidarum several years ago, I haven&#x27;t been able to handle super minty things.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited when I saw this new product.  </li>
            <li>I never really bought a toothpaste that I liked since then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I happened upon it, and I like it enough that having to order it online rather than buy it with</li>
            <li>- this is definitely the most muted flavor vs the lime or chocolate.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have Crest back!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be interested in a paired mouthwash but can&#x27;t seem to find that.</li>
            <li>a side note, the Be Dynamic Lime-Spearmint flavor is almost better than the Vanilla Mint.</li>
            <li>a side note, the Be Dynamic Lime-Spearmint flavor is almost better than the Vanilla Mint.</li>
            <li>, so glad it&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really missed the Vanilla Expressions toothpaste and this makes up for it!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li>I am soooooo glad they put a vanilla mint toothpaste back on the market.  </li>
            <li>This is good, but is less sweet and more minty than the previous Crest Whitening Expressions vanilla mint flavor.</li>
            <li>Overall I feel it does a great job at cleaning my teeth and gives me a different flavor than the normal mint.</li>
            <li>The old flavor seemed more equal parts sweet and mint and was \\&quot;grittier.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I remember it having slightly more vanilla flavor, but this is indeed pretty much the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but less vanilla and more minty than the old one.  </li>
            <li>It is less sweet, but with more vanilla flavor than Crest.</li>
            <li>it was listed on Amazon (as &amp;#34;not available&amp;#34;) and found hundreds of reviewers who missed Vanilla Mint as much as I did.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t love it enough to justify spending that much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that the price on this is finally comming down---hopefully it does not mean that it&#x27;s getting discontinued again (crosses fingers).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any amazing results of whiter teeth, less sensitivity or stronger enamel or whatever else</li>
            <li>I was clearly not the only fan of this beloved  toothpaste based on the prices and number of listings I found.</li>
            <li>with regular mint flavour my mouth gets spicy and I don´t really enjoy washing my teeths, but</li>
            <li>It seems much stronger than it ever was pre-pregnancy.</li>
            <li>- I was absolutely mortified.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste has really helped with that.  </li>
            <li>I was really hopping that this would work out</li>
            <li>Not too much vanilla flavor.  </li>
            <li>sometimes mint is too much for a child.</li>
            <li>I was one of those buying the last of the Crest Vanilla toothpaste on Amazon a couple of years ago when it was no longer available in stores.  </li>
            <li>If you missed the Vanilla as much as I did, I recommend giving that one a try, too.thout it again if it didn&#x27;t expire after a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you missed the Vanilla as much as I did, I recommend giving that one a try, too.</li>
            <li>right amount and the texture was just right- not too gritty nor too smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As with many others, we loved the old Crest Vanilla Mint and were disappointed when it was no longer available...</li>
            <li>I am so excited that crest brought back vanilla mint.  </li>
            <li>Nice subtle vanilla taste, while definitely leaving you feel fresh and clean and minty after brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>Really, it&#x27;s just sweet and vanilla-y enough to cut through the mint.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet, but not even close to being as sweet as the typical children&#x27;s toothpastes.</li>
            <li>Some may love it, some may hate it, but most will consider it simply okay.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is fine, but as toothpaste goes, it&#x27;s really not that much to write home about.</li>
            <li>It DID leave things feeling clean, I just personally prefer a little more zest.</li>
            <li>nearly fell out of my chair when I saw that Crest had re-introduced a Vanilla Mint flavor as part of their new seemingly teen-targeted &amp;#34;Be Whatever&amp;#34; line and purchased a tube immediately - even getting home and brushing my teeth immediately because I just had to know if it&#x27;s the same as my old favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give that one 4 stars (5 if it wasn&#x27;t priced so high).</li>
            <li>My muscles work normally again.</li>
            <li>Normally my child likes flavors like strawberry, or bubblegum- and even chocolate-</li>
            <li>Not exactly what I was looking for but fine.</li>
            <li>The sweetness of the new vanilla is more subtle and the mint seems a bit more intense and less \\&quot;gritty.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Recently, I was shopping at Target for toothpaste after having used a number of different brands, none which I enjoyed as much as that old Vanilla Mint, only to discover the new Crest</li>
            <li>Vanilla Mint Spark has a nice subtle hint of vanilla, followed by a soft&lt;br /&gt;mint.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s only if you aren&#x27;t a fan of vanilla in the first place, IMO.</li>
            <li>After religiously buying and being loyal to this particular flavor, it stopped appearing at my local Target.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth as well as other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I had a little of the older Whitening Expressions toothpaste left over so was able to to an A</li>
            <li>It actually reminds me a bit of when I make tea (sometimes iced, sometimes hot) with 2 or 3 bags of plain tea and one bag of a strong mint tea (which, ironically, helps settle an upset stomach).</li>
            <li>I was so excited that I went and brushed my teeth right away to see if it was the same as the original version that I had been missing for so long.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitivity to mint and this is the only toothpaste that is mild but still minty enough and doesn&#x27;t burn my tongue.</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest for bringing back Vanilla Mint!!!</li>
            <li>After nearly 6 years I figure it&#x27;s here to stay.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I missed Crest&#x27;s vanilla mint toothpaste so much when they discontinued it several years ago</li>
            <li>One of my friends mentioned that she took a sole tube of this on family vacation and it was mild and sweet enough for her little ones to use.</li>
            <li>The fact that it also tastes like candy tells my brain that my teeth are automatically not clean and that I need to brush again to feel clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit sweeter and the minty flavor is more subtle.</li>
            <li>Apparently they have stopped stocking this near me.</li>
            <li>I loved the vanilla mint toothpaste offered many years ago by Crest and was very disappointed to see it removed from the Crest product line.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be awesome since it was at least double the price I usually pay for Crest.  </li>
            <li>My wife just happened to notice this new version of the Vanilla Mint at our local Target store and bought a tube.</li>
            <li>It is not a really strong vanilla flavor in my opinion but just enough to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I hoped this aversion to mint would go away like most of my aversions gradually have, but alas, it has not.</li>
            <li>It does taste exactly like the vanilla mint expressions this company previously had.</li>

            <li> amazing!!!</li>
            <li> This has the perfect blend.</li>
            <li> The BEST Toothpaste I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> If it is beneficial to dental health, why aren&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s teeth perfect since they are covertly dumping fluoride into our water supply and our produce is being grown with it?  </li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the quality. .</li>
            <li> These Crest flavors have been awesome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderfully light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this might be the best bet.  </li>
            <li> quite awesome!  </li>
            <li> It is delicious!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the best!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s got a very pleasant taste.  </li>

            <li> A great way to start the day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the texture but the taste is great.</li>
            <li> Very nice taste with the crest protection.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste, however, is absolutely magical and even makes your breath smell delicious.</li>
            <li> the combination isn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was SO excited!!!</li>
            <li> The taste is great, the kids, my husband and I love the flavor!  </li>
            <li> Very good and flavorful, but the chocolate mint is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> The good news is that I switched to a xylitol toothpaste</li>
            <li> I am just delighted with it.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I anticipated.</li>
            <li> And the lime spearmint variety is almost as good, tasting like a mint mojito.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Crest Vanilla Mint toothpaste and loved it.  </li>
            <li> It is also not the best at keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> ; Best tasting toothpaste I have ever found, makes your breath smell great - and since we have gotten back on it we are happy to report No Cavities! :-)</li>
            <li> and I remember remarking to her that she smelled delicious right before realizing that it was my toothpaste lending her that smell.</li>
            <li> I love those!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> I ever glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love the Vanilla Mint flavor!  </li>
            <li> Would also love to see these flavors in the restoration toothpastes too!  </li>
            <li> If fluoride is so good, why did Hitler use it to poison innocent people in the concentration camps??</li>
            <li> When I saw that it was emerging again, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I would be more happy about it if Crest had coupled the flavor with a bit more functionality, maybe some whitening or anticavity.</li>
            <li> as what I had loved before.&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product as far as flavor, and performance.</li>
            <li> So this has a warm vanilla flavor followed by what I thought was the weakest mint.  </li>
            <li> This may be good for kids, but be warned they may be more inclined to eat the paste because of the taste.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice creamy taste and goes nicely as a lead in to my morning latte.</li>
            <li> So, if you liked the origional, don&#x27;t hesitate to try it.</li>
            <li> The vanilla is nice, but I wish I could find toothpaste that isn&#x27;t mint (or cinnamon).</li>
            <li> that was nice</li>
            <li> This is a nice change for toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t over power your tastebuds.</li>
            <li> Favorite toothpaste, good price on amazon.</li>
            <li> When I found this under its new name I was very happy.  </li>
            <li> This product has a fresh minty taste that is a great way to start off the day.  </li>
            <li> I was at first very satisfied with this toothpaste and loved the flavour.</li>
            <li> I love this one as hell!!!&lt;br /&gt;cause</li>
            <li> When my husband went to brush his teeth that night, he came running out of the bathroom with a foamy toothpaste filled mouth and shouted &amp;#34;You found it!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of the Chocolate Flavors and Vanilla.</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla mint flavor, and you can&#x27;t find it everywhere.</li>
            <li> We LOVE this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> OK so I tried all three</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d love this (it kinda taste like those vanilla tootsie rolls with a minty taste).</li>
            <li> The chocolate version is much better</li>
            <li> The Dr. Collins toothpaste sold on Amazon is OK, but this is better.</li>
            <li> no matter how much I enjoyed the flavor.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this toothpaste !</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I think it could use a tad more vanilla</li>
            <li> Favorite toothpaste every</li>
            <li> This one is more than tolerable.</li>
            <li> Even my teenagers love it, including my daughter who also doesn&#x27;t like mint because she says it burns her mouth.</li>
            <li> I love vanilla.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> The flavor is not off putting nor is it inspiring.</li>
            <li> since bought the Mint Chocolate and found it to be much better.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my daughter&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> She loves the vanilla flavor and it gets her to brush her teeth more often.</li>
            <li> but this is better.</li>
            <li> Either way it&#x27;s a nice &amp; fun toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, Simple fluoride toothpaste with a good taste/aftertaste.</li>
            <li> The flavor was mild and verging on delicious, and yet was perfect for both the adults and the sensitive toddler aged picky eater.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful flavor, and does not burn like many other toothpastes when you use them.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant, because, after all, it is still a mint toothpaste, but so many of the reviews said it was a light mint, so</li>
            <li> Good gentle taste, unlike the whitener varieties.</li>
            <li> Also, would love to see more flavors, as I really can&#x27;t stand the mint that is used in most toothpastes and it is so nice to be able to have fun flavors for adults and teens.  </li>
            <li> I need to put more on to get that clean feeling to my teeth.</li>
            <li> you haveissues with those strongly mint toothpastes that line the store shelves, give this a go.</li>
            <li> If you have kids or don&#x27;t like strong mint</li>
            <li> I do not like mint or strong flavored toothpaste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fond of &#x27;vanilla coffee&#x27; in the morning but wasn&#x27;t fond of having a super minty taste in my mouth for an hour or more after brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> After years of lamenting the loss of a favorite flavor, I am happy to report that while this version of the vanilla mint is not as sweet (I found i had an old tube in my travel kit and was able to compare), it is much smoother.</li>
            <li> It IS minty, of course, but lightly so.</li>
            <li> the rest of my groceries is more than worth it.</li>
            <li> I used to get Crest Fresh Mint Baking Soda &amp; Peroxide Whitening, but like this product so much better</li>
            <li> We used it and liked it almost as much as the Crest brand.</li>
            <li> Beyond the great flavour, it&#x27;s pretty much normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It makes the mouth feel very clean and leaves your mouth feeling vanilla minty fresh.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh and very clean when I use Vanilla Mint Spark to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I like the new mint chocolate much more!</li>
            <li> this one is about the same - great combo of mild mint and creamy vanilla...</li>
            <li> So maybe I&#x27;m easy to please, but finding my favorite toothpaste of all time really made my day.</li>
            <li> The texture is very nice in my mouth and the taste is not too sweet but just enough to know that it is vanilla.  </li>
            <li> I could not find anything else I liked and I tried many different kinds.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty bland but the flavor it does have is not the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a super strong mint which is great for someone with autism.</li>
            <li> So happy that Crest decided to return this to the market; it is the ONLY toothpaste I have ever truly liked since childhood and several decades of adulthood!</li>
            <li> reminds me of sweet mint orbits gum.  </li>
            <li> It tastes sweet to me but not to the point</li>
            <li> Some may find it a bit sweet</li>
            <li> Our whole family fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Then we weren&#x27;t able to get the Jason brand at a reasonable price anymore...</li>
            <li> They were used to their sweet kids&#x27; toothpastes but it saved her some room in the suitcase</li>
            <li> not bad</li>
            <li> my mouth feels so fresh and clean and the flavour</li>
            <li> But I still feel like I have a clean mouth and fresh breath afterwards</li>
            <li> (which is obviously super important).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I searched many stores hoping to find some last remaining inventory of what had become my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I quickly snatched up a tube to try at home.</li>
            <li> Luckily she likes it</li>
            <li> Like others I was a loyal buyer of the discontinued Expessions vanilla toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I started using the Tom&#x27;s of Maine strawberry kid&#x27;s toothpaste, which is sweet, but not overly so, but the one local store that carried it stopped carrying the kind with fluoride in it.</li>
            <li> For the first time in 6 years my mouth feels fresh and clean without me feeling queasy.</li>
            <li> but it seemed like any time I found one with a promising flavor, it was fluoride free.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to discover it was the same (or close to)</li>
            <li> I was able to try this flavor toothpaste through a BzzAgent campaign and I really enjoyed the flavor of this one and I expected to like it.</li>
            <li> and I am SO THRILLED that it is back!</li>
            <li> so I thought this would be something fun to try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a super strong minty flavor, but it&#x27;s nice and mellow.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice change of pace from peppermint or plain spearmint toothpaste.</li>
            <li> since I dealt with hyperemesis gravidarum several years ago, I haven&#x27;t been able to handle super minty things.</li>
            <li> and I was so excited when I saw this new product.  </li>
            <li> I never really bought a toothpaste that I liked since then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I happened upon it, and I like it enough that having to order it online rather than buy it with</li>
            <li> - this is definitely the most muted flavor vs the lime or chocolate.  </li>
            <li> Glad to have Crest back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be interested in a paired mouthwash but can&#x27;t seem to find that.</li>
            <li> a side note, the Be Dynamic Lime-Spearmint flavor is almost better than the Vanilla Mint.</li>
            <li> a side note, the Be Dynamic Lime-Spearmint flavor is almost better than the Vanilla Mint.</li>
            <li> , so glad it&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really missed the Vanilla Expressions toothpaste and this makes up for it!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> I am soooooo glad they put a vanilla mint toothpaste back on the market.  </li>
            <li> This is good, but is less sweet and more minty than the previous Crest Whitening Expressions vanilla mint flavor.</li>
            <li> Overall I feel it does a great job at cleaning my teeth and gives me a different flavor than the normal mint.</li>
            <li> The old flavor seemed more equal parts sweet and mint and was \\&quot;grittier.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I remember it having slightly more vanilla flavor, but this is indeed pretty much the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but less vanilla and more minty than the old one.  </li>
            <li> It is less sweet, but with more vanilla flavor than Crest.</li>
            <li> it was listed on Amazon (as &amp;#34;not available&amp;#34;) and found hundreds of reviewers who missed Vanilla Mint as much as I did.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t love it enough to justify spending that much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that the price on this is finally comming down---hopefully it does not mean that it&#x27;s getting discontinued again (crosses fingers).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any amazing results of whiter teeth, less sensitivity or stronger enamel or whatever else</li>
            <li> I was clearly not the only fan of this beloved  toothpaste based on the prices and number of listings I found.</li>
            <li> with regular mint flavour my mouth gets spicy and I don´t really enjoy washing my teeths, but</li>
            <li> It seems much stronger than it ever was pre-pregnancy.</li>
            <li> - I was absolutely mortified.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has really helped with that.  </li>
            <li> I was really hopping that this would work out</li>
            <li> Not too much vanilla flavor.  </li>
            <li> sometimes mint is too much for a child.</li>
            <li> I was one of those buying the last of the Crest Vanilla toothpaste on Amazon a couple of years ago when it was no longer available in stores.  </li>
            <li> If you missed the Vanilla as much as I did, I recommend giving that one a try, too.thout it again if it didn&#x27;t expire after a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you missed the Vanilla as much as I did, I recommend giving that one a try, too.</li>
            <li> right amount and the texture was just right- not too gritty nor too smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As with many others, we loved the old Crest Vanilla Mint and were disappointed when it was no longer available...</li>
            <li> I am so excited that crest brought back vanilla mint.  </li>
            <li> Nice subtle vanilla taste, while definitely leaving you feel fresh and clean and minty after brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> Really, it&#x27;s just sweet and vanilla-y enough to cut through the mint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet, but not even close to being as sweet as the typical children&#x27;s toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Some may love it, some may hate it, but most will consider it simply okay.  </li>
            <li> The flavor is fine, but as toothpaste goes, it&#x27;s really not that much to write home about.</li>
            <li> It DID leave things feeling clean, I just personally prefer a little more zest.</li>
            <li> nearly fell out of my chair when I saw that Crest had re-introduced a Vanilla Mint flavor as part of their new seemingly teen-targeted &amp;#34;Be Whatever&amp;#34; line and purchased a tube immediately - even getting home and brushing my teeth immediately because I just had to know if it&#x27;s the same as my old favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give that one 4 stars (5 if it wasn&#x27;t priced so high).</li>
            <li> My muscles work normally again.</li>
            <li> Normally my child likes flavors like strawberry, or bubblegum- and even chocolate-</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was looking for but fine.</li>
            <li> The sweetness of the new vanilla is more subtle and the mint seems a bit more intense and less \\&quot;gritty.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Recently, I was shopping at Target for toothpaste after having used a number of different brands, none which I enjoyed as much as that old Vanilla Mint, only to discover the new Crest</li>
            <li> Vanilla Mint Spark has a nice subtle hint of vanilla, followed by a soft&lt;br /&gt;mint.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s only if you aren&#x27;t a fan of vanilla in the first place, IMO.</li>
            <li> After religiously buying and being loyal to this particular flavor, it stopped appearing at my local Target.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth as well as other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I had a little of the older Whitening Expressions toothpaste left over so was able to to an A</li>
            <li> It actually reminds me a bit of when I make tea (sometimes iced, sometimes hot) with 2 or 3 bags of plain tea and one bag of a strong mint tea (which, ironically, helps settle an upset stomach).</li>
            <li> I was so excited that I went and brushed my teeth right away to see if it was the same as the original version that I had been missing for so long.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitivity to mint and this is the only toothpaste that is mild but still minty enough and doesn&#x27;t burn my tongue.</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for bringing back Vanilla Mint!!!</li>
            <li> After nearly 6 years I figure it&#x27;s here to stay.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I missed Crest&#x27;s vanilla mint toothpaste so much when they discontinued it several years ago</li>
            <li> One of my friends mentioned that she took a sole tube of this on family vacation and it was mild and sweet enough for her little ones to use.</li>
            <li> The fact that it also tastes like candy tells my brain that my teeth are automatically not clean and that I need to brush again to feel clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit sweeter and the minty flavor is more subtle.</li>
            <li> Apparently they have stopped stocking this near me.</li>
            <li> I loved the vanilla mint toothpaste offered many years ago by Crest and was very disappointed to see it removed from the Crest product line.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be awesome since it was at least double the price I usually pay for Crest.  </li>
            <li> My wife just happened to notice this new version of the Vanilla Mint at our local Target store and bought a tube.</li>
            <li> It is not a really strong vanilla flavor in my opinion but just enough to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I hoped this aversion to mint would go away like most of my aversions gradually have, but alas, it has not.</li>
            <li> It does taste exactly like the vanilla mint expressions this company previously had.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is that Crest should use a little less mint to get less of a mint taste and more of the flavor taste.  </li>
            <li> This new one is okay, but sadly has less vanilla and sweetness than before.</li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling clean for the least amount of time as compared to the other flavors.  </li>
            <li> Most of these are so sickening sweet that I just can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> I got this hopping it would be like the old crest vanilla toothpaste that they had a few years ago.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of this my teeth are starting to yellow</li>
            <li> It tastes like a poor quality vanilla mixed with too much mint -</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it ran out and I was using a bland toothpaste by Colgate when I had the unexpected displeasure of having my teeth cleaned at the dentists (months after running out) and the hygienist pulled out two plastic micro-beads from deep in my gums and said to me &amp;#34;you know, you really shouldn&#x27;t use Crest toothpaste&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;They had been sitting in my gums for months</li>
            <li> but wouldn&#x27;t buy again unless on sale- can use just regular toothpaste for less.</li>
            <li> know I sound pretty over-the-top geeky about what is just a humble tube of toothpaste, but I seem to have a terrible habit of falling in love with brands or flavors that get taken off the market.</li>
            <li> We started using this toothpaste a few years ago when it was simply Crest Vanilla Mint flavor.</li>
            <li> I often find regular minty toothpaste to be really harsh.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me and are one of the few who like vanilla mint flavored toothpaste, this is the only way to go.</li>
            <li> My teeth no longer have the extreme sensitivity that they got from fluoride and the brain fog that it caused.</li>
            <li> I had even taken to searching for other sources of the discontinued brand including Amazon and Ebay.</li>
            <li> For me, this toothpaste is the same, if not better.  </li>
            <li> No more cloying kiddie toothpastes for me as long as this is available!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like many, I was disappointed when I discovered that Crest had discontinued the Whitening Expressisons Vanilla Mint toothpaste a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> When I used the it under its previous name, I never got a cavity.</li>
            <li> Then it disappeared off store shelves for a few years.</li>
            <li> tied looking online on and off for a few months</li>
            <li> I kid you not, even just a few weeks ago I stopped by the toothpaste section to see if it was being made again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They discontinued it a few years ago</li>
            <li> As much as this was hyped I was certainly disappointed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very afraid that the vanilla might be too overpowering or that the toothpaste would taste too much like candy.</li>
            <li> That was the only toothpaste I used previously and was so disappointed when they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t mean it is not good</li>
            <li> However, I thought it was silly to waste money on overpriced tubes of expired toothpaste</li>
            <li> but it is a poor quality toothpaste with a not great flavor.</li>
            <li> I have never liked mint toothpastes so it has been difficult to find a toothpaste that is tolerable.</li>
            <li> When I have the time, I&#x27;m going to make a list of all of the dramatic health improvements that have happened since I STOPPED using fluoride.   </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you with a nasty taste after several hours either.</li>

            <li> So happy that Crest decided to return this to the market; it is the ONLY toothpaste I have ever truly liked since childhood and several decades of adulthood!</li>
            <li> I love this one as hell!!!&lt;br /&gt;cause with regular mint flavour my mouth gets spicy and I don´t really enjoy washing my teeths, but with this one&lt;br /&gt;OMG my mouth feels so fresh and clean and the flavour it´s amazing!!! &amp; also like the chocolate one .</li>
            <li> Tasty but a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> We started using this toothpaste a few years ago when it was simply Crest Vanilla Mint flavor. Then it disappeared for a while and we were devastated :-( When I saw this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; Crest flavor &amp; packaging I was SO excited!!! When my husband went to brush his teeth that night, he came running out of the bathroom with a foamy toothpaste filled mouth and shouted &amp;#34;You found it! Yay!!&amp;#34; Best tasting toothpaste I have ever found, makes your breath smell great - and since we have gotten back on it we are happy to report No Cavities! :-)</li>
            <li> Great flavor.  I sm not a fan of regular mint toothpaste.  This has the perfect blend.</li>
            <li> The BEST Toothpaste I have ever used!  I am not finding it on the shelves any longer so I am scared that it will be going away. I will be purchasing more of the Chocolate Flavors and Vanilla.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, Simple fluoride toothpaste with a good taste/aftertaste. Doesn&#x27;t leave you with a nasty taste after several hours either.</li>
            <li> The great &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; feature makes this affordable. I love the vanilla mint flavor, and you can&#x27;t find it everywhere.</li>
            <li> The good news is that I switched to a xylitol toothpaste and I LOVE IT!!!!!!! My teeth no longer have the extreme sensitivity that they got from fluoride and the brain fog that it caused. If fluoride is so good, why did Hitler use it to poison innocent people in the concentration camps?? If it is beneficial to dental health, why aren&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s teeth perfect since they are covertly dumping fluoride into our water supply and our produce is being grown with it?  I wish that I never used fluoride!    When I have the time, I&#x27;m going to make a list of all of the dramatic health improvements that have happened since I STOPPED using fluoride.   My muscles work normally again. An infection that I had around a tooth never went away until I stopped using toothpaste with fluoride.</li>
            <li> I am so excited that crest brought back vanilla mint.  That was the only toothpaste I used previously and was so disappointed when they discontinued it. I never really bought a toothpaste that I liked since then, I just settled on what I could tolerate!!  Thanks Crest for bringing back Vanilla Mint!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that the price on this is finally comming down---hopefully it does not mean that it&#x27;s getting discontinued again (crosses fingers). This is my favirote flavor of toothpaste. It does taste exactly like the vanilla mint expressions this company previously had. I&#x27;ve not had any abrasion...etc problems with it and it is a regular formula toothpaste. I am very impressed with the quality. .</li>
            <li> These Crest flavors have been awesome.</li>
            <li> Apparently they have stopped stocking this near me. It is the only toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t burn the heck out of my mouth.  I love those!</li>
            <li> Years ago, vanilla mint toothpaste was a thing. Then it disappeared off store shelves for a few years. When I saw that it was emerging again, I was thrilled. The flavor is fine, but as toothpaste goes, it&#x27;s really not that much to write home about. I would be more happy about it if Crest had coupled the flavor with a bit more functionality, maybe some whitening or anticavity.</li>
            <li> I loved the vanilla mint toothpaste offered many years ago by Crest and was very disappointed to see it removed from the Crest product line. My wife just happened to notice this new version of the Vanilla Mint at our local Target store and bought a tube. I was so excited that I went and brushed my teeth right away to see if it was the same as the original version that I had been missing for so long. I was thrilled to discover it was the same (or close to) as what I had loved before.&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product as far as flavor, and performance. It seems to make my teeth look and feel cleaner/smoother than the Crest cinnamon tooth paste I had been using prior.</li>
            <li> We LOVE this toothpaste. Makes you look forward to brushing your teeth!</li>
            <li> Love it! Love! Love! LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I dealt with hyperemesis gravidarum several years ago, I haven&#x27;t been able to handle super minty things. It makes me queasy and the burning sensation is unpleasant. It seems much stronger than it ever was pre-pregnancy. I hoped this aversion to mint would go away like most of my aversions gradually have, but alas, it has not. After nearly 6 years I figure it&#x27;s here to stay.&lt;br /&gt;In the intervening years I&#x27;ve tried desperately to find a non-mint toothpaste. I&#x27;ve tried every store in my decently-sized town and all I can ever find that&#x27;s not minty is kids&#x27; toothpastes. Most of these are so sickening sweet that I just can&#x27;t stand it. I started using the Tom&#x27;s of Maine strawberry kid&#x27;s toothpaste, which is sweet, but not overly so, but the one local store that carried it stopped carrying the kind with fluoride in it. I know lots of people don&#x27;t like fluoride, but I find I prefer it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tied looking online on and off for a few months but it seemed like any time I found one with a promising flavor, it was fluoride free. I might as well stick with the toddler toothpaste I can buy locally in that case. Then I stumbled on this. I was hesitant, because, after all, it is still a mint toothpaste, but so many of the reviews said it was a light mint, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I ever glad I did! My mouth feels cleaner, fresher than it did with the children&#x27;s toothpastes. It IS minty, of course, but lightly so. It&#x27;s sweet, but not even close to being as sweet as the typical children&#x27;s toothpastes. Really, it&#x27;s just sweet and vanilla-y enough to cut through the mint. I experience no nausea at all from the mint and no burning sensation. It actually reminds me a bit of when I make tea (sometimes iced, sometimes hot) with 2 or 3 bags of plain tea and one bag of a strong mint tea (which, ironically, helps settle an upset stomach). But, of course, without the tea flavor. It&#x27;s wonderfully light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haveissues with those strongly mint toothpastes that line the store shelves, give this a go. It&#x27;s fantastic! I&#x27;m so glad I happened upon it, and I like it enough that having to order it online rather than buy it with the rest of my groceries is more than worth it. For the first time in 6 years my mouth feels fresh and clean without me feeling queasy. No more cloying kiddie toothpastes for me as long as this is available!&lt;br /&gt;...Now if only they&#x27;d make a mouth wash to go with it.</li>
            <li> I was at first very satisfied with this toothpaste and loved the flavour. Unfortunately, it ran out and I was using a bland toothpaste by Colgate when I had the unexpected displeasure of having my teeth cleaned at the dentists (months after running out) and the hygienist pulled out two plastic micro-beads from deep in my gums and said to me &amp;#34;you know, you really shouldn&#x27;t use Crest toothpaste&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;They had been sitting in my gums for months - I was absolutely mortified. I will not be buying this nor another Crest toothpaste again.</li>
            <li> OK so I tried all three - this is definitely the most muted flavor vs the lime or chocolate.  Doesn&#x27;t mean it is not good, all three capture the essence of what they are going for.  So this has a warm vanilla flavor followed by what I thought was the weakest mint.  It left my mouth feeling clean for the least amount of time as compared to the other flavors.  If you have kids or don&#x27;t like strong mint this might be the best bet.  It DID leave things feeling clean, I just personally prefer a little more zest.</li>
            <li> As with many others, we loved the old Crest Vanilla Mint and were disappointed when it was no longer available...this one is about the same - great combo of mild mint and creamy vanilla...quite awesome!  Beyond the great flavour, it&#x27;s pretty much normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I often find regular minty toothpaste to be really harsh. I find myself dreading brushing my teeth as a result. This toothpaste has really helped with that.  It&#x27;s a bit sweeter and the minty flavor is more subtle. But I still feel like I have a clean mouth and fresh breath afterwards (which is obviously super important).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this thinking I&#x27;d just give it a try but now I really only want to use it over the regular kinds.  Wish it had some whitening benefit, that is the only thing I would say I miss over regularly flavored paste.</li>
            <li> Good gentle taste, unlike the whitener varieties.</li>
            <li> I got this hopping it would be like the old crest vanilla toothpaste that they had a few years ago. It is mildly similar but not close enough. I do not like mint or strong flavored toothpaste which is all I can find in the stores around me. This is pretty bland but the flavor it does have is not the best. I was hopping for a stronger vanilla flavor. It is also not the best at keeping your teeth clean. After a few weeks of this my teeth are starting to yellow and I just get the feeling that the toothpaste portion is not doing what it is supposed to do. I was really hopping that this would work out but it is a poor quality toothpaste with a not great flavor.</li>
            <li> Not too much vanilla flavor.  reminds me of sweet mint orbits gum.  not bad but wouldn&#x27;t buy again unless on sale- can use just regular toothpaste for less.</li>
            <li> It taste like fake candy vanilla and if that is what you are into, go for it! You&#x27;d love this (it kinda taste like those vanilla tootsie rolls with a minty taste). The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth as well as other toothpastes. I need to put more on to get that clean feeling to my teeth. The fact that it also tastes like candy tells my brain that my teeth are automatically not clean and that I need to brush again to feel clean. Overall, I prefer a minty toothpaste. This may be good for kids, but be warned they may be more inclined to eat the paste because of the taste. I got this as part of a BZZAgent program but I don&#x27;t know if I will be buying it soon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste like vanilla at all- just mint. The chocolate version is much better</li>
            <li> This is good, but is less sweet and more minty than the previous Crest Whitening Expressions vanilla mint flavor. I had a little of the older Whitening Expressions toothpaste left over so was able to to an A/B comparison.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and are one of the few who like vanilla mint flavored toothpaste, this is the only way to go. The Dr. Collins toothpaste sold on Amazon is OK, but this is better. The Jason toothpaste is downright nasty. Glad to have Crest back!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this flavor toothpaste through a BzzAgent campaign and I really enjoyed the flavor of this one and I expected to like it. It is not a really strong vanilla flavor in my opinion but just enough to enjoy it. It tastes sweet to me but not to the point it&#x27;s overbearing. Overall I feel it does a great job at cleaning my teeth and gives me a different flavor than the normal mint. I think this is a great one to use for kids since I know sometimes mint is too much for a child.</li>
            <li> Like many, I was disappointed when I discovered that Crest had discontinued the Whitening Expressisons Vanilla Mint toothpaste a few years ago. I searched many stores hoping to find some last remaining inventory of what had become my favorite toothpaste. I had even taken to searching for other sources of the discontinued brand including Amazon and Ebay. I was clearly not the only fan of this beloved  toothpaste based on the prices and number of listings I found. However, I thought it was silly to waste money on overpriced tubes of expired toothpaste no matter how much I enjoyed the flavor. Sadly, I resigned myself to having to settle for another brand.    Recently, I was shopping at Target for toothpaste after having used a number of different brands, none which I enjoyed as much as that old Vanilla Mint, only to discover the new Crest Be Inspired Vanilla Mint Spark Flavor Toothpaste. I could not believe what I was seeing. I quickly snatched up a tube to try at home. After years of lamenting the loss of a favorite flavor, I am happy to report that while this version of the vanilla mint is not as sweet (I found i had an old tube in my travel kit and was able to compare), it is much smoother. The old flavor seemed more equal parts sweet and mint and was \\&quot;grittier.\\&quot;  The sweetness of the new vanilla is more subtle and the mint seems a bit more intense and less \\&quot;gritty.\\&quot; It makes the mouth feel very clean and leaves your mouth feeling vanilla minty fresh. As a result, I will probably Be Inspired to stock up on a number of these tube in case they decide to discontinue this one as well. Never has a toothpaste Inspired me to write a review.</li>
            <li> I love the Vanilla Mint flavor!  I used to get Crest Fresh Mint Baking Soda &amp; Peroxide Whitening, but like this product so much better</li>
            <li> Very nice taste with the crest protection. I enjoy using this toothpaste !</li>
            <li> I always thought that non-mint toothpaste all tasted like butts. This toothpaste, however, is absolutely magical and even makes your breath smell delicious. A friend sleeping over once used it and I remember remarking to her that she smelled delicious right before realizing that it was my toothpaste lending her that smell.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was marketed under another name and withdrawn from circulation. When I found this under its new name I was very happy.  It has a wonderful flavor, and does not burn like many other toothpastes when you use them. When I used the it under its previous name, I never got a cavity. I bought 3 tubes and will stock up just in case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fond of &#x27;vanilla coffee&#x27; in the morning but wasn&#x27;t fond of having a super minty taste in my mouth for an hour or more after brushing my teeth so this solved it... it&#x27;s a nice creamy taste and goes nicely as a lead in to my morning latte. Some may find it a bit sweet but that&#x27;s only if you aren&#x27;t a fan of vanilla in the first place, IMO. I love it- hope they never stop making it. I&#x27;d be interested in a paired mouthwash but can&#x27;t seem to find that.</li>
            <li> I received this product to try as a sample.  I love vanilla and was skeptical about how it would come across in a toothpaste.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This product has a fresh minty taste that is a great way to start off the day.  The texture is very nice in my mouth and the taste is not too sweet but just enough to know that it is vanilla.  I will definitely buy this product when my sample runs out.  Crest you did it again!!</li>
            <li> I was one of those buying the last of the Crest Vanilla toothpaste on Amazon a couple of years ago when it was no longer available in stores.  For me, this toothpaste is the same, if not better.  So, if you liked the origional, don&#x27;t hesitate to try it. I am just delighted with it. Amazon is also now giving a $.50 coupon with the purchase.</li>
            <li> 6-7 years ago, I bought a tube of Crest toothpaste in a line of &amp;#34;new flavors&amp;#34; - one of them being Vanilla Mint. Our whole family fell in love with it. The flavor was mild and verging on delicious, and yet was perfect for both the adults and the sensitive toddler aged picky eater. After religiously buying and being loyal to this particular flavor, it stopped appearing at my local Target. I tried finding it everywhere. For, like, 4 years. I noticed about 2 years go it was listed on Amazon (as &amp;#34;not available&amp;#34;) and found hundreds of reviewers who missed Vanilla Mint as much as I did. I never understood why Crest pulled it off the market. I kid you not, even just a few weeks ago I stopped by the toothpaste section to see if it was being made again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I tried Jason Powersmile Vanilla Mint toothpaste http://www.amazon.com/Jason-Powersmile-Vanilla-Toothpaste-6-Ounce/dp/B003AYEUE0/. We used it and liked it almost as much as the Crest brand. It is less sweet, but with more vanilla flavor than Crest. Then we weren&#x27;t able to get the Jason brand at a reasonable price anymore... and I really didn&#x27;t love it enough to justify spending that much $.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I nearly fell out of my chair when I saw that Crest had re-introduced a Vanilla Mint flavor as part of their new seemingly teen-targeted &amp;#34;Be Whatever&amp;#34; line and purchased a tube immediately - even getting home and brushing my teeth immediately because I just had to know if it&#x27;s the same as my old favorite. I remember it having slightly more vanilla flavor, but this is indeed pretty much the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I sound pretty over-the-top geeky about what is just a humble tube of toothpaste, but I seem to have a terrible habit of falling in love with brands or flavors that get taken off the market. (Like the H&amp;auml;agen-Dazs Five line!) So maybe I&#x27;m easy to please, but finding my favorite toothpaste of all time really made my day. I&#x27;d buy a case to ensure I&#x27;d never be without it again if it didn&#x27;t expire after a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, the Be Dynamic Lime-Spearmint flavor is almost better than the Vanilla Mint. If you missed the Vanilla as much as I did, I recommend giving that one a try, too.thout it again if it didn&#x27;t expire after a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, the Be Dynamic Lime-Spearmint flavor is almost better than the Vanilla Mint. If you missed the Vanilla as much as I did, I recommend giving that one a try, too.</li>
            <li> Vanilla Mint Spark has a nice subtle hint of vanilla, followed by a soft&lt;br /&gt;mint. This is a very nice change of pace from peppermint or plain spearmint toothpaste. I think it could use a tad more vanilla flavor.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn’t have the burning sensation from overpowering mint flavor that you can sometimes get in toothpaste.  My mouth feels fresh and very clean when I use Vanilla Mint Spark to brush my teeth. I felt that this toothpaste foamed just&lt;br /&gt;the right amount and the texture was just right- not too gritty nor too smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of Vanilla Mint Spark Crest Be toothpaste from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Favorite toothpaste every, so glad it&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I anticipated. It tastes like a poor quality vanilla mixed with too much mint - the combination isn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li> I missed Crest&#x27;s vanilla mint toothpaste so much when they discontinued it several years ago and I am SO THRILLED that it is back! I have never liked mint toothpastes so it has been difficult to find a toothpaste that is tolerable. (I feel like they burn my mouth affecting my taste buds for hours.) This one is more than tolerable. It is delicious! Even my teenagers love it, including my daughter who also doesn&#x27;t like mint because she says it burns her mouth. And the lime spearmint variety is almost as good, tasting like a mint mojito. A great way to start the day. Thank you Crest!!</li>
            <li> The vanilla is nice, but I wish I could find toothpaste that isn&#x27;t mint (or cinnamon).</li>
            <li> Nice subtle vanilla taste, while definitely leaving you feel fresh and clean and minty after brushing your teeth. I was very afraid that the vanilla might be too overpowering or that the toothpaste would taste too much like candy. I didn&#x27;t notice any amazing results of whiter teeth, less sensitivity or stronger enamel or whatever else toothpaste makers try to advertise with. I have very white teeth and this toothpaste kept them that way, so that was nice and I repurchased another tube that I found on sale at target. I&#x27;m wondering if they are planning to discontinue it? Either way it&#x27;s a nice &amp; fun toothpaste! One of my friends mentioned that she took a sole tube of this on family vacation and it was mild and sweet enough for her little ones to use. They were used to their sweet kids&#x27; toothpastes but it saved her some room in the suitcase and she didn&#x27;t need to pack 5 toothpaste tubes.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitivity to mint and this is the only toothpaste that is mild but still minty enough and doesn&#x27;t burn my tongue.</li>
            <li> This is a nice change for toothpaste.  The Easter Bunny brought this in my kids basket and it&#x27;s got a very pleasant taste.  It&#x27;s not a super strong minty flavor, but it&#x27;s nice and mellow.  Normally my child likes flavors like strawberry, or bubblegum- and even chocolate- so I thought this would be something fun to try.  Luckily she likes it (and so do I).</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like mint.  I love vanilla.  So I am always looking for vanilla mint toothpaste and mouthwash.  The vanilla softens the mint and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not worth the money.  The flavor is not off putting nor is it inspiring. I expected it to be awesome since it was at least double the price I usually pay for Crest.  Some may love it, some may hate it, but most will consider it simply okay.  As much as this was hyped I was certainly disappointed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since bought the Mint Chocolate and found it to be much better. I&#x27;d give that one 4 stars (5 if it wasn&#x27;t priced so high).</li>
            <li> Very good and flavorful, but the chocolate mint is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Crest Vanilla Mint toothpaste and loved it.  They discontinued it a few years ago and I was so excited when I saw this new product.  It&#x27;s okay but less vanilla and more minty than the old one.  Not exactly what I was looking for but fine.</li>
            <li> Like others I was a loyal buyer of the discontinued Expessions vanilla toothpaste. This new one is okay, but sadly has less vanilla and sweetness than before. I like the new mint chocolate much more!</li>
            <li> The taste is great, the kids, my husband and I love the flavor!  The only thing I can say is that Crest should use a little less mint to get less of a mint taste and more of the flavor taste.  Also, would love to see more flavors, as I really can&#x27;t stand the mint that is used in most toothpastes and it is so nice to be able to have fun flavors for adults and teens.  Would also love to see these flavors in the restoration toothpastes too!  I&#x27;ve really missed the Vanilla Expressions toothpaste and this makes up for it!  Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> I am soooooo glad they put a vanilla mint toothpaste back on the market.  I could not find anything else I liked and I tried many different kinds.  This toothpaste is the best!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the texture but the taste is great.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product. It&#x27;s my daughter&#x27;s favorite. It&#x27;s not a super strong mint which is great for someone with autism. She loves the vanilla flavor and it gets her to brush her teeth more often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t over power your tastebuds. I hate the taste of mint, so before I would sneak kid&#x27;s toothpaste,  but this is better.</li>
            <li> Favorite toothpaste, good price on amazon.</li>
