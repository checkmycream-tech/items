            <li>My baby smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The scent is really good and he becomes calm and happy when I put it on after his bath time.  </li>
            <li>Try at your own risk</li>
            <li>It is a nice cream</li>
            <li>The lavender scent smells a bit strong, but It&#x27;s good for my baby&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li>However, the smell is very strong.  </li>
            <li>This smells wonderful and keeps my baby&#x27;s skin soft!  </li>
            <li>We got this as a gift along withe the shampoo, and we used the shampoo first and loved it!</li>
            <li>:) I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>This is perfect to use on my 3 year old son (and me!)</li>
            <li>I originally had a good review on this product - I thought it was working well.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>Really love this lotion with below reasons.  </li>
            <li>I think there must be better options.  </li>
            <li>I also have been told to add a layer of petroleum jelly on top to keep moisture from lotion in the skin.  </li>
            <li>OK, this and the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>But this lotion has finally solved our problems and works great!  </li>
            <li>To be sure that it was this lotion.</li>
            <li>i think the fact that it has not scent is actually great since you use it on so much of baby.</li>
            <li>her skin has never felt better....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soothing and light, yet effective.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion</li>
            <li>and I love how it makes my baby&#x27;s skin feel.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t love the price</li>
            <li>Buy it for them if you love them.</li>
            <li>Love to use it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t a nice one, so thats a huge turn off.</li>
            <li>The smell is light, but keeps your baby with the good clean baby smell too.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing (pretty strong, but really nice).  </li>
            <li>Really goes on nice and then your hands smell nice too.</li>
            <li>it rubs in great and leaves her feeling soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>IT SMELLS TOO STRONGLY OF LAVENDER.</li>
            <li>Thankfully the smell isn&#x27;t strong like a Johnson and Johnson Baby Lotion.</li>
            <li>it works fine for that.  </li>
            <li>Most creams cause mild to sever itching and irritation when rubbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>This product is very very good and very moist,I will buy  this product more next time.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing, and it&#x27;s nice to feel you&#x27;re doing the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; route, but we will not be going back to using it on my son.   </li>
            <li>I used it on a light sunburn, to soothe irritated skin, and I even use it on my face.</li>
            <li>but I think you&#x27;ll enjoy the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>however, I did keep the Diaper cream because it had such great reviews.  </li>
            <li>this one in particular has a natural remedy calendula in it and smells good too!</li>
            <li>This lotion is quite light and absorbs really quickly into my oily/combination skin.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for any dry spots on kiddos.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with it, happy to replacing my 6.5 oz bottle after 7 months of twice daily facial applications.</li>
            <li>and it is very effective in treating dry skin as well as eczema.</li>
            <li>My son tolerated my putting it on his legs, and we were really really trying to stay on top of the eczema this winter.  </li>
            <li>Bought as gift, and he likes it very much!</li>
            <li>This is our new favorite lotion, my baby has eczema</li>
            <li>Great everyday baby lotion.  </li>
            <li>And I love how it smells even my 2.5 year old</li>
            <li>I love that they are certified natural product and</li>
            <li>If I were interviewed for Into the Gloss (yeah, right), this would be the one skin care item I&#x27;d rave about.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like that at first, but since we had it we used and it and it is great lotion for everyday use.</li>
            <li>But despite his legs looking OK (more or less) they were still itching</li>
            <li>This lotion is great - low on the Skin Deep database, moisturizing, and non greasy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and absorbs quickly, and his legs are no longer dry.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any complaints with this product, but my kids think it smells funny.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells great, isn&#x27;t greasy and isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li>smells great, not as thick as their calendula cream.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried this product I bought the jar of cream.  </li>
            <li>This lotion smells great, isn&#x27;t greasy and isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for two weeks now and have seen nothing but positive results.     </li>
            <li>For a baby, I would suggest the super sensitive lotion instead of this one (for the shampoo/body wash, conditioner, bubble bath, etc.</li>
            <li>B002VARN3O California Baby Super Sensitive Shampoo &amp; Bodywash]], which I use as a facewash.</li>
            <li>I could feel the grit while applying and saw the same glitter/glass like fine dust.</li>
            <li>What I loved the most about the shampoo was the subtle clean scent, so when I went to use the lotion I was expecting the same scent, but realized that it was actually unscented.</li>
            <li>I really like California Baby products.</li>
            <li>but she was still itchy the whole day.</li>
            <li>Very recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I do really like the scent though.</li>
            <li>real lavendar products always work for me.</li>
            <li>By kid likes this so much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t moisturise very well.  </li>
            <li>This serves him very well.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing scent.</li>
            <li>I much rather have the lotion because it&#x27;s easier to use; just pump and go.  </li>
            <li>It really help them out~&lt;br</li>
            <li>price is reasonable as well</li>
            <li>This cream does not cause the reaction that most other products do.</li>
            <li>It is good as an everyday lotion for normal skin, but it wasn&#x27;t able to moisturize my son&#x27;s very dry skin enough.</li>
            <li>It is definitely pricey, but having gone through so many other brands of lotion -  I would say it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I looked for months and tried many different lotions until I finally found one that worked for my sons</li>
            <li>So I will admit this lotion goes on smooth, totally absorbs and leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I normally swell up when bitten by bugs and</li>
            <li>It has a very slight smell that I&#x27;m sure would be more pleasing to little noses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little odd, but Froot Loop-iness aside, it smells GREAT.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve bought this lotion for our new born son.</li>
            <li>I tend to be very sensitive to scents</li>
            <li>She developed a rash, but doubt it has anything to do with the lotion!</li>
            <li>Normally I apply pure lavendar oil to prevent Mosquitos from sworming me, but it doesn&#x27;t dry fast on my legs</li>
            <li>I have suffered from a type of dermatitis since I was young.</li>
            <li>and I put it on every night after the bath, and he has relatively sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>(now he&#x27;s 12 months old) and never had any problem.</li>
            <li>and he developed a staph infection from the scratching.  </li>
            <li>I received this item and when i applied it to my 15 month old</li>
            <li>I am sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>has given our four month old a rash.</li>
            <li>so well I&#x27;ve started using everything else they offer, I have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I need this for my twins who have some sensitive skins.</li>
            <li>I am not blaming this product for the infection - but while I think it works well on normal dry skin, if you&#x27;re really dealing with eczema</li>
            <li>I also really appreciate the pump applicator - makes it so much easier to apply with one hand while my other hand is securing my baby on the changing table.  </li>
            <li>It is so strong and not appealing.  </li>
            <li>I noticed small glass/glitter like fine pieces all over her skin.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;California Baby Everyday Lotion with Calendula\\&quot; is soft &amp; silky, but personally I find the scent way too strong.</li>
            <li>My toddler has sensitive skin and it is gentle enough for him to use daily.</li>
            <li>Will give this to friends next week for their toddler and new baby.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the delicate but noticeable lavender fragrance and my skin has been super well behaved on my regimen of this lotion and the previously mentioned wash.</li>
            <li>I wash my hands several time a day due to my job and to this point the cream has kept my skin from becoming dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>Our baby&#x27;s skin now gets soft and hydrated enough</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturing and helps to soften her rough patches.  </li>
            <li>We all have sensitive skin, but no one in my family would use this a 2nd time.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time finding a lotion that was paraben free with natural ingredients but that also kept his dry and sensitive skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li>In any event, I&#x27;m not really able to review much, as it was barely used.</li>

            <li> For a baby, I would suggest the super sensitive lotion instead of this one (for the shampoo/body wash, conditioner, bubble bath, etc.</li>
            <li> B002VARN3O California Baby Super Sensitive Shampoo &amp; Bodywash]], which I use as a facewash.</li>
            <li> I could feel the grit while applying and saw the same glitter/glass like fine dust.</li>
            <li> What I loved the most about the shampoo was the subtle clean scent, so when I went to use the lotion I was expecting the same scent, but realized that it was actually unscented.</li>
            <li> I really like California Baby products.</li>
            <li> but she was still itchy the whole day.</li>
            <li> Very recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I do really like the scent though.</li>
            <li> real lavendar products always work for me.</li>
            <li> By kid likes this so much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturise very well.  </li>
            <li> This serves him very well.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing scent.</li>
            <li> I much rather have the lotion because it&#x27;s easier to use; just pump and go.  </li>
            <li> It really help them out~&lt;br</li>
            <li> price is reasonable as well</li>
            <li> This cream does not cause the reaction that most other products do.</li>
            <li> It is good as an everyday lotion for normal skin, but it wasn&#x27;t able to moisturize my son&#x27;s very dry skin enough.</li>
            <li> It is definitely pricey, but having gone through so many other brands of lotion -  I would say it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I looked for months and tried many different lotions until I finally found one that worked for my sons</li>
            <li> So I will admit this lotion goes on smooth, totally absorbs and leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I normally swell up when bitten by bugs and</li>
            <li> It has a very slight smell that I&#x27;m sure would be more pleasing to little noses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little odd, but Froot Loop-iness aside, it smells GREAT.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought this lotion for our new born son.</li>
            <li> I tend to be very sensitive to scents</li>
            <li> She developed a rash, but doubt it has anything to do with the lotion!</li>
            <li> Normally I apply pure lavendar oil to prevent Mosquitos from sworming me, but it doesn&#x27;t dry fast on my legs</li>
            <li> I have suffered from a type of dermatitis since I was young.</li>
            <li> and I put it on every night after the bath, and he has relatively sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> (now he&#x27;s 12 months old) and never had any problem.</li>
            <li> and he developed a staph infection from the scratching.  </li>
            <li> I received this item and when i applied it to my 15 month old</li>
            <li> I am sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> has given our four month old a rash.</li>
            <li> so well I&#x27;ve started using everything else they offer, I have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I need this for my twins who have some sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> I am not blaming this product for the infection - but while I think it works well on normal dry skin, if you&#x27;re really dealing with eczema</li>
            <li> I also really appreciate the pump applicator - makes it so much easier to apply with one hand while my other hand is securing my baby on the changing table.  </li>
            <li> It is so strong and not appealing.  </li>
            <li> I noticed small glass/glitter like fine pieces all over her skin.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;California Baby Everyday Lotion with Calendula\\&quot; is soft &amp; silky, but personally I find the scent way too strong.</li>
            <li> My toddler has sensitive skin and it is gentle enough for him to use daily.</li>
            <li> Will give this to friends next week for their toddler and new baby.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the delicate but noticeable lavender fragrance and my skin has been super well behaved on my regimen of this lotion and the previously mentioned wash.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands several time a day due to my job and to this point the cream has kept my skin from becoming dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> Our baby&#x27;s skin now gets soft and hydrated enough</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturing and helps to soften her rough patches.  </li>
            <li> We all have sensitive skin, but no one in my family would use this a 2nd time.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a lotion that was paraben free with natural ingredients but that also kept his dry and sensitive skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li> In any event, I&#x27;m not really able to review much, as it was barely used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every other natural line and they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion we&#x27;ve found that actually softens our baby&#x27;s dry skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use this on my new little one when he arrives.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use this on my new little one when he arrives.</li>
            <li> It seems to work on their dry skin.</li>
            <li> I guess i will use up what we have on my winter dry hands -</li>
            <li> Cleared up some dry skin on baby&#x27;s knees within a day.</li>
            <li> It helped my baby&#x27;s acne and dry skin though.</li>
            <li> dry / eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li> My baby has dry skin</li>
            <li> This weather was made our home so dry.</li>
            <li> so that his skin doesn&#x27;t get so dry.</li>
            <li> My hands get so dry that they crack and bleed.  </li>
            <li> (His entire lower legs end up a mess)  </li>
            <li> helps a little with my LO&#x27;s eczema, but doesn&#x27;t relieve it entirely.</li>
            <li> He is 2 and has a couple of rough spots on his arms.  </li>
            <li> We purchased this after hearing about it from a friend, to use on our baby&#x27;s rough skin.  </li>
            <li> I will suggest other people.</li>
            <li> , unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem to be long lasting</li>
            <li> He had a rash or little pimples on his face when he was 4 ~ 5 months</li>
            <li> We use this on my little one&#x27;s eczema and it helps her skin.  </li>
            <li> The smell does disappear after a little bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too pricey.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few years.</li>
            <li> but that was one my son screamed about applying in the past.  </li>
            <li> I can tell when we haven&#x27;t used it in a few days!  </li>
            <li> No more since I&#x27;ve been using Calendula cream or lotion.  </li>
            <li> It smells terrible and there really was not as much actual calendula in it as you&#x27;d think for it to call itself &amp;#34;calendula lotion&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It just loses a star for cost.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with these products are that they are very expensive.</li>
            <li> I would probably try it again during warmer months, but if your baby has bad eczema, as mine does, this lotion probably won&#x27;t cut it, especially during winter.</li>
            <li> This winter has been rough on skin, from the cold weather and heat in our home.  </li>
            <li> The first day my daughter used it on him before coming to my house, by the time she go here, I asked her what that awful smell was.  </li>
            <li> If you have a child with nasty eczema over a large portion of their body, I would look elsewhere for a remedy.  </li>
            <li> Now we&#x27;re using a nasty prescription ointment and once that has the worst of the flare up under control the derm suggested a few OTC lotions with ceremide in them.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for an alternative bug repellent.</li>
            <li> I would try this yourself before trying it on your children as an alternative to mosquito repellent.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Like all California Baby products, this has a great smell.  My toddler has sensitive skin and it is gentle enough for him to use daily.</li>
            <li> To give as gifts, I feel good</li>
            <li> I really like California Baby products. They are organic and have low EWG ratings. They also smell great. This lotion is no exception. It is good as an everyday lotion for normal skin, but it wasn&#x27;t able to moisturize my son&#x27;s very dry skin enough. I would probably try it again during warmer months, but if your baby has bad eczema, as mine does, this lotion probably won&#x27;t cut it, especially during winter.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from a type of dermatitis since I was young. Most creams cause mild to sever itching and irritation when rubbed into my skin. This cream does not cause the reaction that most other products do. I have been using this product for two weeks now and have seen nothing but positive results.     The product itself rubs into the skin well, and it is non greasy. I wash my hands several time a day due to my job and to this point the cream has kept my skin from becoming dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints with this product, but my kids think it smells funny. It seems to work on their dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It smells amazing (pretty strong, but really nice).  My baby has had no problem with it at all and I put it on every night after the bath, and he has relatively sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s very smooth and absorbs quickly, and his legs are no longer dry.</li>
            <li> help mewborn with peelig skin. Good smelling!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the person who write the opinion in anywhere, but I decided to leave my review in this product. I&#x27;ve used this product when my boy was born (now he&#x27;s 12 months old) and never had any problem. Really love this lotion with below reasons.  1. He had a rash or little pimples on his face when he was 4 ~ 5 months and this was really helpful to reduce that trouble.  2. The scent is really good and he becomes calm and happy when I put it on after his bath time.  Please try this one, you will not regret and be happy!!!</li>
            <li> I originally had a good review on this product - I thought it was working well.  My son tolerated my putting it on his legs, and we were really really trying to stay on top of the eczema this winter.  (His entire lower legs end up a mess)  But despite his legs looking OK (more or less) they were still itching and he was still scratching and he developed a staph infection from the scratching.  I am not blaming this product for the infection - but while I think it works well on normal dry skin, if you&#x27;re really dealing with eczema I think there must be better options.  Now we&#x27;re using a nasty prescription ointment and once that has the worst of the flare up under control the derm suggested a few OTC lotions with ceremide in them.  For myself, Curel anti-itch has worked well but that was one my son screamed about applying in the past.  Cetaphil Restoraderm and something called Cereva were what the derm suggested.  This stuff smells amazing, and it&#x27;s nice to feel you&#x27;re doing the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; route, but we will not be going back to using it on my son.   I guess i will use up what we have on my winter dry hands - it works fine for that.  If you have a child with nasty eczema over a large portion of their body, I would look elsewhere for a remedy.  I never knew you could end up with a staph infection from eczema, and that&#x27;s not something I want to see my son go through ever again.</li>
            <li> We use this on my little one&#x27;s eczema and it helps her skin.  I also have been told to add a layer of petroleum jelly on top to keep moisture from lotion in the skin.  Now to find a substitute for petroleum jelly!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great - low on the Skin Deep database, moisturizing, and non greasy.  However, the smell is very strong.  For a baby, I would suggest the super sensitive lotion instead of this one (for the shampoo/body wash, conditioner, bubble bath, etc. as well).  It has a very slight smell that I&#x27;m sure would be more pleasing to little noses.</li>
            <li> good quality.Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Cleared up some dry skin on baby&#x27;s knees within a day.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;California Baby Everyday Lotion with Calendula\\&quot; is soft &amp; silky, but personally I find the scent way too strong.</li>
            <li> If I were interviewed for Into the Gloss (yeah, right), this would be the one skin care item I&#x27;d rave about. OK, this and the [[ASIN:B002VARN3O California Baby Super Sensitive Shampoo &amp; Bodywash]], which I use as a facewash. I chose this lotion for it&#x27;s favorable EWG rating hoping that it wouldn&#x27;t aggravate my somewhat reactive skin. This lotion is quite light and absorbs really quickly into my oily/combination skin. I enjoy the delicate but noticeable lavender fragrance and my skin has been super well behaved on my regimen of this lotion and the previously mentioned wash. Very pleased with it, happy to replacing my 6.5 oz bottle after 7 months of twice daily facial applications.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells like lavender yuck and grass, but if you&#x27;re into that you&#x27;ll dig it. It helped my baby&#x27;s acne and dry skin though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this lotion but I don&#x27;t like how it smells.  I use it for my newborn and recommend it for babies.</li>
            <li> Great everyday baby lotion.  I looked for months and tried many different lotions until I finally found one that worked for my sons dry / eczema prone skin. I had a hard time finding a lotion that was paraben free with natural ingredients but that also kept his dry and sensitive skin hydrated.  But this lotion has finally solved our problems and works great!  It is light and non-greasy and has a very pleasant smell.  But definitely keeps his eczema at bay.  I also really appreciate the pump applicator - makes it so much easier to apply with one hand while my other hand is securing my baby on the changing table.  It is definitely pricey, but having gone through so many other brands of lotion -  I would say it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is our new favorite lotion, my baby has eczema so we have to keep him moisturize ask the time and this lotion is the best! And I love how it smells even my 2.5 year old is asking me to put some on her back now.</li>
            <li> I received this item and when i applied it to my 15 month old I noticed small glass/glitter like fine pieces all over her skin. I gave her a bath immediately but she was still itchy the whole day. To be sure that it was this lotion. I washed an area of my arm and applied this lotion. I could feel the grit while applying and saw the same glitter/glass like fine dust. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive skin. There are no itchy feelings and no irritation on my face when I use this lotion. Very recommend.</li>
            <li> My favorite baby line of all time! California baby Calendula products!</li>
            <li> great product &amp; service</li>
            <li> I have used california baby for 3 years. Very good.</li>
            <li> THE LOTION WORKS WELL FOR SOFTENING SKIN THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I HAD WITH THE PRODUCT IS IT SMELLS TOO STRONGLY OF LAVENDER.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and keeps my baby&#x27;s skin soft!  The smell is light, but keeps your baby with the good clean baby smell too.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for any dry spots on kiddos.  Also helps with any chapping in the colder months.</li>
            <li> Great smell but has given our four month old a rash. After applying the lotion, we noticed he broke out in tiny red bumps where lotion was applied. We&#x27;re stopping use.</li>
            <li> My baby battled with eczema and this lotion sorted it out in about 3 days! Does not burn, smells wonderful and works! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I did not like this lotion at all. It smells terrible and there really was not as much actual calendula in it as you&#x27;d think for it to call itself &amp;#34;calendula lotion&amp;#34;.  I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Good item.fast shipping,delivery on time.I like it .I will recomand the item to my relative .</li>
            <li> We got this as a gift along withe the shampoo, and we used the shampoo first and loved it! What I loved the most about the shampoo was the subtle clean scent, so when I went to use the lotion I was expecting the same scent, but realized that it was actually unscented. I didn&#x27;t like that at first, but since we had it we used and it and it is great lotion for everyday use. i think the fact that it has not scent is actually great since you use it on so much of baby. it rubs in great and leaves her feeling soft but not greasy. her skin has never felt better....</li>
            <li> Target sells this item for $10.39. What&#x27;s up? Same size, same everything --- except the price. :) I love this lotion! It&#x27;s so soothing and light, yet effective. I used it on a light sunburn, to soothe irritated skin, and I even use it on my face. It&#x27;s not just for babies.</li>
            <li> I am not use it yetï¼Œbut good at smelling</li>
            <li> Very good quality and price^^</li>
            <li> My baby has dry skin and I had hoped that this would do the trick, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem to be long lasting and I keep having to reapply several times a day.  I do really like the scent though.</li>
            <li> my family have been using this product forever, this is best lotion that must to have for all family</li>
            <li> great product but the pump was broke.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my face as a moisturizer. It did not work for my skin. So I would use it on my body. Smells awesome but I don&#x27;t feel it moisturized my body the best it could have! Thankfully the smell isn&#x27;t strong like a Johnson and Johnson Baby Lotion. What I did notice is the lavendar smell worked great for me in mosquito weather on my legs. Any day that I wore this on my body I wasn&#x27;t bitten by any Mosquitos. Normally I apply pure lavendar oil to prevent Mosquitos from sworming me, but it doesn&#x27;t dry fast on my legs and it&#x27;s a pain if it gets onto my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an alternative bug repellent. I would try this yourself before trying it on your children as an alternative to mosquito repellent. I normally swell up when bitten by bugs and real lavendar products always work for me. I have asthma so I do not use commercial bug repellents. Try at your own risk but I think you&#x27;ll enjoy the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was great and the lotion was sealed well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson&#x27;s skin.  He is 2 and has a couple of rough spots on his arms.  The first day my daughter used it on him before coming to my house, by the time she go here, I asked her what that awful smell was.  She told me and said she wanted my reaction - she thought it was just her.  She is going to continue to use it to see if  it helps his skin but only if they are going to stay home where people won&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> This weather was made our home so dry. This is perfect to use on my 3 year old son (and me!) so that his skin doesn&#x27;t get so dry.</li>
            <li> I like it all the time. By kid likes this so much. My wife always would like to buy California Baby product.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and I love how it makes my baby&#x27;s skin feel. But I don&#x27;t love the price so I had to stop buying it.</li>
            <li> Really goes on nice and then your hands smell nice too. Buy it for them if you love them. Cheers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturise very well.  In addition it gave my baby a rash everywhere!!!!</li>
            <li> Love to use it. Our baby&#x27;s skin now gets soft and hydrated enough</li>
            <li> So I will admit this lotion goes on smooth, totally absorbs and leaves skin soft.  It is a nice cream but I could not stand the scent.  It is so strong and not appealing.  I tend to be very sensitive to scents so if you are one of those people you may not like it.  I returned the body wash also.  however, I did keep the Diaper cream because it had such great reviews.  The smell does disappear after a little bit.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great, isn&#x27;t greasy and isn&#x27;t too thick. I can&#x27;t wait to use this on my new little one when he arrives. The scent is devine but not overpowering and you can use the tiniest bit at a time and still feel moisturized. I have purchased several bottles of this because it will be our go-to lotion once he gets here!</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that keeps my daughters skin hydrated in the winter without being greasy. I&#x27;ve tried every other natural line and they don&#x27;t work. Because this lotion works so well I&#x27;ve started using everything else they offer, I have no complaints so far. My daughter is 3 and asks for the &amp;#34;yellow bottle&amp;#34;  (she likes the calendula cream line) because she smells &amp;#34;yummy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift, and he likes it very much!</li>
            <li> Will give this to friends next week for their toddler and new baby. I hope they like it.</li>
            <li> smells great, not as thick as their calendula cream.  helps a little with my LO&#x27;s eczema, but doesn&#x27;t relieve it entirely.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought this lotion for our new born son. We&#x27;ve been using it since day one. He has sensitive skin. This serves him very well.</li>
            <li> This product is very very good and very moist,I will buy  this product more next time.I will suggest other people.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  We purchased this after hearing about it from a friend, to use on our baby&#x27;s rough skin.  It&#x27;s very moisturing and helps to soften her rough patches.  I can tell when we haven&#x27;t used it in a few days!  This winter has been rough on skin, from the cold weather and heat in our home.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Moisturises my boy great. Have been using this product for a few years.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. Very relaxing scent. To tell you the truth, there is a note of Froot Loop smell in it. It&#x27;s a little odd, but Froot Loop-iness aside, it smells GREAT. We use it after baths and before bed. My baby smells amazing. I won&#x27;t be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it, too. Feels really nice, makes my skin feel delightful. It just loses a star for cost. It&#x27;s a little too pricey.</li>
            <li> my baby loves the smell of this lotion. and it is very effective in treating dry skin as well as eczema.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent smells a bit strong, but It&#x27;s good for my baby&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> Love this product.  The first time I tried this product I bought the jar of cream.  I much rather have the lotion because it&#x27;s easier to use; just pump and go.  Love this lotion!  I&#x27;ll continue to use Calendula lotion.  I&#x27;m a cashier in a grocery store.  My hands get so dry that they crack and bleed.  No more since I&#x27;ve been using Calendula cream or lotion.  I used the cream before I knew they made a lotion.  I prefer the lotion, but both are great.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion we&#x27;ve found that actually softens our baby&#x27;s dry skin, especially in the winter. Worked wonders on his eczema breakouts, too</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t a nice one, so thats a huge turn off. We all have sensitive skin, but no one in my family would use this a 2nd time. It&#x27;s supposed to be healing, but rash and irritated skin areas were not helped at all, so I don&#x27;t know what to do with it...</li>
            <li> i like the smell but my baby feels sticky after using it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with these products are that they are very expensive. I love that they are certified natural product and this one in particular has a natural remedy calendula in it and smells good too!</li>
            <li> I need this for my twins who have some sensitive skins. It really help them out~&lt;br /&gt;The price is reasonable as well</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great, isn&#x27;t greasy and isn&#x27;t too thick. I can&#x27;t wait to use this on my new little one when he arrives. The scent is devine but not overpowering and you can use the tiniest bit at a time and still feel moisturized. I have purchased several bottles of this because it will be our go-to lotion once he gets here!</li>
            <li> very effective to deal with baby skin prob</li>
            <li> Was recommended tomy mom to use during her radiation treatment (by the nurse). She developed a rash, but doubt it has anything to do with the lotion! In any event, I&#x27;m not really able to review much, as it was barely used.</li>
