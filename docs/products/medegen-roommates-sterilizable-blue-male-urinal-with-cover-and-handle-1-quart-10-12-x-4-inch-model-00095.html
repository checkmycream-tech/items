            <li>HOWEVER, I don&#x27;t believe there is any urinal that I&#x27;ve seen that is perfectly watertight.  </li>
            <li>That said, it is one of the best I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>So reading a review about how study this is made, I bought one, And I will say it is the best well made one I have seen.</li>
            <li>This is the best urinal out the nothing comes close to it</li>
            <li>The very best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Very impressed.</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>Great quality as these products go.  </li>
            <li>Good color, matches my fathers eyes.</li>
            <li>Wish they made more colors!</li>
            <li>Excellent urinal, nice color; reminds one of &amp;#34;porta- Potty&#x27;s blue, solider sides, but still has &#x27;leekability if knocked over.</li>
            <li>This product is much better than what the hospital sends you home with.  </li>
            <li>I did not like the transparent ones that are also more flimsy.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s a lot more than most urinals you will see,</li>
            <li>The cap stayed sealed and it was more durable and easy to use for the three weeks my husband needed to use one.  </li>
            <li>Very good for occasional use.</li>
            <li>It is good, I piss in it, it does not stink, must be kept clean by washing it with hot water, a bit overpriced ...</li>
            <li>Cleans easily.</li>
            <li>Ordered a cheap one and it lasted the month.</li>
            <li>Hey, its a pee bottle with one important distinction.</li>
            <li>the handle can be removed without creating a hole in the primary container.  </li>
            <li>Lid snaps on but will leak if turned over - Filled with water to evaluate seal of cap.  </li>
            <li>Good product, sturdy, ergonomic, looks professional.</li>
            <li>In fact, I would almost bet one could drive over it with a truck and it would still hold its original shape.  </li>
            <li>Originally I gave this product five stars, but read my update below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped using it and now must rethink my original review.  </li>
            <li>Makes it easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>Another great feature is the lid snaps on much easier than the white ones and STAYS on, yet is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>Cool color.</li>
            <li>It was big, which was good.</li>
            <li>Adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li>Should last for many months!</li>
            <li>Third, the cap fits nicely with a snap.  </li>
            <li>The cap fits better than anything you take home from the hospital, but this is still a blow molded product that is mass produced, so the mouth of the unit is not perfectly round.  </li>
            <li>This one has a nice tight fit and is worth buying.</li>
            <li>I certainly would NOT recommend this product to anyone, given these circumstances and the cost!</li>
            <li>There is a bonus that I was very much hoping for:</li>
            <li>The seam in the plastic cracked the first time my husband used it and spilled urine all over our living room.</li>
            <li>First, it is opaque.  </li>
            <li>these are more solid that the ones in the hospital and do not show the urine yells that comes with use/overuse.</li>
            <li>While this item costs considerably more $$ than those see thru white light-weight (almost flimsy) plastic ones, this is no Throw Away!  </li>
            <li>Most if not all urinals I have seen are made of cheap plastic and tend to buckle if you hold them too tightly.  </li>
            <li>I will be back for more thanks again</li>
            <li>thanks very much</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the mfg. had some sort of fluid collected \\&quot;level\\&quot; indicator like those white lightweight plastic ones have.</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ve had for several months and the do not even seem to retain order significantly</li>
            <li>as a result will leak (out of top) if it is laying down.  </li>
            <li>most of the male urinals are not made with a solid handle that can be removed.  </li>
            <li>Top snaps on tightly.</li>
            <li>Postage is high but it is send UPS.</li>
            <li>much bigger thing for us rare permanent users with a BK amputee and our state of the art Carbon fiber, nylon flexible lined, titanium-</li>
            <li>Bought this for my elderly father when he came to live with us.</li>
            <li>The top on the other brands never close properly.</li>
            <li>My husband was stuck on the sofa for a month after surgery so after reading various reviews I purchased this item figuring that as it was slightly more expensive it might be better made.</li>
            <li>This is an important feature if you wish to use the urinal upside down while seated in a wheelchair.</li>
            <li>Did not work nearly as well as the $6 ones you can get at Walmart.</li>
            <li>If you upright it promptly should prevent a major spill.</li>
            <li>Second, the handle is not hollow.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a piece of junk...!  No matter where one relieves themselve inside the urinal--the urine ends up evertwhere else?  it&#x27;s a waste of money, time and whatever your wearing.  Be prepared to wash your linens and whatever your wearing every day.  Icannot express strongly enough what junk this is!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product but  a different brand in the stores. The top on the other brands never close properly. This one has a nice tight fit and is worth buying.</li>
            <li> My husband was stuck on the sofa for a month after surgery so after reading various reviews I purchased this item figuring that as it was slightly more expensive it might be better made. Wrong! The seam in the plastic cracked the first time my husband used it and spilled urine all over our living room. Ordered a cheap one and it lasted the month.</li>
            <li> This product is much better than what the hospital sends you home with.  The cap stayed sealed and it was more durable and easy to use for the three weeks my husband needed to use one.  If you need one for an extended time, I would suggest this one.</li>
            <li> Great quality as these products go.  I got it for when I came home from the hospital and couldn&#x27;t get out of bed.  Most if not all urinals I have seen are made of cheap plastic and tend to buckle if you hold them too tightly.  This has several qualities that I like.  First, it is opaque.  I did not like the transparent ones that are also more flimsy.  If he cap is closed, I know I have used it.  If the cap is open, I haven&#x27;t used it.  I&#x27;m not in a situation where I had to measure the volume as they need to in hospitals. Second, the handle is not hollow.  This makes it stronger and no liquids can get in the handle.  Makes it easier to clean.  Third, the cap fits nicely with a snap.  HOWEVER, I don&#x27;t believe there is any urinal that I&#x27;ve seen that is perfectly watertight.  So do not expect it to be.  The cap fits better than anything you take home from the hospital, but this is still a blow molded product that is mass produced, so the mouth of the unit is not perfectly round.  Nor is there any rubber gasket to make a water tight seal.  So do not expect that from any urinal.  That said, it is one of the best I&#x27;ve seen and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Does its job, as long as it is upright.  Cap does not fit snugly enough on it to prevent spillage should it be tipped over.</li>
            <li> I really got tired of urinals, that are made of thin plastic and flimsy lids. So reading a review about how study this is made, I bought one, And I will say it is the best well made one I have seen. Besides it being made of thick material the lid snaps on very well. I know it&#x27;s a lot more than most urinals you will see, But it is the only type I will be buying for a long time. Postage is high but it is send UPS.</li>
            <li> Hey, its a pee bottle with one important distinction. It is WELL made, and the lid stays on when you are not using it.&lt;br /&gt;That makes it a 5 star device . The cheap ones will unpleasantly surprise you with spillage when the lid gets loose with&lt;br /&gt;handling.</li>
            <li> well made---great product for the price</li>
            <li> This is the best urinal out the nothing comes close to it thanks very much I will be back for more thanks again</li>
            <li> Good product, sturdy, ergonomic, looks professional. Very good for occasional use. Not sure the cover would stand up to daily + use but it may. Fairly-priced here in August 2015 @ $9.99 + $3.95 shipping.</li>
            <li> The very best I&#x27;ve ever used. Cleans easily. Cool color.</li>
            <li> I accidentally tipped this over and the seal was tight enough to prevent  all but a few drops leakage.  Very impressed.</li>
            <li> This product is made out of solid material just as was described by another reviewer.  There is a bonus that I was very much hoping for: the handle can be removed without creating a hole in the primary container.  Don&#x27;t dismiss this ability as trivial – most of the male urinals are not made with a solid handle that can be removed.  This is an important feature if you wish to use the urinal upside down while seated in a wheelchair.</li>
            <li> Did not work nearly as well as the $6 ones you can get at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Solid urinal. Cleans well with little odor so far.  Lid snaps on but will leak if turned over - Filled with water to evaluate seal of cap.  If you upright it promptly should prevent a major spill. Good color, matches my fathers eyes.</li>
            <li> A little pricy, but very solid and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Met my every expectation.</li>
            <li> Practical design. Top snaps on tightly. Adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li> Wish they made more colors! Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The item has arrived as planned and the quality is found to be exceeding my expectations. Thank you.</li>
            <li> bedside convenience, decorative color and the handle is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Should last for many months!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Dad. He did not like it so I sent it back.</li>
            <li> Excellent urinal, nice color; reminds one of &amp;#34;porta- Potty&#x27;s blue, solider sides, but still has &#x27;leekability if knocked over. This may seem like&lt;br /&gt;a much bigger thing for us rare permanent users with a BK amputee and our state of the art Carbon fiber, nylon flexible lined, titanium- strontium-&lt;br /&gt;stainless steel K-4 all terrain College -Park Tacical Soleous feet. Huhhraah!/ improvise, adapt overcome.</li>
            <li> these are more solid that the ones in the hospital and do not show the urine yells that comes with use/overuse. we&#x27;ve had for several months and the do not even seem to retain order significantly -- boy was that a problem with the ones we brought home from the hospital.</li>
            <li> bought 4, only one would close. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> While this item costs considerably more $$ than those see thru white light-weight (almost flimsy) plastic ones, this is no Throw Away!  Another great feature is the lid snaps on much easier than the white ones and STAYS on, yet is easy to remove.  In fact, I would almost bet one could drive over it with a truck and it would still hold its original shape.  It would be nice if the mfg. had some sort of fluid collected \\&quot;level\\&quot; indicator like those white lightweight plastic ones have. Originally I gave this product five stars, but read my update below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Now after several uses of this product, I&#x27;ve discovered that the lid does not \\&quot;snap\\&quot; on/off and as a result will leak (out of top) if it is laying down.  I&#x27;ve stopped using it and now must rethink my original review.  I certainly would NOT recommend this product to anyone, given these circumstances and the cost!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my elderly father when he came to live with us. It is fine.it stands on bottom or lays flat without spilling the contents. Not cheap looking.sturdy.What can you say about a urinal.</li>
            <li> It leaks. These need to have twist on tops...some do, I recommend one of those instead. It was big, which was good.</li>
            <li> It is good, I piss in it, it does not stink, must be kept clean by washing it with hot water, a bit overpriced ... Thanks</li>
