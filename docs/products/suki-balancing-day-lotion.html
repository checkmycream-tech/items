            <li>Amazon had the best price</li>
            <li>this is one of the best day creams i have ever used, no fillers like water,great ingredients and organic a perfect solution for those with blemishes and oily skin .</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the way my face looks and feels!</li>
            <li>Great ingredients--glad for something without siliones to clog pores and require scrubbing to remove from the face.  </li>
            <li>It is really good during summer months.  </li>
            <li>- don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise to use, if age spots is a concern...</li>
            <li>The product gets good ratings for lack of toxicity and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to find organic products that also smell good and</li>
            <li>Good smell.</li>
            <li>the ingredients were good but the product was greasy and didn&#x27;t do what was advertised.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything good for my skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Love Suki products!  </li>
            <li>Its like magic!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I find the smell of this system to be very pleasant - a very light citrusy fragrance which dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an amazing line of products.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing line of products.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight, non-greasy, but moisturizes effectively.</li>
            <li>so I find this is a nice something in-between.  </li>
            <li>about 2 drops on still damp skin if you break out easily gives good results.</li>
            <li>this lotion will be perfect for hot summer days when i am naturally more oily and cant imagine adding more oil&#x27;s to the mix.</li>
            <li>Possibly ideal for someone with very oily skin.</li>
            <li>Suki products are clean with good ingredients but they don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>It is also packed with many antioxidants in natural from and loaded with vitamins that are excellent for skin.  </li>
            <li>what because Suki makes lovely beauty items.</li>
            <li>must I say more?  </li>
            <li>Just healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>Love the texture ,smell and feel on my face.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the smell and the texture of these products</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love all Suki products, and i really love this</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells so good and fresh, does not irritate the skin</li>
            <li>It is pure and gentle and works awesome.</li>
            <li>Love the healthy and clean ingredients on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this light hydrating lotion, keeps my face from being oily.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate using products without the chemicals and a lovely clean smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of liquorice is so strong and overpowering that i feel it until i wash off the cream in the evening.</li>
            <li>this stuff quickly absorbs, and is non greasy.. also smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>I also use the Eye Repair Balm around my eyes and have seen some improvement in the fine lines there</li>
            <li>My initial review is confirmed - this is a great system!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made my pores huge</li>
            <li>Easy to clean the face</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping for a light anti-age and control of face sebum.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>And the thing isn&#x27;t cheap either.  </li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I was excited to try this \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product on my oily, blemish-prone 40-year-old skin.</li>
            <li>After the first application, it seemed just ok.</li>
            <li>I also like how the first ingredient isn&#x27;t water like most drug store lotions.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels clean even after applying make up over the cream.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best facial lotion, it does not leave a oily residue feeling, going on 1 year using this product</li>
            <li>of course, I immediately ordered the full size set of these items.  </li>
            <li>Loved the facial and wound up purchasing the suki Balancing Day Lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love the amount of moisture- not oily but very smooth/hydrating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loyal to that product for years now.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>cause it gets used up quickly.</li>
            <li>My face also feels dry with it on, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it contains retinol, which makes your skin more sensitive to sunlight</li>
            <li>Some worked better than others, but none of them really helped all that much.  </li>
            <li>This along with Suki&#x27;s camomile moisture serum are the only skin products that keep my skin clear and happy.</li>
            <li>Most have organic or natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Lovely natural fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and allergic to the chemical compound form of salicylic acid that are usually in most skin care products.  </li>
            <li>you will see a difference right away.</li>
            <li>And mind you, i am not allergic and i have nothing against strong natural scents.</li>
            <li>I only use it at night :)</li>
            <li>First heard of this product and purchased from my Naturopath.  </li>
            <li>Soaks right in and does not take much...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of all of their products, but this moisturizer is worth every penny and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin is totally happy with one pump of this product mixed with the other serum twice a day.</li>
            <li>I was first turned off by the smell because it is really concentrated</li>
            <li>It is light, soaks in well, and is adequately moisturizing for my moderately dry acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive combo/oily skin.</li>
            <li>Smooth, blemish free, much less oily than before.</li>
            <li>But this smell is intense to the point i had to force myself to use the cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend all SukiFace products!</li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference in my complexion and it helped with under-eye darkness.  </li>
            <li>Several years ago my skin developed many contact sensitivities.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hours later, my skin was still fresh, soft and NOT OILY!</li>
            <li>thinking it might not be as effective, I come back after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>I can go all day, blotting only once or twice, with fresh, soft, non-oily skin and my makeup looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face felt clean and refreshed without being dry or tight, and lightly moisturized after using the balancing day</li>
            <li>At first I thought, I&#x27;ll just use the bottle and not order it again, but after the third use, I had to return it.</li>
            <li>The day after after a long shower i noticed that my freshly washed face was covered in while bits of peeled skin.</li>
            <li>Like it because it does a decent job of keeping my skin smooth, and unlike Clarins, won&#x27;t cause me to break out after a few days of continuous use!&lt;br</li>
            <li>i buy this product over and over because it definitely is useful, even if i dont use it every single day.</li>
            <li>I disagree completely.  </li>
            <li>but so far things seem to be improving.  </li>
            <li>and wow ---- practically gone.</li>
            <li>It is so natural</li>
            <li>If it helps, I have combination skin which is also non sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>for sensitive skin that breaks out - this works.  </li>
            <li>Several enlarged oil glands on my forehead, which a dermatologist said would have to be professionally removed (which would leave scabs for a couple of weeks) and would then most likely come back later, are now diminishing by themselves.  </li>
            <li>Several enlarged oil glands on my forehead, which a dermatologist said would have to be professionally removed (which would leave scabs for a couple of weeks) and would then most likely come back later, are now diminishing by themselves.  </li>
            <li>and this stuff does such a good job of moisturizing my skin without irritating it.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, this is the first time I&#x27;ve been using a lotion on a daily basis because I have very oily skin and don&#x27;t want to add more sheen/moisture/oil to my face, but this facial lotion actually helps to improve overall complexion (dulls redness of any blemishes and scars) and mattes your face.  </li>
            <li>This product and others in the kit have thankfully brought my skin back to normal.  </li>
            <li>fl oz isn&#x27;t much, especially compared to how much toner and facial exfoliant Suki provides.  </li>
            <li>My face just feels so very soft now - and no one ever believes I&#x27;m in my mid-40s, but think I&#x27;m 10 years younger!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finished the bottle and generally saw no improvement in my combination skin.  </li>
            <li>This was my last purchase to complete the Suki care line</li>
            <li>I tried this product two years ago after reading the ingredients on the package, and found that the salicylic acid in it is extracted naturally from white willow bark.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not cheap, but they are so worth it.  </li>
            <li>My oily areas seem under control and a large red pimple I had is much less inflammed and red, and it&#x27;s almost gone.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I usually love Suki products so I was tremendously disappointed to find that this had a nasty nasty odor. At first I thought, I&#x27;ll just use the bottle and not order it again, but after the third use, I had to return it. I&#x27;m not sure if this was just rancid or what because Suki makes lovely beauty items. Oh well.</li>
            <li> My skin is terribly fickle.  And I never know when or why it changes it&#x27;s mind....but this lotion tends to always work for my skin without causing breakouts.  It is really good during summer months.  I had to supplement it or use a heavier moisturizer during the extremely cold dry months-but still use this for day time.  Been using it for several years now and each time I try to move away from it thinking it might not be as effective, I come back after a few weeks.  Soaks right in and does not take much...about 2 drops on still damp skin if you break out easily gives good results.</li>
            <li> Like it because it does a decent job of keeping my skin smooth, and unlike Clarins, won&#x27;t cause me to break out after a few days of continuous use!&lt;br /&gt;However, it contains retinol, which makes your skin more sensitive to sunlight - don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise to use, if age spots is a concern...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I only use it at night :)</li>
            <li> The product gets good ratings for lack of toxicity and the packaging is nice, but it smells so bad I don&#x27;t know if I can use it.  It smells like really strong insect repellent to me, absolutely awful.  I can tolerate that if I have to but don&#x27;t want to smell that way to others.   I&#x27;m trying to find organic products that also smell good and this is coming off my list.</li>
            <li> Several years ago my skin developed many contact sensitivities.  I had been using Lancome products for a number of years at the time.  I switched to Clinque in hopes that brand would help my skin issues.  I tried several drug store brands; my dermatologist recommended cetaphil.  None of these skin care lines helped.  Then I found Suki products, and tried the skin care kit.  This product and others in the kit have thankfully brought my skin back to normal.  I also appreciate using products without the chemicals and a lovely clean smell.  My face just feels so very soft now - and no one ever believes I&#x27;m in my mid-40s, but think I&#x27;m 10 years younger!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Suki......  must I say more?  Love Suki products!  I am in my (very) late 40&#x27;s and my skin is changing drastically.  I tried Suki and now I have no issues.  No grease - No dryness - No breakouts - No rash.....  Just healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  In response to another review re: unpleasant smell.  I disagree completely.  I find the smell of this system to be very pleasant - a very light citrusy fragrance which dissipates quickly.  I&#x27;ve now been using this system for a couple of months and my skin is in the best shape it has ever been.  Smooth, blemish free, much less oily than before. I also use the Eye Repair Balm around my eyes and have seen some improvement in the fine lines there so I started using it on the deep crease between my eyes, and it is now also softening up a bit. My initial review is confirmed - this is a great system!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;This review is for the entire Suki for oily skin system (Exfoliate Foaming Cleanser, Balancing Toner, Balancing Day Lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have struggled with my extremely oily, congested &amp; blemish prone skin all of my life (I&#x27;m 44).  I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap grocery store brands, to expensive department store brands, to exclusive salon lines (both natural and conventional skin care lines) with little success.  Some worked better than others, but none of them really helped all that much.  I was still so oily an hour after cleansing and putting on my makeup that my face would be shining like a beacon and my makeup would be melting off.  I went through package after package of oil blotting tissues every day trying to stem the tide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried Suki.  Even with just the little samples that I received, I could tell the difference.  My face felt clean and refreshed without being dry or tight, and lightly moisturized after using the balancing day lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours later, my skin was still fresh, soft and NOT OILY! My makeup stayed in place.  of course, I immediately ordered the full size set of these items.  They&#x27;re not cheap, but they are so worth it.  I can go all day, blotting only once or twice, with fresh, soft, non-oily skin and my makeup looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a little while, I can see that my skin texture is also beginning to improve.  Several enlarged oil glands on my forehead, which a dermatologist said would have to be professionally removed (which would leave scabs for a couple of weeks) and would then most likely come back later, are now diminishing by themselves.  Some have disappeared entirely and others have gotten a lot smaller and less noticeable.  And that&#x27;s after less than a week of using the Suki products.  I have had no blemishes since I started using this system daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing line of products.  I will be a devoted user for life!  If you have troubled, congested, oily skin, do yourself and favor and get the sample set of this line and give it a try.  It&#x27;s a miracle!lso beginning to improve.

            <li> During a recent facial I had a UV photo taken of my face - definite combination skin but I&#x27;d never really used anything specifically for combination (t-zone) skin because I&#x27;ve been battling acne, period.  The esthetician chose the Suki line for my facial.  Loved the facial and wound up purchasing the suki Balancing Day Lotion.  That was Friday, this is Monday.  I know it sounds hard to believe, but I see a difference already.  My oily areas seem under control and a large red pimple I had is much less inflammed and red, and it&#x27;s almost gone.  I plan to stick with this product for a while (I use Neutragena Naturals face wash and will be receiving my Clarisonic Mia from Amazon tomorrow - also used on me during the facial).  I hate to get my hopes up that I might have found a combination of products that work, but so far things seem to be improving.  I&#x27;ll update in a little while...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Finished the bottle and generally saw no improvement in my combination skin.  I went to the Origins counter and found a product there, \\&quot;Balanced Diet\\&quot; that is cheaper, lasts longer, and worked wonders on my combination skin.  I&#x27;ve been loyal to that product for years now.</li>
            <li> Feels lightless. Good smell. Skin feels clean even after applying make up over the cream. Easy to clean the face</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for a light anti-age and control of face sebum.&lt;br /&gt;This product is utterly horrible.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of liquorice is so strong and overpowering that i feel it until i wash off the cream in the evening.And mind you, i am not allergic and i have nothing against strong natural scents.But this smell is intense to the point i had to force myself to use the cream.&lt;br /&gt;I endured the experiment with this for a week,my skin started flaking and i could not use foundation.After a week of using this lotion the skin around my mouth turned yellow.The day after after a long shower i noticed that my freshly washed face was covered in while bits of peeled skin.I washed my face again and the whole outer layer of my skin just peeled off,leaving me with raw red face.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this lotion  without trying this in samples for a week!</li>
            <li> Your skin says a lot about you. This product is unbelievable. Used after toning and cleansing your face.. you will see a difference right away. I promise you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was excited to try this \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product on my oily, blemish-prone 40-year-old skin. Unfortunately, right after using it, I got 3 tiny painful pustules (a kind I never get) in places on my face where I never get zits. :-(</li>
            <li> Found these products while on a trip in Seattle. This is my third bottle to date. Lightweight, non-greasy, but moisturizes effectively. Looking forward to using some of their other products...</li>
            <li> this stuff quickly absorbs, and is non greasy.. also smells pretty good. i use this every now and then, switching between this and the suki balancing day oils. this lotion will be perfect for hot summer days when i am naturally more oily and cant imagine adding more oil&#x27;s to the mix. i buy this product over and over because it definitely is useful, even if i dont use it every single day.</li>
            <li> Love the texture ,smell and feel on my face. This is by far the best facial lotion, it does not leave a oily residue feeling, going on 1 year using this product and I am very pleased with the way my face looks and feels!</li>
            <li> This along with Suki&#x27;s camomile moisture serum are the only skin products that keep my skin clear and happy. I have super sensitive combo/oily skin. I literally use nothing else but water on my face. My skin is totally happy with one pump of this product mixed with the other serum twice a day. A little goes a long way! Its like magic!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend all SukiFace products! Most have organic or natural ingredients. I have used several products for quite some time now including foaming cleanser, sugar scrub, toner, day lotion, transformation clay and cleansing bar and I highly recommend them. I am over 50 and still fight with the occasional outbreak of acne but these products minimize the outbreaks. If I do get a bleemish - I use the transformation clay overnight and wow ---- practically gone. All of these products are awesome!</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this face lotion from somewhere stuck in my travel cosmetic case.  Used it on vacation and got hooked.  I really noticed a difference in my complexion and it helped with under-eye darkness.  Now, I&#x27;m using the face lotion, the lemongrass scrub, the face brightener and the tinted moisturizer.  Absolutely love the smell and the texture of these products and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Love this light hydrating lotion, keeps my face from being oily. Love the healthy and clean ingredients on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the amount of moisture- not oily but very smooth/hydrating. Lovely natural fragrance. Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It is pure and gentle and works awesome. It is so natural and I have used it for years. Amazon had the best price</li>
            <li> Suki products are clean with good ingredients but they don&#x27;t work well. I bought all of the skin care becasue the ingredients were good but the product was greasy and didn&#x27;t do what was advertised.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample, thank goodness I didn&#x27;t pay for it. This by far is the worst product ever. After the first application, it seemed just ok. It absorbs quickly and wasn&#x27;t greasy. After a few more days of wearing this, the corners of my mouth and lips were cracked so badly that it hurt to open my mouth just even a little. My lips look like they had gone through a harsh winter in a matter of a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I know everybody&#x27;s skin is different but I thought I&#x27;d share my experience. If it helps, I have combination skin which is also non sensitive.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not very lotion - like.  It feels dry, and is hard to put on because of it. My face also feels dry with it on, and not in a good way. Possibly ideal for someone with very oily skin.</li>
            <li> The price of this hurts but so does addle acne so I find this is a nice something in-between.  Great ingredients--glad for something without siliones to clog pores and require scrubbing to remove from the face.  It is light, soaks in well, and is adequately moisturizing for my moderately dry acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this moisturizer.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of all of their products, but this moisturizer is worth every penny and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> First heard of this product and purchased from my Naturopath.  I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does such a good job of moisturizing my skin without irritating it.  I like the scent as well!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything good for my skin. It made my pores huge but I was skeptical about such an expensive product doing the opposite of what it claims but as soon as I stopped using it they went back to normal. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best day creams i have ever used, no fillers like water,great ingredients and organic a perfect solution for those with blemishes and oily skin .</li>
            <li> This was my last purchase to complete the Suki care line I&#x27;m on and I must say it&#x27;s the icing on the cake.  I exfoliate, use the balancing toner, then follow through with this day lotion (all Suki products) and my skin has never look so radiant.  I was first turned off by the smell because it is really concentrated but you get over that once you see the effects.  I also like how the first ingredient isn&#x27;t water like most drug store lotions.  Secondly, this is the first time I&#x27;ve been using a lotion on a daily basis because I have very oily skin and don&#x27;t want to add more sheen/moisture/oil to my face, but this facial lotion actually helps to improve overall complexion (dulls redness of any blemishes and scars) and mattes your face.  I mean I still use oil blotting wipes to control the oil but it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s habit by now and not prompted by obvious oil build up on the face.  In other words, it makes oil build up on the face a lot less noticeable, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of it.  I knocked off a star because of the amount that&#x27;s given.  1 fl oz isn&#x27;t much, especially compared to how much toner and facial exfoliant Suki provides.  And the thing isn&#x27;t cheap either.  But overall, I recommend this product and the whole Suki skin care line to people with very oily skin and random blemishes.</li>
            <li> for sensitive skin that breaks out - this works.  If you have combination skin, this product works well.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and allergic to the chemical compound form of salicylic acid that are usually in most skin care products.  I tried this product two years ago after reading the ingredients on the package, and found that the salicylic acid in it is extracted naturally from white willow bark.  It is also packed with many antioxidants in natural from and loaded with vitamins that are excellent for skin.  Since the ingredients are natural, my sensitive skin has not experienced any side effects at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with vitamin c serum, and my skin looks glowing even with little to no make up.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love all Suki products, and i really love this toner!&lt;br /&gt;It smells so good and fresh, does not irritate the skin and i can apply it before or after using make up to either set the make up in, or even after a long day spray my face with it to balance out the shine and keep my face looking refreshed and not tired.&lt;br /&gt;I got a small one this time, but want to order a bigger size next time cause it gets used up quickly.</li>
