            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and it is so great to be able to skip the blow drying step!</li>
            <li>This iron is really amazing.  </li>
            <li>(remember I never straightened my own hair before)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a no fuss kind of gal</li>
            <li>, i couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my purchase. :)</li>
            <li>This is really the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>greatttttttttttttttttttttttt, awesome, works very well, would never buy anything else.</li>
            <li>an absolute great buy for anyone searching for a great iron</li>
            <li>nice.</li>
            <li>Auto shutdown feature - don&#x27;t have to worry about burning your apt down&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Bought it for my girlfriend she liked it</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with this purchase and the changes/improvements that Remmington made.  </li>
            <li>I was kind of torn whether to give it 4 stars or 5.</li>
            <li>I have naturally very curly hair and it flattens it perfectly</li>
            <li>This is so nice because it cuts time from blow drying, the straightening.</li>
            <li>The gauge is so flimsy that it turns on its own while I&#x27;m doing my hair so sometimes my hair will smell burnt</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest</li>
            <li>The price might be cheap on this product, but there is nothing cheap about the quality!!!</li>
            <li>But I have &amp;#34;easy-to-straighten&amp;#34; hair so that might not mean that this straightener is perfect for everyone.</li>
            <li>is a good product, it recoemindo, just have to be sure of the size or appropriate measures according to what you want.</li>
            <li>Very easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Well never pay $50 or more on another ceramic one when this works way better!</li>
            <li>good size and weight, not too light.......</li>
            <li>and this by far is the best I have ever used!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and very comfortable in your hand.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable egg shell feel and great light notification feature.</li>
            <li>This is a great brand and it is a nice improvement to the older version of this product.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice design and heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>Bought for my Grand daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>Most fried her hair.</li>
            <li>Did all it said it would do and more.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this straightener</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>So much better</li>
            <li>I love that i can straighten my hair in just under 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my sister who used my 2005 model and fell in love with the ability to skip the hairdrying stage.</li>
            <li>I use it with the Moroccan infused Suave products and love the results.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>it heats up within 20 seconds at the most.</li>
            <li>I love this iron.</li>
            <li>it worths more than the price.</li>
            <li>PLEASED</li>
            <li>I was so impressed I purchased for my personal use .</li>
            <li>for any type of hair. :)</li>
            <li>Might be faster drying, but faster is not always better or heathier.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this</li>
            <li>Love love love this item.</li>
            <li>how many times I straighten it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the product over all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to straighten my hair every morning before work without having to wake up at 3 am.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I Have Been Receiving Many Compliments.</li>
            <li>Made my hair straight and shiny and even when I went out in the rain today, it still looked great when I got to work.</li>
            <li>Would recommend and will will for sure replace it when another Remington when the time comes.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li>and I am still in love with the size of that one.</li>
            <li>But is OK</li>
            <li>But if you have healthier hair, especially hair that has not been chemically treated, this would probably work great for you!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had this for 6 weeks or more.</li>
            <li>Works best on damp hair and is amazing for this busy working mom...anything that saves me time is worth it.</li>
            <li>I really love this iron.</li>
            <li>I love this brand</li>
            <li>and I love this item.</li>
            <li>it is ok save some time at mornings</li>
            <li>This iron works for me even when my hair is a bit more than damp.</li>
            <li>I bought this off a recommendation from my sister in law who has very curly hair and when she straightens her hair, it looks great.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love being able to style my hair damp before it get out of control.</li>
            <li>I just love this thing.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I got rid of my regular straightener and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Great iron, heats up fast and leaves my hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I can find a better seller.</li>
            <li>I love it though I spend almost 150 purchasing it...</li>
            <li>Also makes your hair static.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and this dries it out even more.  </li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>great product, irons hair very well.</li>
            <li>It does a much better job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know more than that.</li>
            <li>I love this hair iron.</li>
            <li>Both my daughters love it.</li>
            <li>but it drys it much better than a blow dryer.</li>

            <li>Excellent flat iron.</li>
            <li>Best flat iron I have ordered online.</li>
            <li>This Remington flat iron is awesome.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but after one use, I am VERY SATISFIED that I purchased this!</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>I first tried it out on my side bangs since they weren&#x27;t straight, and it straightened it perfectly!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and comes with detailed instructions.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, very quick</li>
            <li>She loved how it looked and it was not difficult.</li>
            <li>I Loved this straightner from the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good</li>
            <li>it straightens it pretty good.  </li>
            <li>She loved it so much, I had to order her one!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple of months now and it is still as good as the first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the product is still one of the best on the market but the older version would warrant a higher rating than the newer version.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!!</li>
            <li>(I have very long hair and need help sometimes with it) and was so impressed she wanted one...</li>
            <li>Very happy, what I expected and works as it should.</li>
            <li>However for wet hair is excellent!</li>
            <li>If you have no idea for your own hair, I can say usually 15 is the best place to start for any hair type.</li>
            <li>I have gotten compliments and my husband and kids prefer my straight hair to the perm that I thought was a good idea.</li>
            <li>good for fast straightning</li>
            <li>Good price and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several \\&quot;good hair days\\&quot; using this product and that warrants the 5 star review more than anything in my book!</li>
            <li>All in all, a very good flat iron for a steal!</li>
            <li>However, I bit the bullet and went ahead with it since I did really love the original so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>flattens hair easily without burning it.</li>
            <li>creases hair easily</li>

            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>The unit heats up very quickly, and I have not had any problems with tangles or the unit pulling on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Does dries hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>It heat up very quickly, and i used it on the highest heat setting.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>easy to use,no piroblem with it,got it on time,would buy again.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and instructions were understandable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*you could easily burn yourself with the steam it lets out...</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly</li>
            <li>strong warnings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But once straighteners began coming out, I purchased the CHI first, since it was widely popular</li>
            <li>I have really fine, curly hair and this straightened it well.</li>
            <li>I use it now to straighten the ends and it looks fine but can&#x27;t wait until those frizzy ends get cut off.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re short on time it&#x27;s definitely a splendid convenience.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>but I would be willing to pay more for better.</li>
            <li>but I would be willing to pay more for better.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and easy to use.</li>
            <li>it seems to work just fine if its not all the way turned up.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and the soy lotion makes hair smooth.  </li>
            <li>I had previously owned one of these and loved it!!</li>
            <li>Super cute and well made.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to style my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>When it was time to use the straightener I was pleased with how quickly it heated up.</li>
            <li>I have had it for four months now and have straightened my hair more often than I used to because of how quickly it heats up and</li>
            <li>She absolutely LOVES it and says she has got more compliments on her hair than ever!</li>
            <li>I love that this product is 2\\&quot; and I can do my hair so fast!!</li>
            <li>This thing gets VERY hot!</li>
            <li>and it does get very hot!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super smooth, even better than the original.  </li>
            <li>Straightens hair well and leaves it smooth for days.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great after only about 5 minutes of use!</li>
            <li>smooth glide&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just tried it on a few strands and I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li>it is lightweight, comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>it feels great when something brings back words of praise.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and takes the frizz away.</li>
            <li>But if you have healthier hair, especially hair that has not been chemically treated, this would probably work great for you!touch.</li>
            <li>&quot; light just kept flashing</li>
            <li>Smooth plates, no snags, but</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>Runs through my hair really smoothly.</li>
            <li>But now it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and turns off automatically which are two nice features.  </li>
            <li>If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use gels in my hair that fight fizziness or to smooth it as it just makes my hair look like I dumped oil on it.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and this product made my hair nice and straight and gave it body.  </li>
            <li>it makes a hissing sound too.</li>
            <li>Between the serum and iron, my hair is silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I came upon this straightener from my hair stylist of 15 years, she simply stated I needed anything Remington Branded, that they were great</li>
            <li>The ceramic soy infused plates allow you to smooth over your hair and it leaves a glossy sheen.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect as it is not too big but gets the job done in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had really good luck with this product so far.</li>
            <li>I ordered this one without hesitation because i had faith that it would work as good as the old one..</li>
            <li>And the price iS fair enough :-)</li>
            <li>heats up very fast leaves my hair very soft and smooth great  width on the heating plate</li>
            <li>it was very worth it)</li>
            <li>This flatiron is great for one step styling instead of blow drying &amp; then flat ironing.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Gets really hot which is good but does make your hair very frizzy.</li>
            <li>This product is the greatest, and even in high humidity, which normally makes my hair curl, it stayed straight.</li>
            <li>It works well, and I have not noticed any significant damage.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you read the instructions first.  </li>
            <li>I accidentally threw away (dont ask) the original Wet2Straight iron i had for years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li>like i found with the original.  </li>
            <li>Nothing was fried or damaged, there were no flyaways, but most importantly, my hair was very sleek and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this.</li>
            <li>If you get one that grips well, it does work on wet hair beautifully, but</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous products and the best one I have found so far is Tigi S Factor Silky Smooth serum.  </li>
            <li>worth buying!</li>
            <li>With my hair as damaged as it already is (colored and fine), being able to skip the blow drying step should really help it on the road to recovery.</li>
            <li>With my hair as damaged as it already is (colored and fine), being able to skip the blow drying step should really help it on the road to recovery.</li>
            <li>My favorite  by far!!!!</li>
            <li>Getting ready for work has never been this easy!</li>
            <li>I have very wavy and very fine hair.</li>
            <li>The whole idea of being able to basically skip a step (blow drying) sounded fantastic to me.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t clean it.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t any marks and it was clean in a sealed plastic bag.</li>
            <li>I used it for 2 times and it was amazing , then I ordered 2 more for my friend , then suddenly it&#x27;s stop working</li>
            <li>I was kinda scared at first because I have fine, easily damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and my hair feels great, doesn&#x27;t seem too dry at all.</li>
            <li>It helps make your hair feel more healthy after using it your hair feels really soft.</li>
            <li>Keep the plates clean with just a damp/wet rag while cooled and unplugged.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this flat iron so far as it tames the friz for the most part.</li>
            <li>These flat irons are amazing!</li>
            <li>Make sure that you are holding your hand either below or to the side of the steam vents (as the steam rises), as I was quickly reminded just how hot the steam coming from the hair can be (when I forgot).</li>
            <li>, 2 Inch is as close to perfect as I have gotten so far with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I tried other straighteners and they work perfectly and keep my hair straight without hairspray.</li>
            <li>It is fine and I am not unhappy; just can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Straightening my hair was usually a special occasion thing because of the hours of work that had to be invested in the procedure.</li>
            <li>It is just way too large and would work much better for someone with longer hair or thicker hair.</li>
            <li>It is just way too large and would work much better for someone with longer hair or thicker hair.</li>
            <li>and the price was right!</li>
            <li>something can&#x27;t be right!</li>
            <li>The flat iron itself has yet to burn me, but I did get a pretty good steam burn on my scalp once from not holding the hair away from my head, but more at a downward angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The width is a hard to find one and this one is perfect for her needs.</li>
            <li>It works great on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>the only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 star is because it didn&#x27;t come in good packaging...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay full</li>
            <li>/&gt;honestly, I would suggest spending a bit more and having an iron that works really well and lasts a loooong time.</li>
            <li>It works well and fast as a dryer, and does minimize damage and leave your hair healthy.</li>
            <li>but the iron was cool to the touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several \\&quot;good hair days\\&quot; using this product and that warrants the 5 star review more than anything in my book!good result, it still absolutely works as it says it will.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely order more</li>
            <li>I use this iron every day, and my hair stays straight and healthy.</li>
            <li>cool</li>
            <li>Thank you sooooo much :)</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad straightener</li>
            <li>It sound great because I could save time by not having to completely dry my hair first.</li>
            <li>Its perfect and unbelievable!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good also for a quick run over in the evening on dry hair (amber light showing and a setting between 10-17 on the dial) before going out for dinner or to a party etc.  </li>
            <li>It is also fairly hefty, it tires out my arm before I&#x27;m finished flat ironing.</li>
            <li>It is also fairly hefty, it tires out my arm before I&#x27;m finished flat ironing.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, has solid construction (nice fit and finish), and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>it heats up really quick</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>not so it&#x27;s nice to hear a sound if you&#x27;re in the middle of finishing your hair when it shuts off and starts cooling</li>
            <li>but I quickly learned it was NO upgrade.  </li>
            <li>Better to buy online more expense in the store by 8 dollars ...the only thing I don&#x27;t like when you put up to your head the plate burns your head ..</li>
            <li>I Love this hair straightener, it works perfect with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>With this iron I&#x27;ve not had any of the static problems I have with the expensive chi and am very happy with my affordable choice this time around.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and well packaged</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, has an automatic shut off</li>
            <li>It does amazing things to my hair better than any much higher priced flat iron has (i.e. Chi), my sister used it on my hair</li>
            <li>I had an older Conair ceramic flat iron that I LOVED, but the handle finally cracked apart after 12 years, so I bought this as a replacement because of the really great reviews.</li>
            <li>Gets very hot but the heating element has not burned and keeps temp up well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Use on wet hair at your own risk!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too hot to use a straightener or curler to smooth it out and just go with</li>
            <li>Gets very hot.</li>
            <li>was really excited about the straightener its ok so far..</li>
            <li>Gets very hot.</li>
            <li>pretty light weight</li>
            <li>She uses it everyday with beautiful results.</li>
            <li>It made getting ready so quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I had borrowed an older model (same brand) and it worked great</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me, I already knew from the original that the best setting was likely right in the middle for my damp hair, and so I was easily able to get it on the same level as before by turning it to 15.</li>
            <li>soy hydra complex surprisingly seems to do an even better job at smoothing hair than the original tourmaline did.</li>
            <li>I thought that the new S7230 would have to be somehow better...</li>
            <li>I bought the new version for my 5th wheel and love it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and healthy looking (</li>
            <li>Perfectly straight hair!!</li>
            <li>This one won&#x27;t grab onto the hair, very flimsy!!</li>
            <li>like many have also noted, better to let the hair dry a bit before straightening.  </li>
            <li>Also would be nice if this one had a little more rounded body so that I could easily give a gentle curl/curve to my ends instead.</li>
            <li>If I curl it with a separate curling iron it looks fine, otherwise if I want it pin straight</li>
            <li>she can straighten wet or dry hair and my daughter loves it alot and keeps them from stealing each others lol thanks and loved the shipping</li>
            <li>great for travelling or drying hair when you have little time</li>
            <li>However, as I finished and brushed through my hair once more, it was PERFECTLY FINE.</li>
            <li>She is very happy with the flat iron as it does cut out having to dry her hair out before flattening it.  </li>
            <li>(it worked great), most of the time I use it with dry hair (though I do put heat protected spray; i use the Brazilian Keratin Flat Iron Spray.)</li>
            <li>It took some time but did everything in one step and made her hair poker straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>but I needed something fast and cheap.</li>
            <li>She says it really saves her lots of time styling her hair now and leaves it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I found I didn&#x27;t need to use nearly as much hair product to get silky smooth results as I did with the tourmaline</li>
            <li>I even like this better than the old Remington</li>
            <li>Straightening your hair while wet everyday isn&#x27;t the best idea for healthy hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never yet tried this on my wet hair, and it&#x27;s a good thing:</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it is worth the investment though.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and fantastic!</li>
            <li>The Remington S7230 offers just a bit more.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite straightener.</li>
            <li>This works best on people with thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice to finally have a straightener that allows me to straighten my hair while wet/damp -</li>
            <li>So far, I love it.</li>
            <li>worth the money tbh.</li>
            <li>My favorite by far is TreSemme Keratin Infused Shampoo &amp; conditioners.</li>
            <li>Around $5 for each bottle but soooo worth it.</li>
            <li>this wet2straight is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair straight all day, gets rid of most of the flyaways, and leaves it with a nice healthy shin from the soy hydra complex and the tourmaline.</li>
            <li>it does best on DAMP hair, not WET hair, so make sure you towel dry your hair well prior to usage.</li>
            <li>it does best on DAMP hair, not WET hair, so make sure you towel dry your hair well prior to usage.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with the heat setting options (you can make it super hot or low heat depending on how wet/dry your hair is while using the iron).  </li>
            <li>&amp;#60;3 I would recommend this to just abt any female searching for an excellent flat iron at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you will love this Flat Iron as much as I have.</li>
            <li>but this flat iron is amazing and worth the money</li>
            <li>wet)&lt;br /&gt;- makes hair super glossy and pretty</li>
            <li>Leaves hair super straight and shiny!</li>
            <li>Heats Up super fast!</li>
            <li>Not sure how good it would work on wet hair, but I am very pleased!</li>
            <li>It heats up super quick and takes no time at all to straighten my very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, good straightener for a decent price.</li>
            <li>While the older version was a more user friendly and results were smoother a lot quicker, while the newer version is better on wet or damp hair but time</li>
            <li>This flat iron is amazing.. will recommend this product..</li>
            <li>one really is an improvement over the original.</li>
            <li>and I made the right</li>
            <li>Additionally, I can use it right after the shower while my hair is still damp.</li>
            <li>All right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve own many in the past and I wish I would of come across this one sooner.</li>
            <li>nice long cord and gets hot quick</li>
            <li>Overall the Remington S7230 is great for a quickly straightening your still soggy hair and eliminating the extra step of having to use a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I also find that this works better on my damp/wet hair than the original (which i only liked to use on dry hair)</li>
            <li>- there&#x27;s no distinguishing between what temperatures are best for what hair types on the wet and dry settings.</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair and have difficulty finding one that actually works, but this one is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I get better results with my old flat iron, it was more economical than this</li>
            <li>I love that you have several settings and it does good on wet hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased the wet to straight flat iron after reading most of the reviews, both positive and not so great ones.</li>
            <li>I have a fantastic straightening iron that I love but have to dry my hair most of the way prior to using it</li>
            <li>then I bet it&#x27;s amazing with dry</li>
            <li>The package arrived very well wrapped and protected, the iron heats up quickly, glides without problems, no hair pulling, hair frizz</li>
            <li>For the price moves super straight and shiny hair.</li>
            <li>Hair is super straight and shiny</li>
            <li>It Leaves My Hair Super Straight.</li>
            <li>Great on dry hair but on damp hair if u dont go through quick enough it will fry your ends!</li>
            <li>It does warn you that it will make a hissing sound on wet hair, but that is OK.</li>
            <li>The plates get very hot and you can&#x27;t really hold the head of the straighter to help guide it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She was very excited to get the new iron; there were a few things she liked right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>It is naturally very straight</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>actual use the flat iron worked great.  </li>
            <li>manage)&lt;br /&gt;It heats up super fast and there are different heat settings :-)</li>
            <li>Minor touching up sometimes like rainy days but other than that it stays gorgeous for two-three days at most.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I was weary of owning a straightener before, but this product is high quality and true to its promises.</li>
            <li>I have been using a large round barrel brush in front of the iron to get a nice smooth look.</li>
            <li>This Flat iron deserves 5 stars, its absolutely the best you are literally done in half the time.</li>
            <li>but this iron is amazing on wet hair..</li>
            <li>say I turn the heat seating on A to low and the heat setting on B to the the highest.&lt;br /&gt;The heat on A is more than B.</li>
            <li>And my hair definitely looks more polished.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair straight and shiny!</li>
            <li>It never gets hot on the outer shell even when there is heat going to the irons.</li>
            <li>The steam is hot and the hair is hot to the touch immediately after straightening it.</li>
            <li>This is the first straightener that I have ever purchased or used.  </li>
            <li>Gets too hot.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>The soy really does work!</li>
            <li>so you have to do smaller, thinner locks of hair which takes more time as you turn what would have been 10 locks of hair into</li>
            <li>When I first passed the iron on my hair</li>
            <li>Works as well as the much higher priced irons.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great at first, but don&#x27;t expect it to last long.</li>
            <li>It does get pretty hot (which you can control)</li>
            <li>I bought this iron for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>but the style lasts the whole day and does not frizz!</li>
            <li>So let me start out by saying I have pretty unmanageable hair.  </li>
            <li>The product was exactly what it said it would be</li>
            <li>but it gets really hot</li>
            <li>Because of that it is pretty porous.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now several times a week (the 2 inch width) and it is just okay.</li>
            <li>but it was the first straightener I ever owned</li>
            <li>so I picked it up to feel if it was hot</li>
            <li>I ended up finding this one at Target for basically the same price (even if it was much more, Target price matches now).</li>
            <li>I ultimately decided on 5 stars because I love it</li>
            <li>this was exactly what the recipient wanted.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really hot</li>
            <li>Definitely reccomend :)</li>
            <li>Seems to work well but need to be aware of settings</li>
            <li>I also love how you only have to go over the hair twice!</li>
            <li>It does get really hot</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>the price for the product is pretty damn awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is hot.</li>
            <li>;] IT WORKS.</li>
            <li>have split ends for the first time ever...</li>
            <li>I love the larger size.</li>
            <li>Only thing that could make it better is an auto shut off afyer 30 mins or hour.</li>
            <li>, REALLY hot - so to prevent damage, be SURE to use a product to protect the cuticle (I cannot emphasize this enough)!</li>
            <li>My hair feels and is so much healthier!</li>
            <li>Well this time I&#x27;ve had my recent one almost two years and make sure to turn it OFF then unplug.</li>
            <li>I had a Chi for a few years and loved it</li>
            <li>I used to have little fly aways on the top of my head from my other straighteners burning pieces off without my noticing</li>
            <li>my little sister loved it, as it irons quickly and hair can be wet, my older sister liked it so much that she ordered another one for herself.</li>
            <li>It dries your hair easily and it remains straight and soft after hours</li>
            <li>I used them on my hair right after washing and it got bone straight.</li>
            <li>It is not very wide, perhaps I need to spend more time becoming accustomed to the way to use it so my bangs lay flat.</li>
            <li>but I decided to try this first as it is significantly cheaper, almost suspiciously cheap for a flat iron, and I figured I wouldn&#x27;t be out much</li>
            <li>I am in love with this flat iron, and recommend it to EVERYONE I know that has curly hair or is really busy!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron and converted from a $300 one that didn&#x27;t work as well as this one.</li>
            <li>I used flat iron spray, and didn&#x27;t even have it at the top heat setting.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>This 2 in flat iron was the largest I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a great stylist, and has done wonders with my hair over the years, so, paired with my just-average experiences with this flat iron on my hair dry</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I needed a new straightener, and since I genuinely dislike blow drying my hair and then straightening it, I decided to give this particular model a try.</li>
            <li>I know it sounds great, but I did scald my hair in several places after using it on my wet hair.  </li>
            <li>Gets hot pretty fast.</li>
            <li>The iron also does not grip very well unto the hair so not being able to hold the head of it to give it the extra grip is a bother.</li>
            <li>This one is similar in that it is not digital (this is good for me and what I was looking for).</li>
            <li>This one could probably be an effective flatiron, but only after the blow-drying is complete.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it performs well on my dry hair, heats up quickly, and is easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just given mine to my sister, who&#x27;s used to blow drying her hair on a regular basis, but she&#x27;s just had twins, so this should be a good alternative for her as well, given the relatively low noise level of it.</li>
            <li>I also love the soy hydra complex feature because it makes my hair smooth!</li>
            <li>- it lasted me almost 5 and a half years, always worked well, got and stayed hot... just a nice straightener all around.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews before purchasing this product and it was mostly positive</li>
            <li>Although my hair dresser states that people would give anything to have my hair so that they could just wash it and let it dry with beautiful curls, I on the other hand want it straight!</li>
            <li>I can pretty much hop out of the shower,</li>
            <li>Gets really hot and really straightens.</li>
            <li>and it just made my hair really frizzy, but this is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Ok for the price lets see how long it lasts ..</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty naturally straight already, so I can&#x27;t review the quality of this as a straightening iron.</li>
            <li>Be aware that it gets really</li>
            <li>For the first time my hair is STRAIGHT</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>this flat iron definitely dries your hair as good as a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>My sedu iron which cost me about $150.00 recently broke and I was looking for a good flat alternative.</li>
            <li>Even better that I can skip the blow drying step and go straight to flat ironing out of the shower</li>
            <li>She&#x27;d stated that manufacturers have tried selling these products over the past 5 or so years, and they&#x27;ve never taken off, for good reason:</li>
            <li>Not outstanding, but good.  </li>
            <li>This is as good if not better than the straightener I purchased for my daughter at almost 4 times the cost.  </li>
            <li>great for the price:) Use on wet or dry hair-worth the price compared to salon flat irons.</li>
            <li>hair is nice, smooth and straight (I have very frizzy, curly hair, hard to</li>
            <li>Mostly use on my hair dry</li>
            <li>This worked ok when I used it on dry hair, but FRIED my hair when I used it on damp hair.</li>
            <li>It not only straightens my hair fabulously, it keeps the frizz out on those hot humid days in Georgia.  </li>
            <li>I love this straightener I towel dry my hair and straighten.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, note that you will get vastly better and healthier results relying on oil based protective hair products than you will silicone based ones (hair oil, hair dressing, etc) if you have curly, dry, damaged, and/or ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>I love using this to dry my hair though.</li>
            <li>Warms quickly and leaves hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li>good for long hair and short hair</li>
            <li>my drying time down a lot.&lt;br /&gt;*hair looks great until next time you wash it.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin and this iron seems to give my hair more body.  </li>
            <li>I have tried it as well and it leaves your hair soft and very straight!  </li>
            <li>it works great on wet or dry.</li>
            <li>It works great on wet hair as well as dry hair.</li>
            <li>Does a great weather my hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I also love that there&#x27;s a color flashing indicator on the switch telling me when it&#x27;s set to dry hair or straight hair.</li>
            <li>I used this flat iron on my towel dried hair yesterday and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>Her hair came out very shiny (Her favorite thing), straight and dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the product says that it works on wet, dry and damp hair (and it really does), for best results you should use it on damp hair (green light should be showing and a setting of somewhere around 20-24 on the dial which goes from 1-30).  </li>
            <li>Very effective in wet to dry straightening.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my new favorite flat iron!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoy using it and it has taken an entire step out of my getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>I love everything about my Remington Wet 2 Straight iron.  </li>
            <li>The plates heat up instantly and leaves my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>It really straighten your hair</li>
            <li>Name brands, advertised brands, nothing really did as it said it would.</li>
            <li>fast shipping...might get one for myself now...</li>
            <li>/&gt;- heats FAST</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair straight and silky even when its damn.</li>
            <li>She tells her friends and anyone that asks how she keeps her hair so straight.</li>
            <li>I have naturally really curly hair...</li>
            <li>I purchased this straight iron from a retail store.</li>
            <li>Works great with my thin hair.</li>
            <li>heats up fast.</li>
            <li>shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>and doesnt pull hair and dries and straightnes fast</li>
            <li>My hair just slides through, with out really straightening it</li>
            <li>The soy hydra didnt really make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I really like, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was unsure as to how this thing would really work.  </li>
            <li>It hurt so much all day.</li>
            <li>But now my hair wont stay straight no matter</li>
            <li>its ready to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As with every iron, hair looks thinner when it is straight.</li>
            <li>and I was never even able to use them while my hair was wet because they would fry my hair</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very wavy and curly in some places.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Very damaging on hair.</li>
            <li>Well it made my hair very frizzy and very unmanageable.</li>
            <li>It works  very well and does not burn or make your hair frizzy.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>This iron works very well...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to spray my hair with anything just to get it to be straight and non frizzy.</li>
            <li>Works really well, does the job in rapid time.</li>
            <li>&amp; I enjoy the quiet mornings.</li>
            <li>I love that I can skip the blow dryer to save time when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li>Although I have relatively straight hair, this iron works well for styling and adding body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky, but I expected more out of this straightener.</li>
            <li>but one morning while I was getting ready for work the \\&quot;ready\\</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know though</li>
            <li>and it really does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate having this product because it eliminates the need to blow-dry my hair after I take a shower.</li>
            <li>This takes out the whole blow drying step.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My hair is curly and my daughter&#x27;s is kinky coily curls and this almost gets our hair pin straight.</li>
            <li>so I ordered her one simliar and hope she likes it just as much as I do mine.  </li>
            <li>The dial hasn&#x27;t really had any learning curve at all to it, much to my surprise.</li>
            <li>This Iron really comes thru.  </li>
            <li>Very quality item.</li>
            <li>She likes it and wants to get one for my sister-in-law now.  </li>
            <li>so I was very leary about trying this.</li>
            <li>sometimes I&#x27;m wondering why my hair isn&#x27;t getting straight.</li>
            <li>recommend this hair iron to anyone who wants to buy it.</li>
            <li>so they were not straightened as much as she would like.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price for the product.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length wavy hair, with layers in the front that I like to keep straight and angled out of my face.</li>
            <li>It works very well just as described.</li>
            <li>straightens my hair really well.</li>
            <li>i have very frizzy hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Given the price of this product, I would say it does its functions reasonably well.</li>
            <li>okay though don&#x27;t last as far as it being straight</li>
            <li>Seems to hold the steamed straight look</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She says it heats up really fast and gets the job done faster.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely unsatisfied with this iron.</li>
            <li>the results are even better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair really frizzy, and the tips are still curly and won&#x27;t straighten.  </li>
            <li>It effectively straightens my mop of hair in just a few minutes instead of others that have taken me over an hour to use.</li>
            <li>i had the same brand product earlier the pearl finish one i gave to my sis in law as she liked it</li>
            <li>actually; it even surprised me, and related to that the iron felt good in her hand.  </li>
            <li>I simply hoped it would work better than my old one.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this for the wet to straight feature, but I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li>I do not think that it cuts down on too much time for me, which is the biggest drawback, but my hair did feel pretty soft and straight which I liked.</li>
            <li>With a little work I believe this could be a great flat iron that saves you a lot of time.</li>
            <li>This is a big improvement over my Old flat iron, which I Loved.  </li>
            <li>Of course it works better on dry hair, and most of the time I use it on my hair is just slightly damp.  </li>
            <li>the Remington flat iron will automatically turn itself off after 60 minutes and with the ceramic plates it doesn&#x27;t take long to cool down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very impressed with this iron and her other iron has been relagated to back of the drawer and never gets used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using it dry, it got my hair smooth and relatively straight, but it did nothing to fight the humidity that undid my efforts, and was really no more exceptional than anything else I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>I used it right after getting out of the shower and it dried my hair quickly and straighten it quick would recommend to all</li>
            <li>I began using it exactly according to directions, on the lowest setting for &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; hair, since I thought mine was a little more than damp.</li>
            <li>I used 300 dollar flat irons and also cheap ones that my friends have had</li>
            <li>I use a comb to keep the hair taught and tangle free as I pass the flat iron over it.</li>
            <li>Much better than expected!</li>
            <li>and i love the vents that allow you to straighten your hair while wet!</li>
            <li>The smaller size makes it great for getting down near the roots.</li>
            <li>15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older version had alert sounds letting you know when the iron was ready and when it was shutting itself off while the newer version has no sounds warnings so it can be turned on or off without you hearing anything</li>
            <li>It was also an add on item and the price was fantastic more than ten dollars less than in the store.</li>
            <li>The cord is nice and long, there is no constantly turning around to use the iron while in front of the mirror in the bathroom, also the cord angles off the side at the end of the iron</li>
            <li>We both like how fast it heated up and it seemed to cool down relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid area and even though my hair is mostly straight, the humidity makes it frizzy.</li>
            <li>Now I just lightly blow dry my roots then straight to this.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>If you want a good dry straightener, this will work, but DO NOT use it wet.</li>
            <li>it leaves it super straight and no extra frizz from the vent steam</li>
            <li>My daughter uses it both with wet and dry hair, and she&#x27;s delighted with it.</li>
            <li>My hair is very long and fine, and wavy/straightish naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li>I could never keep my hair straight for more than a day and now with this it last for various days.</li>
            <li>Does not beep when it gets hot or turns off after an hour like my old one</li>
            <li>I normally use the Hemp heat protecting balm on my hair but perhaps I now just need a much heavier protecting balm, so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li>Let me state that I did not use any sort of heat protectant (although, you normally should) just to see how well the soy conditioners worked and if it&#x27;d really leave my hair as the description promised it would.</li>
            <li>I contacted Remington customer service and they are letting me send it back for a full refund, thankfully.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;wet to straight&amp;#34;, slightly damp but mostly dry to straight would be more accurate.</li>
            <li>Days 2 and 3, my hair looks MUCH nicer after having slept on it; it takes little or no time to get it to look okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to say that because it does not work as nicely on dry hair.</li>
            <li>and I have paid alot more for less irons.  </li>
            <li>- I have to lightly blow dry the roots before using this product.</li>
            <li>If you use it with wet hair it dries it fast and leaves your hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I only put it on the lowest setting and it still got pretty hot under 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s an older model?</li>
            <li>I had an older version of this product and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot enough to do it the first time through.</li>
            <li>For a girl with thick coarse hair this has been great.  </li>
            <li>I now only use it from about 2 inches from my roots and then just give my roots a quick blow-dry after.&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li>I had to go over my hair four times to have it look decent, which sort of defeats the purpose of having a &amp;#34;wet to straight&amp;#34;, which i supposed to save me time.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair, towel dry it, then let the Wet to Straight iron do its magic!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Remington 2 inch flat iron heats up to full temperature</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with any hair type.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>We have the Remington S5500 that we use on my daughter&#x27;s hair, and which I highly recommend (and also have a review posted).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve found being able to gauge it by the sound of the sizzling (which can only be done on the first pass) helps prevent completely cooking all of the moisture in your hair, leaving the optimal amount of moisture behind to help keep it healthy and frizz free (helpful for those of us that normally can&#x27;t use dry heat styling on our hair due to how much moisture it takes out of it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ok so anyone in the market for a flat iron, go no further.</li>
            <li>After I use it my husband says my hair looks professionally done!!</li>
            <li>It has a little more to it than just turning it</li>
            <li>It took about an hour to even semi- straiten my hair, then I just ended up using my old one anyway!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gotten their hair just as straight and soft.</li>
            <li>This is the only one I have used where I don&#x27;t have to use it daily because of how smooth and straight it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>I use a heat protectant product on my sopping wet hair and then this finishes my hair to silky smooth in about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>and afterwards my hair is so much bouncy and alive</li>
            <li>I have mostly straight fine hair with a slight wave in some areas.</li>
            <li>I will say though that I have a friend with very curly natural hair that she straightens</li>
            <li>It works great with her thick long Hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this at the NEX, a bit more expensive than here, but it&#x27;s a good straightener FOR WET hair.</li>
            <li>I took a normal section of hair and the iron didn&#x27;t grab it</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and have had many compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I suspect this would work well on someone who has normal or oily hair.</li>
            <li>One other tip I would like to give is when you use this straightener, couple water will drip when you flat it so make sure those hot water drips dont get on ur skins.</li>
            <li>best way to use this on damp hair is to press the iron down on each section until the sizzling noise comes to an *almost* complete stop (don&#x27;t worry if it&#x27;s not completely silent, the last little bit of moisture will vaporize away on its own as your hair cools), then inch it forward a little bit by bit to the tips.</li>
            <li>The iron gets hot really fast and within seconds you are ready to straighten and dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>extremely recommend it, even if you have super duper curly hair!</li>
            <li>So I liked that it worked with wet hair and dry hair.</li>
            <li>Left my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>I spent half the morning on Amazon looking for a new one that would be both affordable and a good reviewed product.</li>
            <li>i got the new hair straight flat iron of reminginton s2730, on the first day i pulged into switch board, i got a burned smell &amp; fumes coming out of the machine...</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace my old Wet 2 Straight which I absolutely love and which finally died after six years.</li>
            <li>I no longer have any issues with getting hair caught in the plates if it gets turned the wrong way, problems with indentations from the vents has somehow been reduced (or maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m experienced with this particular type of flat iron now), and it feels a lot more heavy, solid, and well constructed than the original did, too.</li>
            <li>Actually my first Remington S7230 Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron didn&#x27;t work on my second use, I returned it to the store and ordered the same one on Amazon, because I believed that it would be the flat iron I was looking for, I tried it and It works great,</li>
            <li>But in the long run it was very very damaging to my hair!</li>
            <li>For reference, I have owned Chi and T3 irons in the high end range, and Hot Tools in the low end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gives my hair a nice smooth, soft finish in half the time, if not more.</li>
            <li>but i can live with that</li>
            <li>I got it since I needed a new one.</li>
            <li>It was in a box with a Remington sticker on it that said new.</li>
            <li>I was thinking maybe I needed a new straightener.</li>
            <li>When I needed to buy a new straightener, I bought this one thinking it would work well.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item new.</li>
            <li>I love the CHI pro flat iron and blow dry your hair with a thermal protectanct</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has the old one, or anyone who wants a cheap flat iron that works wonders.</li>
            <li>placenta work great, but it still isn&#x27;t as soft as letting it air dry totally before using a regular flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>placenta work great, but it still isn&#x27;t as soft as letting it air dry totally before using a regular flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that it&#x27;s less time consuming and far more effective to blow dry my hair and then use a traditional flat iron.</li>
            <li>I like the wet 2 straight feature because I don&#x27;t have to make sure my hair is completely dry</li>
            <li>It takes awhile to use on wet hair, it does dry it but doesn&#x27;t really save me any more time than it did when I used a blow dryer and straightener.</li>
            <li>The iron also is not heavy, which can be a problem with older irons,</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats up really fast though (but usually don&#x27;t really care because they all take relatively short time).</li>
            <li>The Remington S7230 Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron with Soy Hydra Complex is a very nice flat iron that leaves your hair feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Pros is that it gets hot very fast and gets my thick wavy hair pretty straight.</li>
            <li>NEVER flat iron hair that hasn&#x27;t been treated with some form of protective product first, though, no matter your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does get hot, much hotter than my wife&#x27;s old flat iron; the box says up to 425 degrees I believe it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair but leaves it very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got damaged colored frizzy hair, but no need to set this device on a very high temperature, this satisfies my expectations, makes my hair look flat and shiny (Thanks to the soy infused into the plates).</li>
            <li>OMG, I purchased the wet 2 straight last week and the very first time I used it I was amazed at the outcome!</li>
            <li>She is used to using a hair drier after showering if she wants straight hair and had never heard of wet 2 straight before.</li>
            <li>This actually works really well!</li>
            <li>It vents out the steam rather than forcing the hot steam back onto your hair.  </li>
            <li>And it is much more durable than irons she has had in the past.</li>
            <li>I will admit, the sizzle of hair totally freaked me out at first</li>
            <li>I am not able to use this close to the hair scalp as the heating element will be touching my hair scalp then.</li>
            <li>My significant other has been using this for about a month, and has no complaints.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;This is the first hair straightener I have personally owned.</li>
            <li>My first and second ones broke within a couple months because I would just leave it in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position and unplug.</li>
            <li>This flat iron gives my hair a sleek and smooth look and feel and lasts til the next wash.</li>
            <li>When I tried it, I found that it heated fast, but it pulled my hair (gets in the seams) and or the tension wasn&#x27;t high enough to grip my hair.</li>
            <li>Flat irons are expensive but this one is low cost andit works great!  </li>
            <li>Ordered this new Remington model because my old model conched out after about 4 years.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I was a little nervous about getting this version, as they&#x27;ve replaced the original tourmaline with the soy hydra complex, and the easy to read/comprehend digital display and buttons with a twisting temperature dial and power switch (which appeared to me like it would be more difficult/complex to use than a digital display).</li>
            <li>I have to go over each section of hair TWICE in order for it to get dry, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>There are many people who have had not problems with it, but to me it&#x27;s just not worth the risk of having open sores on your head.</li>
            <li>She definitely felt like it worked as far as the drying went, but overall her experience with the straightening portion was not anything special.</li>
            <li>It delivers on its claims and my hair does feel soft and it looks soft!</li>
            <li>I was unsure at first about this flat iron because it was so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>so I would recommend putting some oil or flat iron protection on your hair first.</li>
            <li>I would normally have to blow dry first, which would cause me to sweat.</li>
            <li>It does straighten wet hair better than dry.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to also adjust the temperature setting when switching from wet to dry hair.</li>
            <li>I am bummed about having to do even that, knowing that it will most likely burn out in a year, like the 2 previous ones did)</li>
            <li>You have to go over each piece a few times, but my hair has remained super straight all day.</li>
            <li>Not only does this product dry and straighten your hair, it comes out so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a couple of months now with everyday use and it holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it with my hair barely towel dried and almost dripping wet and while it definitely takes longer to get a good result, it still absolutely works as it says it will.</li>
            <li>After 2 days of using it i immediately got on Amazon to order another Wet 2 Straight!!</li>
            <li>Mainly that the hot iron and wet hair produces a lot of stream, so be care not to steam your ears off.  </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about using this, but for my hair it works great!</li>
            <li>When I used the iron on mostly dry hair, the way I used my Chi, it worked MUCH better but still not as well as my other iron.  </li>
            <li>I take my showers at night so straight ironing my hair while wet is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Well, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Just used this in my 12 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>So far, I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter because she has natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>I thought I was upgrading the old Remington</li>
            <li>Def need to use some product to add volume, otherwise contrast between roots and hair does not look natural</li>
            <li>Well, it works just as well as my last one, and the feel of it is much nicer.</li>
            <li>I would have to break out my old straightener.</li>
            <li>and it is also very frizzy, especially during summer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cons are (1) fixed, not floating plates and (2) doesn&#x27;t get hair quite as silky as my T3.  </li>
            <li>The instant on really save me time in the morning</li>
            <li>I have NEVER liked to do this, so I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>wow* me.  </li>
            <li>It has far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Makes her hair look so professionally done.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to all those that left reviews!</li>
            <li>I was grateful to know that ahead of time, but you should squeeze out as much excess water as possible.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, shiny and suoer straight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;*It&#x27;s a lot of direct heat...</li>
            <li>She uses a much more expensive and hotter iron that works much faster, but her hair is much curlier than mine.</li>
            <li>it was worth every penny (and considering it&#x27;s not very pricy</li>
            <li>I go slow waiting for the sizzle to stop before sliding any more.  </li>
            <li>It worked even better for my niece, her hair isn&#x27;t as thick as mine and doesn&#x27;t have any wave at all</li>
            <li>It is super thick and very, very wavy.</li>
            <li>I purchase this 5 months ago and it&#x27;s really on fire when I iron my curly thick hair and makes my hair perfectly straight and shiny!!!</li>
            <li>and I love the new Soy Hydra Complex that the new version offers(my old wet 2 straight one didn&#x27;t have it)</li>
            <li>But then I went and tried it on almost dry hair and it turned out pretty good-my hair was soft and shiny and sleek.</li>
            <li>Works very well on my very curly hair, does not leave my hair frizzy like my last flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have not found a flat iron better than this one hands down !</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first using this when my hair was wet, but it worked great!  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well on dry hair too, it straightens with one or two strokes depending on the heat setting.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s very lightweight and itheats up at a reasonable pace</li>
            <li>My wife has relatively small hands and this handled well in her hands easy to hold and not too bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I do have to dry it some first before using the iron, but once I get the excess water out</li>
            <li>I need a new haircut and a new hair style because of it after only 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>She says it does a good job and her only comments were that it is difficult to get it close to the hair roots, and that the outside gets quite hot.  </li>
            <li>current slimmer version covers less area of the hair and doesn&#x27;t penetrate the locks of hair as easily</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and takes half the time my old straightener took to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I actually take less time now doing my hair, as long as you follow the directions (orange light for dry hair up to setting &amp;#60;20-25, and green light for wet hair beyond 25&amp;#62;) then you will be fine.</li>
            <li>I really like this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t save a ton of time but doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair as much as blow drying then flat ironing.</li>
            <li>I absolutely luv this flat iron.</li>
            <li>At a reasonable cost, this flat iron is a steel.  </li>
            <li>The outside plate right above the groove for your hand can get hot, so be careful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if mine was just faulty, but the temperature control was loose and causes the temperature to turn up (way too hot) while using it.</li>
            <li>very wet hair, fresh out of the shower, one time is not sufficient --  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super straight hair, it is wavy by nature, so going to bed with wet hair and waking up with a frizzy mess is pretty standard for me.</li>
            <li>This gets hot really, really, and I mean really fast.</li>
            <li>Does not get hot enough for lasting effect.</li>
            <li>The old model, would straighten my hair in no more than 7min and would leave my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I use a decent line of shampoos and conditioners as well as leave in products especially a heat protector when I am straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li>Actually gets hot enough to make a difference</li>
            <li>and it did a decent enough job.</li>
            <li>Higher temps for straight out of the shower hair, lower temps for partially dried hair.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this Remington flat iron to smooth straight hair and to straighten loose waves though, especially at</li>
            <li>I have only used it on damp hair so far (not full on wet out of the shower) and it dried and straightened it beautifully.</li>
            <li>free remains stretched and longer than other irons I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>I used my step moms straightener, which was a Remington Wet 2 Straight and was really surprised at how well it worked!</li>
            <li>a normal straightener, I can straighten my hair and then walk outside</li>
            <li>is left pretty flat...</li>
            <li>;)styling, DEFINITELY give this flat iron a try on damp hair!</li>
            <li>At first I was a little confused on how to switch it between &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; modes, but this has actually been greatly simplified from the digital version so that it&#x27;s just a matter of dialing in the right temperature, with the light turning green for wet and amber for dry.</li>
            <li>I have an older version of this flat iron I use every day.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend has been wanting a flat iron for a long time but could never find the right one.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth, something it never used to be like with previous flat irons.</li>
            <li>I would have to use this 3 times slowly down my hair to get it straight as opposed to my old Conair, which would be perfectly straight after only once.</li>
            <li>With the Remington Wet 2 Straight flat iron, I get stick straight hair and it doesn&#x27;t give me split ends or do damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li>new five star totally recommend</li>
            <li>I think I will go back to buying a new Chi.</li>
            <li>This iron, since it makes hair much straighter than you would get by straightening dry hair, make them look even thinner.</li>
            <li>On dry hair, the iron works very well.</li>
            <li>It has taken out that choppy look and has left my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I only use this about 2 times a month because my hair can only take so much.</li>
            <li>I barely use the highest heat setting even with wet hair because it gets really hot just on setting 20.</li>
            <li>I like this one better because the Soy Hydra Complex actually helps to protect her hair.  </li>
            <li>The thick plates are much better than the last one I used.</li>
            <li>I was a little leary about purchasing another cheap flat iron.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and cools down enough to wrap the cord around it and stick it in the drawer in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>have gone through so many straighteners from the icky wal-mart brands to the $200 fancy flat irons and none of them work as well on my hair as the Wet2Straight.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t get nearly as flat results as doing just one pass, and it concerns me a little that multiple passes may involve exposing your hair to more heat than necessary.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I was very unnerved to use this on my wet hair, because I did not want it to do anything beyond the scope of what a normal flat iron will do.</li>
            <li>If you are new to flat ironing and just want to give it a try, this is the bargain for you.</li>
            <li>So my wife had wanted a new flat iron for a while now.  </li>
            <li>The wet to straight doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well on my extremely thick hair but does fantastic on my daughter&#x27;s hair and mine when it is dry.</li>
            <li>am glad I purchased this Remington S7230 Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron with Soy Hydra Complex, 2 Inch</li>
            <li>I was always very sceptable about wet to straight flat irons because I didn&#x27;t want burn my hair, but then I finally got one</li>
            <li>I blow dry it a bit first, then use the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I previously had a cheap 1\\&quot; flat iron that maybe worked for a short time and then stopped straightening my hair well.</li>
            <li>Great iron, but the build up was so bad</li>
            <li>In general, i recommend any remington wet2straight.</li>
            <li>was a bit surprised that it&#x27;s smaller than the two inches described</li>
            <li>My hair will stay straight for up to a week with minimal upkeep.</li>
            <li>I really like this appliance but do not like it when used on wet hair.</li>
            <li>So, I received this wet to straight iron on Wednesday..</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say how well it works on wet hair.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this for my mother for mother&#x27;s day and so far she loves it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had wet to straight irons before</li>
            <li>even if i have so far only used it one time.</li>
            <li>Wet to straight does not work well.</li>
            <li>:o(((</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like fixed plates, as there always seems to be a section that doesn&#x27;t quite grip hair, and this one is no different.  </li>
            <li>So far I have used this only on damp hair, setting the dial to about 23.</li>
            <li>It definitely works nowhere near as well as this one:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking I will still buy and try out the In Styler wet hair flat iron and the Cool Way flat iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking I will still buy and try out the In Styler wet hair flat iron and the Cool Way flat iron.</li>
            <li>Nice and cheaper alternative to my expensive CHI hair straightener (that I dropped and broke).</li>
            <li>and it does not take long to cool down.</li>
            <li>although i was not smart enough to go to amazon to look for this item first, I purchased mine at target and paid either $25 or $30.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are little vents at the top of the flat iron plates which allows the steam from your wet hair to escape.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are little vents at the top of the flat iron plates which allows the steam from your wet hair to escape.</li>
            <li>tired of paying full price at super center stores.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>It really does dry your hair and straighten at the same time!</li>
            <li>and it is just damp it really does dry and straighten at the same time.</li>
            <li>It did not dry my hair straight when wet though.</li>
            <li>using these to pull on and stress wet hair (which she said is in its weakest possible state) causes serious damage to the hair shaft, as the hair, being in its most fragile state, can&#x27;t take the heat and pulling without getting very damaged after repeated uses of wet-to-dry styling implements.</li>
            <li>I normally tend to have dry frizzy ends</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as previously.  </li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting this Wet to Dry flat iron to work, but to my surprise it really does.</li>
            <li>straightener works well as a dry straightener (although you should still be sure that the vents are pointed AWAY from your head, dry or not) especially being 2 inches wide, but I am going back to my old, narrow straightener and returned this one because it really ticks me off that I followed the directions to the letter, and still ended up getting hurt.</li>
            <li>This iron is great for those who will use it on mostly dry hair and do not want to spend a lot of money on an iron - having used another iron previously, I was left unimpressed with the Remington as I found it did nothing for wet or damp hair and did not work as well as my other iron on mostly dry hair</li>
            <li>but it doesnt make my hair as flat as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>A flat iron with fixed plates burns and breaks your hair.</li>
            <li>They have my hair moisturized and soft as it&#x27;s ever been, but they can&#x27;t replace a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers mention that this doesn&#x27;t straighten their hair very well, and I&#x27;ve seen videos of people with thicker hair use this, and I agree.</li>
            <li>I had an old flat iron and was probably about 4 in.</li>
            <li>I have only had my new flat iron for 3 weeks now</li>
            <li>I got this as a replacement for my old purple digital Wet 2 Straight flat iron.</li>
            <li>and I used to blow dry it straight back in the day then use a regular iron to flatten it...</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t blow dry my hair just because I want to use as least amount of heat possible on my hair to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>it does not dry my hair in one use.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair frizzy free, fly-a-ways under control, shinny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight and dry with little effort!</li>
            <li>I had to hold the iron from both sides:the handle and the front tip of the iron which was a little too hot for my fingers in order to grab my hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tool to anyone with longer hair, especially if you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t like to blow dry!</li>
            <li>I bought it because of all the great reviews on here, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li>so obviously don&#x27;t touch the plates whilst it is on) fast compared to her other iron, in around 30 seconds</li>
            <li>so when I saw Remington was making a Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron</li>
            <li>I decided on the Remington Wet 2 Straight flat iron</li>
            <li>I decided to get the Remington Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron for my oldest daughter who is a pro at straightening her hair every morning.</li>
            <li>My old flat iron didn&#x27;t heat properly and took forever to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I totally have no regrets on purchasing this item.</li>
            <li>For the first couple passes it mostly dried my hair.</li>
            <li>I was really skeptical because I also own a Revlon flat iron</li>
            <li>The next morning I did my normal routine of showering and letting my hair air dry while I had my coffee and breakfast and watched the news (about an hour total).</li>
            <li>I actually thought i&#x27;d have a hard time adjusting to it because it was a different shape than the original, but I didnt.  </li>
            <li>choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love not having to dry it and having all that long thick hair to do another process on.</li>
            <li>It takes me about 10 mins to dry with this iron (but i still dry roots separately with the blow dryer, since it is a bit hard to do with the iron alone, plus it adds more volume)&lt;br /&gt;- Does not seem to spoil your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of wet 2 straight flat irons.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t have to dry her hair completely when she uses it which she likes and it saves her some time.</li>
            <li>, it tends to feel MUCH dryer after I flat iron my damp hair as opposed to using a regular flat iron on dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair</li>
            <li>You most likely won&#x27;t be disappointed! :)</li>
            <li>You most likely won&#x27;t be disappointed! :)</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot of money and time in the past having my hair dresser straighten it, as it takes me over an hour and several styling products to get it smooth.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not usually a concern with wet hair anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very simple to use and has a large variety of heat settings for wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Works very well wet and dry.  </li>
            <li>It only has a on/off switch, a two-color light indicator to indicate dial settings (dry, damp and wet hair) and a dial (level 1 - 30) to select the hair condition (dry or damp or wet).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that using this iron on wet hair might make coarse hair (like mine) a little frizzly, but I usually use it with dry or only slightly damp hair, and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I bought both of them from Walmart for about $25, although that model now costs $42 on walmart.com, and $27 on amazon, and this one apparently the new slightly cheaper model.</li>
            <li>I would never own another straight iron!!</li>
            <li>With the older version your cord from the hair dryer could accidentally lay across the flat iron and it wouldn&#x27;t matter, the newer version must be kept away from all other cords, combs, brushes, etc.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace myh old flat iron that coujld only be used on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>There was good and bad things about this straightner, I wanted to like this</li>
            <li>The soy hydra complex coated plates really seem to help keep my hair from getting fried and it leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>unfortunately, when my old one died I was forced to find a replacement fast and this has been fantastic so far.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with this purchase and the changes/improvements that Remmington made.  </li>
            <li> I was kind of torn whether to give it 4 stars or 5.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very curly hair and it flattens it perfectly</li>
            <li> This is so nice because it cuts time from blow drying, the straightening.</li>
            <li> The gauge is so flimsy that it turns on its own while I&#x27;m doing my hair so sometimes my hair will smell burnt</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest</li>
            <li> The price might be cheap on this product, but there is nothing cheap about the quality!!!</li>
            <li> But I have &amp;#34;easy-to-straighten&amp;#34; hair so that might not mean that this straightener is perfect for everyone.</li>
            <li> is a good product, it recoemindo, just have to be sure of the size or appropriate measures according to what you want.</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Well never pay $50 or more on another ceramic one when this works way better!</li>
            <li> good size and weight, not too light.......</li>
            <li> and this by far is the best I have ever used!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and very comfortable in your hand.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable egg shell feel and great light notification feature.</li>
            <li> This is a great brand and it is a nice improvement to the older version of this product.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice design and heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought for my Grand daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> Most fried her hair.</li>
            <li> Did all it said it would do and more.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this straightener</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> So much better</li>
            <li> I love that i can straighten my hair in just under 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister who used my 2005 model and fell in love with the ability to skip the hairdrying stage.</li>
            <li> I use it with the Moroccan infused Suave products and love the results.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> it heats up within 20 seconds at the most.</li>
            <li> I love this iron.</li>
            <li> it worths more than the price.</li>
            <li> PLEASED</li>
            <li> I was so impressed I purchased for my personal use .</li>
            <li> for any type of hair. :)</li>
            <li> Might be faster drying, but faster is not always better or heathier.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this</li>
            <li> Love love love this item.</li>
            <li> how many times I straighten it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product over all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to straighten my hair every morning before work without having to wake up at 3 am.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I Have Been Receiving Many Compliments.</li>
            <li> Made my hair straight and shiny and even when I went out in the rain today, it still looked great when I got to work.</li>
            <li> Would recommend and will will for sure replace it when another Remington when the time comes.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> and I am still in love with the size of that one.</li>
            <li> But is OK</li>
            <li> But if you have healthier hair, especially hair that has not been chemically treated, this would probably work great for you!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had this for 6 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> Works best on damp hair and is amazing for this busy working mom...anything that saves me time is worth it.</li>
            <li> I really love this iron.</li>
            <li> I love this brand</li>
            <li> and I love this item.</li>
            <li> it is ok save some time at mornings</li>
            <li> This iron works for me even when my hair is a bit more than damp.</li>
            <li> I bought this off a recommendation from my sister in law who has very curly hair and when she straightens her hair, it looks great.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love being able to style my hair damp before it get out of control.</li>
            <li> I just love this thing.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I got rid of my regular straightener and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Great iron, heats up fast and leaves my hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I can find a better seller.</li>
            <li> I love it though I spend almost 150 purchasing it...</li>
            <li> Also makes your hair static.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and this dries it out even more.  </li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> great product, irons hair very well.</li>
            <li> It does a much better job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know more than that.</li>
            <li> I love this hair iron.</li>
            <li> Both my daughters love it.</li>
            <li> but it drys it much better than a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> : Be sure to stock up on tbe heat protectant for your Hair&#x27;s sake and let your &amp;#34;Freak</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This heats fast, works great</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I have the one inch, and it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I want to use it, but for the most part, it sits buried in the bathroom cupboard.  </li>
            <li> So, this might be okay for you.  </li>
            <li> I prefer more body.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> She had a one inch before and it was ok</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I love this iron because it does four jobs in one, it shines, conditions, straightens, and dries your hair.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I LOVE that it has a one hour</li>
            <li> so I decided to buy i and glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and makes it very nice and straight.</li>
            <li> She was very excited to learn she didn&#x27;t have to blowdry her hair before using it.</li>
            <li> Well let me just say this flat iron is Awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I have ordered online.</li>
            <li> This Remington flat iron is awesome.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but after one use, I am VERY SATISFIED that I purchased this!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> I first tried it out on my side bangs since they weren&#x27;t straight, and it straightened it perfectly!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and comes with detailed instructions.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, very quick</li>
            <li> She loved how it looked and it was not difficult.</li>
            <li> I Loved this straightner from the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good</li>
            <li> it straightens it pretty good.  </li>
            <li> She loved it so much, I had to order her one!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of months now and it is still as good as the first time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the product is still one of the best on the market but the older version would warrant a higher rating than the newer version.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!!</li>
            <li> (I have very long hair and need help sometimes with it) and was so impressed she wanted one...</li>
            <li> Very happy, what I expected and works as it should.</li>
            <li> However for wet hair is excellent!</li>
            <li> If you have no idea for your own hair, I can say usually 15 is the best place to start for any hair type.</li>
            <li> I have gotten compliments and my husband and kids prefer my straight hair to the perm that I thought was a good idea.</li>
            <li> good for fast straightning</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several \\&quot;good hair days\\&quot; using this product and that warrants the 5 star review more than anything in my book!</li>
            <li> All in all, a very good flat iron for a steal!</li>
            <li> However, I bit the bullet and went ahead with it since I did really love the original so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> flattens hair easily without burning it.</li>
            <li> creases hair easily</li>
            <li> Breaks easily tho</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> The unit heats up very quickly, and I have not had any problems with tangles or the unit pulling on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Does dries hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> It heat up very quickly, and i used it on the highest heat setting.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy.</li>
            <li> easy to use,no piroblem with it,got it on time,would buy again.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and instructions were understandable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*you could easily burn yourself with the steam it lets out...</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly</li>
            <li> strong warnings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But once straighteners began coming out, I purchased the CHI first, since it was widely popular</li>
            <li> I have really fine, curly hair and this straightened it well.</li>
            <li> I use it now to straighten the ends and it looks fine but can&#x27;t wait until those frizzy ends get cut off.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re short on time it&#x27;s definitely a splendid convenience.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> but I would be willing to pay more for better.</li>
            <li> but I would be willing to pay more for better.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and easy to use.</li>
            <li> it seems to work just fine if its not all the way turned up.</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly and the soy lotion makes hair smooth.  </li>
            <li> I had previously owned one of these and loved it!!</li>
            <li> Super cute and well made.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to style my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> When it was time to use the straightener I was pleased with how quickly it heated up.</li>
            <li> I have had it for four months now and have straightened my hair more often than I used to because of how quickly it heats up and</li>
            <li> She absolutely LOVES it and says she has got more compliments on her hair than ever!</li>
            <li> I love that this product is 2\\&quot; and I can do my hair so fast!!</li>
            <li> This thing gets VERY hot!</li>
            <li> and it does get very hot!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super smooth, even better than the original.  </li>
            <li> Straightens hair well and leaves it smooth for days.</li>
            <li> My hair looks great after only about 5 minutes of use!</li>
            <li> smooth glide&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just tried it on a few strands and I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li> it is lightweight, comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> it feels great when something brings back words of praise.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and takes the frizz away.</li>
            <li> But if you have healthier hair, especially hair that has not been chemically treated, this would probably work great for you!touch.</li>
            <li> &quot; light just kept flashing</li>
            <li> Smooth plates, no snags, but</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Runs through my hair really smoothly.</li>
            <li> But now it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and turns off automatically which are two nice features.  </li>
            <li> If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use gels in my hair that fight fizziness or to smooth it as it just makes my hair look like I dumped oil on it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and this product made my hair nice and straight and gave it body.  </li>
            <li> it makes a hissing sound too.</li>
            <li> Between the serum and iron, my hair is silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I came upon this straightener from my hair stylist of 15 years, she simply stated I needed anything Remington Branded, that they were great</li>
            <li> The ceramic soy infused plates allow you to smooth over your hair and it leaves a glossy sheen.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect as it is not too big but gets the job done in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had really good luck with this product so far.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one without hesitation because i had faith that it would work as good as the old one..</li>
            <li> And the price iS fair enough :-)</li>
            <li> heats up very fast leaves my hair very soft and smooth great  width on the heating plate</li>
            <li> it was very worth it)</li>
            <li> This flatiron is great for one step styling instead of blow drying &amp; then flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Gets really hot which is good but does make your hair very frizzy.</li>
            <li> This product is the greatest, and even in high humidity, which normally makes my hair curl, it stayed straight.</li>
            <li> It works well, and I have not noticed any significant damage.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you read the instructions first.  </li>
            <li> I accidentally threw away (dont ask) the original Wet2Straight iron i had for years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li> like i found with the original.  </li>
            <li> Nothing was fried or damaged, there were no flyaways, but most importantly, my hair was very sleek and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this.</li>
            <li> If you get one that grips well, it does work on wet hair beautifully, but</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products and the best one I have found so far is Tigi S Factor Silky Smooth serum.  </li>
            <li> worth buying!</li>
            <li> With my hair as damaged as it already is (colored and fine), being able to skip the blow drying step should really help it on the road to recovery.</li>
            <li> With my hair as damaged as it already is (colored and fine), being able to skip the blow drying step should really help it on the road to recovery.</li>
            <li> My favorite  by far!!!!</li>
            <li> Getting ready for work has never been this easy!</li>
            <li> I have very wavy and very fine hair.</li>
            <li> The whole idea of being able to basically skip a step (blow drying) sounded fantastic to me.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t clean it.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t any marks and it was clean in a sealed plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 times and it was amazing , then I ordered 2 more for my friend , then suddenly it&#x27;s stop working</li>
            <li> I was kinda scared at first because I have fine, easily damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and my hair feels great, doesn&#x27;t seem too dry at all.</li>
            <li> It helps make your hair feel more healthy after using it your hair feels really soft.</li>
            <li> Keep the plates clean with just a damp/wet rag while cooled and unplugged.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this flat iron so far as it tames the friz for the most part.</li>
            <li> These flat irons are amazing!</li>
            <li> Make sure that you are holding your hand either below or to the side of the steam vents (as the steam rises), as I was quickly reminded just how hot the steam coming from the hair can be (when I forgot).</li>
            <li> , 2 Inch is as close to perfect as I have gotten so far with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I tried other straighteners and they work perfectly and keep my hair straight without hairspray.</li>
            <li> It is fine and I am not unhappy; just can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Straightening my hair was usually a special occasion thing because of the hours of work that had to be invested in the procedure.</li>
            <li> It is just way too large and would work much better for someone with longer hair or thicker hair.</li>
            <li> It is just way too large and would work much better for someone with longer hair or thicker hair.</li>
            <li> and the price was right!</li>
            <li> something can&#x27;t be right!</li>
            <li> The flat iron itself has yet to burn me, but I did get a pretty good steam burn on my scalp once from not holding the hair away from my head, but more at a downward angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The width is a hard to find one and this one is perfect for her needs.</li>
            <li> It works great on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> the only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 star is because it didn&#x27;t come in good packaging...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pay full</li>
            <li> /&gt;honestly, I would suggest spending a bit more and having an iron that works really well and lasts a loooong time.</li>
            <li> It works well and fast as a dryer, and does minimize damage and leave your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> but the iron was cool to the touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several \\&quot;good hair days\\&quot; using this product and that warrants the 5 star review more than anything in my book!good result, it still absolutely works as it says it will.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely order more</li>
            <li> I use this iron every day, and my hair stays straight and healthy.</li>
            <li> cool</li>
            <li> Thank you sooooo much :)</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad straightener</li>
            <li> It sound great because I could save time by not having to completely dry my hair first.</li>
            <li> Its perfect and unbelievable!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good also for a quick run over in the evening on dry hair (amber light showing and a setting between 10-17 on the dial) before going out for dinner or to a party etc.  </li>
            <li> It is also fairly hefty, it tires out my arm before I&#x27;m finished flat ironing.</li>
            <li> It is also fairly hefty, it tires out my arm before I&#x27;m finished flat ironing.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, has solid construction (nice fit and finish), and does the job.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> it heats up really quick</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> not so it&#x27;s nice to hear a sound if you&#x27;re in the middle of finishing your hair when it shuts off and starts cooling</li>
            <li> but I quickly learned it was NO upgrade.  </li>
            <li> Better to buy online more expense in the store by 8 dollars ...the only thing I don&#x27;t like when you put up to your head the plate burns your head ..</li>
            <li> I Love this hair straightener, it works perfect with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> With this iron I&#x27;ve not had any of the static problems I have with the expensive chi and am very happy with my affordable choice this time around.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and well packaged</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, has an automatic shut off</li>
            <li> It does amazing things to my hair better than any much higher priced flat iron has (i.e. Chi), my sister used it on my hair</li>
            <li> I had an older Conair ceramic flat iron that I LOVED, but the handle finally cracked apart after 12 years, so I bought this as a replacement because of the really great reviews.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot but the heating element has not burned and keeps temp up well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Use on wet hair at your own risk!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too hot to use a straightener or curler to smooth it out and just go with</li>
            <li> Gets very hot.</li>
            <li> was really excited about the straightener its ok so far..</li>
            <li> Gets very hot.</li>
            <li> pretty light weight</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday with beautiful results.</li>
            <li> It made getting ready so quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I had borrowed an older model (same brand) and it worked great</li>
            <li> Fortunately for me, I already knew from the original that the best setting was likely right in the middle for my damp hair, and so I was easily able to get it on the same level as before by turning it to 15.</li>
            <li> soy hydra complex surprisingly seems to do an even better job at smoothing hair than the original tourmaline did.</li>
            <li> I thought that the new S7230 would have to be somehow better...</li>
            <li> I bought the new version for my 5th wheel and love it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and healthy looking (</li>
            <li> Perfectly straight hair!!</li>
            <li> This one won&#x27;t grab onto the hair, very flimsy!!</li>
            <li> like many have also noted, better to let the hair dry a bit before straightening.  </li>
            <li> Also would be nice if this one had a little more rounded body so that I could easily give a gentle curl/curve to my ends instead.</li>
            <li> If I curl it with a separate curling iron it looks fine, otherwise if I want it pin straight</li>
            <li> she can straighten wet or dry hair and my daughter loves it alot and keeps them from stealing each others lol thanks and loved the shipping</li>
            <li> great for travelling or drying hair when you have little time</li>
            <li> However, as I finished and brushed through my hair once more, it was PERFECTLY FINE.</li>
            <li> She is very happy with the flat iron as it does cut out having to dry her hair out before flattening it.  </li>
            <li> (it worked great), most of the time I use it with dry hair (though I do put heat protected spray; i use the Brazilian Keratin Flat Iron Spray.)</li>
            <li> It took some time but did everything in one step and made her hair poker straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> but I needed something fast and cheap.</li>
            <li> She says it really saves her lots of time styling her hair now and leaves it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I found I didn&#x27;t need to use nearly as much hair product to get silky smooth results as I did with the tourmaline</li>
            <li> I even like this better than the old Remington</li>
            <li> Straightening your hair while wet everyday isn&#x27;t the best idea for healthy hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never yet tried this on my wet hair, and it&#x27;s a good thing:</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it is worth the investment though.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and fantastic!</li>
            <li> The Remington S7230 offers just a bit more.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite straightener.</li>
            <li> This works best on people with thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice to finally have a straightener that allows me to straighten my hair while wet/damp -</li>
            <li> So far, I love it.</li>
            <li> worth the money tbh.</li>
            <li> My favorite by far is TreSemme Keratin Infused Shampoo &amp; conditioners.</li>
            <li> Around $5 for each bottle but soooo worth it.</li>
            <li> this wet2straight is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair straight all day, gets rid of most of the flyaways, and leaves it with a nice healthy shin from the soy hydra complex and the tourmaline.</li>
            <li> it does best on DAMP hair, not WET hair, so make sure you towel dry your hair well prior to usage.</li>
            <li> it does best on DAMP hair, not WET hair, so make sure you towel dry your hair well prior to usage.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with the heat setting options (you can make it super hot or low heat depending on how wet/dry your hair is while using the iron).  </li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 I would recommend this to just abt any female searching for an excellent flat iron at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you will love this Flat Iron as much as I have.</li>
            <li> but this flat iron is amazing and worth the money</li>
            <li> wet)&lt;br /&gt;- makes hair super glossy and pretty</li>
            <li> Leaves hair super straight and shiny!</li>
            <li> Heats Up super fast!</li>
            <li> Not sure how good it would work on wet hair, but I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> It heats up super quick and takes no time at all to straighten my very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, good straightener for a decent price.</li>
            <li> While the older version was a more user friendly and results were smoother a lot quicker, while the newer version is better on wet or damp hair but time</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing.. will recommend this product..</li>
            <li> one really is an improvement over the original.</li>
            <li> and I made the right</li>
            <li> Additionally, I can use it right after the shower while my hair is still damp.</li>
            <li> All right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve own many in the past and I wish I would of come across this one sooner.</li>
            <li> nice long cord and gets hot quick</li>
            <li> Overall the Remington S7230 is great for a quickly straightening your still soggy hair and eliminating the extra step of having to use a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I also find that this works better on my damp/wet hair than the original (which i only liked to use on dry hair)</li>
            <li> - there&#x27;s no distinguishing between what temperatures are best for what hair types on the wet and dry settings.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair and have difficulty finding one that actually works, but this one is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I get better results with my old flat iron, it was more economical than this</li>
            <li> I love that you have several settings and it does good on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the wet to straight flat iron after reading most of the reviews, both positive and not so great ones.</li>
            <li> I have a fantastic straightening iron that I love but have to dry my hair most of the way prior to using it</li>
            <li> then I bet it&#x27;s amazing with dry</li>
            <li> The package arrived very well wrapped and protected, the iron heats up quickly, glides without problems, no hair pulling, hair frizz</li>
            <li> For the price moves super straight and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Hair is super straight and shiny</li>
            <li> It Leaves My Hair Super Straight.</li>
            <li> Great on dry hair but on damp hair if u dont go through quick enough it will fry your ends!</li>
            <li> It does warn you that it will make a hissing sound on wet hair, but that is OK.</li>
            <li> The plates get very hot and you can&#x27;t really hold the head of the straighter to help guide it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She was very excited to get the new iron; there were a few things she liked right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> It is naturally very straight</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> actual use the flat iron worked great.  </li>
            <li> manage)&lt;br /&gt;It heats up super fast and there are different heat settings :-)</li>
            <li> Minor touching up sometimes like rainy days but other than that it stays gorgeous for two-three days at most.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I was weary of owning a straightener before, but this product is high quality and true to its promises.</li>
            <li> I have been using a large round barrel brush in front of the iron to get a nice smooth look.</li>
            <li> This Flat iron deserves 5 stars, its absolutely the best you are literally done in half the time.</li>
            <li> but this iron is amazing on wet hair..</li>
            <li> say I turn the heat seating on A to low and the heat setting on B to the the highest.&lt;br /&gt;The heat on A is more than B.</li>
            <li> And my hair definitely looks more polished.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair straight and shiny!</li>
            <li> It never gets hot on the outer shell even when there is heat going to the irons.</li>
            <li> The steam is hot and the hair is hot to the touch immediately after straightening it.</li>
            <li> This is the first straightener that I have ever purchased or used.  </li>
            <li> Gets too hot.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> The soy really does work!</li>
            <li> so you have to do smaller, thinner locks of hair which takes more time as you turn what would have been 10 locks of hair into</li>
            <li> When I first passed the iron on my hair</li>
            <li> Works as well as the much higher priced irons.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great at first, but don&#x27;t expect it to last long.</li>
            <li> It does get pretty hot (which you can control)</li>
            <li> I bought this iron for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> but the style lasts the whole day and does not frizz!</li>
            <li> So let me start out by saying I have pretty unmanageable hair.  </li>
            <li> The product was exactly what it said it would be</li>
            <li> but it gets really hot</li>
            <li> Because of that it is pretty porous.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now several times a week (the 2 inch width) and it is just okay.</li>
            <li> but it was the first straightener I ever owned</li>
            <li> so I picked it up to feel if it was hot</li>
            <li> I ended up finding this one at Target for basically the same price (even if it was much more, Target price matches now).</li>
            <li> I ultimately decided on 5 stars because I love it</li>
            <li> this was exactly what the recipient wanted.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really hot</li>
            <li> Definitely reccomend :)</li>
            <li> Seems to work well but need to be aware of settings</li>
            <li> I also love how you only have to go over the hair twice!</li>
            <li> It does get really hot</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> the price for the product is pretty damn awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is hot.</li>
            <li> ;] IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> have split ends for the first time ever...</li>
            <li> I love the larger size.</li>
            <li> Only thing that could make it better is an auto shut off afyer 30 mins or hour.</li>
            <li> , REALLY hot - so to prevent damage, be SURE to use a product to protect the cuticle (I cannot emphasize this enough)!</li>
            <li> My hair feels and is so much healthier!</li>
            <li> Well this time I&#x27;ve had my recent one almost two years and make sure to turn it OFF then unplug.</li>
            <li> I had a Chi for a few years and loved it</li>
            <li> I used to have little fly aways on the top of my head from my other straighteners burning pieces off without my noticing</li>
            <li> my little sister loved it, as it irons quickly and hair can be wet, my older sister liked it so much that she ordered another one for herself.</li>
            <li> It dries your hair easily and it remains straight and soft after hours</li>
            <li> I used them on my hair right after washing and it got bone straight.</li>
            <li> It is not very wide, perhaps I need to spend more time becoming accustomed to the way to use it so my bangs lay flat.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try this first as it is significantly cheaper, almost suspiciously cheap for a flat iron, and I figured I wouldn&#x27;t be out much</li>
            <li> I am in love with this flat iron, and recommend it to EVERYONE I know that has curly hair or is really busy!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron and converted from a $300 one that didn&#x27;t work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> I used flat iron spray, and didn&#x27;t even have it at the top heat setting.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This 2 in flat iron was the largest I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a great stylist, and has done wonders with my hair over the years, so, paired with my just-average experiences with this flat iron on my hair dry</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I needed a new straightener, and since I genuinely dislike blow drying my hair and then straightening it, I decided to give this particular model a try.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds great, but I did scald my hair in several places after using it on my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Gets hot pretty fast.</li>
            <li> The iron also does not grip very well unto the hair so not being able to hold the head of it to give it the extra grip is a bother.</li>
            <li> This one is similar in that it is not digital (this is good for me and what I was looking for).</li>
            <li> This one could probably be an effective flatiron, but only after the blow-drying is complete.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it performs well on my dry hair, heats up quickly, and is easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just given mine to my sister, who&#x27;s used to blow drying her hair on a regular basis, but she&#x27;s just had twins, so this should be a good alternative for her as well, given the relatively low noise level of it.</li>
            <li> I also love the soy hydra complex feature because it makes my hair smooth!</li>
            <li> - it lasted me almost 5 and a half years, always worked well, got and stayed hot... just a nice straightener all around.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this product and it was mostly positive</li>
            <li> Although my hair dresser states that people would give anything to have my hair so that they could just wash it and let it dry with beautiful curls, I on the other hand want it straight!</li>
            <li> I can pretty much hop out of the shower,</li>
            <li> Gets really hot and really straightens.</li>
            <li> and it just made my hair really frizzy, but this is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Ok for the price lets see how long it lasts ..</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty naturally straight already, so I can&#x27;t review the quality of this as a straightening iron.</li>
            <li> Be aware that it gets really</li>
            <li> For the first time my hair is STRAIGHT</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> this flat iron definitely dries your hair as good as a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> My sedu iron which cost me about $150.00 recently broke and I was looking for a good flat alternative.</li>
            <li> Even better that I can skip the blow drying step and go straight to flat ironing out of the shower</li>
            <li> She&#x27;d stated that manufacturers have tried selling these products over the past 5 or so years, and they&#x27;ve never taken off, for good reason:</li>
            <li> Not outstanding, but good.  </li>
            <li> This is as good if not better than the straightener I purchased for my daughter at almost 4 times the cost.  </li>
            <li> great for the price:) Use on wet or dry hair-worth the price compared to salon flat irons.</li>
            <li> hair is nice, smooth and straight (I have very frizzy, curly hair, hard to</li>
            <li> Mostly use on my hair dry</li>
            <li> This worked ok when I used it on dry hair, but FRIED my hair when I used it on damp hair.</li>
            <li> It not only straightens my hair fabulously, it keeps the frizz out on those hot humid days in Georgia.  </li>
            <li> I love this straightener I towel dry my hair and straighten.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, note that you will get vastly better and healthier results relying on oil based protective hair products than you will silicone based ones (hair oil, hair dressing, etc) if you have curly, dry, damaged, and/or ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> I love using this to dry my hair though.</li>
            <li> Warms quickly and leaves hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li> good for long hair and short hair</li>
            <li> my drying time down a lot.&lt;br /&gt;*hair looks great until next time you wash it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and thin and this iron seems to give my hair more body.  </li>
            <li> I have tried it as well and it leaves your hair soft and very straight!  </li>
            <li> it works great on wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It works great on wet hair as well as dry hair.</li>
            <li> Does a great weather my hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I also love that there&#x27;s a color flashing indicator on the switch telling me when it&#x27;s set to dry hair or straight hair.</li>
            <li> I used this flat iron on my towel dried hair yesterday and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> Her hair came out very shiny (Her favorite thing), straight and dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the product says that it works on wet, dry and damp hair (and it really does), for best results you should use it on damp hair (green light should be showing and a setting of somewhere around 20-24 on the dial which goes from 1-30).  </li>
            <li> Very effective in wet to dry straightening.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my new favorite flat iron!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoy using it and it has taken an entire step out of my getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love everything about my Remington Wet 2 Straight iron.  </li>
            <li> The plates heat up instantly and leaves my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> It really straighten your hair</li>
            <li> Name brands, advertised brands, nothing really did as it said it would.</li>
            <li> fast shipping...might get one for myself now...</li>
            <li> /&gt;- heats FAST</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair straight and silky even when its damn.</li>
            <li> She tells her friends and anyone that asks how she keeps her hair so straight.</li>
            <li> I have naturally really curly hair...</li>
            <li> I purchased this straight iron from a retail store.</li>
            <li> Works great with my thin hair.</li>
            <li> heats up fast.</li>
            <li> shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> and doesnt pull hair and dries and straightnes fast</li>
            <li> My hair just slides through, with out really straightening it</li>
            <li> The soy hydra didnt really make a difference.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I really like, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was unsure as to how this thing would really work.  </li>
            <li> It hurt so much all day.</li>
            <li> But now my hair wont stay straight no matter</li>
            <li> its ready to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As with every iron, hair looks thinner when it is straight.</li>
            <li> and I was never even able to use them while my hair was wet because they would fry my hair</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very wavy and curly in some places.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Very damaging on hair.</li>
            <li> Well it made my hair very frizzy and very unmanageable.</li>
            <li> It works  very well and does not burn or make your hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight.</li>
            <li> This iron works very well...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to spray my hair with anything just to get it to be straight and non frizzy.</li>
            <li> Works really well, does the job in rapid time.</li>
            <li> &amp; I enjoy the quiet mornings.</li>
            <li> I love that I can skip the blow dryer to save time when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> Although I have relatively straight hair, this iron works well for styling and adding body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky, but I expected more out of this straightener.</li>
            <li> but one morning while I was getting ready for work the \\&quot;ready\\</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know though</li>
            <li> and it really does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate having this product because it eliminates the need to blow-dry my hair after I take a shower.</li>
            <li> This takes out the whole blow drying step.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and my daughter&#x27;s is kinky coily curls and this almost gets our hair pin straight.</li>
            <li> so I ordered her one simliar and hope she likes it just as much as I do mine.  </li>
            <li> The dial hasn&#x27;t really had any learning curve at all to it, much to my surprise.</li>
            <li> This Iron really comes thru.  </li>
            <li> Very quality item.</li>
            <li> She likes it and wants to get one for my sister-in-law now.  </li>
            <li> so I was very leary about trying this.</li>
            <li> sometimes I&#x27;m wondering why my hair isn&#x27;t getting straight.</li>
            <li> recommend this hair iron to anyone who wants to buy it.</li>
            <li> so they were not straightened as much as she would like.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price for the product.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length wavy hair, with layers in the front that I like to keep straight and angled out of my face.</li>
            <li> It works very well just as described.</li>
            <li> straightens my hair really well.</li>
            <li> i have very frizzy hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given the price of this product, I would say it does its functions reasonably well.</li>
            <li> okay though don&#x27;t last as far as it being straight</li>
            <li> Seems to hold the steamed straight look</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She says it heats up really fast and gets the job done faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely unsatisfied with this iron.</li>
            <li> the results are even better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair really frizzy, and the tips are still curly and won&#x27;t straighten.  </li>
            <li> It effectively straightens my mop of hair in just a few minutes instead of others that have taken me over an hour to use.</li>
            <li> i had the same brand product earlier the pearl finish one i gave to my sis in law as she liked it</li>
            <li> actually; it even surprised me, and related to that the iron felt good in her hand.  </li>
            <li> I simply hoped it would work better than my old one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for the wet to straight feature, but I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li> I do not think that it cuts down on too much time for me, which is the biggest drawback, but my hair did feel pretty soft and straight which I liked.</li>
            <li> With a little work I believe this could be a great flat iron that saves you a lot of time.</li>
            <li> This is a big improvement over my Old flat iron, which I Loved.  </li>
            <li> Of course it works better on dry hair, and most of the time I use it on my hair is just slightly damp.  </li>
            <li> the Remington flat iron will automatically turn itself off after 60 minutes and with the ceramic plates it doesn&#x27;t take long to cool down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very impressed with this iron and her other iron has been relagated to back of the drawer and never gets used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using it dry, it got my hair smooth and relatively straight, but it did nothing to fight the humidity that undid my efforts, and was really no more exceptional than anything else I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> I used it right after getting out of the shower and it dried my hair quickly and straighten it quick would recommend to all</li>
            <li> I began using it exactly according to directions, on the lowest setting for &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; hair, since I thought mine was a little more than damp.</li>
            <li> I used 300 dollar flat irons and also cheap ones that my friends have had</li>
            <li> I use a comb to keep the hair taught and tangle free as I pass the flat iron over it.</li>
            <li> Much better than expected!</li>
            <li> and i love the vents that allow you to straighten your hair while wet!</li>
            <li> The smaller size makes it great for getting down near the roots.</li>
            <li> 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older version had alert sounds letting you know when the iron was ready and when it was shutting itself off while the newer version has no sounds warnings so it can be turned on or off without you hearing anything</li>
            <li> It was also an add on item and the price was fantastic more than ten dollars less than in the store.</li>
            <li> The cord is nice and long, there is no constantly turning around to use the iron while in front of the mirror in the bathroom, also the cord angles off the side at the end of the iron</li>
            <li> We both like how fast it heated up and it seemed to cool down relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid area and even though my hair is mostly straight, the humidity makes it frizzy.</li>
            <li> Now I just lightly blow dry my roots then straight to this.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> If you want a good dry straightener, this will work, but DO NOT use it wet.</li>
            <li> it leaves it super straight and no extra frizz from the vent steam</li>
            <li> My daughter uses it both with wet and dry hair, and she&#x27;s delighted with it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and fine, and wavy/straightish naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> I could never keep my hair straight for more than a day and now with this it last for various days.</li>
            <li> Does not beep when it gets hot or turns off after an hour like my old one</li>
            <li> I normally use the Hemp heat protecting balm on my hair but perhaps I now just need a much heavier protecting balm, so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> Let me state that I did not use any sort of heat protectant (although, you normally should) just to see how well the soy conditioners worked and if it&#x27;d really leave my hair as the description promised it would.</li>
            <li> I contacted Remington customer service and they are letting me send it back for a full refund, thankfully.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;wet to straight&amp;#34;, slightly damp but mostly dry to straight would be more accurate.</li>
            <li> Days 2 and 3, my hair looks MUCH nicer after having slept on it; it takes little or no time to get it to look okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to say that because it does not work as nicely on dry hair.</li>
            <li> and I have paid alot more for less irons.  </li>
            <li> - I have to lightly blow dry the roots before using this product.</li>
            <li> If you use it with wet hair it dries it fast and leaves your hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I only put it on the lowest setting and it still got pretty hot under 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s an older model?</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this product and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot enough to do it the first time through.</li>
            <li> For a girl with thick coarse hair this has been great.  </li>
            <li> I now only use it from about 2 inches from my roots and then just give my roots a quick blow-dry after.&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li> I had to go over my hair four times to have it look decent, which sort of defeats the purpose of having a &amp;#34;wet to straight&amp;#34;, which i supposed to save me time.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair, towel dry it, then let the Wet to Straight iron do its magic!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Remington 2 inch flat iron heats up to full temperature</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with any hair type.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> We have the Remington S5500 that we use on my daughter&#x27;s hair, and which I highly recommend (and also have a review posted).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve found being able to gauge it by the sound of the sizzling (which can only be done on the first pass) helps prevent completely cooking all of the moisture in your hair, leaving the optimal amount of moisture behind to help keep it healthy and frizz free (helpful for those of us that normally can&#x27;t use dry heat styling on our hair due to how much moisture it takes out of it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ok so anyone in the market for a flat iron, go no further.</li>
            <li> After I use it my husband says my hair looks professionally done!!</li>
            <li> It has a little more to it than just turning it</li>
            <li> It took about an hour to even semi- straiten my hair, then I just ended up using my old one anyway!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gotten their hair just as straight and soft.</li>
            <li> This is the only one I have used where I don&#x27;t have to use it daily because of how smooth and straight it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> I use a heat protectant product on my sopping wet hair and then this finishes my hair to silky smooth in about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> and afterwards my hair is so much bouncy and alive</li>
            <li> I have mostly straight fine hair with a slight wave in some areas.</li>
            <li> I will say though that I have a friend with very curly natural hair that she straightens</li>
            <li> It works great with her thick long Hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the NEX, a bit more expensive than here, but it&#x27;s a good straightener FOR WET hair.</li>
            <li> I took a normal section of hair and the iron didn&#x27;t grab it</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and have had many compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I suspect this would work well on someone who has normal or oily hair.</li>
            <li> One other tip I would like to give is when you use this straightener, couple water will drip when you flat it so make sure those hot water drips dont get on ur skins.</li>
            <li> best way to use this on damp hair is to press the iron down on each section until the sizzling noise comes to an *almost* complete stop (don&#x27;t worry if it&#x27;s not completely silent, the last little bit of moisture will vaporize away on its own as your hair cools), then inch it forward a little bit by bit to the tips.</li>
            <li> The iron gets hot really fast and within seconds you are ready to straighten and dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> extremely recommend it, even if you have super duper curly hair!</li>
            <li> So I liked that it worked with wet hair and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Left my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I spent half the morning on Amazon looking for a new one that would be both affordable and a good reviewed product.</li>
            <li> i got the new hair straight flat iron of reminginton s2730, on the first day i pulged into switch board, i got a burned smell &amp; fumes coming out of the machine...</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my old Wet 2 Straight which I absolutely love and which finally died after six years.</li>
            <li> I no longer have any issues with getting hair caught in the plates if it gets turned the wrong way, problems with indentations from the vents has somehow been reduced (or maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m experienced with this particular type of flat iron now), and it feels a lot more heavy, solid, and well constructed than the original did, too.</li>
            <li> Actually my first Remington S7230 Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron didn&#x27;t work on my second use, I returned it to the store and ordered the same one on Amazon, because I believed that it would be the flat iron I was looking for, I tried it and It works great,</li>
            <li> But in the long run it was very very damaging to my hair!</li>
            <li> For reference, I have owned Chi and T3 irons in the high end range, and Hot Tools in the low end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This gives my hair a nice smooth, soft finish in half the time, if not more.</li>
            <li> but i can live with that</li>
            <li> I got it since I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> It was in a box with a Remington sticker on it that said new.</li>
            <li> I was thinking maybe I needed a new straightener.</li>
            <li> When I needed to buy a new straightener, I bought this one thinking it would work well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item new.</li>
            <li> I love the CHI pro flat iron and blow dry your hair with a thermal protectanct</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has the old one, or anyone who wants a cheap flat iron that works wonders.</li>
            <li> placenta work great, but it still isn&#x27;t as soft as letting it air dry totally before using a regular flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> placenta work great, but it still isn&#x27;t as soft as letting it air dry totally before using a regular flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that it&#x27;s less time consuming and far more effective to blow dry my hair and then use a traditional flat iron.</li>
            <li> I like the wet 2 straight feature because I don&#x27;t have to make sure my hair is completely dry</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to use on wet hair, it does dry it but doesn&#x27;t really save me any more time than it did when I used a blow dryer and straightener.</li>
            <li> The iron also is not heavy, which can be a problem with older irons,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats up really fast though (but usually don&#x27;t really care because they all take relatively short time).</li>
            <li> The Remington S7230 Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron with Soy Hydra Complex is a very nice flat iron that leaves your hair feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Pros is that it gets hot very fast and gets my thick wavy hair pretty straight.</li>
            <li> NEVER flat iron hair that hasn&#x27;t been treated with some form of protective product first, though, no matter your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does get hot, much hotter than my wife&#x27;s old flat iron; the box says up to 425 degrees I believe it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair but leaves it very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got damaged colored frizzy hair, but no need to set this device on a very high temperature, this satisfies my expectations, makes my hair look flat and shiny (Thanks to the soy infused into the plates).</li>
            <li> OMG, I purchased the wet 2 straight last week and the very first time I used it I was amazed at the outcome!</li>
            <li> She is used to using a hair drier after showering if she wants straight hair and had never heard of wet 2 straight before.</li>
            <li> This actually works really well!</li>
            <li> It vents out the steam rather than forcing the hot steam back onto your hair.  </li>
            <li> And it is much more durable than irons she has had in the past.</li>
            <li> I will admit, the sizzle of hair totally freaked me out at first</li>
            <li> I am not able to use this close to the hair scalp as the heating element will be touching my hair scalp then.</li>
            <li> My significant other has been using this for about a month, and has no complaints.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;This is the first hair straightener I have personally owned.</li>
            <li> My first and second ones broke within a couple months because I would just leave it in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position and unplug.</li>
            <li> This flat iron gives my hair a sleek and smooth look and feel and lasts til the next wash.</li>
            <li> When I tried it, I found that it heated fast, but it pulled my hair (gets in the seams) and or the tension wasn&#x27;t high enough to grip my hair.</li>
            <li> Flat irons are expensive but this one is low cost andit works great!  </li>
            <li> Ordered this new Remington model because my old model conched out after about 4 years.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a little nervous about getting this version, as they&#x27;ve replaced the original tourmaline with the soy hydra complex, and the easy to read/comprehend digital display and buttons with a twisting temperature dial and power switch (which appeared to me like it would be more difficult/complex to use than a digital display).</li>
            <li> I have to go over each section of hair TWICE in order for it to get dry, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> There are many people who have had not problems with it, but to me it&#x27;s just not worth the risk of having open sores on your head.</li>
            <li> She definitely felt like it worked as far as the drying went, but overall her experience with the straightening portion was not anything special.</li>
            <li> It delivers on its claims and my hair does feel soft and it looks soft!</li>
            <li> I was unsure at first about this flat iron because it was so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> so I would recommend putting some oil or flat iron protection on your hair first.</li>
            <li> I would normally have to blow dry first, which would cause me to sweat.</li>
            <li> It does straighten wet hair better than dry.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to also adjust the temperature setting when switching from wet to dry hair.</li>
            <li> I am bummed about having to do even that, knowing that it will most likely burn out in a year, like the 2 previous ones did)</li>
            <li> You have to go over each piece a few times, but my hair has remained super straight all day.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product dry and straighten your hair, it comes out so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a couple of months now with everyday use and it holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it with my hair barely towel dried and almost dripping wet and while it definitely takes longer to get a good result, it still absolutely works as it says it will.</li>
            <li> After 2 days of using it i immediately got on Amazon to order another Wet 2 Straight!!</li>
            <li> Mainly that the hot iron and wet hair produces a lot of stream, so be care not to steam your ears off.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about using this, but for my hair it works great!</li>
            <li> When I used the iron on mostly dry hair, the way I used my Chi, it worked MUCH better but still not as well as my other iron.  </li>
            <li> I take my showers at night so straight ironing my hair while wet is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Well, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Just used this in my 12 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> So far, I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because she has natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> I thought I was upgrading the old Remington</li>
            <li> Def need to use some product to add volume, otherwise contrast between roots and hair does not look natural</li>
            <li> Well, it works just as well as my last one, and the feel of it is much nicer.</li>
            <li> I would have to break out my old straightener.</li>
            <li> and it is also very frizzy, especially during summer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cons are (1) fixed, not floating plates and (2) doesn&#x27;t get hair quite as silky as my T3.  </li>
            <li> The instant on really save me time in the morning</li>
            <li> I have NEVER liked to do this, so I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> wow* me.  </li>
            <li> It has far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Makes her hair look so professionally done.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to all those that left reviews!</li>
            <li> I was grateful to know that ahead of time, but you should squeeze out as much excess water as possible.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, shiny and suoer straight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;*It&#x27;s a lot of direct heat...</li>
            <li> She uses a much more expensive and hotter iron that works much faster, but her hair is much curlier than mine.</li>
            <li> it was worth every penny (and considering it&#x27;s not very pricy</li>
            <li> I go slow waiting for the sizzle to stop before sliding any more.  </li>
            <li> It worked even better for my niece, her hair isn&#x27;t as thick as mine and doesn&#x27;t have any wave at all</li>
            <li> It is super thick and very, very wavy.</li>
            <li> I purchase this 5 months ago and it&#x27;s really on fire when I iron my curly thick hair and makes my hair perfectly straight and shiny!!!</li>
            <li> and I love the new Soy Hydra Complex that the new version offers(my old wet 2 straight one didn&#x27;t have it)</li>
            <li> But then I went and tried it on almost dry hair and it turned out pretty good-my hair was soft and shiny and sleek.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my very curly hair, does not leave my hair frizzy like my last flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have not found a flat iron better than this one hands down !</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first using this when my hair was wet, but it worked great!  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well on dry hair too, it straightens with one or two strokes depending on the heat setting.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s very lightweight and itheats up at a reasonable pace</li>
            <li> My wife has relatively small hands and this handled well in her hands easy to hold and not too bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I do have to dry it some first before using the iron, but once I get the excess water out</li>
            <li> I need a new haircut and a new hair style because of it after only 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> She says it does a good job and her only comments were that it is difficult to get it close to the hair roots, and that the outside gets quite hot.  </li>
            <li> current slimmer version covers less area of the hair and doesn&#x27;t penetrate the locks of hair as easily</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and takes half the time my old straightener took to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I actually take less time now doing my hair, as long as you follow the directions (orange light for dry hair up to setting &amp;#60;20-25, and green light for wet hair beyond 25&amp;#62;) then you will be fine.</li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t save a ton of time but doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair as much as blow drying then flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely luv this flat iron.</li>
            <li> At a reasonable cost, this flat iron is a steel.  </li>
            <li> The outside plate right above the groove for your hand can get hot, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if mine was just faulty, but the temperature control was loose and causes the temperature to turn up (way too hot) while using it.</li>
            <li> very wet hair, fresh out of the shower, one time is not sufficient --  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super straight hair, it is wavy by nature, so going to bed with wet hair and waking up with a frizzy mess is pretty standard for me.</li>
            <li> This gets hot really, really, and I mean really fast.</li>
            <li> Does not get hot enough for lasting effect.</li>
            <li> The old model, would straighten my hair in no more than 7min and would leave my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I use a decent line of shampoos and conditioners as well as leave in products especially a heat protector when I am straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> Actually gets hot enough to make a difference</li>
            <li> and it did a decent enough job.</li>
            <li> Higher temps for straight out of the shower hair, lower temps for partially dried hair.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this Remington flat iron to smooth straight hair and to straighten loose waves though, especially at</li>
            <li> I have only used it on damp hair so far (not full on wet out of the shower) and it dried and straightened it beautifully.</li>
            <li> free remains stretched and longer than other irons I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> I used my step moms straightener, which was a Remington Wet 2 Straight and was really surprised at how well it worked!</li>
            <li> a normal straightener, I can straighten my hair and then walk outside</li>
            <li> is left pretty flat...</li>
            <li> ;)styling, DEFINITELY give this flat iron a try on damp hair!</li>
            <li> At first I was a little confused on how to switch it between &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; modes, but this has actually been greatly simplified from the digital version so that it&#x27;s just a matter of dialing in the right temperature, with the light turning green for wet and amber for dry.</li>
            <li> I have an older version of this flat iron I use every day.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has been wanting a flat iron for a long time but could never find the right one.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky smooth, something it never used to be like with previous flat irons.</li>
            <li> I would have to use this 3 times slowly down my hair to get it straight as opposed to my old Conair, which would be perfectly straight after only once.</li>
            <li> With the Remington Wet 2 Straight flat iron, I get stick straight hair and it doesn&#x27;t give me split ends or do damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li> new five star totally recommend</li>
            <li> I think I will go back to buying a new Chi.</li>
            <li> This iron, since it makes hair much straighter than you would get by straightening dry hair, make them look even thinner.</li>
            <li> On dry hair, the iron works very well.</li>
            <li> It has taken out that choppy look and has left my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I only use this about 2 times a month because my hair can only take so much.</li>
            <li> I barely use the highest heat setting even with wet hair because it gets really hot just on setting 20.</li>
            <li> I like this one better because the Soy Hydra Complex actually helps to protect her hair.  </li>
            <li> The thick plates are much better than the last one I used.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary about purchasing another cheap flat iron.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and cools down enough to wrap the cord around it and stick it in the drawer in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> have gone through so many straighteners from the icky wal-mart brands to the $200 fancy flat irons and none of them work as well on my hair as the Wet2Straight.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t get nearly as flat results as doing just one pass, and it concerns me a little that multiple passes may involve exposing your hair to more heat than necessary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I was very unnerved to use this on my wet hair, because I did not want it to do anything beyond the scope of what a normal flat iron will do.</li>
            <li> If you are new to flat ironing and just want to give it a try, this is the bargain for you.</li>
            <li> So my wife had wanted a new flat iron for a while now.  </li>
            <li> The wet to straight doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well on my extremely thick hair but does fantastic on my daughter&#x27;s hair and mine when it is dry.</li>
            <li> am glad I purchased this Remington S7230 Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron with Soy Hydra Complex, 2 Inch</li>
            <li> I was always very sceptable about wet to straight flat irons because I didn&#x27;t want burn my hair, but then I finally got one</li>
            <li> I blow dry it a bit first, then use the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I previously had a cheap 1\\&quot; flat iron that maybe worked for a short time and then stopped straightening my hair well.</li>
            <li> Great iron, but the build up was so bad</li>
            <li> In general, i recommend any remington wet2straight.</li>
            <li> was a bit surprised that it&#x27;s smaller than the two inches described</li>
            <li> My hair will stay straight for up to a week with minimal upkeep.</li>
            <li> I really like this appliance but do not like it when used on wet hair.</li>
            <li> So, I received this wet to straight iron on Wednesday..</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really say how well it works on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my mother for mother&#x27;s day and so far she loves it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had wet to straight irons before</li>
            <li> even if i have so far only used it one time.</li>
            <li> Wet to straight does not work well.</li>
            <li> :o(((</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like fixed plates, as there always seems to be a section that doesn&#x27;t quite grip hair, and this one is no different.  </li>
            <li> So far I have used this only on damp hair, setting the dial to about 23.</li>
            <li> It definitely works nowhere near as well as this one:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I will still buy and try out the In Styler wet hair flat iron and the Cool Way flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I will still buy and try out the In Styler wet hair flat iron and the Cool Way flat iron.</li>
            <li> Nice and cheaper alternative to my expensive CHI hair straightener (that I dropped and broke).</li>
            <li> and it does not take long to cool down.</li>
            <li> although i was not smart enough to go to amazon to look for this item first, I purchased mine at target and paid either $25 or $30.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are little vents at the top of the flat iron plates which allows the steam from your wet hair to escape.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are little vents at the top of the flat iron plates which allows the steam from your wet hair to escape.</li>
            <li> tired of paying full price at super center stores.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> It really does dry your hair and straighten at the same time!</li>
            <li> and it is just damp it really does dry and straighten at the same time.</li>
            <li> It did not dry my hair straight when wet though.</li>
            <li> using these to pull on and stress wet hair (which she said is in its weakest possible state) causes serious damage to the hair shaft, as the hair, being in its most fragile state, can&#x27;t take the heat and pulling without getting very damaged after repeated uses of wet-to-dry styling implements.</li>
            <li> I normally tend to have dry frizzy ends</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as previously.  </li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting this Wet to Dry flat iron to work, but to my surprise it really does.</li>
            <li> straightener works well as a dry straightener (although you should still be sure that the vents are pointed AWAY from your head, dry or not) especially being 2 inches wide, but I am going back to my old, narrow straightener and returned this one because it really ticks me off that I followed the directions to the letter, and still ended up getting hurt.</li>
            <li> This iron is great for those who will use it on mostly dry hair and do not want to spend a lot of money on an iron - having used another iron previously, I was left unimpressed with the Remington as I found it did nothing for wet or damp hair and did not work as well as my other iron on mostly dry hair</li>
            <li> but it doesnt make my hair as flat as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> A flat iron with fixed plates burns and breaks your hair.</li>
            <li> They have my hair moisturized and soft as it&#x27;s ever been, but they can&#x27;t replace a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers mention that this doesn&#x27;t straighten their hair very well, and I&#x27;ve seen videos of people with thicker hair use this, and I agree.</li>
            <li> I had an old flat iron and was probably about 4 in.</li>
            <li> I have only had my new flat iron for 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for my old purple digital Wet 2 Straight flat iron.</li>
            <li> and I used to blow dry it straight back in the day then use a regular iron to flatten it...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t blow dry my hair just because I want to use as least amount of heat possible on my hair to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> it does not dry my hair in one use.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair frizzy free, fly-a-ways under control, shinny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight and dry with little effort!</li>
            <li> I had to hold the iron from both sides:the handle and the front tip of the iron which was a little too hot for my fingers in order to grab my hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tool to anyone with longer hair, especially if you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t like to blow dry!</li>
            <li> I bought it because of all the great reviews on here, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> so obviously don&#x27;t touch the plates whilst it is on) fast compared to her other iron, in around 30 seconds</li>
            <li> so when I saw Remington was making a Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron</li>
            <li> I decided on the Remington Wet 2 Straight flat iron</li>
            <li> I decided to get the Remington Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron for my oldest daughter who is a pro at straightening her hair every morning.</li>
            <li> My old flat iron didn&#x27;t heat properly and took forever to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I totally have no regrets on purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> For the first couple passes it mostly dried my hair.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical because I also own a Revlon flat iron</li>
            <li> The next morning I did my normal routine of showering and letting my hair air dry while I had my coffee and breakfast and watched the news (about an hour total).</li>
            <li> I actually thought i&#x27;d have a hard time adjusting to it because it was a different shape than the original, but I didnt.  </li>
            <li> choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love not having to dry it and having all that long thick hair to do another process on.</li>
            <li> It takes me about 10 mins to dry with this iron (but i still dry roots separately with the blow dryer, since it is a bit hard to do with the iron alone, plus it adds more volume)&lt;br /&gt;- Does not seem to spoil your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of wet 2 straight flat irons.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have to dry her hair completely when she uses it which she likes and it saves her some time.</li>
            <li> , it tends to feel MUCH dryer after I flat iron my damp hair as opposed to using a regular flat iron on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair</li>
            <li> You most likely won&#x27;t be disappointed! :)</li>
            <li> You most likely won&#x27;t be disappointed! :)</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money and time in the past having my hair dresser straighten it, as it takes me over an hour and several styling products to get it smooth.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not usually a concern with wet hair anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very simple to use and has a large variety of heat settings for wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Works very well wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> It only has a on/off switch, a two-color light indicator to indicate dial settings (dry, damp and wet hair) and a dial (level 1 - 30) to select the hair condition (dry or damp or wet).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that using this iron on wet hair might make coarse hair (like mine) a little frizzly, but I usually use it with dry or only slightly damp hair, and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I bought both of them from Walmart for about $25, although that model now costs $42 on walmart.com, and $27 on amazon, and this one apparently the new slightly cheaper model.</li>
            <li> I would never own another straight iron!!</li>
            <li> With the older version your cord from the hair dryer could accidentally lay across the flat iron and it wouldn&#x27;t matter, the newer version must be kept away from all other cords, combs, brushes, etc.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace myh old flat iron that coujld only be used on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> There was good and bad things about this straightner, I wanted to like this</li>
            <li> The soy hydra complex coated plates really seem to help keep my hair from getting fried and it leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, when my old one died I was forced to find a replacement fast and this has been fantastic so far.  </li>
            <li> I tried using the product according to the instructions with the heat on high for wet to damp hair and began straightening my bangs, this left my hair looking dry and fried at the ends.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hard to control naturally wavy hair that frizzes very easily.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical ordering this because i have not found a good flat iron that actually works for my hair and doesn&#x27;t destroy it.</li>
            <li> I have previously bought the Remington Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron twice, both lasting a little less than a year, but working fabulously for the time that they worked.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be returning this one, and getting the slightly more expensive Wet2Straight Flat</li>
            <li> I would never recommend a wet to straight product and absolutely not this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to use the hair dryer more than twice a year because the hot air usually makes my body temp too hot, esp after a shower, and I just hate all the noise a dryer makes.</li>
            <li> My old straightener, though it also was supposed to be for use with wet hair, NEVER did anything like that!</li>
            <li> I was never into Remington flat iron&#x27;s because I thought they were low quality and probably would damage my hair</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous flat irons throughout the years, always looking for something to keep my frizzy locks in place</li>
            <li> I ordered a $50 flat iron and sent it back.</li>
            <li> When i ordered this flat iron I asked for standard shipping and was not expecting it to get here for almost a week.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of looking before finally buying a flat iron.</li>
            <li> You can mix these with a little silicone serum as well to increase their durability in high humidity.</li>
            <li> I have two children, work full time, and hair down to the small of my back.  </li>
            <li> First let me say I have waist Legnth, thick blonde hair</li>
            <li> With it&#x27;s temperature dial, I no longer have to worry about frying my hair (a major concern with wet irons).</li>
            <li> I did take a blow dryer and took some of the moisture out of my hair, a 5 minute or less job, but then used the Wet 2 straight to straighten it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty lazy about styling my hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> During the entire process, it took maybe two strokes for the iron to dry the different sections of my hair.</li>
            <li> if the comparison to my old one shows that this one is a fantastic product or just that my old was so bad.</li>
            <li> I have usually used a 1 in straightener, but I really appreciated having the 2 in with all the hair I do have.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so humid here in NYC that I&#x27;ve been styling with a flat iron to control the frizz.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought every flat Iron out there.</li>
            <li> DONT spend $100&#x27;s on a flat iron.</li>
            <li> My grandaughter loves this flat iron.</li>
            <li> By the way, FYI, this one actually lasts realllly long.</li>
            <li> Obviously you can&#x27;t run this through wet hair once and expect it to be straight and dried.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I just received my flat iron and straightened my damp hair.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this purchase to anyone wanting a flat iron.</li>
            <li> flat iron</li>
            <li> - it made it damp and frizzy but flat.  </li>
            <li> Neither of us had any luck with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s above my shoulders, so it may take longer if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> but saves on time of blow drying plus flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for college</li>
            <li> Being a bigger barrel it doesn&#x27;t take me as long to do my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> Saves me time and using it on damp hair makes it smoother and straighter than I can get it when I flat iron</li>
            <li> but this flat iron doesn&#x27;t pull AT all.</li>
            <li> I recommend this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron exceeded my expectations for the price.  </li>
            <li> Her old yet expensive flat iron just wasn&#x27;t giving her the same results that she had enjoyed in the past, so I had my eye open for one</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pain in the butt to blow dry then flat iron and as a mom to a baby I don&#x27;t have 2 hours to straighten my hair, and it never really last.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I find it&#x27;s frying the ends of my hair as opposed to the Remington flat iron (just dry)</li>
            <li> I can wash my hair and quickly flat iron and dry my hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> ... if you have always wanted to flat iron your hair, but have issues with dry heatstyling, DEFINITELY give this flat iron a try on damp hair!</li>
            <li> After my straightener broke a few weeks ago, I went to the store to buy a new one</li>
            <li> It only works when dry for me.</li>
            <li> I would only use this product on dry hair and on a lower setting.</li>
            <li> or the fact that i dry the hair on a low temp</li>
            <li> My natural color is black</li>
            <li> It also tends to get dry in the winter and need extra TLC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does eliminate the extra step of blow drying though it doesn&#x27;t totally dry my damp hair</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t have the ability to dry like a dryer can.</li>
            <li> It takes longer to heat and longer to dry my hair, perhaps it is gentler..that is still left to be seen.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t completely dry or straighten our hair (but it did make our hair smell really gross).</li>
            <li> but it only takes a couple of strokes to completely dry.</li>
            <li> Now I only blow dry my roots to give volume and then use this.</li>
            <li> Personally I didn&#x27;t see much difference with the complex, but it didn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly left the iron on it&#x27;s highest setting and tried it on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> , I simply let it air dry</li>
            <li> Actually, when it is wet or damp, it is curly in the back and underneath.</li>
            <li> If u have super thick hair, I do not reccomend this product if you want a wet to dry straightener.</li>
            <li> it normally takes her 45 min to dry her hair but after using this her hair was dry and sytled in less then 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> So, overall, for me, this Remington flat iron gets a \\&quot;meh\\&quot; for its effectiveness on my dry hair, and a resounding, \\&quot;heck no!\\&quot; on the simple consideration of using it on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have long naturally curly hair that is all one length and subject to frizziness.</li>
            <li> especially when i wash it, it takes me really long to dry my hair and&lt;br /&gt;straighten</li>
            <li> It seems that this unit doesn&#x27;t hold the hair tightly like my old one did.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have overly thick or wavy hair, I mainly use a flat iron just to seal the hair so it doesn&#x27;t get frizzy, and this one definitely didn&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tossed it to the back of the cabinet and will use it only in a moment of desperation if all other straighteners within a 5 mile radius are gone.</li>
            <li> other Wet2Straight is digital), so I was constantly hitting the dial and changing it, but even on the hottest setting(it is supposed to go to 425 degrees)</li>
            <li> , it wasn&#x27;t as hot as the previous one, which is only supposed to go to 410 degrees, but I never used it much past 380 or 390.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only minor issue with this flat iron is that it does give off a funky sort of smell if applied to wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy/wavy hair and this iron really does make my hair flat and frizzy-less!</li>
            <li> I typically wear my hair up with the layers/bangs down in front, so I looking for a relatively inexpensive straightener and was drawn to this model because of the wet to straight option.</li>
            <li> I had the digital version of this Wet 2 Straight Flat iron with Soy Hydra Complex</li>
            <li> And now the flat iron wont work on dry hair unless it&#x27;s on the lowest heat setting.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to blow dry and flat iron it.</li>
            <li> They all cost about the same, and all generally work as advertised with little variation.</li>
            <li> I now simply lower the temperature setting when using it on my dry hair and haven&#x27;t had a single issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a wet to dry flat iron before this product because I always assumed that it would totally fry my hair.</li>
            <li> I do not use while my hair is wet, only with infusium or motions leave in</li>
            <li> Heat enough and you can use it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> When I say long hair</li>
            <li> I use this iron on the lowest setting with my hair naturally air dried.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money...  </li>
            <li> so she has to keep it 6 inches from her head when her hair is wet because of the steam overall</li>
            <li> but I bleach it to a silver color and often dye it with semi permanent dyes in unnatural colors like pastel purple, blue, pink, etc.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take long at all</li>
            <li> I was curious to try a product that could potentially eliminate a step in the hair process!  </li>
            <li> After using the straightner for a couple of weeks, I do not see any damage to my hair which I was concerned about, especially since I was using it on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> To me it&#x27;s used as a hair dryer, it takes too long to straighten my hair with this</li>
            <li> I have really  curly, long, and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I use 15 setting (which is actually low, you can use 20-30 for wet hair) and i have long hair.</li>
            <li> This flat iron simply could not grip my hair tight enough to give it the tension it so needed.</li>
            <li> At worst, you may not get the straightest results or it may take an extra long time to do, but it&#x27;s very unlikely that setting will fry anyone&#x27;s hair unless perhaps it&#x27;s EXTREMELY baby fine, and even then I&#x27;m sure it would take more than one attempt...</li>
            <li> I use it on damp hair now and not wet to cut down on how long it touches my hair.</li>
            <li> Also, despite the fact that it feels dryer and not nearly as soft with this flat iron, my hair actually looks nicer than it did with my previous flat iron.</li>
            <li> I doubted this iron would work on my type of hair (thin, soft, course hair), wet or dry, but it really straightens my hair the way I would like it</li>
            <li> and I am glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money on a more expensive tourmaline flat iron!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Although I do not use it with my hair completely wet, I blow dry just enough and finish with it.  </li>
            <li> Remington S7210 Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron with soy Hydra Complex.</li>
            <li> Remington S7230 Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron with Soy Hydra Complex</li>
            <li> With my daughter&#x27;s hair, it took just as long to blow dry and straighten as it did to use this iron without blow drying, so, since this pulled her hair, what&#x27;s the point?  </li>
            <li> my girlfriend who has long thickish hair (half way down her back)tried my brand new iron.</li>
            <li> So I ended up getting this for Christmas and use it on towel dried hair fresh out of the shower after applying a leave in treatment for color treated hair and a heat protectant and it completely dries and straightens my thick hair in less than 20 minutes!</li>
            <li> One works as it should the other doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;The item is simple to use and the one that works, works beyond expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it last for days even a week, my hair stays silky and doesn&#x27;t get frizzy like other times...</li>
            <li> The original version of this product worked wonderfully, no improvements needed...</li>
            <li> So I did the rest of my hair and it didn&#x27;t take long!</li>
            <li> I hope people don&#x27;t actually try to straighten wet hair, though!</li>
            <li> The rounded edges are key to creating body without the crimping you can get from sharper edges of some other flat-irons.</li>
            <li> and I wonder how I lived so long without one!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreen&#x27;s and it was a little more expensive there.</li>
            <li> The only con is that it leaves a smell on your hair due to the material that the straightener is made from.</li>
            <li> My other straighteners left my hair fuzzy - not this one.  </li>
            <li> No split ends and my hair does not feel rough or damaged from the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I may purchase a second one anyway - just because my teenage daughter and I are usually trying to use it at the same time!</li>
            <li> The Remington Flat Iron also dries wet hair and straightens the hair simultaneously.</li>
            <li> I really had low expectations for this product, but as someone who has long, thick, and slightly wavy hair</li>
            <li> So I wanted to try out a wet to dry flat iron</li>
            <li> Also, it is very long.</li>
            <li> I have (had) very long hair, and decided to have layers put into it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister in law who has very long, curly hair.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have to be completely dry to use&lt;br /&gt;Heats</li>
            <li> I had to have it on the highest setting and be completely dry to even look like the way it should.</li>
            <li> By the way it straightens it perfectly on dry hair too..</li>
            <li> I use straightening oil when my hair is dry, and the Redken heat protection spray if my hair is damp.  </li>
            <li> I decided to just blow dry my hair and then straighten it.</li>
            <li> no matter what I use-shampoo and conditioner for dry, chemical treated hair</li>
            <li> But I would recommend it for use on almost dry hair.</li>
            <li> While it would mostly my dry my hair</li>
            <li> It has to be ran through until it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to wait for any product in my hair to dry.  </li>
            <li> In fact, despite some dry and some damp sections, my hair was uniform in the end.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like how dry my hair feels with this one.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like how dry my hair feels with this one.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to blow dry my hair before styling it.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry a bit</li>
            <li> I rather blow dry and then straighten.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s making your hair way too dry though and dial it</li>
            <li> it dry.  </li>
            <li> I used to blow dry and then straighten my hair -- what a pain.</li>
            <li> If you apply it to dry hair, it&#x27;s scentless.</li>
            <li> my hair air dry while eating breakfast.</li>
            <li> Works on damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li> It used to take me 30+ minutes to blow dry my hair (no kidding) and then an additional 10 - 15 minutes to curl or straighten.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Is wide enough to straighten larger portions of hair, making it less time consuming&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> I first tried the iron on wet/towel dried hair and it did nothing other than heating my hair, I then used it on dam, partially dried hair and again found that it did not straighten my hair the way my Chi does</li>
            <li> my hair is dry, this breezes right through it and doesn&#x27;t leave that weird crimp that can sometimes show up where you initially place the iron on your hair.</li>
            <li> other flat iron however doesn&#x27;t heat up as it should.</li>
            <li> I was just so attached to the one that stopped working that it is hard to accept this new one.</li>
            <li> Giving the benefit of the doubt I tried it again with my hair dry on a lower setting same results but with even less control.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, since my hair is chemically treated I try to cut down on using heat whenever possible.</li>
            <li> I usually take a little under a half hour to get ready and this has added no extra time in the morning for me.  </li>
            <li> I do have to run it down the section a couple times, but it still works and is gentler than drying my hair dry then using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> it is wet or dry and doesn&#x27;t burn or fry your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used it with my hair wet and semi dry</li>
            <li> It works on wet, dry , and damp hair.</li>
            <li> Especially since by the time I&#x27;m half done with my hair, the remaining hair needs a lower temperature</li>
            <li> It heats up within 60 seconds for the wet hair setting and even faster for the dry hair setting (lower number on the dial).</li>
            <li> Can be used on dry , damp or wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> It does work on my wavy Caucasian hair, but it pulls my daughter&#x27;s biracial curly (black and white) hair.  </li>
            <li> My long hair is unbelievably thick and has a natural wave in it.</li>
            <li> It also fried my hair on the lowest setting for the wet to dry.</li>
            <li> It was the only way the iron grab the hair tightly.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very curly, long &amp; hard to tame.</li>
            <li> Do NOT use on wet hair, you will look a total mess.</li>
            <li> I have had luck using a spray in conditioning treatment after flat ironing to give some softness back to it, usually the ones with sheep</li>
            <li> I have had luck using a spray in conditioning treatment after flat ironing to give some softness back to it, usually the ones with sheep</li>
            <li> So a little bit about my hair type as not every tool is going to work the same for every person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my stylist was vehemently against using this, or any other, wet-to-dry flat iron on wet hair, due to the severe damage she said these cause.</li>
            <li> and I had to use my other one once my hair was dry.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a little dry, sort of dry, it was dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The newer version has a lot less plastic around the edges to protect you from burning things such as the cords to your other hair stylers.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, it is a little difficult to get it dry closer to the scalp, so you may want to towel dry your scalp more than usual before using the iron.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a Conair 1 inch cheap iron that was utterly disappointing.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about two months now and noticed my hair is much more damaged (and I don&#x27;t even use it for the wet to straight function because I know that&#x27;s terrible for your hair).</li>
            <li> Remington works about 70% as well as my T3 and at least as well as my old, travel-sized Chi (which is still chugging along).  </li>
            <li> My stylist has never yet steered me wrong, and, since she&#x27;s a professional that clearly knows what she&#x27;s doing, I&#x27;m not about to ignore her</li>
            <li> Worth the money, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve used it once wet</li>
            <li> Just be careful.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t used it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to burn yourself from the steam when using it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy a wide one again</li>
            <li> She has below shoulder length frizzy hair (not straight but not quite curly) but likes her hair</li>
            <li> I tried this on wet hair and it turned out diasterous.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I could use it with wet hair.</li>
            <li> As promised the iron only takes a few seconds to reach maximum heat.</li>
            <li> but i dont use it with hair completely wet</li>
            <li> Be careful when using this that you are not pointing the steam vents toward your scalp or face.</li>
            <li> Be careful when using this that you are not pointing the steam vents toward your scalp or face.</li>
            <li> but it stoped working properly after four years of heavy using.  </li>
            <li> I did not use it for my hair wet though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this straightener on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on wet hair yet but will update this when I do.</li>
            <li> as its grt for price n does a grt job in only few minutes ...go for it guyss</li>
            <li> so be careful,</li>
            <li> after a while the iron turns itself off and the expected results are not obtained.after</li>
            <li> while the iron turns itself off and the expected results are not obtained.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the idea that you can straighten hair while it was wet.  </li>
            <li> Did not work on wet hair well at all.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really expected alot</li>
            <li> EVEN ON THE INSTRUCTION IT SAYS BE CAREFUL AND USE THE STEAM AWAY FROM UR HEAD.</li>
            <li> She used it a few times and has given me her final verdict:  </li>
            <li> a another note the packaging was also a nightmare to open and to repackage without trying to destroy the box.</li>
            <li> it can do wet hair</li>
            <li> I do use a heat treatment while my hair is still wet to protect it from the heat.</li>
            <li> And it gets so hot that it&#x27;s very hard to hold it down with the other hand without getting burned.</li>
            <li> For a user like me with extra thick hair with waves, I tried straightening from wet to dry, it barely even dried it.</li>
            <li> Just wash, air dry and straighten!!</li>
            <li> But that means sometimes running into our New England snowy winters with still damp hair, which is never a good mix.</li>
            <li> I got the same results of stiff crispy hair.</li>
            <li> Not smart.</li>
            <li> It is not strong enough to grip the hair.</li>
            <li> Saves me time, I blow dry my hair half way (don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d work with soaking wet hair) then finish up with this.</li>
            <li> I figured this item would allow her to cut her morning routine time down since it purports to do both dry and straighten.</li>
            <li> Other comments I see is that &amp;#34;BE CAREFUL OF THE STEAM&amp;#34; etc etc...</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick, long hair that is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a matter of debate as to whether it really saves time, but it does dry my hair and makes it much less frizzy that my other ridiculously expensive flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have owned possibly no less than 10 straighteners (very expensive ones, I might add), and none of them came close to the results that I achieved with Wet 2 straight.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try this at first,  but always in search of an appliance or product to tame my naturally curly,  gets frizzy in the rain hair,  I had to try it.  </li>
            <li> Christmas present for our granddaughter who has long thick hair, this was perferct for her.  </li>
            <li> My wife had never used to wet to dry iron before so there was a little bit of a learning curve.  </li>
            <li> the other one B.&lt;br /&gt;Lets</li>
            <li> For the amount of money she spent on the others, she could have had 100 of these!</li>
            <li> several times like I had experience with straighteners in the past.</li>
            <li> but it will have to due.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat like my other brand.</li>
            <li> , it is usually still a bit wet after having flat ironed.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> I continued doing so, but I was nervous as I was still worried about any sort of extreme damage that could&#x27;ve been being done to my hair.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, it turns out so frizzy that it&#x27;s really not helpful to my appearance until the next day when my natural hair oils have taken over and given me that silky shine</li>
            <li> i jus towel dry my hair,apply a little bit of hair serum and use</li>
            <li> It was very heavy and my hair was too short for it to work.</li>
            <li> So while I can recommend this product, I would say it&#x27;s with the reservation that those with very thick hair might find the straightening portion to be less than they&#x27;d hoped, particularly when it comes to the part close to the head.</li>
            <li> I tried the wet hair setting on slightly damp hair</li>
            <li> I have had fairly long hair for most of my life, and the one thing I have always hated to do is to blow dry!  </li>
            <li> However, I would only recommend this to someone with thin hair such as myself.</li>
            <li> My very first straightener always left my hair smelling terrible, but then I got rid of that one to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I divvy it into small sections and use the flat iron and watch the steam rise up and away.</li>
            <li> I have thick long curly hair and trying to straighten it dry</li>
            <li> so our hair is naturally frizzy and I live in South Florida where humidity is our worst enemy, but this flat iron has given me the necessary tool to combat these obstacles.</li>
            <li> We are African American women with very Different hair from one another With Some having thick and course and others beinv thin.  </li>
            <li> I have to use two hands on this product, one to hold the handle to my hair and the other to hold the clamp down.</li>
            <li> faster than my old flat iron which was supposed to be one of the &#x27;expensive&#x27; brands.  </li>
            <li> I know anytime you apply heat to your hair it makes it smell funny, but the smell this flat iron leaves is very weird.</li>
            <li> conventional straighteners leave my hair frizzy and no one likes to look like the lion king for a date.</li>
            <li> Takes a little longer with wet hair but still works well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never burned myself but it is definitely unpleasant to get a eye full of steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never burned myself but it is definitely unpleasant to get a eye full of steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t allow for a lot of pressure when holding the clamps down.</li>
            <li> and it just shuts down for no reason and wont turn on.</li>
            <li> I been almost down to my rear.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item, hoping to cut down on the time I spend in the morning blow-drying and flat-ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> I jumped at the chance to cut down on hair styling time.  </li>
            <li> I narrowed it down to a handful of them</li>
            <li> Hair does not feel greasy or weighed down - just silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> I often forget to turn mine off when I&#x27;m done and this feature has prevented my house from burning down or making the house smell like smoke.</li>
            <li> I usually towel dry</li>
            <li> I tried soooo hard not to have to buy a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say anything negative about this flat iron...</li>
            <li> I have really thick, coarse hair and have a really hard time drying my hair that I just gave up on trying to dry it.</li>
            <li> The soy conditioners (while not very strong</li>
            <li> I had the previous model for years and it has been retired</li>
            <li> and im done in 20 minutes or less.</li>
            <li> This is also feel lighter than my previous and back-up straightener (both conair).</li>
            <li> I previously had...</li>
            <li> I had mine for a year and a half, and i have blond bleached hair, and i didn&#x27;t notice any deterioration/breakage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Heats very quickly - less than 30 sec&lt;</li>
            <li> I had a previous Remington 1 inch iron that was infused with avocado.</li>
            <li> But as previously mentioned, I have to style it every morning.</li>
            <li> It takes less time to do my hair comparing with a 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> finish my hair in less time than ever.</li>
            <li> I have previously owned three hair straighteners ranging from the fred meyer ones to the helen of troy ceramic straightener and</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about buying a $27 wet to dry flat iron.  </li>
            <li> overall this straightner is NOT good for bi-racial hair, not mine anyways.</li>
            <li> The iron doesn&#x27;t close tightly around my hair.  </li>
            <li> I seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier with the flat iron</li>
            <li> I have thick dry tightly curled hair and this worked terrifically.</li>
            <li> I even went out and splurged on a T3 dryer and still had issues getting my hair dried in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> They also offer a 60 day money back guarantee for anyone who is dissatisfied (but buyer usually has to pay return shipping), so at least there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the one she stole from her little sister...</li>
            <li> I shower, brush my teeth, get my clothes laid out, dabble a little here and there...</li>
            <li> My processed ombre ends can still look a little fried/split after using this.</li>
            <li> Regardless, with a little Moroccan oil I can probably combat that problem.  </li>
            <li> and when my hair is still a little damp</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &gt; - Can not bring this close enough to scalp without the steam burning it, thus making it difficult to dry at the root</li>
            <li> My wife thinks she steam cleaned her ears a few times by getting the hair and iron a little too close maybe.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This hair straightener hands down deserves 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of the importance of using smaller sections of hair and going VERY SLOW.  </li>
            <li> I had my previous Remington iron for 5 years and only broke due to me being careless.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it was going to be cheaply made and work poorly.</li>
            <li> To avoid disappointment, I purchased this straight iron with few expectations.</li>
            <li> heavy</li>
            <li> It actually dried my hair &amp; it didn&#x27;t smelled like burned hair.</li>
            <li> I dried my hair.  </li>
            <li> The worst part, is that regardless of whether you have the 1\\&quot; or 2\\&quot; plates, neither can effectively do anything for the hair closest to your scalp.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times a week for about 3 years.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair but its thin, the only way I used to get volume and sleek look was when I blow-dried then straightened it.</li>
            <li> In fact, I ended up stashing it in the closet somewhere and have misplaced it.  </li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t have heavy buyer&#x27;s remorse.  </li>
            <li> So I dried my hair to where it was semi damp</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have also tried it with towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> how few passes I need to make to straighten my unruly waves.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener because I thought it would cut down on my drying time, unfortunately It would only work on slightly damp hair and even then it would take a couple of passes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what Soy Hydra complex means, but what I received was damaged dry ends with a crispy look.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s less time!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this straightener because I had previously tried a wet to dry straightener</li>
            <li> The small section that I did looked slightly damaged.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this one out because I hate blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I used it on towel dried hair and it singed the ends badly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my hair glossy and tame</li>
            <li> My hair also feels very thin and not heavy at all like usual.</li>
            <li> Just would not grip my hair no matter how hard I tried to clamp down on the handle.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, dry hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair, past my shoulders, it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my girlfriend who has thick black hair.</li>
            <li> My expensive flat iron has been down graded to the bottom of my appliance drawer!</li>
            <li> hate blow drying my hair because I just end up a hot sweaty (literally) mess and by the time I&#x27;m finished</li>
            <li> We tried it and she was afraid the direct heat would damage her hair.</li>
            <li> I used an old backup Conair but it wasn&#x27;t cutting it</li>
            <li> This review is based on comments from my wife using this product over the past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m done, no more relaxer in my hair.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that each time my daughter uses this thing it smells the whole room up like chlorine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what happened</li>
            <li> It does not really works very well on wet hair and my hair looked so horrible after using this product..</li>
            <li> Not sure how the soy works - but it does.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if anyone has had their hair OVER layered but it looks very choppy and not neat at all.  </li>
            <li> I got it just time ,because my last flat iron had started to give problems and my hair desperately needed a press,lol thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether it is soy hydra complex though</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I usually hate washing my hair, because I know of all the hassle after to get my wavy thick hair pin straight, but this did it in 15 MINUTES, when it usually takes me 45-1hr .</li>
            <li> it will work on wet hair as it states but they have to be very thin and small sections at a time so it could take a while.</li>
            <li> I do not have hard to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> She loses this.</li>
            <li> and it was too late after</li>
            <li> iron also advertises a Soy Hydra complex on the plates.</li>
            <li> Time consuming to say the least.</li>
            <li> All though not curly, I do have wavy, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Would not straighten my thick hair.</li>
            <li> It is thick, it is curly, it is frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have extremely thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> Shines amazingly - no additional product required but heat protectant can be used.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This product dries and straightens my hair in 10 minutes (15 if I am taking it slow).</li>
            <li> I shopped around like crazy for a flat iron and decided on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for the past 4 years and it still works to this day without a problem!</li>
            <li> Amazon price is unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> Wife uses it everyday!!</li>
            <li> I have always used a very expensive unit prior</li>
            <li> i was a little insecure because I had never tried an iron that dries your hair &amp; straightens it.</li>
            <li> I never really loved it</li>
            <li> Not a good experience with this straightener.</li>
            <li> i have thick hair so thin straighteners do not work as well as this product.</li>
            <li> You can use on thick or thin hair without damage.</li>
            <li> Shockingly my hair wasn&#x27;t fried after using the flat iron while still wet.</li>
            <li> The clamp is weak.</li>
            <li> towel dry my hair, and then crank this bad boy up to 30 and start getting to work.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad, but I was hoping to have totally dry hair when I walk out the door in the morning to the −30 degree</li>
            <li> You end up with frizzy, sticky, damp hair near your scalp, which looks awful and feels even worse.&lt;br /&gt;Stick with your usual styling tools.</li>
            <li> It was bubble wrapped and dirty (like it was previously used)</li>
            <li> I have very thick and wavy hair and</li>
            <li> She felt the design did not allow her to get to the roots of her very thick hair</li>
            <li> but she has thin hair.</li>
            <li> hair is a bit thin.</li>
            <li> It may work on thin wavy hair; I wouldn&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I was tired of driving to work paranoid</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order because I&#x27;ve had bad buy&#x27;s with other seller</li>
            <li> a few times before I noticed what I was doing wrong!)</li>
            <li> But sadly, mine is going back to Walmart tomorrow morning, what a shame. :(</li>
            <li> but I only used it once and was very disappointed in results.</li>
            <li> I was in awe, now comes the sad part.</li>
            <li> just when I received it it had a couple scratches and was in weird packaging.</li>
            <li> My $70 straightener is worse then this!</li>
            <li> Needless to say its a miracle.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of burning my hair.</li>
            <li> No need to buy the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair is difficult to straighten</li>
            <li> It lasted me for over 5 years before it got a short in the wire and would no longer work so purchased another brand and HATED IT!!</li>
            <li> Dangerous, hair straightener.</li>
            <li> This hair product takes my kinky, curly, and a lot of the time crazy hair to be 100% sleek and silky with shine.</li>
            <li> The temperature is adjustable and I don&#x27;t feel afraid of my hair burning with this tool.</li>
            <li> and again I was disappointing my front layers look damaged and fried.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s impossible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad, OK?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a *bad* iron.  </li>
            <li> Now,  I can&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s like to have a Bad Hair</li>
            <li> and I wanted it so badly, well it did straighten my hair but not like this one..</li>
            <li> I get so frustrated with my hair.</li>
            <li> I was shocked how well this unit worked.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Deeply disappointed.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s very awkward</li>
            <li> and I hate spending tons of time on my hair in the morning</li>
            <li> Hate it.</li>
            <li> It can be annoying.</li>
            <li> I was shocked by the amount of steam that came from my damp hair!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it… terrible product.</li>
            <li> However, be warned, because this increases the chances of burning the crap out of your scalp!</li>
            <li> horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I would give this product a 2.5 if I could.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two of these. One works as it should the other doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;The item is simple to use and the one that works, works beyond expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other flat iron however doesn&#x27;t heat up as it should. When comparing the two, let&#x27;s call the working one A and the other one B.&lt;br /&gt;Lets say I turn the heat seating on A to low and the heat setting on B to the the highest.&lt;br /&gt;The heat on A is more than B.</li>
            <li> Bought for my Grand daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Was tired of paying full price at super center stores.&lt;br /&gt;Used every day and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair glossy and tame&lt;br /&gt;Is wide enough to straighten larger portions of hair, making it less time consuming&lt;br /&gt;Hair doesn&#x27;t have to be completely dry to use&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Is heavy&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;wet to straight&amp;#34;, slightly damp but mostly dry to straight would be more accurate.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Target for $25. The plates heat up instantly and leaves my hair smooth and silky. Comfortable egg shell feel and great light notification feature. Zero complaints</li>
            <li> Very happy, what I expected and works as it should. Worth the money, can&#x27;t go wrong. Hope this review  helps</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my girlfriend who has thick black hair. She is used to using a hair drier after showering if she wants straight hair and had never heard of wet 2 straight before. We tried it and she was afraid the direct heat would damage her hair. She&#x27;s super happy with how well it works!</li>
            <li> These flat irons are amazing! I used them on my hair right after washing and it got bone straight. I&#x27;ve used them on friends hair as well and it&#x27;s gotten their hair just as straight and soft. We are African American women with very Different hair from one another With Some having thick and course and others beinv thin.  Definitely competes with the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this flat iron. The whole idea of being able to basically skip a step (blow drying) sounded fantastic to me. Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. I will say on damp hair this flat iron definitely dries your hair as good as a blow dryer. I was in awe, now comes the sad part. IT does not straighten well at all. I do not have hard to straighten hair. All though not curly, I do have wavy, thick hair. This flat iron simply could not grip my hair tight enough to give it the tension it so needed. Talk about a let down. Maybe this thing needs floating plates like others I have tried. Just would not grip my hair no matter how hard I tried to clamp down on the handle. With a little work I believe this could be a great flat iron that saves you a lot of time. But sadly, mine is going back to Walmart tomorrow morning, what a shame. :(</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my old Wet 2 Straight which I absolutely love and which finally died after six years. I used an old backup Conair but it wasn&#x27;t cutting it so I decided to try this. I have processed blonde hair so I was intrigued by the soy complex.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit surprised that it&#x27;s smaller than the two inches described but I figured what the hell? It&#x27;s so humid here in NYC that I&#x27;ve been styling with a flat iron to control the frizz. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to maneuver, perfect for travel. The smaller size makes it great for getting down near the roots. And my hair definitely looks more polished. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have really  curly, long, and thick hair. I don&#x27;t know how to style my hair but wanted to start. I bought this on a whim and started using it. Since I bought it 1 year ago, it&#x27;s been a blessing. What once took 3 hours to straighten my hair (remember I never straightened my own hair before) now takes me 1 1/2 hours. Not bad. It makes my hair straight and shiny! I get compliments all the time. My hair will stay straight for up to a week with minimal upkeep. I love this thing! While I&#x27;ve used it once wet (it worked great), most of the time I use it with dry hair (though I do put heat protected spray; i use the Brazilian Keratin Flat Iron Spray.)</li>
            <li> It really straighten your hair I likr it</li>
            <li> My daughter bought every flat Iron out there. Name brands, advertised brands, nothing really did as it said it would. Most fried her hair. This one was the the ONE. Did all it said it would do and more. For the amount of money she spent on the others, she could have had 100 of these!</li>
            <li> Straightens hair well and leaves it smooth for days. This is the only one I have used where I don&#x27;t have to use it daily because of how smooth and straight it leaves my hair. The last straightener I had was also a Remington and it lasted 3 years and that&#x27;s why I got this brand again.</li>
            <li> flattens hair easily without burning it.</li>
            <li> This actually works really well! Worked great on my mom&#x27;s Hair, which is fine than mine. I use it as my regular straightener instead of my chi that I&#x27;ve been using for Years. Saves me time, I blow dry my hair half way (don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d work with soaking wet hair) then finish up with this. Great Deal. just when I received it it had a couple scratches and was in weird packaging. I didn&#x27;t care tho.</li>
            <li> Daughter has been using this for months now. It works great with her thick long Hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this straightener but I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  I like Remington&#x27;s line of hair care products.  I even like this better than the old Remington I used to have (before the airline broke it...ughhh)!  My hair looks great after only about 5 minutes of use!</li>
            <li> For a user like me with extra thick hair with waves, I tried straightening from wet to dry, it barely even dried it. I even tried drying it a bit and it stilll didn&#x27;t even straighten it all that well when it was drier. It doesn&#x27;t allow for a lot of pressure when holding the clamps down. I had to have it on the highest setting and be completely dry to even look like the way it should. If u have super thick hair, I do not reccomend this product if you want a wet to dry straightener. It only works when dry for me.</li>
            <li> My favorite  by far!!!! It makes ur hair fell great!</li>
            <li> Got it for my niece for Christmas.. She loves it..her hair looks great every time I see her now...she&#x27;s not a blowdry person..lol..does what it says...fast shipping...might get one for myself now...lol</li>
            <li> Just what I, personally, needed. But I have &amp;#34;easy-to-straighten&amp;#34; hair so that might not mean that this straightener is perfect for everyone. My hair is very long and fine, and wavy/straightish naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- heats FAST&lt;br /&gt;- smooth glide&lt;br /&gt;- straightens damp hair (haven&#x27;t tried soaking wet)&lt;br /&gt;- makes hair super glossy and pretty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- creases hair easily</li>
            <li> I bought this and it&#x27;s excellent!!!!! Great buy,I&#x27;m from Trinidad and even with shipping I got it just time ,because my last flat iron had started to give problems and my hair desperately needed a press,lol thank you Amazon! &amp;#60;3 I would recommend this to just abt any female searching for an excellent flat iron at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I purchased the wet to straight flat iron after reading most of the reviews, both positive and not so great ones. I have the thickest, curly hair ever. Although my hair dresser states that people would give anything to have my hair so that they could just wash it and let it dry with beautiful curls, I on the other hand want it straight! I have spent a lot of money and time in the past having my hair dresser straighten it, as it takes me over an hour and several styling products to get it smooth. OMG, I purchased the wet 2 straight last week and the very first time I used it I was amazed at the outcome! I did take a blow dryer and took some of the moisture out of my hair, a 5 minute or less job, but then used the Wet 2 straight to straighten it. I have owned possibly no less than 10 straighteners (very expensive ones, I might add), and none of them came close to the results that I achieved with Wet 2 straight. Not only does this product dry and straighten your hair, it comes out so soft and smooth and it stays that way! This product is the greatest, and even in high humidity, which normally makes my hair curl, it stayed straight. So goodbye to all those styling products and hours of straightening my hair!</li>
            <li> faster than my old flat iron which was supposed to be one of the &#x27;expensive&#x27; brands.  Takes a little longer with wet hair but still works well</li>
            <li> Super cute and well made.  I like the material.  Shipped quickly.  Daughter likes this.  Good value.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have really fine, curly hair and this straightened it well. My only complaint is how your hair smells after using it. I know anytime you apply heat to your hair it makes it smell funny, but the smell this flat iron leaves is very weird. I would still recommend it though.</li>
            <li> the product is of excellent quality, and the time when the delivery has been made ​​very punctual, I recommend it to others the product is genuine.</li>
            <li> she can straighten wet or dry hair and my daughter loves it alot and keeps them from stealing each others lol thanks and loved the shipping</li>
            <li> Love this. I have very thick and wavy hair and not just any straightener can get through it but this one does. It leaves it silky and shiny, very happy!</li>
            <li> The package arrived very well wrapped and protected, the iron heats up quickly, glides without problems, no hair pulling, hair frizz free remains stretched and longer than other irons I&#x27;ve had, I hope to prove over time the conditioning effect of soy protein</li>
            <li> My wife uses this once a week, and has a history of leaving it on and forgetting about it for a bit. It never gets hot on the outer shell even when there is heat going to the irons.</li>
            <li> I just tried it on a few strands and I&#x27;m impressed so far!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is nice, smooth and straight (I have very frizzy, curly hair, hard to manage)&lt;br /&gt;It heats up super fast and there are different heat settings :-)</li>
            <li> Very good straightener. Breaks easily tho</li>
            <li> I loved this straightener!!!! It made getting ready so quick and easy. I&#x27;m a no fuss kind of gal and I hate spending tons of time on my hair in the morning this straightener was just the thing! I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because mine stopped working and I had not even had it one year.... I would purchase another one considering the price.</li>
            <li> Just used this in my 12 year old daughter&#x27;s hair. It is super thick and very, very wavy. Actually, when it is wet or damp, it is curly in the back and underneath. Also, it is very long. It is almost to the middle of her back. This tool was awesome. It took some time but did everything in one step and made her hair poker straight and smooth. She loved how it looked and it was not difficult. Just be careful. The steam is hot and the hair is hot to the touch immediately after straightening it. Would definitely recommend this. Hopefully it continues to work.</li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron. My sedu iron which cost me about $150.00 recently broke and I was looking for a good flat alternative. I was never into Remington flat iron&#x27;s because I thought they were low quality and probably would damage my hair but I needed something fast and cheap. Well let me just say this flat iron is Awesome!!!! So much better then my sedu. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and defiantly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I love that i can straighten my hair in just under 30 minutes. it heats up really quick and i&#x27;m always in a rush so i often forget to unplug or turn something off but with auto shutoff after 60 mins i don&#x27;t have to worry. i have thick hair so thin straighteners do not work as well as this product. it leaves my hair straight and silky even when its damn. conventional straighteners leave my hair frizzy and no one likes to look like the lion king for a date. I totally have no regrets on purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I had the digital version of this Wet 2 Straight Flat iron with Soy Hydra Complex and it was wonderful, so I wanted another one to keep in my travel bag. When I tried it, I found that it heated fast, but it pulled my hair (gets in the seams) and or the tension wasn&#x27;t high enough to grip my hair. It&#x27;s a total loss for me. I tossed it to the back of the cabinet and will use it only in a moment of desperation if all other straighteners within a 5 mile radius are gone.</li>
            <li> heats up very fast leaves my hair very soft and smooth great  width on the heating plate i recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this appliance but do not like it when used on wet hair. When I first got it, I used it on towel dried hair and it singed the ends badly. I use it now to straighten the ends and it looks fine but can&#x27;t wait until those frizzy ends get cut off. I would only use this product on dry hair and on a lower setting.</li>
            <li> This is the first straightener that I have ever purchased or used.  So far, I have no complaints.  It works well, and I have not noticed any significant damage.  I do use  thermal protection and extra conditioners with this.  I have gotten compliments and my husband and kids prefer my straight hair to the perm that I thought was a good idea.</li>
            <li> Gets too hot. Burned my scalp every time I try to used it. Wouldn&#x27;t used it on wet hair. Pain on scalp after using it. Which lasted for two week. Dangerous, hair straightener.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because she has natural curly hair. She loses this. She tells her friends and anyone that asks how she keeps her hair so straight.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used!  It really does dry your hair and straighten at the same time!</li>
            <li> I am from Ecuador and i got it and it works perfectly, i couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my purchase. :)</li>
            <li> I have naturally really curly hair... It&#x27;s a pain in the butt to blow dry then flat iron and as a mom to a baby I don&#x27;t have 2 hours to straighten my hair, and it never really last.  I tried this did my hair in 30 mins or so and it last for days even a week, my hair stays silky and doesn&#x27;t get frizzy like other times... I am in love with this flat iron, and recommend it to EVERYONE I know that has curly hair or is really busy!!!! Saves time, and it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this straight iron from a retail store. Not sure how good it would work on wet hair, but I am very pleased! It delivers on its claims and my hair does feel soft and it looks soft! Happy I have it!</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Works very well wet and dry.  The thick plates are much better than the last one I used.</li>
            <li> This is really the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had. If you use it with wet hair it dries it fast and leaves your hair smooth and silky. Use it with every hair wash.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister who used my 2005 model and fell in love with the ability to skip the hairdrying stage. This newer model is great. She absolutely LOVES it and says she has got more compliments on her hair than ever!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener because I thought it would cut down on my drying time, unfortunately It would only work on slightly damp hair and even then it would take a couple of passes. It worked well on my roommate but she has thin hair. I would not recommend for anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> greatttttttttttttttttttttttt, awesome, works very well, would never buy anything else. Using this product daily I would def. tell everyone about it because it&#x27;s a piece of cake.</li>
            <li> Hate it. Doesn&#x27;t heat up at all</li>
            <li> I shopped around like crazy for a flat iron and decided on this one. I LOVE it!!! Amazon had the best price anywhere. I use it with the Moroccan infused Suave products and love the results. The size is perfect as it is not too big but gets the job done in a reasonable amount of time. Just be careful not to burn yourself from the steam when using it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Works great with my thin hair. Don&#x27;t save a ton of time but doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair as much as blow drying then flat ironing.</li>
            <li> works great I love it I had the previous model for years and it has been retired</li>
            <li> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009HKAWFC/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love it! works great and i have course hair. heats up fast. shipped fast. easy to use. i would recommend it!</li>
            <li> ok so anyone in the market for a flat iron, go no further. DONT spend $100&#x27;s on a flat iron. although i was not smart enough to go to amazon to look for this item first, I purchased mine at target and paid either $25 or $30. I absolutely luv this flat iron. it heats up within 20 seconds at the most. it is lightweight, comfortable to use. my girlfriend who has long thickish hair (half way down her back)tried my brand new iron. it normally takes her 45 min to dry her hair but after using this her hair was dry and sytled in less then 30 minutes. i have shorter hair,not quite shoulder length and im done in 20 minutes or less. an absolute great buy for anyone searching for a great iron</li>
            <li> Purchased this item because I have wavy hair and sometimes want to take the waves out.  it works great, but cut my hair so I don&#x27;t use it as often as I did.</li>
            <li> I really like it! It dries your hair easily and it remains straight and soft after hours and you don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s damaging your hair.</li>
            <li> This has been such a time saver for me.  I have two children, work full time, and hair down to the small of my back.  I use a heat protectant product on my sopping wet hair and then this finishes my hair to silky smooth in about 15 minutes.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Actually my first Remington S7230 Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron didn&#x27;t work on my second use, I returned it to the store and ordered the same one on Amazon, because I believed that it would be the flat iron I was looking for, I tried it and It works great, the best I have ever used. I&#x27;ve got damaged colored frizzy hair, but no need to set this device on a very high temperature, this satisfies my expectations, makes my hair look flat and shiny (Thanks to the soy infused into the plates).</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and it works great to straighten it, however I have had it about a year and it just shuts down for no reason and wont turn on.</li>
            <li> The soy really does work! It makes your hair softer and even shinier! I love this iron. The best I&#x27;ve ever had!!&lt;br /&gt;I extremely recommend it, even if you have super duper curly hair!</li>
            <li> I love this piece!  Just as described and even with the lowest current, it works! it worths more than the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the NEX, a bit more expensive than here, but it&#x27;s a good straightener FOR WET hair. It&#x27;s important to say that because it does not work as nicely on dry hair. I have thick long curly hair and trying to straighten it dry it&#x27;s impossible. However for wet hair is excellent! Make sure you use a heat protector!</li>
            <li> EXCELENT!!!! PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASED, FULLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> it works great on wet or dry. easy to use. and the price was right! nice long cord and gets hot quick</li>
            <li> This product is a gift once it is used I will add to my feedback, however it look durable. I hope it is</li>
            <li> This hair straightener hands down deserves 5 stars! It heats up quickly and takes half the time my old straightener took to straighten my hair. This hair product takes my kinky, curly, and a lot of the time crazy hair to be 100% sleek and silky with shine. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more! Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Great straightner and doesnt pull hair and dries and straightnes fast</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly. The temperature is adjustable and I don&#x27;t feel afraid of my hair burning with this tool. It works great on wet hair as well as dry hair. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> am glad I purchased this Remington S7230 Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron with Soy Hydra Complex, 2 Inch I was so impressed I purchased for my personal use .</li>
            <li> Great iron, but the build up was so bad, I couldn&#x27;t clean it. I ordered 2 more, but I will make do with them trying to make sure I wipe them as best I can. I do not use while my hair is wet, only with infusium or motions leave in</li>
            <li> This gets hot really, really, and I mean really fast. I only put it on the lowest setting and it still got pretty hot under 10 minutes. This is also feel lighter than my previous and back-up straightener (both conair). I have thick frizzy/wavy hair and this iron really does make my hair flat and frizzy-less! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> is a good product, it recoemindo, just have to be sure of the size or appropriate measures according to what you want. cheer up and buy whatever you want.</li>
            <li> The original version of this product worked wonderfully, no improvements needed... why fix what isn&#x27;t broken?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works on hair weather it is wet or dry and doesn&#x27;t burn or fry your hair. While the older version was a more user friendly and results were smoother a lot quicker, while the newer version is better on wet or damp hair but time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current slimmer version covers less area of the hair and doesn&#x27;t penetrate the locks of hair as easily so you have to do smaller, thinner locks of hair which takes more time as you turn what would have been 10 locks of hair into 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older version had alert sounds letting you know when the iron was ready and when it was shutting itself off while the newer version has no sounds warnings so it can be turned on or off without you hearing anything but both versions turn off after about an hour after you turn them on whether you&#x27;re using them or not so it&#x27;s nice to hear a sound if you&#x27;re in the middle of finishing your hair when it shuts off and starts cooling down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newer version has a lot less plastic around the edges to protect you from burning things such as the cords to your other hair stylers. With the older version your cord from the hair dryer could accidentally lay across the flat iron and it wouldn&#x27;t matter, the newer version must be kept away from all other cords, combs, brushes, etc. because there is virtually no protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is still one of the best on the market but the older version would warrant a higher rating than the newer version.</li>
            <li> Personally, I find it&#x27;s frying the ends of my hair as opposed to the Remington flat iron (just dry) I previously had... I wouldn&#x27;t buy a wide one again neither - it&#x27;s very awkward and I can&#x27;t make the ends flip like I use to...</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron. I would definitely recommend this. I could never keep my hair straight for more than a day and now with this it last for various days. for any type of hair. :)</li>
            <li> It worked well but it smelled like... If a swimming pool could burn thats what it would smell like. But overall it was fab</li>
            <li> my little sister loved it, as it irons quickly and hair can be wet, my older sister liked it so much that she ordered another one for herself.</li>
            <li> So, I received this wet to straight iron on Wednesday..i was a little insecure because I had never tried an iron that dries your hair &amp; straightens it. I was scared it might burn it..Yesterday I showered &amp; decided to give it a try. When I first passed the iron on my hair I was amazed! It was really awesome! It actually dried my hair &amp; it didn&#x27;t smelled like burned hair. This product is the best, I recommend you to get it (; By the way it straightens it perfectly on dry hair too..</li>
            <li> Of course it works better on dry hair, and most of the time I use it on my hair is just slightly damp.  I use straightening oil when my hair is dry, and the Redken heat protection spray if my hair is damp.  The unit heats up very quickly, and I have not had any problems with tangles or the unit pulling on my hair.  I would buy this unit again if I needed 2 of them.</li>
            <li> Might be faster drying, but faster is not always better or heathier. I love the CHI pro flat iron and blow dry your hair with a thermal protectanct</li>
            <li> At a reasonable cost, this flat iron is a steel.  Does a great job!  Works as well as the much higher priced irons.  If you are new to flat ironing and just want to give it a try, this is the bargain for you.</li>
            <li> There was good and bad things about this straightner, I wanted to like this but too many things were wrong. 1. It doesnt grip my hair like i wanted it to. My hair just slides through, with out really straightening it so i had to go over it a couple times. 2. This problem only may be because of the way i hold my straightners but i hold it with my thumb up, and unfortunatley this straightner has grooves where i put my thumb and after awhile it starts to hurt. 3. Does not beep when it gets hot or turns off after an hour like my old one but i can live with that but i do have a problem with the temperature. You can turn it from 1 to 30 but it doesnt tell you what degrees it is. 4. The soy hydra didnt really make a difference.  now for the good. 1. Gets hot pretty fast. 2. good size and weight, not too light....... overall this straightner is NOT good for bi-racial hair, not mine anyways.</li>
            <li> I love it. Heat enough and you can use it on wet hair. Although too smoky for my taste. Meet good luster hair. Anyway, I really like, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this Remington S7210 Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron with soy Hydra Complex. For the price moves super straight and shiny hair. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this item. I would definitely recommend. It works the best compaired to any brand of hair straightening products.</li>
            <li> I was unsure as to how this thing would really work.  But I can tell you, I LOVE this thing! Works great. Getting ready for work has never been this easy!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this one out because I hate blow drying my hair. I began using it exactly according to directions, on the lowest setting for &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; hair, since I thought mine was a little more than damp. I pointed the vents away and everything. For the first couple passes it mostly dried my hair. However, then I straightened a piece and it burned the you-know-what out of my head. It was about that time that my family asked what was burning. I decided to just blow dry my hair and then straighten it. My scalp burned and stung the rest of the evening, and a bit the next morning. Two days later I was doing my hair and discovered I had knocked open a wound on my head in that same place, a result of the burn from before. It hurt so much all day. That was yesterday and it is still stinging, but healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener works well as a dry straightener (although you should still be sure that the vents are pointed AWAY from your head, dry or not) especially being 2 inches wide, but I am going back to my old, narrow straightener and returned this one because it really ticks me off that I followed the directions to the letter, and still ended up getting hurt. If you want a good dry straightener, this will work, but DO NOT use it wet. There are many people who have had not problems with it, but to me it&#x27;s just not worth the risk of having open sores on your head.</li>
            <li> Would not straighten my thick hair. Does not get hot enough for lasting effect. Would not recommend product. Sent back</li>
            <li> I just received this item week. I dried my hair.  nice. highly recommended. I will give ***** stars to this item. I went to Target Store and they have this item for $35.00. So if you need this item buy it for $16.00 plus shipping handling.</li>
            <li> This is a great brand and it is a nice improvement to the older version of this product.  I had my previous Remington iron for 5 years and only broke due to me being careless.</li>
            <li> I got it since I needed a new one. So I liked that it worked with wet hair and dry hair. So I got it. I first tried it out on my side bangs since they weren&#x27;t straight, and it straightened it perfectly! So I did the rest of my hair and it didn&#x27;t take long! So I thought this was perfect. But now my hair wont stay straight no matter how many times I straighten it. My side bangs don&#x27;t even last 5 minuets, even with hairspray. They do not need to be re done. The tips of both my side bangs and hair curl towards the same direction. I tried other straighteners and they work perfectly and keep my hair straight without hairspray. And now the flat iron wont work on dry hair unless it&#x27;s on the lowest heat setting. Even then it lights up green(wet hair). And it also turns off in the middle of the process. It&#x27;s great at first, but don&#x27;t expect it to last long.</li>
            <li> Nice and cheaper alternative to my expensive CHI hair straightener (that I dropped and broke). I hope people don&#x27;t actually try to straighten wet hair, though! The product name is misleading, as doing this will damage your hair! It has a nice design and heats up very quickly. I&#x27;d recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> Works very well on my very curly hair, does not leave my hair frizzy like my last flat iron. Mostly use on my hair dry so I can&#x27;t really say how well it works on wet hair. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, coarse hair and have a really hard time drying my hair that I just gave up on trying to dry it. I even went out and splurged on a T3 dryer and still had issues getting my hair dried in less than an hour. So I ended up getting this for Christmas and use it on towel dried hair fresh out of the shower after applying a leave in treatment for color treated hair and a heat protectant and it completely dries and straightens my thick hair in less than 20 minutes! I don&#x27;t even need my hair dryer anymore! I am completely impressed! A+</li>
            <li> This review is based on comments from my wife using this product over the past couple of weeks. She has below shoulder length frizzy hair (not straight but not quite curly) but likes her hair straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington 2 inch flat iron heats up to full temperature (425 degrees so obviously don&#x27;t touch the plates whilst it is on) fast compared to her other iron, in around 30 seconds its ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the product says that it works on wet, dry and damp hair (and it really does), for best results you should use it on damp hair (green light should be showing and a setting of somewhere around 20-24 on the dial which goes from 1-30).  It&#x27;s really good also for a quick run over in the evening on dry hair (amber light showing and a setting between 10-17 on the dial) before going out for dinner or to a party etc.  Quick and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington also has a soy based infusion built in which gives your hair a nice shine and makes it smoother to the touch which is good and it lasts for a while (obviously depending on use).  We haven&#x27;t had to refill it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For safety the Remington flat iron will automatically turn itself off after 60 minutes and with the ceramic plates it doesn&#x27;t take long to cool down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very impressed with this iron and her other iron has been relagated to back of the drawer and never gets used.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I tried this on wet hair and it turned out diasterous. But then I went and tried it on almost dry hair and it turned out pretty good-my hair was soft and shiny and sleek. I normally tend to have dry frizzy ends no matter what I use-shampoo and conditioner for dry, chemical treated hair (I color my hair so I use for color treated hair as well) and I use leave in conditioner and heat treatments and trim my hair on a regular basis, but my hair will still friz. I get so frustrated with my hair. But I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this flat iron so far as it tames the friz for the most part. It doesn&#x27;t eliminate it totally. I think I&#x27;m doomed to the frizzies for life. But I would recommend it for use on almost dry hair. Do NOT use on wet hair, you will look a total mess.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and she loves it but also tried it on me now I want to get one for myself I used it right after getting out of the shower and it dried my hair quickly and straighten it quick would recommend to all</li>
            <li> I thought I was upgrading the old Remington I had (wich lasted me two years btw) but I quickly learned it was NO upgrade.  The old model, would straighten my hair in no more than 7min and would leave my hair smooth and shiny.  This is quite the opposite.  My hair looked like hay after using this.</li>
            <li> Better to buy online more expense in the store by 8 dollars ...the only thing I don&#x27;t like when you put up to your head the plate burns your head ..</li>
            <li> My grandaughter loves this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Excellent ! Very easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- low price&lt;br /&gt;- Does dries hair very quickly. I use 15 setting (which is actually low, you can use 20-30 for wet hair) and i have long hair. It takes me about 10 mins to dry with this iron (but i still dry roots separately with the blow dryer, since it is a bit hard to do with the iron alone, plus it adds more volume)&lt;br /&gt;- Does not seem to spoil your hair. I had mine for a year and a half, and i have blond bleached hair, and i didn&#x27;t notice any deterioration/breakage. I am not sure whether it is soy hydra complex though or the fact that i dry the hair on a low temp&lt;br /&gt;- Hair is super straight and shiny&lt;br /&gt;- Heats very quickly - less than 30 sec&lt;br /&gt;- Auto shutdown feature - don&#x27;t have to worry about burning your apt down&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- As with every iron, hair looks thinner when it is straight. This iron, since it makes hair much straighter than you would get by straightening dry hair, make them look even thinner. Def need to use some product to add volume, otherwise contrast between roots and hair does not look natural</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I used a friends once when I was strapped for time to do my hair. I was so impressed by it and how good my hair looked that I HAD to get one. Hers was purchased at bed bath and beyond mine here. Not sure why but I feel like this one didn&#x27;t work as well. I felt like this one took longer to get the job done.The packaging was not as it is in the description. It was in a box with a Remington sticker on it that said new. There wasn&#x27;t any marks and it was clean in a sealed plastic bag. I&#x27;m satisfied with the product over all. Maybe it&#x27;s an older model? All in all good for the price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the one does that I had to buy to replace this one</li>
            <li> I have straightened my hair since i was 16... I have not found a flat iron better than this one hands down ! I used 300 dollar flat irons and also cheap ones that my friends have had but I would never replace this brand. I had mine for scene years now never broke and still works like its brand new five star totally recommend</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I wish it was wider though.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as previously.  Its</li>
            <li> This straighner works amazing! I used it and in 5 minuets I was good to go! Perfectly straight hair!! I have super thick hair so it will work for lots of kinds!! I love it! For $30 it is perfect! My $70 straightener is worse then this! Perfect!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my mother for mother&#x27;s day and so far she loves it... the only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 star is because it didn&#x27;t come in good packaging...</li>
            <li> After my straightener broke a few weeks ago, I went to the store to buy a new one but they didn&#x27;t have the brand that I had before - it lasted me almost 5 and a half years, always worked well, got and stayed hot... just a nice straightener all around. So I was at a loss of what to do. I used my step moms straightener, which was a Remington Wet 2 Straight and was really surprised at how well it worked! I decided to take a look on Amazon, found this one, was AMAZED at the price and decided that even if it didn&#x27;t work as well as my last it was about 1/4 of the price. Well, it works just as well as my last one, and the feel of it is much nicer. It only took me a couple of minutes to straighten my hair, because I didn&#x27;t have to go over each strand several times like I had experience with straighteners in the past. I must say there might be better straighteners out there, but not for the value of this one!</li>
            <li> I was thinking maybe I needed a new straightener. I purchased this because I could use it with wet hair. While it would mostly my dry my hair I would have to break out my old straightener. This left my hair looking a bit frizzy. Not that great of quality</li>
            <li> I was unsure at first about this flat iron because it was so inexpensive. I was afraid it was going to be cheaply made and work poorly. However this was not the case! I have thick dry tightly curled hair and this worked terrifically. Straightening my hair was usually a special occasion thing because of the hours of work that had to be invested in the procedure. I&#x27;ve been able to straighten my hair every morning before work without having to wake up at 3 am. Shockingly my hair wasn&#x27;t fried after using the flat iron while still wet. I&#x27;ve had wet to straight irons before and I was never even able to use them while my hair was wet because they would fry my hair and I would have to chop off the frizzled split ends. Straightening your hair while wet everyday isn&#x27;t the best idea for healthy hair but if you&#x27;re short on time it&#x27;s definitely a splendid convenience. As promised the iron only takes a few seconds to reach maximum heat. The plates get very hot and you can&#x27;t really hold the head of the straighter to help guide it. The iron also does not grip very well unto the hair so not being able to hold the head of it to give it the extra grip is a bother. I have been using a large round barrel brush in front of the iron to get a nice smooth look. Overall the Remington S7230 is great for a quickly straightening your still soggy hair and eliminating the extra step of having to use a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> very good and effective</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s geat but i dont use it with hair completely wet</li>
            <li> I have (had) very long hair, and decided to have layers put into it.  When I say long hair I been almost down to my rear.  Anyways, I went for the cut and she butchered my hair.  I have cried now every night for a week.  With my hair in a bun I went to Duane Reade and happened to see this.  Needless to say its a miracle. I am not sure if anyone has had their hair OVER layered but it looks very choppy and not neat at all.  This iron has changed that.  I usually take a little under a half hour to get ready and this has added no extra time in the morning for me.  Although I do not use it with my hair completely wet, I blow dry just enough and finish with it.  It has taken out that choppy look and has left my hair smooth and shiny.  I highly recommend this to anyone with any hair type.  I wish I would have gotten it before the nightmare cut, but I am so happy now that I have it.  Great buy!!</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous flat irons throughout the years, always looking for something to keep my frizzy locks in place and this by far is the best I have ever used! Even better that I can skip the blow drying step and go straight to flat ironing out of the shower so it&#x27;s less time! By the way, FYI, this one actually lasts realllly long. I&#x27;ve had mine for the past 4 years and it still works to this day without a problem! I DEF recommend this!</li>
            <li> This Flat iron deserves 5 stars, its absolutely the best you are literally done in half the time. I have curly course hair and I pass this over my hair one to two time and I&#x27;m done, no more relaxer in my hair.</li>
            <li> Obviously you can&#x27;t run this through wet hair once and expect it to be straight and dried.  It has to be ran through until it&#x27;s dry.  I use a decent line of shampoos and conditioners as well as leave in products especially a heat protector when I am straightening my hair.  I have a lot of fine hair that&#x27;s very wavy and curly in some places.  I had an older version of this product and the newer one straightens my hair faster.  I like the wet 2 straight feature because I don&#x27;t have to make sure my hair is completely dry and I don&#x27;t have to wait for any product in my hair to dry.  It vents out the steam rather than forcing the hot steam back onto your hair.  I don&#x27;t like the knob tempature setting on this but it will have to due.</li>
            <li> I ordered a $50 flat iron and sent it back. I got this one instead and I love it! It does the job. It does get pretty hot (which you can control) so I would recommend putting some oil or flat iron protection on your hair first.</li>
            <li> everything was perfect and running smoothly</li>
            <li> When i ordered this flat iron I asked for standard shipping and was not expecting it to get here for almost a week. It arrived at my house in 2 days! Very happy with that! I have VERY thick, long hair that is naturally wavy and it is also very frizzy, especially during summer. I was skeptical ordering this because i have not found a good flat iron that actually works for my hair and doesn&#x27;t destroy it. I used multiple products after washing my hair such as frizz control and argon oil and also a heat protectant spray. It heat up very quickly, and i used it on the highest heat setting. I was very impressed even just with the bottom layer of my hair. It took me 1 hour and 10 minutes to straighten, partly because i have not straightened my hair in years, partly because i wanted it to be perfect haha. It did turn off after 1 hour like it says it will. I am very happy with how my hair turned out using this product, even if i have so far only used it one time. My hair is silky smooth, something it never used to be like with previous flat irons. My hair also feels very thin and not heavy at all like usual. I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Very damaging on hair. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This was a gift.  My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I have used it with my hair wet and semi dry and it knocks the curl out. Gets very hot but the heating element has not burned and keeps temp up well. I love this flat iron and converted from a $300 one that didn&#x27;t work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> Have used this before..works great, received  promptly.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I love it!! It works great. My very first straightener always left my hair smelling terrible, but then I got rid of that one to get a new one. Well it made my hair very frizzy and very unmanageable. I was always very sceptable about wet to straight flat irons because I didn&#x27;t want burn my hair, but then I finally got one and I LOVE it!!!!!!!!!! It does not burn your hair at all. It has soy infused plates. It works on wet, dry , and damp hair. It works  very well and does not burn or make your hair frizzy. I would recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> Awesome iron. But they sent me two and charged me for two but that&#x27;s ok i Gave one to my sister as a gift and she loved it to</li>
            <li> This Straightener Is Beyond Good! I Have A Lot Of Hair And It&#x27;s Frizzy. I Bought A Couple Straighteners and They Didnt Seem To Work. I Bought This One To Test It Out, And It Leaves My Hair Super Straight. I Have Been Receiving Many Compliments.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! She says it really saves her lots of time styling her hair now and leaves it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have long naturally curly hair that is all one length and subject to frizziness. I used this flat iron on my towel dried hair yesterday and it worked beautifully. Made my hair straight and shiny and even when I went out in the rain today, it still looked great when I got to work.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the one she stole from her little sister...so I had to buy another.</li>
            <li> Actually gets hot enough to make a difference</li>
            <li> This flat iron exceeded my expectations. I had a previous Remington 1 inch iron that was infused with avocado. It lasted 5 years until it  got ruined! This one is similar in that it is not digital (this is good for me and what I was looking for). I had purchased a Conair 1 inch cheap iron that was utterly disappointing. I have very wavy and very fine hair. I use this iron on the lowest setting with my hair naturally air dried. It gives me the result I was looking for! Not only that but the style lasts the whole day and does not frizz! Remington infused irons are definitely the way to go! Also the price Amazon provided was the cheapest one to be fund. Would recommend and will will for sure replace it when another Remington when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat like my other brand. Wet to straight does not work well. It will do for now though, until I can find another.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly, frizzy hair. This worked ok when I used it on dry hair, but FRIED my hair when I used it on damp hair. I used flat iron spray, and didn&#x27;t even have it at the top heat setting. It is very lightweight. I had an older Conair ceramic flat iron that I LOVED, but the handle finally cracked apart after 12 years, so I bought this as a replacement because of the really great reviews. I would have to use this 3 times slowly down my hair to get it straight as opposed to my old Conair, which would be perfectly straight after only once. It seems that this unit doesn&#x27;t hold the hair tightly like my old one did. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> was a Christmas present to my daughter her happiness with them was my reward for the purchase it feels great when something brings back words of praise.</li>
            <li> Christmas present for our granddaughter who has long thick hair, this was perferct for her.  She uses it everyday with beautiful results.</li>
            <li> I just received my flat iron and straightened my damp hair.  For reference, I have owned Chi and T3 irons in the high end range, and Hot Tools in the low end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington works about 70% as well as my T3 and at least as well as my old, travel-sized Chi (which is still chugging along).  It did not frizz the damp sections of my hair.  In fact, despite some dry and some damp sections, my hair was uniform in the end.  The straightening power is very good: quick and effective.  I do have some fly-away/static hairs, which my T3 kept to a minimum.  The ceramic plates are substantial, not just plated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price is unbelievable!  I&#x27;d pay full price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are (1) fixed, not floating plates and (2) doesn&#x27;t get hair quite as silky as my T3.  All in all, a very good flat iron for a steal!</li>
            <li> Not a bad straightener but it does pull my hair.  Pros is that it gets hot very fast and gets my thick wavy hair pretty straight.</li>
            <li> So let me start out by saying I have pretty unmanageable hair.  It is thick, it is curly, it is frizzy.  I look like a banshee when I don&#x27;t put tons of product in my hair.  It&#x27;s bad, OK?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone through so many straighteners from the icky wal-mart brands to the $200 fancy flat irons and none of them work as well on my hair as the Wet2Straight.  I can pretty much hop out of the shower, towel dry my hair, and then crank this bad boy up to 30 and start getting to work.  It not only straightens my hair fabulously, it keeps the frizz out on those hot humid days in Georgia.  Let me tell you, that is a FEAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a normal straightener, I can straighten my hair and then walk outside and it looks like someone rubbed a balloon to my head.  Well, not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank YOU Wet2Straight!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used, but it works alright. It gets the job done. Leaves hair smooth and takes the frizz away.</li>
            <li> I really loved the Remington and thought it was that answer to my frizzy hair issues. However only after maximum 10 uses it has given up on me and stopped working now.. Complete waste of money...  :o(((</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what it said it would be but I did not like it.  It was very heavy and my hair was too short for it to work.</li>
            <li> Flat irons are expensive but this one is low cost andit works great!  I would recommend this purchase to anyone wanting a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have to use two hands on this product, one to hold the handle to my hair and the other to hold the clamp down. It is not strong enough to grip the hair. And it gets so hot that it&#x27;s very hard to hold it down with the other hand without getting burned. The clamp is weak. I don&#x27;t get it… terrible product.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my girlfriend she liked it but it gets really hot so she has to keep it 6 inches from her head when her hair is wet because of the steam overall it&#x27;s a good buy</li>
            <li> I have to say it, it is a good product but I don&#x27;t love it, It is too big! I had Baby Liss before and I am still in love with the size of that one. But is OK</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that each time my daughter uses this thing it smells the whole room up like chlorine! something can&#x27;t be right!</li>
            <li> So a little bit about my hair type as not every tool is going to work the same for every person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a bit thin. My natural color is black but I bleach it to a silver color and often dye it with semi permanent dyes in unnatural colors like pastel purple, blue, pink, etc. Because of that it is pretty porous. It is naturally very straight but like anyone with lightened hair can say, the porosity level means it will kink up and you&#x27;ll have bed head all day if you don&#x27;t style it in the morning. It also tends to get dry in the winter and need extra TLC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, since my hair is chemically treated I try to cut down on using heat whenever possible. But as previously mentioned, I have to style it every morning. So I wanted to try out a wet to dry flat iron so I wouldn&#x27;t have to blow dry and flat iron it. It was between this and the In Styler but I decided to try this first as it is significantly cheaper, almost suspiciously cheap for a flat iron, and I figured I wouldn&#x27;t be out much if it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now several times a week (the 2 inch width) and it is just okay. It does eliminate the extra step of blow drying though it doesn&#x27;t totally dry my damp hair, it is usually still a bit wet after having flat ironed. Not too bad, but I was hoping to have totally dry hair when I walk out the door in the morning to the −30 degree Cleveland winter (yes, my hair forms ice crystals when I go outside).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it tends to feel MUCH dryer after I flat iron my damp hair as opposed to using a regular flat iron on dry hair. I normally use the Hemp heat protecting balm on my hair but perhaps I now just need a much heavier protecting balm, so keep that in mind. Also, despite the fact that it feels dryer and not nearly as soft with this flat iron, my hair actually looks nicer than it did with my previous flat iron. There aren&#x27;t as many flyaways and there is never any frizziness, it just isn&#x27;t as pleasant to the touch. I have had luck using a spray in conditioning treatment after flat ironing to give some softness back to it, usually the ones with sheep placenta work great, but it still isn&#x27;t as soft as letting it air dry totally before using a regular flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having thinner hair (shoulder length) I do regret having bought the 2 inch width. It is just way too large and would work much better for someone with longer hair or thicker hair. It is also fairly hefty, it tires out my arm before I&#x27;m finished flat ironing. If I bought it again I would definitely get the smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are little vents at the top of the flat iron plates which allows the steam from your wet hair to escape. Be careful when using this that you are not pointing the steam vents toward your scalp or face. I&#x27;ve never burned myself but it is definitely unpleasant to get a eye full of steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is good for the price but I would be willing to pay more for better. I&#x27;m thinking I will still buy and try out the In Styler wet hair flat iron and the Cool Way flat iron. I just don&#x27;t like how dry my hair feels with this one. But if you have healthier hair, especially hair that has not been chemically treated, this would probably work great for you!touch.

            <li> This flat iron is amazing.. will recommend this product..</li>
            <li> I take my showers at night so straight ironing my hair while wet is very convenient.  This iron works very well...no complaints and I have paid alot more for less irons.  I haven&#x27;t notice any split ends yet and I&#x27;ve had this for 6 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I wash my hair every three days. Days 2 and 3, my hair looks MUCH nicer after having slept on it; it takes little or no time to get it to look okay. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I got this based on the reviews and the thickness. It takes less time to do my hair comparing with a 1&amp;#34; flat iron but it doesnt make my hair as flat as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;All in all good product.</li>
            <li> Works best on damp hair and is amazing for this busy working mom...anything that saves me time is worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. I don&#x27;t have to spray my hair with anything just to get it to be straight and non frizzy. It&#x27;s hot enough to do it the first time through. Well never pay $50 or more on another ceramic one when this works way better!</li>
            <li> Gets really hot and really straightens. I like that it turns on once plugged in. I don&#x27;t have to press a button. It did not dry my hair straight when wet though.</li>
            <li> I received this as a birthday present.  The iron doesn&#x27;t close tightly around my hair.  I took a normal section of hair and the iron didn&#x27;t grab it, it just kept sliding through it.  I had to hold the iron from both sides:the handle and the front tip of the iron which was a little too hot for my fingers in order to grab my hair.  It was the only way the iron grab the hair tightly.  I had a Chi for a few years and loved it but it stoped working properly after four years of heavy using.  I think I will go back to buying a new Chi.</li>
            <li> thus is one product I can&#x27;t do without it does everything that&#x27;s stipulated. it&#x27;s dries my hair within minutes and afterwards my hair is so much bouncy and alive I really love this iron. you won&#x27;t regret buying this product it&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Left my hair super soft. I did not use it for my hair wet though. I was skeptical of burning my hair.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 times and it was amazing , then I ordered 2 more for my friend , then suddenly it&#x27;s stop working only i used it for 2 times ! Do t know what to do</li>
            <li> Wow...got it the day after ordering!  Works great</li>
            <li> I love this brand and I love this item. Works really well, does the job in rapid time.</li>
            <li> it is ok save some time at mornings</li>
            <li> A flat iron with fixed plates burns and breaks your hair. I tried to returned it when I noticed it but we had that blizzard, I forgot for a while and it was too late after (the returning time is shorter for this product for some reason).&lt;br /&gt;I read every word on the description and I couldn&#x27;t find anything about the plates before buying it.&lt;br /&gt;Too sad, I love Remington. Not this one tho.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item, hoping to cut down on the time I spend in the morning blow-drying and flat-ironing my hair. I probably should have known that something written up to do both so miraculously was too-good-to-be-true.&lt;br /&gt;No, this product is in no way a substitute for both blow-drying and flat-ironing in the traditional manner. It simply doesn&#x27;t have the ability to dry like a dryer can. The worst part, is that regardless of whether you have the 1\\&quot; or 2\\&quot; plates, neither can effectively do anything for the hair closest to your scalp. You end up with frizzy, sticky, damp hair near your scalp, which looks awful and feels even worse.&lt;br /&gt;Stick with your usual styling tools. This one could probably be an effective flatiron, but only after the blow-drying is complete.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a wet to dry flat iron before this product because I always assumed that it would totally fry my hair. I&#x27;m prone to split ends - even when I use heat protection in my hair - and was worried this type of product would increase them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had really good luck with this product so far. I&#x27;m enjoy using it and it has taken an entire step out of my getting ready in the morning. I no longer have to blow dry my hair before styling it. This iron works for me even when my hair is a bit more than damp. However, be warned, because this increases the chances of burning the crap out of your scalp! The flat iron itself has yet to burn me, but I did get a pretty good steam burn on my scalp once from not holding the hair away from my head, but more at a downward angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair is dry, this breezes right through it and doesn&#x27;t leave that weird crimp that can sometimes show up where you initially place the iron on your hair. I don&#x27;t have super straight hair, it is wavy by nature, so going to bed with wet hair and waking up with a frizzy mess is pretty standard for me. This tames it with no issues in about 15 minutes start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and would recommend it to anyone. It heats up quickly and cools down enough to wrap the cord around it and stick it in the drawer in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This flatiron is great for one step styling instead of blow drying &amp; then flat ironing. Saves me time &amp; I enjoy the quiet mornings.</li>
            <li> I previously had a cheap 1\\&quot; flat iron that maybe worked for a short time and then stopped straightening my hair well. I bought this off a recommendation from my sister in law who has very curly hair and when she straightens her hair, it looks great. I have mostly straight fine hair with a slight wave in some areas. I was a little leary about purchasing another cheap flat iron. The price might be cheap on this product, but there is nothing cheap about the quality!!! After I use it my husband says my hair looks professionally done!! I love that I can skip the blow dryer to save time when my hair is wet. I love that this product is 2\\&quot; and I can do my hair so fast!! It leaves my hair straight all day, gets rid of most of the flyaways, and leaves it with a nice healthy shin from the soy hydra complex and the tourmaline. I seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier with the flat iron and I am glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money on a more expensive tourmaline flat iron!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> this has worked great for my split ends, I have colored my hair for years leaving it brittle and this is works better than creme rinse!</li>
            <li> Great flat-iron! Although I have relatively straight hair, this iron works well for styling and adding body. It is comfortable to hold and easy to use. I tried the wet hair setting on slightly damp hair and I was able to style my hair quickly. However, my hair was not as shiny as when I blow-dry using a boar&#x27;s bristle brush, so I only use it on damp hair if I am in a hurry. On dry hair, the iron works very well. The 30 heat settings help to optimize what I need, depending on how unruly my hair starts off. The rounded edges are key to creating body without the crimping you can get from sharper edges of some other flat-irons. I use this almost daily and I wonder how I lived so long without one!</li>
            <li> was working great for about 5 months now it turns off after 2-3 minutes. it seems to work just fine if its not all the way turned up.</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron for a great price! I have super curly hair and have difficulty finding one that actually works, but this one is fantastic! Very pleased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never yet tried this on my wet hair, and it&#x27;s a good thing: my stylist was vehemently against using this, or any other, wet-to-dry flat iron on wet hair, due to the severe damage she said these cause. She&#x27;d stated that manufacturers have tried selling these products over the past 5 or so years, and they&#x27;ve never taken off, for good reason: using these to pull on and stress wet hair (which she said is in its weakest possible state) causes serious damage to the hair shaft, as the hair, being in its most fragile state, can&#x27;t take the heat and pulling without getting very damaged after repeated uses of wet-to-dry styling implements. She&#x27;s a great stylist, and has done wonders with my hair over the years, so, paired with my just-average experiences with this flat iron on my hair dry, that was enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it dry, it got my hair smooth and relatively straight, but it did nothing to fight the humidity that undid my efforts, and was really no more exceptional than anything else I&#x27;ve tried before. So, overall, for me, this Remington flat iron gets a \\&quot;meh\\&quot; for its effectiveness on my dry hair, and a resounding, \\&quot;heck no!\\&quot; on the simple consideration of using it on my wet hair. My stylist has never yet steered me wrong, and, since she&#x27;s a professional that clearly knows what she&#x27;s doing, I&#x27;m not about to ignore her strong warnings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use on wet hair at your own risk!</li>
            <li> Ordered this new Remington model because my old model conched out after about 4 years. I thought that the new S7230 would have to be somehow better...just because it was a newer model, but that is not the case. It takes longer to heat and longer to dry my hair, perhaps it is gentler..that is still left to be seen. It is not very wide, perhaps I need to spend more time becoming accustomed to the way to use it so my bangs lay flat. I was just so attached to the one that stopped working that it is hard to accept this new one. It is fine and I am not unhappy; just can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have a fantastic straightening iron that I love but have to dry my hair most of the way prior to using it so when I saw Remington was making a Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron I jumped at the chance to cut down on hair styling time.  I was thrilled with the heat setting options (you can make it super hot or low heat depending on how wet/dry your hair is while using the iron).  I first tried the iron on wet/towel dried hair and it did nothing other than heating my hair, I then used it on dam, partially dried hair and again found that it did not straighten my hair the way my Chi does - it made it damp and frizzy but flat.  When I used the iron on mostly dry hair, the way I used my Chi, it worked MUCH better but still not as well as my other iron.  This iron is great for those who will use it on mostly dry hair and do not want to spend a lot of money on an iron - having used another iron previously, I was left unimpressed with the Remington as I found it did nothing for wet or damp hair and did not work as well as my other iron on mostly dry hair but it did straighten it and did work at that stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;honestly, I would suggest spending a bit more and having an iron that works really well and lasts a loooong time.</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener.  Just make sure you read the instructions first.  It has a little more to it than just turning it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this straightener on wet hair.  I know it sounds great, but I did scald my hair in several places after using it on my wet hair.  BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> It works great.  My daughter&#x27;s hair looks beautiful.  It is very simple to use and has a large variety of heat settings for wet or dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have extremely thick, curly hair. Neither of us had any luck with this flat iron. It didn&#x27;t completely dry or straighten our hair (but it did make our hair smell really gross). I found that it&#x27;s less time consuming and far more effective to blow dry my hair and then use a traditional flat iron. It may work on thin wavy hair; I wouldn&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Recomendado 100%, deja el cabello en segundos liso,el producto lleg&amp;oacute; perfectamente, a tiempo y la calidad del empaque es buena, tal cual la publicaci&amp;oacute;n .</li>
            <li> I had a chi and it finally broke after years of having it. I reluctantly bought this and I love it. I have super thick hair and I love being able to style my hair damp before it get out of control.</li>
            <li> I accidentally threw away (dont ask) the original Wet2Straight iron i had for years.  I LOVED that thing.  I ordered this one without hesitation because i had faith that it would work as good as the old one.. and i didnt want to have to research a million products or spend a ton of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed at all.  This iron is great!!  I actually thought i&#x27;d have a hard time adjusting to it because it was a different shape than the original, but I didnt.  It leaves my hair super smooth, even better than the original.  It&#x27;s lighter so its easier to use especially because my hair it to my waist and it takes a lot of work to straighten.  The best thing about this upgrade is the moved the on/off button to the inside, so i dont shut it off accidentally anymore when i&#x27;m doing my hair.  I also find that this works better on my damp/wet hair than the original (which i only liked to use on dry hair) it leaves it super straight and no extra frizz from the vent steam like i found with the original.  The vents on this one are wider and push the steam away from the hair faster/farther so there is no frizz issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with this purchase and the changes/improvements that Remmington made.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has the old one, or anyone who wants a cheap flat iron that works wonders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky, but I expected more out of this straightener. It works well and fast as a dryer, and does minimize damage and leave your hair healthy. However, it&#x27;s a sucky straightener and I had to use my other one once my hair was dry. I don&#x27;t suggest buying it unless you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to blow-drying.</li>
            <li> I bought this, and it broke after a month. While it was functioning, it worked great. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is worth the investment though.</li>
            <li> It works great. It was also an add on item and the price was fantastic more than ten dollars less than in the store.</li>
            <li> I used to have a [[ASIN:B000F5DRCS Conair Tourmaline Ceramic Straightener with Straightening Comb, Red, 2 Inch]]. I used it a few times a week for about 3 years. I never really loved it but it was the first straightener I ever owned and it did a decent enough job. Well, last week it kicked the bucket. I&#x27;m not really sure what happened but one morning while I was getting ready for work the \\&quot;ready\\&quot; light just kept flashing so I picked it up to feel if it was hot and maybe the light or sensor was broken but the iron was cool to the touch. I spent half the morning on Amazon looking for a new one that would be both affordable and a good reviewed product. I narrowed it down to a handful of them and then I headed out to the stores to see what I could find that same day so I wouldn&#x27;t be without one. I ended up finding this one at Target for basically the same price (even if it was much more, Target price matches now). The next morning I did my normal routine of showering and letting my hair air dry while I had my coffee and breakfast and watched the news (about an hour total). When it was time to use the straightener I was pleased with how quickly it heated up. Then once I started using it I was shocked by the amount of steam that came from my damp hair! My old straightener, though it also was supposed to be for use with wet hair, NEVER did anything like that! I could literally see it not only straightening my hair but also extracting the water from it at the same time. The soy hydra complex coated plates really seem to help keep my hair from getting fried and it leaves it soft and shiny. I don&#x27;t really know though if the comparison to my old one shows that this one is a fantastic product or just that my old was so bad. I was kind of torn whether to give it 4 stars or 5. I ultimately decided on 5 stars because I love it and it really does what it claims to do. I&#x27;ve tried it with my hair barely towel dried and almost dripping wet and while it definitely takes longer to get a good result, it still absolutely works as it says it will. With my hair as damaged as it already is (colored and fine), being able to skip the blow drying step should really help it on the road to recovery. I&#x27;ve had several \\&quot;good hair days\\&quot; using this product and that warrants the 5 star review more than anything in my book!good result, it still absolutely works as it says it will.

            <li> This is a big improvement over my Old flat iron, which I Loved.  unfortunately, when my old one died I was forced to find a replacement fast and this has been fantastic so far.  The instant on really save me time in the morning and it works like a straightener should.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on wet hair yet but will update this when I do.</li>
            <li> this was exactly what the recipient wanted. The width is a hard to find one and this one is perfect for her needs.</li>
            <li> I just love this thing. It leaves my hair feeling soft and fantastic! I am so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I Love this hair straightener, it works perfect with wet or dry hair. And the price iS fair enough :-)</li>
            <li> I really appreciate having this product because it eliminates the need to blow-dry my hair after I take a shower. I have NEVER liked to do this, so I&#x27;m really glad I have this now. It heats up quickly and is easy to use. It makes my hair really hot but it only takes a couple of strokes to completely dry. It works pretty well on dry hair too, it straightens with one or two strokes depending on the heat setting. Definitely reccomend :)</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair but its thin, the only way I used to get volume and sleek look was when I blow-dried then straightened it. Now I only blow dry my roots to give volume and then use this. I advise you use a very good heat protectant or oil. I only use this about 2 times a month because my hair can only take so much. I got rid of my regular straightener and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first using this when my hair was wet, but it worked great!  I use it everyday and have had many compliments on my hair.  I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> good for fast straightning</li>
            <li> great for the price:) Use on wet or dry hair-worth the price compared to salon flat irons. You can use on thick or thin hair without damage.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about buying a $27 wet to dry flat iron.  I bought it because of all the great reviews on here, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It&#x27;s a matter of debate as to whether it really saves time, but it does dry my hair and makes it much less frizzy that my other ridiculously expensive flat iron.  I love it!  My expensive flat iron has been down graded to the bottom of my appliance drawer!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about using this, but for my hair it works great! I have somewhat thick wavy hair. It&#x27;s above my shoulders, so it may take longer if you have long hair.I let my hair air dry a bit so it wasn&#x27;t dripping. You have to go over each piece a few times, but my hair has remained super straight all day. I would normally have to blow dry first, which would cause me to sweat. This takes out the whole blow drying step. It&#x27;s really amazing! I bought this at Walgreen&#x27;s and it was a little more expensive there. The outside plate right above the groove for your hand can get hot, so be careful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that using this iron on wet hair might make coarse hair (like mine) a little frizzly, but I usually use it with dry or only slightly damp hair, and I&#x27;m pleased with the results. My daughter uses it both with wet and dry hair, and she&#x27;s delighted with it. I&#x27;ve found that it performs well on my dry hair, heats up quickly, and is easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tool!  I have had fairly long hair for most of my life, and the one thing I have always hated to do is to blow dry!  Now, I no longer have to!  I wash my hair, towel dry it, then let the Wet to Straight iron do its magic! No fuss, no muss!  Once you learn how to use it properly, without burning your scalp with the steam (I did it a few times before I noticed what I was doing wrong!), then it&#x27;s all good from there.  I highly recommend this tool to anyone with longer hair, especially if you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t like to blow dry!</li>
            <li> Great iron, heats up fast and leaves my hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Eh.  It wasn&#x27;t a *bad* iron.  It did the job as well as others I&#x27;ve tried.  But the results didn&#x27;t *wow* me.  In fact, I ended up stashing it in the closet somewhere and have misplaced it.  Would I buy this one again?  No.  Though I don&#x27;t have heavy buyer&#x27;s remorse.  It&#x27;s just so-so....</li>
            <li> This iron works surprisingly well for the price!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter last Christmas and she loves it.  I have tried it as well and it leaves your hair soft and very straight!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the best! No need to buy the expensive stuff. My hair is curly and my daughter&#x27;s is kinky coily curls and this almost gets our hair pin straight. I take this everywhere.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has been wanting a flat iron for a long time but could never find the right one. When I saw thia one I got it for her. She was very excited to learn she didn&#x27;t have to blowdry her hair before using it. It straightens her hair with ease. And it is much more durable than irons she has had in the past.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister in law who has very long, curly hair. This straightens her hair well and doesn&#x27;t even look like she has curly hair! She loves it.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this iron about once a week.  She says it does a good job and her only comments were that it is difficult to get it close to the hair roots, and that the outside gets quite hot.  Still she likes it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of wet 2 straight flat irons. I&#x27;ve had many. They all cost about the same, and all generally work as advertised with little variation. The Remington S7230 offers just a bit more. With it&#x27;s temperature dial, I no longer have to worry about frying my hair (a major concern with wet irons). Higher temps for straight out of the shower hair, lower temps for partially dried hair. Easy. Especially since by the time I&#x27;m half done with my hair, the remaining hair needs a lower temperature anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron also advertises a Soy Hydra complex on the plates. Personally I didn&#x27;t see much difference with the complex, but it didn&#x27;t hurt either. Smooth plates, no snags, but that&#x27;s not usually a concern with wet hair anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite flat iron!</li>
            <li> When I needed to buy a new straightener, I bought this one thinking it would work well.  It has far exceeded my expectations.  With the Remington Wet 2 Straight flat iron, I get stick straight hair and it doesn&#x27;t give me split ends or do damage to my hair.  It effectively straightens my mop of hair in just a few minutes instead of others that have taken me over an hour to use.</li>
            <li> It does not really works very well on wet hair and my hair looked so horrible after using this product..i ended up returning this item.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves it.</li>
            <li> easy to use,no piroblem with it,got it on time,would buy again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It does amazing things to my hair better than any much higher priced flat iron has (i.e. Chi), my sister used it on my hair (I have very long hair and need help sometimes with it) and was so impressed she wanted one...so I ordered her one simliar and hope she likes it just as much as I do mine.  I have very thick hard to control naturally wavy hair that frizzes very easily.  With this iron I&#x27;ve not had any of the static problems I have with the expensive chi and am very happy with my affordable choice this time around.  It arrived quickly and well packaged and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace myh old flat iron that coujld only be used on dry hair.  Seems to work well but need to be aware of settings</li>
            <li> This thing gets VERY hot! I love that you have several settings and it does good on wet hair. However, I don&#x27;t use it for that. I rather blow dry and then straighten. The only con is that it leaves a smell on your hair due to the material that the straightener is made from. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months and the smell is still present.</li>
            <li> Have had it for over a year works perfect !</li>
            <li> Great on dry hair but on damp hair if u dont go through quick enough it will fry your ends!</li>
            <li> Great product, it is as advertised.  Good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> i had the same brand product earlier the pearl finish one i gave to my sis in law as she liked it n thn ordered this one as its grt for price n does a grt job in only few minutes ...go for it guyss</li>
            <li> I love this straightener I towel dry my hair and straighten. My hair seemed to&lt;br /&gt;Be healthier after using this for a year. will be ordering another soon for a friends birthday!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.  My other straighteners left my hair fuzzy - not this one.  It is great.  Leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Good product and service.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for all.</li>
            <li> I can only rate my experience with this product by what happened when I opened the box. There was no &amp;#34;Remington&amp;#34; packaging as described in the pictures when I initially purchased it. It was bubble wrapped and dirty (like it was previously used) I purchased this item new. I am returning it. Hopefully I can find a better seller.</li>
            <li> I recently threw out my $129.00 chi iron for this! This hair iron does my below shoulder hair length in TEN minutes!!!! It has to be the best hair iron I have own!!! I also love how you only have to go over the hair twice! Its perfect and unbelievable! You also cannot beat the price! I am in love!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this one time since I received it a month ago. It&#x27;s a waist of money! I&#x27;ll probably never use it again. It took about an hour to even semi- straiten my hair, then I just ended up using my old one anyway!! This one won&#x27;t grab onto the hair, very flimsy!! I&#x27;m done ording off of Amazon. This is the 4th thing I waisted money on that I&#x27;ll never use again.</li>
            <li> I was eyeing this on Amazon and actually got it for $17 on sale at Walgreens last weekend.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great tool to add to anyone&#x27;s cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Korean and have thick coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;I hate blow drying my hair because I just end up a hot sweaty (literally) mess and by the time I&#x27;m finished I&#x27;m too hot to use a straightener or curler to smooth it out and just go with it.&lt;br /&gt;With this I shower, brush my teeth, get my clothes laid out, dabble a little here and there...then start in on my hair.  I read the reviews of the importance of using smaller sections of hair and going VERY SLOW.  I go slow waiting for the sizzle to stop before sliding any more.  I will admit, the sizzle of hair totally freaked me out at first but I keep telling myself that it&#x27;s being steamed and not fried.&lt;br /&gt;It does take longer than just blow drying in itself...but saves on time of blow drying plus flat ironing.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite straightener. I&#x27;ve own many in the past and I wish I would of come across this one sooner. Heats up in seconds. Gets very hot. Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and makes it very nice and straight.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for college so I wouldn&#x27;t annoy anyone with my hair dryer and it is perfect. I can wash my hair and quickly flat iron and dry my hair at the same time. I actually take less time now doing my hair, as long as you follow the directions (orange light for dry hair up to setting &amp;#60;20-25, and green light for wet hair beyond 25&amp;#62;) then you will be fine. I barely use the highest heat setting even with wet hair because it gets really hot just on setting 20. I would recommend using a heat protectant too but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> Runs through my hair really smoothly. Being a bigger barrel it doesn&#x27;t take me as long to do my hair anymore. I have really thick hair and this is a plus. It takes awhile to use on wet hair, it does dry it but doesn&#x27;t really save me any more time than it did when I used a blow dryer and straightener. It does get really hot so be careful, but I love that!</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my wife and she loves it.  Makes her hair look so professionally done.  Worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I purchase this 5 months ago and it&#x27;s really on fire when I iron my curly thick hair and makes my hair perfectly straight and shiny!!! I love it though I spend almost 150 purchasing it... But now it&#x27;s so cheap I will absolutely order more hehehhe.... I love it!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this straightener because I had previously tried a wet to dry straightener and it just made my hair really frizzy, but this is the real deal!</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for my old purple digital Wet 2 Straight flat iron. I have to admit I was a little nervous about getting this version, as they&#x27;ve replaced the original tourmaline with the soy hydra complex, and the easy to read/comprehend digital display and buttons with a twisting temperature dial and power switch (which appeared to me like it would be more difficult/complex to use than a digital display). However, I bit the bullet and went ahead with it since I did really love the original so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one really is an improvement over the original. I no longer have any issues with getting hair caught in the plates if it gets turned the wrong way, problems with indentations from the vents has somehow been reduced (or maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m experienced with this particular type of flat iron now), and it feels a lot more heavy, solid, and well constructed than the original did, too. The dial hasn&#x27;t really had any learning curve at all to it, much to my surprise. At first I was a little confused on how to switch it between &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; modes, but this has actually been greatly simplified from the digital version so that it&#x27;s just a matter of dialing in the right temperature, with the light turning green for wet and amber for dry. Something I would like to note though with this that was present in the digital version - there&#x27;s no distinguishing between what temperatures are best for what hair types on the wet and dry settings. Fortunately for me, I already knew from the original that the best setting was likely right in the middle for my damp hair, and so I was easily able to get it on the same level as before by turning it to 15. If you have no idea for your own hair, I can say usually 15 is the best place to start for any hair type. At worst, you may not get the straightest results or it may take an extra long time to do, but it&#x27;s very unlikely that setting will fry anyone&#x27;s hair unless perhaps it&#x27;s EXTREMELY baby fine, and even then I&#x27;m sure it would take more than one attempt... hopefully before you go through multiple attempts you&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s making your hair way too dry though and dial it down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soy hydra complex surprisingly seems to do an even better job at smoothing hair than the original tourmaline did. I found I didn&#x27;t need to use nearly as much hair product to get silky smooth results as I did with the tourmaline version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to use this on damp hair is to press the iron down on each section until the sizzling noise comes to an *almost* complete stop (don&#x27;t worry if it&#x27;s not completely silent, the last little bit of moisture will vaporize away on its own as your hair cools), then inch it forward a little bit by bit to the tips. I just wanted to note that because I noticed a lot of reviewers saying they do multiple passes. This doesn&#x27;t get nearly as flat results as doing just one pass, and it concerns me a little that multiple passes may involve exposing your hair to more heat than necessary. Also, I&#x27;ve found being able to gauge it by the sound of the sizzling (which can only be done on the first pass) helps prevent completely cooking all of the moisture in your hair, leaving the optimal amount of moisture behind to help keep it healthy and frizz free (helpful for those of us that normally can&#x27;t use dry heat styling on our hair due to how much moisture it takes out of it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, note that you will get vastly better and healthier results relying on oil based protective hair products than you will silicone based ones (hair oil, hair dressing, etc) if you have curly, dry, damaged, and/or ethnic hair. You can mix these with a little silicone serum as well to increase their durability in high humidity. NEVER flat iron hair that hasn&#x27;t been treated with some form of protective product first, though, no matter your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And... if you have always wanted to flat iron your hair, but have issues with dry heatstyling, DEFINITELY give this flat iron a try on damp hair! You most likely won&#x27;t be disappointed! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted... it does best on DAMP hair, not WET hair, so make sure you towel dry your hair well prior to usage. ;)styling, DEFINITELY give this flat iron a try on damp hair!

            <li> was really excited about the straightener its ok so far.. Gets really hot which is good but does make your hair very frizzy. Also makes your hair static. I guess you get what you pay for. Ok for the price lets see how long it lasts ..</li>
            <li> after a while the iron turns itself off and the expected results are not obtained.after a while the iron turns itself off and the expected results are not obtained.</li>
            <li> I tried soooo hard not to have to buy a flat iron. I purchased a lot of different products to get the frizzies and fly-a-ways under control. They have my hair moisturized and soft as it&#x27;s ever been, but they can&#x27;t replace a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to Amazon to read customer reviews to help me decide what would best meet my needs. Thanks to all those that left reviews! I decided on the Remington Wet 2 Straight flat iron and I made the right choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love not having to dry it and having all that long thick hair to do another process on. I divvy it into small sections and use the flat iron and watch the steam rise up and away. I use a comb to keep the hair taught and tangle free as I pass the flat iron over it. Leaves my hair frizzy free, fly-a-ways under control, shinny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight and dry with little effort! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter who loves to style her hair.  I was intrigued by the idea that you can straighten hair while it was wet.  This Iron really comes thru.  It does straighten wet hair better than dry.  For a girl with thick coarse hair this has been great.  Don&#x27;t get the soy thing, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that.  Good price and fast shipping.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My college friend and roommate had one of these, and I&#x27;ve always wanted to try it out myself. My hair is pretty naturally straight already, so I can&#x27;t review the quality of this as a straightening iron. I love using this to dry my hair though. I&#x27;m usually pretty lazy about styling my hair and let it air dry. But that means sometimes running into our New England snowy winters with still damp hair, which is never a good mix. I&#x27;ve never been one to use the hair dryer more than twice a year because the hot air usually makes my body temp too hot, esp after a shower, and I just hate all the noise a dryer makes. This works as a great alternative to a dryer. I&#x27;ve just given mine to my sister, who&#x27;s used to blow drying her hair on a regular basis, but she&#x27;s just had twins, so this should be a good alternative for her as well, given the relatively low noise level of it. I&#x27;ll be ordering another for myself!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I have ordered online. I was hesitant to order because I&#x27;ve had bad buy&#x27;s with other seller but this flat iron is amazing and worth the money</li>
            <li> I was kinda scared at first because I have fine, easily damaged hair.  But this works great on damp hair.  I blow dry it a bit first, then use the flat iron.  Very smooth, very quick and it hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair.  Saves me time and using it on damp hair makes it smoother and straighter than I can get it when I flat iron it dry.  I&#x27;m hooked and won&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot. The plates don&#x27;t have that gold protective stuff on it, so using heat protective spray on your hair is a must must must</li>
            <li> I doubted this iron would work on my type of hair (thin, soft, course hair), wet or dry, but it really straightens my hair the way I would like it 2 be.</li>
            <li> Did not work on wet hair well at all. I had borrowed an older model (same brand) and it worked great so I bought this one but I only used it once and was very disappointed in results.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, past my shoulders, it&#x27;s very thick. My hair is dark brown and the bottom is processed (ombre - blondish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Defrizzes my sometimes frizzy hair and split ends.&lt;br /&gt;- Shines amazingly - no additional product required but heat protectant can be used.&lt;br /&gt;- I used to blow dry and then straighten my hair -- what a pain. Now I just lightly blow dry my roots then straight to this.&lt;br /&gt;- My hair feels lighter and soft.&lt;br /&gt;- the 2&amp;#34; plate makes things go faster!!&lt;br /&gt;- the price for the product is pretty damn awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt; - Can not bring this close enough to scalp without the steam burning it, thus making it difficult to dry at the root - I have to lightly blow dry the roots before using this product. There should be a steam guard that can be placed on one of the sides, so that when it comes out and it&#x27;s close to the head, it can be deflected away from the skin/scalp.&lt;br /&gt;- it does not dry my hair in one use. I have to go over each section of hair TWICE in order for it to get dry, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;- My processed ombre ends can still look a little fried/split after using this. If I curl it with a separate curling iron it looks fine, otherwise if I want it pin straight I have to add product afterwards. Also would be nice if this one had a little more rounded body so that I could easily give a gentle curl/curve to my ends instead.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say anything negative about this flat iron...it&#x27;s cheap and it is so great to be able to skip the blow drying step! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and my hair feels great, doesn&#x27;t seem too dry at all. It heats up within 60 seconds for the wet hair setting and even faster for the dry hair setting (lower number on the dial). I was really skeptical because I also own a Revlon flat iron and it CONSTANTLY pulled my hair but this flat iron doesn&#x27;t pull AT all. Very quality item. I love it and I have gotten tons of compliments on my hair!! I have naturally very curly hair and it flattens it perfectly and it doesn&#x27;t take long at all (my hair is chin length). Try this...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I needed a new straightener, and since I genuinely dislike blow drying my hair and then straightening it, I decided to give this particular model a try. I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but after one use, I am VERY SATISFIED that I purchased this! However, I would only recommend this to someone with thin hair such as myself. If you have thicker hair, look elsewhere. I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers mention that this doesn&#x27;t straighten their hair very well, and I&#x27;ve seen videos of people with thicker hair use this, and I agree. This works best on people with thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was very unnerved to use this on my wet hair, because I did not want it to do anything beyond the scope of what a normal flat iron will do. So I dried my hair to where it was semi damp and I sectioned everything off and prepared to straighten. Let me state that I did not use any sort of heat protectant (although, you normally should) just to see how well the soy conditioners worked and if it&#x27;d really leave my hair as the description promised it would. During the entire process, it took maybe two strokes for the iron to dry the different sections of my hair. TWO STROKES! It wasn&#x27;t a little dry, sort of dry, it was dry. I continued doing so, but I was nervous as I was still worried about any sort of extreme damage that could&#x27;ve been being done to my hair. However, as I finished and brushed through my hair once more, it was PERFECTLY FINE. Nothing was fried or damaged, there were no flyaways, but most importantly, my hair was very sleek and smooth. The soy conditioners (while not very strong I will admit) definitely do work, and they do soften your hair and give it a bit of shine. I wouldn&#x27;t rely solely on them, and I still would recommend using a heat protectant, but they do work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only minor issue with this flat iron is that it does give off a funky sort of smell if applied to wet hair. If you apply it to dry hair, it&#x27;s scentless. Other than that, it&#x27;s very lightweight and itheats up at a reasonable pace and it does get very hot! Overall, good straightener for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I really had low expectations for this product, but as someone who has long, thick, and slightly wavy hair I was curious to try a product that could potentially eliminate a step in the hair process!  I have usually used a 1 in straightener, but I really appreciated having the 2 in with all the hair I do have.  After using the straightner for a couple of weeks, I do not see any damage to my hair which I was concerned about, especially since I was using it on wet hair.  It does warn you that it will make a hissing sound on wet hair, but that is OK. I was grateful to know that ahead of time, but you should squeeze out as much excess water as possible.  It heats up fast and turns off automatically which are two nice features.  I do not think that it cuts down on too much time for me, which is the biggest drawback, but my hair did feel pretty soft and straight which I liked.</li>
            <li> So my wife had wanted a new flat iron for a while now.  Her old yet expensive flat iron just wasn&#x27;t giving her the same results that she had enjoyed in the past, so I had my eye open for one and then I found the S7230.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was very excited to get the new iron; there were a few things she liked right out of the box.  The cord is nice and long, there is no constantly turning around to use the iron while in front of the mirror in the bathroom, also the cord angles off the side at the end of the iron so she doesn&#x27;t get tangled in it as well.  The iron also is not heavy, which can be a problem with older irons, pretty light weight actually; it even surprised me, and related to that the iron felt good in her hand.  My wife has relatively small hands and this handled well in her hands easy to hold and not too bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In actual use the flat iron worked great.  It heats up superfast so no need to worry about letting it sit out and pre-heat.  It does get hot, much hotter than my wife&#x27;s old flat iron; the box says up to 425 degrees I believe it.  My wife had never used to wet to dry iron before so there was a little bit of a learning curve.  Mainly that the hot iron and wet hair produces a lot of stream, so be care not to steam your ears off.  My wife thinks she steam cleaned her ears a few times by getting the hair and iron a little too close maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were great though.  Her hair came out very shiny (Her favorite thing), straight and dry.  She is very happy with the flat iron as it does cut out having to dry her hair out before flattening it.  She likes it and wants to get one for my sister-in-law now.  So based on my wife&#x27;s input I recommend this flat iron.  If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment and I will be happy to try and respond.</li>
            <li> i got the new hair straight flat iron of reminginton s2730, on the first day i pulged into switch board, i got a burned smell &amp; fumes coming out of the machine... here i have a 2 questions .. amazon mailed me low &amp; degraded quality product .... remington manufacture problem... please dnt buy this product..</li>
            <li> Remington S7230 Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron with Soy Hydra Complex, 2 Inch is as close to perfect as I have gotten so far with a flat iron. I use this iron every day, and my hair stays straight and healthy. No split ends and my hair does not feel rough or damaged from the flat iron. Additionally, I can use it right after the shower while my hair is still damp.</li>
            <li> I love everything about my Remington Wet 2 Straight iron.  It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair but leaves it very soft and shiny.  My hair is very fine and thin and this iron seems to give my hair more body.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and very comfortable in your hand.  I have never used an iron like this before so I was very leary about trying this. I have used a curling iron but always ended up burning my hair.  No problem for this excellent product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice to finally have a straightener that allows me to straighten my hair while wet/damp - unfortunately, it turns out so frizzy that it&#x27;s really not helpful to my appearance until the next day when my natural hair oils have taken over and given me that silky shine I like.  I have very thick, dry hair and this dries it out even more.  Regardless, with a little Moroccan oil I can probably combat that problem.  I suspect this would work well on someone who has normal or oily hair.</li>
            <li> Love this! Works great! Much better than expected! Leaves hair super straight and shiny!</li>
            <li> I have only had my new flat iron for 3 weeks now but I love it. I use it everyday. I still use the hair dryer but keep my hair a tiny bit damp then use the iron. It leaves my hair very soft and healthy looking (No frizzing at all).</li>
            <li> So far, I love it. I usually towel dry andthenlet my hair air dry while eating breakfast. This is so nice because it cuts time from blow drying, the straightening. I can&#x27;t use gels in my hair that fight fizziness or to smooth it as it just makes my hair look like I dumped oil on it. This gives my hair a nice smooth, soft finish in half the time, if not more. It&#x27;s a great price too.</li>
            <li> Totally happy with this item, it works well, easy to use and does not pull on your hair. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of looking before finally buying a flat iron. The wet to straight doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well on my extremely thick hair but does fantastic on my daughter&#x27;s hair and mine when it is dry.</li>
            <li> I love it, is just what i was looking great product, will recommend to any one that want some great Iron</li>
            <li> I Loved this straightner from the first time i used it. My hair is very curly, long &amp; hard to tame.</li>
            <li> it smells like chemicals.</li>
            <li> The gauge is so flimsy that it turns on its own while I&#x27;m doing my hair so sometimes my hair will smell burnt sometimes I&#x27;m wondering why my hair isn&#x27;t getting straight. It can be annoying.</li>
            <li> great product, irons hair very well. easy to maneuver, and excellent heat settings. good for long hair and short hair</li>
            <li> It works and it automatically shuts off.  That&#x27;s what I needed.  I was tired of driving to work paranoid that I didn&#x27;t shut it off.  Now, I don&#x27;t have to worry.  Don&#x27;t set on bedding, etc.  It will burn and discolor fabric.</li>
            <li> In general, i recommend any remington wet2straight. Ive been usign them for years - the only reason i needed to buy this one was because i lost my last!</li>
            <li> Not a good experience with this straightener. Been using it for about two months now and noticed my hair is much more damaged (and I don&#x27;t even use it for the wet to straight function because I know that&#x27;s terrible for your hair). Hair gets caught and rips. I don&#x27;t know if mine was just faulty, but the temperature control was loose and causes the temperature to turn up (way too hot) while using it. I contacted Remington customer service and they are letting me send it back for a full refund, thankfully. They also offer a 60 day money back guarantee for anyone who is dissatisfied (but buyer usually has to pay return shipping), so at least there&#x27;s that. Would not recommend, though.</li>
            <li> This flat iron exceeded my expectations for the price.  It works great on wet hair.  My hair is difficult to straighten and I actually like this one better than my daughter&#x27;s expensive one.  It does a much better job.</li>
            <li> Great hair straightener for a great price</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. I don&#x27;t know more than that. I try to stay away from the bathroom when she&#x27;s using it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair iron. It leaves my hair soft, shiny and suoer straight.&lt;br /&gt;I finish my hair in less time than ever. I love this hair iron best buy i have ever done!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this hair iron to anyone who wants to buy it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this yesterday and I didn&#x27;t really expected alot but since I needed a styling iron i just said YOLO and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, IT WORKS. just read the instruction thoroughly. Other comments I see is that &amp;#34;BE CAREFUL OF THE STEAM&amp;#34; etc etc... and they give like 2 stars because they got burned from the steam or got too close to the scalp. EVEN ON THE INSTRUCTION IT SAYS BE CAREFUL AND USE THE STEAM AWAY FROM UR HEAD. One other tip I would like to give is when you use this straightener, couple water will drip when you flat it so make sure those hot water drips dont get on ur skins. It is hot. so let it drip on a towel u lay it out or mats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;;] IT WORKS. worth the money tbh.</li>
            <li> not heat well, do not get the result you desire. I let the straw hair,. I get better results with my old flat iron, it was more economical than this</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.  Can be used on dry , damp or wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;On very wet hair, fresh out of the shower, one time is not sufficient --  you must use it several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have wavy hair and this product made my hair nice and straight and gave it body.  Heats up very quickly and the soy lotion makes hair smooth.  Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I decided to get the Remington Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron for my oldest daughter who is a pro at straightening her hair every morning. I figured this item would allow her to cut her morning routine time down since it purports to do both dry and straighten. She used it a few times and has given me her final verdict:  All right. Not outstanding, but good.  The report is that it does, indeed, straighten while drying, but her biggest complaints were about the straightening part itself. She felt the design did not allow her to get to the roots of her very thick hair so they were not straightened as much as she would like. She definitely felt like it worked as far as the drying went, but overall her experience with the straightening portion was not anything special. So while I can recommend this product, I would say it&#x27;s with the reservation that those with very thick hair might find the straightening portion to be less than they&#x27;d hoped, particularly when it comes to the part close to the head.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and instructions were understandable. Hair came out looking great. Reasonable price for the product.  Works on damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I bought two for Christmas. Both my daughters love it. Warms quickly and leaves hair silky and soft. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Ty works great  very very satisfied. I will order from u all again soon.</li>
            <li> I love it for the price! To me it&#x27;s used as a hair dryer, it takes too long to straighten my hair with this but it drys it much better than a blow dryer. I then have to use my babybliss straightener to finish it up.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try this at first,  but always in search of an appliance or product to tame my naturally curly,  gets frizzy in the rain hair,  I had to try it.  So Happy that I did!  Now,  I can&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s like to have a Bad Hair Day!&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Be sure to stock up on tbe heat protectant for your Hair&#x27;s sake and let your &amp;#34;Freak Flag Fly&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; ( a quote from the Broadway production HAIR.)</li>
            <li> I love it. Straightens great and leaves a sleek finish. (:</li>
            <li> This heats fast, works great and it does not take long to cool down. Does a great weather my hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what Soy Hydra complex means, but what I received was damaged dry ends with a crispy look. I have medium length wavy hair, with layers in the front that I like to keep straight and angled out of my face. I typically wear my hair up with the layers/bangs down in front, so I looking for a relatively inexpensive straightener and was drawn to this model because of the wet to straight option. I tried using the product according to the instructions with the heat on high for wet to damp hair and began straightening my bangs, this left my hair looking dry and fried at the ends. Giving the benefit of the doubt I tried it again with my hair dry on a lower setting same results but with even less control. I tried it a third time with moderately damp hair on a medium to lower setting hoping this would work and again I was disappointing my front layers look damaged and fried. Even when I straightened all of my hair I got the same results of stiff crispy hair. I&#x27;ll be returning this product and purchasing a deep condition keratin product to fix the damage that has been done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a another note the packaging was also a nightmare to open and to repackage without trying to destroy the box.</li>
            <li> i love it. i just wish it had a digital screen for heat settings and a beep for when ita heated.</li>
            <li> I had an old flat iron and was probably about 4 in. This 2 in flat iron was the largest I&#x27;ve been able to find. It sound great because I could save time by not having to completely dry my hair first. But in the long run it was very very damaging to my hair! It fried the ends of my hair like they were caught on fire and shriveled! I need a new haircut and a new hair style because of it after only 2 weeks of using it. I would never recommend a wet to straight product and absolutely not this one!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this. My old flat iron didn&#x27;t heat properly and took forever to straighten my hair. This Remington flat iron is awesome. It heats up super quick and takes no time at all to straighten my very curly hair. I have also tried it with towel dried hair. It works very well just as described.</li>
            <li> straightens my hair really well.</li>
            <li> this is a great iron..i have very frizzy hair especially when i wash it, it takes me really long to dry my hair and&lt;br /&gt;straighten it. but this iron is amazing on wet hair..i jus towel dry my hair,apply a little bit of hair serum and use&lt;br /&gt;the wet2straight iron, i have to tell its awesome within minutes my frizzy hair turns to smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;i jus love it!  a definite 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> I have the one inch, and it&#x27;s okay.  It does work on my wavy Caucasian hair, but it pulls my daughter&#x27;s biracial curly (black and white) hair.  I don&#x27;t like fixed plates, as there always seems to be a section that doesn&#x27;t quite grip hair, and this one is no different.  However, it could just be my iron.  If you get one that grips well, it does work on wet hair beautifully, but like many have also noted, better to let the hair dry a bit before straightening.  With my daughter&#x27;s hair, it took just as long to blow dry and straighten as it did to use this iron without blow drying, so, since this pulled her hair, what&#x27;s the point?  I keep it in case I want to use it, but for the most part, it sits buried in the bathroom cupboard.  So, this might be okay for you.  We have the Remington S5500 that we use on my daughter&#x27;s hair, and which I highly recommend (and also have a review posted). Don&#x27;t let it&#x27;s low price fool you!  That one works great for both of us!</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is a no frills model. It only has a on/off switch, a two-color light indicator to indicate dial settings (dry, damp and wet hair) and a dial (level 1 - 30) to select the hair condition (dry or damp or wet). So far I have used this only on damp hair, setting the dial to about 23. I am not able to use this close to the hair scalp as the heating element will be touching my hair scalp then. Overall it does both actions simultaneously, that is, drying and straightening my hair at the same time. I do not observe any damage to my hair as yet. I will update this review whenever this is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the price of this product, I would say it does its functions reasonably well.</li>
            <li> This is the second Remmington straightener for my daughter.  She wore the last one out!  I like this one better because the Soy Hydra Complex actually helps to protect her hair.  She uses this almost daily and no &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; hair.  Nice product!!</li>
            <li> My significant other has been using this for about a month, and has no complaints.  It heats up quickly, has solid construction (nice fit and finish), and does the job.  It&#x27;s taken a couple of falls and no damage.</li>
            <li> From my girlfriend&#x27;s mouth:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;This is the first hair straightener I have personally owned. It is very easy to use and comes with detailed instructions. I have only used it on damp hair so far (not full on wet out of the shower) and it dried and straightened it beautifully. I was weary of owning a straightener before, but this product is high quality and true to its promises. I highly recommend it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The smell of it makes me want to throw Its okay though don&#x27;t last as far as it being straight</li>
            <li> I was shocked how well this unit worked. I have always used a very expensive unit prior that cost me $300 and this was purchased on a whim.  It works pretty good and when my hair is still a little damp it straightens it pretty good.  it will work on wet hair as it states but they have to be very thin and small sections at a time so it could take a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months, about 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;S&lt;br /&gt;*Leaves hair shiny and straight.&lt;br /&gt;*Less breakage then using a brush and blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;*Cut my drying time down a lot.&lt;br /&gt;*hair looks great until next time you wash it. Seems to hold the steamed straight look very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s a lot of direct heat...I use it on damp hair now and not wet to cut down on how long it touches my hair. Also you MUST use a heat protecting product.&lt;br /&gt;*Hair is left pretty flat...I prefer more body. I now only use it from about 2 inches from my roots and then just give my roots a quick blow-dry after.&lt;br /&gt;*I have split ends for the first time ever...I use extra heat protection on my roots now.&lt;br /&gt;*you could easily burn yourself with the steam it lets out...it makes a hissing sound too. Takes a little getting use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great invention. great for travelling or drying hair when you have little time (it dries and styles all in one). Gives you good hair days everyday...just protect as best you can from the heat.</li>
            <li> it works good with me and give me results, but i cant take it me when i travel coz it&#x27;s just 110 volt..!</li>
            <li> I had previously owned one of these and loved it!! It lasted me for over 5 years before it got a short in the wire and would no longer work so purchased another brand and HATED IT!! Compared to this one that i was used to it didn&#x27;t work as well and pulled out my hair while using it causing split ends!! After 2 days of using it i immediately got on Amazon to order another Wet 2 Straight!! It is by far the best straighter you can own!! It heats up quickly, has an automatic shut off so you don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving it on and i love the vents that allow you to straighten your hair while wet! It never snags or pulls your hair and I love the new Soy Hydra Complex that the new version offers(my old wet 2 straight one didn&#x27;t have it) It makes your hair look and feel awesome!! This is a must have for anyone!! I would never own another straight iron!! &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love the larger size. Very effective in wet to dry straightening.  Highly recommended.  Only thing that could make it better is an auto shut off afyer 30 mins or hour. Heats up very quickly</li>
            <li> To avoid disappointment, I purchased this straight iron with few expectations. I simply hoped it would work better than my old one. It does. My long hair is unbelievably thick and has a natural wave in it. No product has EVER tamed my hair like this one! It used to take me 30+ minutes to blow dry my hair (no kidding) and then an additional 10 - 15 minutes to curl or straighten. Time consuming to say the least. This product dries and straightens my hair in 10 minutes (15 if I am taking it slow). Be aware that it gets really, REALLY hot - so to prevent damage, be SURE to use a product to protect the cuticle (I cannot emphasize this enough)! I have tried numerous products and the best one I have found so far is Tigi S Factor Silky Smooth serum.  Between the serum and iron, my hair is silky and smooth. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is a little difficult to get it dry closer to the scalp, so you may want to towel dry your scalp more than usual before using the iron. Make sure that you are holding your hand either below or to the side of the steam vents (as the steam rises), as I was quickly reminded just how hot the steam coming from the hair can be (when I forgot). Be sure to also adjust the temperature setting when switching from wet to dry hair. I mistakenly left the iron on it&#x27;s highest setting and tried it on my dry hair. Not smart. The small section that I did looked slightly damaged. Not the irons fault, just my inexperience and not following the directions included with it. I now simply lower the temperature setting when using it on my dry hair and haven&#x27;t had a single issue. Not sure how the soy works - but it does. Hair does not feel greasy or weighed down - just silky and shiny. If this iron ever bites the dust - I will be purchasing a second one in a heartbeat! I may purchase a second one anyway - just because my teenage daughter and I are usually trying to use it at the same time! She loves it even more than I do!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It helps make your hair feel more healthy after using it your hair feels really soft.</li>
            <li> not the easiest to use but it gets the job done, next time we&#x27;ll go for the $50 salon quality ones or the one the next reviewer is talking about below...</li>
            <li> I have previously bought the Remington Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron twice, both lasting a little less than a year, but working fabulously for the time that they worked.  I bought both of them from Walmart for about $25, although that model now costs $42 on walmart.com, and $27 on amazon, and this one apparently the new slightly cheaper model. It definitely works nowhere near as well as this one: http://www.amazon.com/Remington-Straight-Ceramic-Straightening-Tourmaline/dp/B00067YSLO/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1369907608&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;wet+to+dry+flat+iron&lt;br /&gt;the steam vents don&#x27;t appear to work overly well, I had to do 4-5 passes on each section of hair, from only damp, and it left it kinda frazzled. And bear in mind I don&#x27;t have overly thick or wavy hair, I mainly use a flat iron just to seal the hair so it doesn&#x27;t get frizzy, and this one definitely didn&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br /&gt;Addendum- I forgot to mention that this one is a turn dial(the other Wet2Straight is digital), so I was constantly hitting the dial and changing it, but even on the hottest setting(it is supposed to go to 425 degrees), it wasn&#x27;t as hot as the previous one, which is only supposed to go to 410 degrees, but I never used it much past 380 or 390.&lt;br /&gt;So I will definitely be returning this one, and getting the slightly more expensive Wet2Straight Flat Iron(although I am bummed about having to do even that, knowing that it will most likely burn out in a year, like the 2 previous ones did)</li>
            <li> I have an older version of this flat iron I use every day. I bought the new version for my 5th wheel and love it. I will be purchases another one for my cabin!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She had a one inch before and it was ok but it got to where it would stink up the bathroom when she used it so I bought her this one. She says it heats up really fast and gets the job done faster. She doesn&#x27;t have to dry her hair completely when she uses it which she likes and it saves her some time. It&#x27;s been a couple of months now with everyday use and it holding up just fine. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> This iron is really amazing.  My hair feels and is so much healthier! The only problem is getting to my roots, that&#x27;s why I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> very good product, comfortable and affordable. Hair serves grilled to perfection and my mom was very satisfied. worth buying! cool</li>
            <li> Works so nicely on my hair and no damage!</li>
            <li> Love them.Just put weave in curls my hair perfectly</li>
            <li> One of the best straighteners I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely unsatisfied with this iron. It is not making my hair oily or shiny. This iron damage and almost scratching hair!&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really fast though (but usually don&#x27;t really care because they all take relatively short time). Don&#x27;t recommend this item</li>
            <li> Wife uses it everyday!!</li>
            <li> Love it! (But had used a friend&#x27;s before I bought it)</li>
            <li> I usually hate washing my hair, because I know of all the hassle after to get my wavy thick hair pin straight, but this did it in 15 MINUTES, when it usually takes me 45-1hr . Thank you sooooo much :)</li>
            <li> This s supposed to help with frizz but it doesn&#x27;t. It also fried my hair on the lowest setting for the wet to dry.</li>
            <li> First let me say I have waist Legnth, thick blonde hair and I used to blow dry it straight back in the day then use a regular iron to flatten it...horrible I know. But once straighteners began coming out, I purchased the CHI first, since it was widely popular and I wanted it so badly, well it did straighten my hair but not like this one..&lt;br /&gt;I came upon this straightener from my hair stylist of 15 years, she simply stated I needed anything Remington Branded, that they were great so I went on the hunt. When I saw this I thought..&amp;#34;if it can do wet hair then I bet it&#x27;s amazing with dry hair!&amp;#34; So I bought it...that was five years ago and I&#x27;m only on my third ONLY because the one thing you can&#x27;t do is just unplug it. My first and second ones broke within a couple months because I would just leave it in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position and unplug. Well this time I&#x27;ve had my recent one almost two years and make sure to turn it OFF then unplug. Keep the plates clean with just a damp/wet rag while cooled and unplugged.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair just because I want to use as least amount of heat possible on my hair to keep it healthy. So wen I wash it, I simply let it air dry and it gets curly. Then I straighten as it&#x27;s perfect for two days I swear. Minor touching up sometimes like rainy days but other than that it stays gorgeous for two-three days at most.&lt;br /&gt;For even better results, Try Keratin shampoos and conditioners! My favorite by far is TreSemme Keratin Infused Shampoo &amp; conditioners. Around $5 for each bottle but soooo worth it. I don&#x27;t have to use cremes, balms, frizz sprays or anything. Just wash, air dry and straighten!! Best best your money will buy and affordable too!!! I get mine on Amazon and Walmart!</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting this Wet to Dry flat iron to work, but to my surprise it really does. My hair is pretty thick and I do have to dry it some first before using the iron, but once I get the excess water out and it is just damp it really does dry and straighten at the same time. I do have to run it down the section a couple times, but it still works and is gentler than drying my hair dry then using a flat iron. It worked even better for my niece, her hair isn&#x27;t as thick as mine and doesn&#x27;t have any wave at all and it worked even faster for her. She loved it so much, I had to order her one! We both like how fast it heated up and it seemed to cool down relatively quickly. I will say though that I have a friend with very curly natural hair that she straightens and it did not work as well for her, she only experimented with a few sections, but she had to pass the iron through several times to get them completely straight. She uses a much more expensive and hotter iron that works much faster, but her hair is much curlier than mine. I would definitely recommend this Remington flat iron to smooth straight hair and to straighten loose waves though, especially at it&#x27;s very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is as good if not better than the straightener I purchased for my daughter at almost 4 times the cost.  Works great and the results are even better than I expected.  Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> The Remington S7230 Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron with Soy Hydra Complex is a very nice flat iron that leaves your hair feeling smooth and silky. The iron gets hot really fast and within seconds you are ready to straighten and dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an African American so our hair is naturally frizzy and I live in South Florida where humidity is our worst enemy, but this flat iron has given me the necessary tool to combat these obstacles. The ceramic soy infused plates allow you to smooth over your hair and it leaves a glossy sheen. The Remington Flat Iron also dries wet hair and straightens the hair simultaneously. I love this iron because it does four jobs in one, it shines, conditions, straightens, and dries your hair. I have been using this for a couple of months now and it is still as good as the first time. I&#x27;m sure you will love this Flat Iron as much as I have.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really frizzy, and the tips are still curly and won&#x27;t straighten.  I had to go over my hair four times to have it look decent, which sort of defeats the purpose of having a &amp;#34;wet to straight&amp;#34;, which i supposed to save me time.</li>
            <li> Heats Up super fast! And works great! I love it</li>
            <li> I have previously owned three hair straighteners ranging from the fred meyer ones to the helen of troy ceramic straightener and this wet2straight is by far my favorite. For the first time my hair is STRAIGHT not just \\&quot;un-wavy\\&quot; and I LOVE that it has a one hour auto shut off feature. I often forget to turn mine off when I&#x27;m done and this feature has prevented my house from burning down or making the house smell like smoke. I also love the soy hydra complex feature because it makes my hair smooth! I used to have little fly aways on the top of my head from my other straighteners burning pieces off without my noticing but since I&#x27;ve had this straightener I haven&#x27;t had this problem. I also love that there&#x27;s a color flashing indicator on the switch telling me when it&#x27;s set to dry hair or straight hair. I&#x27;ll be honest I didn&#x27;t buy this for the wet to straight feature, but I&#x27;m glad I did it was worth every penny (and considering it&#x27;s not very pricy it was very worth it) I have had it for four months now and have straightened my hair more often than I used to because of how quickly it heats up and how few passes I need to make to straighten my unruly waves.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this product and it was mostly positive so I decided to buy i and glad that I did. It works really good. I live in a very humid area and even though my hair is mostly straight, the humidity makes it frizzy. This flat iron gives my hair a sleek and smooth look and feel and lasts til the next wash. I do use a heat treatment while my hair is still wet to protect it from the heat. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Felt like an electric shock into my scalp. Deeply disappointed.</li>
