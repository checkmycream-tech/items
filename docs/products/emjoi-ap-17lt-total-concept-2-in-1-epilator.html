    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is especially great for underarms, where shaving never quite cut it!  </li>
            <li>The best epilator ever.</li>
            <li>Best ever product</li>
            <li>This is the best hair removal tool I have come across.  </li>
            <li>The Emjoi is an excellent hair remover!!!!</li>
            <li>the lighted tweezers are wonderful</li>
            <li>Love this product!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this!!!  </li>
            <li>love it!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel great</li>
            <li>For under the arms - it works great.</li>
            <li>For the legs and arms - it works great.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this product and would buy another if I needed to do so.</li>
            <li>Now, as for the armpits, it worked great.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work that great</li>
            <li>it works great there.</li>
            <li>But for what I do with it, it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Excellent product received very quickly.  </li>
            <li>and it just does not do a good job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good epilator for the price, but it eats up batteries like candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also does not do good job picking up hairs.</li>
            <li>This works really good.</li>
            <li>I had one of these before and loved it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased w/</li>
            <li>Just kind of a tickling sensation.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is resilient and has a mind of its own, you might want to stick with shaving.</li>
            <li>, I own for years.</li>
            <li>Really nice stuff</li>
            <li>It is made nicely.</li>
            <li>The best Epilator on the market, first I was so concern about if a will handle the pain of using an epilator, reading the review, I was even more concern about it,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT motor, much better than the older, identical version</li>
            <li>I ordered this epilator which is more effective</li>
            <li>Very useful and good quality.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this product.  </li>
            <li>I can judge it better after seeing how it works with her.</li>
            <li>it pulls out most of the hair...not ALL of it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This product is better used on the body than on the face.  </li>
            <li>So much better than tweezing.</li>
            <li>but I have not been able to make it work.  </li>
            <li>It does not get teh finer hairs and misses much more than it gets out.</li>
            <li>Will buy another one and more of their products.</li>
            <li>Over time, it also gets easier since you know what to expect as well as the hair becoming sparser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are the most accurate tweezers ever and the LED light in it makes it insuperable.</li>
            <li>so easy.  </li>
            <li>I strongly reccomend.</li>
            <li>I bought this after my first Epi-Slim died thinking more tweezers, better coverage.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work best on the lighter less course hairs, the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky about being smooth.  </li>
            <li>But this has it too, and a nifty light too.</li>
            <li>For the upper lip - it works great.</li>
            <li>Works great for larger areas that require tweezing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you for making this available.</li>
            <li>LIKE YOU&#x27;RE GETTING READY FOR TORTURE!!!</li>
            <li>before I forget this epilator had a Teewzer with light, is just so cool</li>
            <li>Overall, even though it is not the best chin hair grabber (even when positioning the unit is several directions), I like the unit and am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Gave this one recently to my sister to purchase the corded gold plated version with more tweezers and must say that I love this one more.  </li>
            <li>This product works outstanding and has not failed me.  </li>
            <li>the only thing good is the tweezers with the light on the end.  </li>
            <li>I had to clean it a couple of times before I was done.</li>
            <li>One of the keys I had to figure out on my own is to NOT press against skin too hard - this is more effective if you lightly press against skin, which is counter-intuitive in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>It does not do as good a  job as my smaller one.  </li>
            <li>It does hurt some but works great and lasts longer than other methods I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>highly recomended, pain is not bad at all, I can handle it, I&#x27;m sure you will too&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective at removing smooth hair, like the type found on your arm or on the legs of someone who doesn&#x27;t shave regularly.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that I love it, it does remove some hairs, but not enough that I could give it more than 3 stars.</li>
            <li>Very good :) I highly recommend it to people who have a lot hair and thick stubborn hair.</li>
            <li>Did not work very well but returned it easily.</li>
            <li>I must agree with those who say this unit is not the best at grabbing the hairs on the chin - unless you don&#x27;t mind waiting until the hair on your chin grows out long enough that you are mistaken for your husband.</li>
            <li>it is my second one purchased my daughter took the first one she loved it to.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my face/upper lip to get rid of little hairs that aren&#x27;t welcome.  </li>
            <li>I no longer shave as much and have smooth legs longer.</li>
            <li>- rarely shave - so thought this would maybe work for me.  </li>
            <li>Much more natural looking results than waxing which strips everything in the areas that are waxed.</li>
            <li>And unlike waxing where you pull out big chunks of hair at one time, you can move at your own pace with this.  </li>
            <li>If you have success with waxing products, this will probably work for you.  </li>
            <li>I have had an epilator of this kind for the last 20 years (electric) and it still worked, but rather primitive</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended it to several of my friends; they want one of their own.  </li>
            <li>The epilator works first time, every time, QUICKLY, and no burning hair smell.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little tool !</li>
            <li>However, since the results last much longer than the creams I used to use + takes a LOT less time than tweezing &#x3D; I\\&quot;m happy!  </li>
            <li>It grabs the hairs well, once you are used to it, it doesn&#x27;t hurt (much...there are still some sensitive areas), and it is quick!</li>
            <li>And you have to let your hair grow out pretty substantially before you try to remove it.  </li>
            <li>i better get every penny including shipping refunded back to me!</li>
            <li>Does take some getting used to at first.</li>
            <li>get.;-)</li>
            <li>Okay on my legs, though I really need better light so I can see what its missing and go back over it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather just grab the razor in the shower, that&#x27;s easy enough.</li>
            <li>It does sting a little the first few times you use it but don&#x27;t let that discourage you it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I wish it picked up the fine hair better but at least it is something to use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten my daughter to use her&#x27; much yet..</li>
            <li>Even tweezing i really have to work at getting hairs out.  </li>
            <li>The one thing that is really problematic is that the batteries drain after just one use.  </li>
            <li>, hair don&#x27;t grow that fast, and it even doesn&#x27;t hurt when I depilate.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted an up-to-date modern one.  </li>
            <li>Does not work very well</li>
            <li>I expected a better shave without the pain.</li>
            <li>very time-consuming.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t really feel any pulling</li>
            <li>This epilator is great for facial hair its small</li>
            <li>Bulky, hard to manuver, doesn&#x27;t pluck near as good...</li>
            <li>I mainly use the tweezers.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend the epilator.</li>
            <li>The lighted tweezers is kind of pointless as I find my tweezerman tweezers far more effective, I find it to be a fun, but unnecessary little gadget add-on.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really not much of an inconvenience, and my skin feels so smooth after I do this</li>
            <li>so the hair was more than long enough for this epilator to grab.  </li>
            <li>The only caveat is the batteries run low pretty quickly once it ages which makes for slower pulling of hair.  </li>
            <li>I had a Tweezee for years that finally died, so stupid me thought more money, more tweezer, better product.  </li>
            <li>The chin did not hurt at all as I use waxing and tweeze there, but i had to go over and over and over and over it and still, it left stubble, coarse hair and fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this epilator since 2008, and it still works just as if it were new.  </li>
            <li>Very soft face, and no redness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same model.    </li>
            <li>this is her second one , first one lasted about 5 years.</li>
            <li>This epilator has made it much more easier to remove facial hair but it hasn&#x27;t worked that well for me for other areas.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this epilator on QVC when they were offering a special deal, but it was called \\&quot;Emjoi Total Tweeze,\\</li>
            <li>I bought one for my 11-year old daughter, who recently developed the need to shave.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product!</li>
            <li>I like the natural look of leaving the peach fuzz, if you will and taking out the hairs.  </li>
            <li>But overall, I am very content with the product and my results.</li>
            <li>The epilator is loud and sounds like Im using an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>There can be occasional pain on the upper lip, if not applied properly, needs a light hand I found.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Elderly mom uses it on her face for stray hairs that old ladies</li>
            <li>Nothing like the old epilators that felt like it was taking your skin off with the hair.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it works pretty good although a bit painful...</li>
            <li>Turned out to be a conventional tweezer with a light...about 50 cents worth of material.  </li>
            <li>Even my leg hair (which right now long - winter legs starting already!) and going over and over and over in a patch about 4x4 it removed 80% of the hair -</li>
            <li>legs are so smooth now, no more razors cuts.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>The hairs come back in more slowly since they are being plucked out.    </li>
            <li>Hair grows back more slowly and finer.  </li>
            <li>The light on this doesn&#x27;t work even after installing batteries and the tweezers are hard to remove.  </li>
            <li>So Im constantly changing the batteries even when they are not dead.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the lighted tweezer, very convenient for removing just a single hair.</li>
            <li>The added tweezers that come with it are a little dull, so I still use my own, but no big deal.  </li>
            <li>Plus, once you buy it, it&#x27;ll last a long time, and you only need to put in new batteries every once in a while.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one (the first went missing on a trip, otherwise I know it would still be working).</li>
            <li>it runs down pretty quickly.. not completely off but slower which causes it to not pull the hairs like it should be.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;d rather just grab the razor in the shower, that&#x27;s easy enough.</li>
            <li> It does sting a little the first few times you use it but don&#x27;t let that discourage you it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I wish it picked up the fine hair better but at least it is something to use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten my daughter to use her&#x27; much yet..</li>
            <li> Even tweezing i really have to work at getting hairs out.  </li>
            <li> The one thing that is really problematic is that the batteries drain after just one use.  </li>
            <li> , hair don&#x27;t grow that fast, and it even doesn&#x27;t hurt when I depilate.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted an up-to-date modern one.  </li>
            <li> Does not work very well</li>
            <li> I expected a better shave without the pain.</li>
            <li> very time-consuming.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t really feel any pulling</li>
            <li> This epilator is great for facial hair its small</li>
            <li> Bulky, hard to manuver, doesn&#x27;t pluck near as good...</li>
            <li> I mainly use the tweezers.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend the epilator.</li>
            <li> The lighted tweezers is kind of pointless as I find my tweezerman tweezers far more effective, I find it to be a fun, but unnecessary little gadget add-on.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really not much of an inconvenience, and my skin feels so smooth after I do this</li>
            <li> so the hair was more than long enough for this epilator to grab.  </li>
            <li> The only caveat is the batteries run low pretty quickly once it ages which makes for slower pulling of hair.  </li>
            <li> I had a Tweezee for years that finally died, so stupid me thought more money, more tweezer, better product.  </li>
            <li> The chin did not hurt at all as I use waxing and tweeze there, but i had to go over and over and over and over it and still, it left stubble, coarse hair and fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this epilator since 2008, and it still works just as if it were new.  </li>
            <li> Very soft face, and no redness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly the same model.    </li>
            <li> this is her second one , first one lasted about 5 years.</li>
            <li> This epilator has made it much more easier to remove facial hair but it hasn&#x27;t worked that well for me for other areas.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this epilator on QVC when they were offering a special deal, but it was called \\&quot;Emjoi Total Tweeze,\\</li>
            <li> I bought one for my 11-year old daughter, who recently developed the need to shave.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product!</li>
            <li> I like the natural look of leaving the peach fuzz, if you will and taking out the hairs.  </li>
            <li> But overall, I am very content with the product and my results.</li>
            <li> The epilator is loud and sounds like Im using an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> There can be occasional pain on the upper lip, if not applied properly, needs a light hand I found.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Elderly mom uses it on her face for stray hairs that old ladies</li>
            <li> Nothing like the old epilators that felt like it was taking your skin off with the hair.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works pretty good although a bit painful...</li>
            <li> Turned out to be a conventional tweezer with a light...about 50 cents worth of material.  </li>
            <li> Even my leg hair (which right now long - winter legs starting already!) and going over and over and over in a patch about 4x4 it removed 80% of the hair -</li>
            <li> legs are so smooth now, no more razors cuts.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> The hairs come back in more slowly since they are being plucked out.    </li>
            <li> Hair grows back more slowly and finer.  </li>
            <li> The light on this doesn&#x27;t work even after installing batteries and the tweezers are hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> So Im constantly changing the batteries even when they are not dead.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the lighted tweezer, very convenient for removing just a single hair.</li>
            <li> The added tweezers that come with it are a little dull, so I still use my own, but no big deal.  </li>
            <li> Plus, once you buy it, it&#x27;ll last a long time, and you only need to put in new batteries every once in a while.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one (the first went missing on a trip, otherwise I know it would still be working).</li>
            <li> it runs down pretty quickly.. not completely off but slower which causes it to not pull the hairs like it should be.  </li>
            <li> Works well picks up small hairs and seems to last pretty long, I use it on my arms, it hurts but what do you expect when your pulling out hair.</li>
            <li> so it takes a long time for larger areas.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little to big for those \\&quot;old hag\\&quot; hairs.</li>
            <li> this epilator for the limited facial areas</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first and it was too painful for my legs, but it is a great product for under arms</li>
            <li> Yes it hurts and while a lot of folks say they get used to the minor pain, I&#x27;m apparently not one of them.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to maneuver and hurt to much.</li>
            <li> And I never wanted to wait until the hair was 1/4 inch long in order to wax it.  </li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T REALLY WORK FOR THICK HAIR.</li>
            <li> It really removed VERY few!</li>
            <li> Previously I have waxed my upper lip and this is much less painful and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> It does remove a FEW, VERY few - breaks others (which i can get from shaving!) - and leaves the rest right where they are.  </li>
            <li> It has enabled me to spend less time in the shower shaving with traditional razors that used to leave me with stubble and five o&#x27;clock shadows.  </li>
            <li> : the next day I ended up with small rashy pimples on my upper lip - um EW!</li>
            <li> hair grows back in about a week/ week and a half.  </li>
            <li> If there are any spare hairs left over (usually ones that haven&#x27;t quite surfaced above the skin yet), I just grab them with a tweezer.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked that it removed my armpit hair so easily, but it wouldn&#x27;t remove my facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have to say though I have blond hair and not very hairy.  </li>
            <li> Does not work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as I thought it would (I was mentally prepared for much worse).  </li>
            <li> My wife spent a few dollars extra for the \\&quot;eyebrow feature\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It was a little uncomfortable but not painful to me.</li>
            <li> The process does take longer than shaving due to the fact that you have to continue to pass the machine through an area till all hair is gone.</li>
            <li> I have no intention of trying on other body parts.  </li>
            <li> so I could use them every other week.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s working properly.</li>
            <li> After postage, not worth it.</li>
            <li> I used to use cream removers and found that those were much to irritating to my skin, even though I would use the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; versions of the creams.  </li>
            <li> It helps to keep the skin taught to avoid any unnecessary pain, and keep your skin exfoliated relatively frequently to avoid any ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well on the black course hairs.</li>
            <li> With this epilator I can remove all of my lip hair in less than 10 seconds and I can do it almost every day.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why I reordered one but disappointed with the light and the tweezer.</li>
            <li> After seeing me use it, my boyfriend even bought one to pull out little hairs on his chest and fingers and whatnot.  </li>
            <li> and it took maybe 3-5 minutes for just that small patch - not worth the time :</li>
            <li> I have to repeatedly go over an area to remove unwanted hair and hair is still left behind.  </li>
            <li> Purchased solely for those pesky chin, upper lip hairs that I got tired of tweezing.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for use on my face, but I wasted my money on that one.</li>
            <li> If you want your brains pulled out and half your face gone, Go for it!</li>
            <li> It is painful at first</li>
            <li> My lip - felt like someone stabbing me with little needles (i also wax so was surprised at the pain involved)...</li>
            <li> I had always tweezed, as I hate shaving due to the ingrown hairs and stubble that grows back the next day.  </li>
            <li> As far as pain goes though, it&#x27;s really not that bad.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very harsh, and it needs to be done sonner</li>
            <li> It does the word on pulling out hairs - not flawlessly - Although it has left me with scratched all over - not good.</li>
            <li> I do have hard to remove hair - it just likes to STAY where it is.  </li>
            <li> So, if you have hard to remove hair, I&#x27;d say, give this product a pass.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t hurt yourself with this--if you press too hard against your skin, the safety kicks in and it turns off.  </li>
            <li> I had always been reluctant to buy one, since epilators aren&#x27;t commonly used and they don&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;d be efficient.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly an irritating feeling, but after a few minutes your skin gets used to the sensation.  </li>
            <li> does what its suppose to, but some hairs must be to thick to pull out</li>
            <li> It is very small</li>
            <li> There is a slight string as the hair is removed, but nothing too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Waxing was so tedious and messy</li>
            <li> It was bearable - but not pleasant - again, it did not remove hair.  </li>
            <li> Just a bit of a rip-off and misrepresentation.  </li>
            <li> Not really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My face still broke out after use like other products, but not as bad.</li>
            <li> Plus, my experience with wax was that it was messy, time consuming, expensive, and painful.  </li>
            <li> I was so wrong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works the fastest and is least painful when it has the highest power too.  </li>
            <li> They were expensive and took time to prepare and use them  </li>
            <li> I really am so disappointed, but I hate sending stuff back.  </li>
            <li> Yes, sounds crazy, but it becomes a habit over time.    </li>
            <li> I am too chicken to try the bikini area.</li>
            <li> inside the plastic cover you can see disgusting black hairs!</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to do your face with this product.</li>
            <li> but It was just too darn painful.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too painful for me, to use on the arm pits.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this item.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed that it did not work and will have to end up buying one from the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> really disappointed in it.  </li>
            <li> This makes me sick!</li>
            <li> I am so grossed out and so disappointed in Amazon!</li>
            <li> SO PAINFUL!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disgusted and outraged!</li>

            <li> Garbage!  I bought this after my first Epi-Slim died thinking more tweezers, better coverage.  Not so!  Just threw this out and will be going back to my Epi-Slim!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product.  would like it to be chargeable instead of batteries.. it runs down pretty quickly.. not completely off but slower which causes it to not pull the hairs like it should be.  So Im constantly changing the batteries even when they are not dead.  I use it on my legs, underarms and upper lip.  I have to say though I have blond hair and not very hairy.  So that might be why it works well for me.  I haven&#x27;t gotten my daughter to use her&#x27; much yet.. I can judge it better after seeing how it works with her.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face/upper lip to get rid of little hairs that aren&#x27;t welcome.  I used to use cream removers and found that those were much to irritating to my skin, even though I would use the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; versions of the creams.  The hairs come back in more slowly since they are being plucked out.    It doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as I thought it would (I was mentally prepared for much worse).  It&#x27;s just like plucking your eyebrows.  I would recommend it to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> SO PAINFUL!!!!! If there is any way to alleviate the god-awful pain, please let me know!!!</li>
            <li> I received this epilator as a gift.  It has enabled me to spend less time in the shower shaving with traditional razors that used to leave me with stubble and five o&#x27;clock shadows.  I know that after using this tool, I can go days without using it again.  Hair grows back more slowly and finer.  It is especially great for underarms, where shaving never quite cut it!  I bought one for my 11-year old daughter, who recently developed the need to shave.  She uses it with ease.  I hope she never has to use a traditional razor.  We highly recommend the epilator.</li>
            <li> My wife spent a few dollars extra for the \\&quot;eyebrow feature\\&quot;.  Turned out to be a conventional tweezer with a light...about 50 cents worth of material.  Just a bit of a rip-off and misrepresentation.  Otherwise, it works pretty good although a bit painful...but, again, you&#x27;re pulling out hair by the \\&quot;roots\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool !</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product! I wax ALL the time and tweeze - rarely shave - so thought this would maybe work for me.  I tried it every which way you can to get it to remove hair and it just does not do a good job.  It does remove a FEW, VERY few - breaks others (which i can get from shaving!) - and leaves the rest right where they are.  I bought this for my face to do chin and lip.  The chin did not hurt at all as I use waxing and tweeze there, but i had to go over and over and over and over it and still, it left stubble, coarse hair and fine hair.  It really removed VERY few! My lip - felt like someone stabbing me with little needles (i also wax so was surprised at the pain involved)... It was bearable - but not pleasant - again, it did not remove hair.  I waited to wax so the hair was more than long enough for this epilator to grab.  I do have hard to remove hair - it just likes to STAY where it is.  Even tweezing i really have to work at getting hairs out.  So, if you have hard to remove hair, I&#x27;d say, give this product a pass.  I will be returning it to whence it came :-(&lt;br /&gt;Back to waxing and tweezing.... *sigh*&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did use it on my leg, just to try different angles to see if there was something that i could do to get this to work.  Even my leg hair (which right now long - winter legs starting already!) and going over and over and over in a patch about 4x4 it removed 80% of the hair - but again, i had to go over and over it and it took maybe 3-5 minutes for just that small patch - not worth the time :-(&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: the next day I ended up with small rashy pimples on my upper lip - um EW! not the look i was going for....</li>
            <li> I had a Tweezee for years that finally died, so stupid me thought more money, more tweezer, better product.  I was so wrong.  Bulky, hard to manuver, doesn&#x27;t pluck near as good...I really am so disappointed, but I hate sending stuff back.  After postage, not worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator from amazon and I like it a lot.  Previously I have waxed my upper lip and this is much less painful and does a good job.  I especially like the lighted tweezer, very convenient for removing just a single hair. I like the natural look of leaving the peach fuzz, if you will and taking out the hairs.  Much more natural looking results than waxing which strips everything in the areas that are waxed. It wasn&#x27;t obvious that the epilator needed two AA batteries, but is wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> This epilator does what it says it will.  It plucks hair.  It doesn&#x27;t feel great but it is tolerable.  It is very small so it takes a long time for larger areas.  The one thing that is really problematic is that the batteries drain after just one use.  It doesn&#x27;t work well with low batteries.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have sent this product back. It doesn&#x27;t work and it cost a lot of money. Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this epilator since 2008, and it still works just as if it were new.  It&#x27;s a good epilator for the price, but it eats up batteries like candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works the fastest and is least painful when it has the highest power too.  As far as pain goes though, it&#x27;s really not that bad.  It helps to keep the skin taught to avoid any unnecessary pain, and keep your skin exfoliated relatively frequently to avoid any ingrown hairs.  It&#x27;s mostly an irritating feeling, but after a few minutes your skin gets used to the sensation.  Over time, it also gets easier since you know what to expect as well as the hair becoming sparser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair grows back in about a week/ week and a half.  I really only need to take about an hour out of my schedule to do this so it&#x27;s really not much of an inconvenience, and my skin feels so smooth after I do this it&#x27;s addicting.</li>
            <li> Very useful and good quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent product received very quickly.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Very good :) I highly recommend it to people who have a lot hair and thick stubborn hair. It pulls your hair out from the root and your hair will grow out slower. It is painful at first but you will get used to it and eventually not feel it. The process does take longer than shaving due to the fact that you have to continue to pass the machine through an area till all hair is gone. It&#x27;s not a one pass and all hair is gone type of thing. But overall, I am very content with the product and my results. I no longer shave as much and have smooth legs longer.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this epilator on QVC when they were offering a special deal, but it was called \\&quot;Emjoi Total Tweeze,\\&quot; I think so QVC could market it with a different name.  It&#x27;s exactly the same model.    I am so glad I bought this!!!  I had always tweezed, as I hate shaving due to the ingrown hairs and stubble that grows back the next day.  I&#x27;m picky about being smooth.  And I never wanted to wait until the hair was 1/4 inch long in order to wax it.  Plus, my experience with wax was that it was messy, time consuming, expensive, and painful.  One or twice a week, I would painstakingly spend about 1.5 to 2 hours just tweezing.  Yes, sounds crazy, but it becomes a habit over time.    When my friend and I were discussing hair removal techniques, I told her about my tweezing.  She said, \\&quot;Why don&#x27;t you get an epilator?  I use one, and I only spend about 30 minutes once a week using it.\\&quot;  I had always been reluctant to buy one, since epilators aren&#x27;t commonly used and they don&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;d be efficient.  But with my friend&#x27;s recommendation, I bought the Emjoi Total Tweeze when it was on sale on QVC, paid about $25 or so.    Now I&#x27;ll NEVER go back to tweezing, shaving, or waxing again!  This is so convenient.  I spend maybe 30 minutes once a week removing hair.  If there are any spare hairs left over (usually ones that haven&#x27;t quite surfaced above the skin yet), I just grab them with a tweezer.  Since I was already used to pulling my hair out by the root, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  Just kind of a tickling sensation.  You can&#x27;t hurt yourself with this--if you press too hard against your skin, the safety kicks in and it turns off.  And unlike waxing where you pull out big chunks of hair at one time, you can move at your own pace with this.  The added tweezers that come with it are a little dull, so I still use my own, but no big deal.  This is such a time-saver!  Plus, once you buy it, it&#x27;ll last a long time, and you only need to put in new batteries every once in a while.  If you&#x27;ve never tried an epilator, get one!  You can use it almost anywhere--bikini, legs, arms, face, whatever.  I use it on my bikini weekly, and before I went on vacation to Cabo, I did my arms and legs, too, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to shave while on vacation.  After seeing me use it, my boyfriend even bought one to pull out little hairs on his chest and fingers and whatnot.  I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this thing!</li>
            <li> I have to repeatedly go over an area to remove unwanted hair and hair is still left behind.  Not really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Purchased solely for those pesky chin, upper lip hairs that I got tired of tweezing.  Yes it hurts and while a lot of folks say they get used to the minor pain, I&#x27;m apparently not one of them.  Still, the pain is short-lived as is the resulting skin redness.  However, since the results last much longer than the creams I used to use + takes a LOT less time than tweezing &#x3D; I\\&quot;m happy!  One of the keys I had to figure out on my own is to NOT press against skin too hard - this is more effective if you lightly press against skin, which is counter-intuitive in my opinion.  I have no intention of trying on other body parts.  The lighted tweezers is kind of pointless as I find my tweezerman tweezers far more effective, I find it to be a fun, but unnecessary little gadget add-on.  I&#x27;m very pleased w/ this epilator for the limited facial areas I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> The best Epilator on the market, first I was so concern about if a will handle the pain of using an epilator, reading the review, I was even more concern about it,&lt;br /&gt;but I take a chance and I bought this product,&lt;br /&gt;I highly recomended, pain is not bad at all, I can handle it, I&#x27;m sure you will too&lt;br /&gt;my legs are so smooth now, no more razors cuts.&lt;br /&gt;And before I forget this epilator had a Teewzer with light, is just so cool I get my eyebrowns done like a pro now!</li>
            <li> It does pull out the hair. Still you need a tweezer  for those  stubbern one or two that resist . But this has it too, and a nifty light too.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this item.  Batteries fall out causing it to stop running.  Also does not do good job picking up hairs.</li>
            <li> This is my second one (the first went missing on a trip, otherwise I know it would still be working). It grabs the hairs well, once you are used to it, it doesn&#x27;t hurt (much...there are still some sensitive areas), and it is quick!</li>
            <li> Overall, the Emjoi Total Concept does what it says it does.  It&#x27;s effective at removing smooth hair, like the type found on your arm or on the legs of someone who doesn&#x27;t shave regularly.  But, for coarse-haired people who shave regularly like myself, it really only removes 50-60% of the hair.  And you have to let your hair grow out pretty substantially before you try to remove it.  Longer than for waxing, in my experience. The hair started to regrow within 1-2 weeks.  But, that will probably vary from person to person as well.  If you have success with waxing products, this will probably work for you.  If your hair is resilient and has a mind of its own, you might want to stick with shaving.</li>
            <li> The best epilator ever. EXCELLENT motor, much better than the older, identical version, I own for years. These are the most accurate tweezers ever and the LED light in it makes it insuperable.</li>
            <li> I was shipped a used one and the tweezers did not work on my face.  The epilator is loud and sounds like Im using an electric razor.  the only thing good is the tweezers with the light on the end.  Disappointed that it did not work and will have to end up buying one from the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Did not work very well but returned it easily.</li>
            <li> So I read some raving reviews and some that had some complaints about how efficient the unit is in grabbing hairs. I must agree with those who say this unit is not the best at grabbing the hairs on the chin - unless you don&#x27;t mind waiting until the hair on your chin grows out long enough that you are mistaken for your husband. For the upper lip - it works great. For under the arms - it works great. For the legs and arms - it works great. I am too chicken to try the bikini area. I use the tweezers to get the stray hairs on my chin. Overall, even though it is not the best chin hair grabber (even when positioning the unit is several directions), I like the unit and am satisfied with my purchase. Nothing is going to get 100% of the hair but it works well enough to help me along.</li>
            <li> I have been using Emjoi for years and this is my second purchase from them.  Gave this one recently to my sister to purchase the corded gold plated version with more tweezers and must say that I love this one more.  The only caveat is the batteries run low pretty quickly once it ages which makes for slower pulling of hair.  Must change batteries often.  I suggest using the 1/2 used batteries on another appliance after removing from this gem.</li>
            <li> It works. it pulls out most of the hair...not ALL of it. But it beats shaving any day. I will just keep going over the patches it misses.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that I love it, it does remove some hairs, but not enough that I could give it more than 3 stars. It seems to work best on the lighter less course hairs, the peach fuzz. Doesn&#x27;t work as well on the black course hairs.</li>
            <li> It does the word on pulling out hairs - not flawlessly - Although it has left me with scratched all over - not good.</li>
            <li> This works really good. It doesn&#x27;t grab all of the hairs but it gets the majority of them. I had to clean it a couple of times before I was done. Also I can&#x27;t seem to get the lights to work on it but that doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of it. I would recommend it to anyone who is just starting out.</li>
            <li> The light on this doesn&#x27;t work even after installing batteries and the tweezers are hard to remove.  I had one of these before and loved it so that&#x27;s why I reordered one but disappointed with the light and the tweezer.</li>
            <li> Since when did Amazon start selling used personal care products???!!! I&#x27;m so disgusted and outraged! Aren&#x27;t there laws against selling used personal care items? This came in a box inside a box labeled QVC Returns. The epilady is in a plastic sleeve, no sealed packaging. inside the plastic cover you can see disgusting black hairs! I am so grossed out and so disappointed in Amazon! I pray I didn&#x27;t get exposed to a disease by opening the box! i better get every penny including shipping refunded back to me! This makes me sick!</li>
            <li> It was hard to maneuver and hurt to much. I rather save the money for laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> Works like a breeze. Does take some getting used to at first.</li>
            <li> Works well. I wish it picked up the fine hair better but at least it is something to use. I mainly use the tweezers.</li>
            <li> I love it. Keeps away that unfeminine upper lip and chin hair. Works well on my underarms too. Okay on my legs, though I really need better light so I can see what its missing and go back over it. There can be occasional pain on the upper lip, if not applied properly, needs a light hand I found. I am really happy with this product and would buy another if I needed to do so.</li>
            <li> A+++ This is my second one...love it!!! Once you get used to it, it&#x27;s a breeze to do the facial hair thing, and then forget about it. Very soft face, and no redness. I would recommend waiting an hour or so before putting any lotions or makeup on your skin.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to do your face with this product. It left rashes on the sides of my face. It&#x27;s very harsh, and it needs to be done sonner then the ad claims.</li>
            <li> This product is better used on the body than on the face.  It&#x27;s a little to big for those \\&quot;old hag\\&quot; hairs.</li>
            <li> This epilator literally pulled my skin off my face. Maybe I have sensitive skin but It was just too darn painful. Would not recommend but its up to you. I only used it once, too scared to try it again.If you want your brains pulled out and half your face gone, Go for it!</li>
            <li> Really nice stuff, hair don&#x27;t grow that fast, and it even doesn&#x27;t hurt when I depilate. I strongly reccomend. It is made nicely.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T REALLY WORK FOR THICK HAIR. THE NOISE IT MAKES SOUNDS LIKE YOU&#x27;RE GETTING READY FOR TORTURE!!! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> It does hurt some but works great and lasts longer than other methods I&#x27;ve used. My face still broke out after use like other products, but not as bad.</li>
            <li> does what its suppose to, but some hairs must be to thick to pull out so i just use the tweezers on it</li>
            <li> Amazing! So much better than tweezing. No pain at all!</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for use on my face, but I wasted my money on that one. It did not remove the hairs from my chin. Now, as for the armpits, it worked great. It was a little uncomfortable but not painful to me. I was shocked that it removed my armpit hair so easily, but it wouldn&#x27;t remove my facial hair. I thought they were both coarse and about the same length. Anyway, if you have very coarse facial hair, this might not work for you.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrific.  I have had an epilator of this kind for the last 20 years (electric) and it still worked, but rather primitive and I really wanted an up-to-date modern one.  I ordered this epilator which is more effective and I will still say \\&quot;terrific\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a NO NO thinking I could solve my hair problems but I have not been able to make it work.  The epilator works first time, every time, QUICKLY, and no burning hair smell.  Best ever product</li>
            <li> This is the best hair removal tool I have come across.  Works great for larger areas that require tweezing.  With prolonged use hair eventually disappears.</li>
            <li> works well  but does hurt somewhat</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work that great must use over and over</li>
            <li> Works well picks up small hairs and seems to last pretty long, I use it on my arms, it hurts but what do you expect when your pulling out hair.</li>
            <li> Does not work very well It does not get teh finer hairs and misses much more than it gets out. wished i could get my money back and buy one like I used to have since this is just gonna sit in my drwer forever.</li>
            <li> I only us this on my upper lip but it works great there. Waxing was so tedious and messy I would always put it off. But with this, I can just reach in the drawer and remove the face hair in no time. I think it&#x27;s too painful for me, to use on the arm pits. I&#x27;d rather just grab the razor in the shower, that&#x27;s easy enough. But for what I do with it, it&#x27;s been great. I&#x27;ve owned it for over a year now.</li>
            <li> I expected a better shave without the pain. I still have to go over my legs with a regular razor to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Eileen</li>
            <li> This device makes removing those unwanted hair(s) so easy.  Even the ones I&#x27;ve not yet located are found by the Emjoi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended it to several of my friends; they want one of their own.  Perhaps Christmas shopping will be a lot easier this year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making this available.</li>
            <li> Elderly mom uses it on her face for stray hairs that old ladies get.;-) this is her second one , first one lasted about 5 years. She recommends it.</li>
            <li> I never even ATTEPMTED  to use an epilator with someone elses&#x27; DNA  IN IT!! Gross! I won&#x27;t even order again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first and it was too painful for my legs, but it is a great product for under arms</li>
            <li> This product works outstanding and has not failed me.  Had it for 3 years.  Will buy another one and more of their products.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi is an excellent hair remover!!!! There is a slight string as the hair is removed, but nothing too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as I expected. I have to keep going over spots and sometimes that still does not work....very time-consuming.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this epilator I was using wax strips to remove my upper lip hair. They were expensive and took time to prepare and use them  so I could use them every other week. With this epilator I can remove all of my lip hair in less than 10 seconds and I can do it almost every day. This epilator has made it much more easier to remove facial hair but it hasn&#x27;t worked that well for me for other areas. The tweezer that came with it works well too.</li>
            <li> It does not do as good a  job as my smaller one.  really disappointed in it.  so take your chance on a smaller on</li>
            <li> This epilator is great for facial hair its small the lighted tweezers are wonderful I definitely would recommend this product it is my second one purchased my daughter took the first one she loved it to.  It does sting a little the first few times you use it but don&#x27;t let that discourage you it is a wonderful product. Nothing like the old epilators that felt like it was taking your skin off with the hair. After you use it three or four times there is no discomfort at all.  Love this product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I wish the head was wider and I couldn&#x27;t really feel any pulling so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s working properly.</li>
