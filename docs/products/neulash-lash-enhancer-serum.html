            <li> I just tried this and have been using it for about 2 weeks...which is not long enough to expect results.  </li>
            <li> Now, if only the hairs weren&#x27;t turning grey!  </li>
            <li> I have tried other growth serums, but NeuBrow will make ALL the difference in growing new hairs that have been missing for so long.  </li>
            <li> ; I could have regrowth my eyebrows a long time ago!  </li>
            <li> At least this seems to stay on all day although it is pretty dark</li>
            <li> I tried Neubrow and within a few weeks saw a major change.  </li>
            <li> Product was as expected.  </li>
            <li> or you eyebrows will return to their previous condition</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to find the right color for eyebrows since mine are almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> , eye brows grow back very slowly</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, as I am 65 and didn&#x27;t know if I had any active eyebrow follicles after over-plucking as a teen.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows have been disappearing for the past few years.</li>

            <li> i am a sucker....</li>
            <li> Seriously works</li>
            <li> The price is less expensive here than I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I will be rebuying to finish growing out my poor eyebrows that were over threaded!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical with this one.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it has gradually made my brows thicker</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t post it because it&#x27;s a product from a friends dermatology office.</li>
            <li> I never had real thin eyebrows, but I wanted to add to what I have already, so that&#x27;s my story.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes a difference, but you have to keep using it</li>
            <li> It works. Simple as that. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments. I use Neulash too and that stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Bought three, didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Maybe Rogaine foam for women?</li>
            <li> The product turns white and sticky then peels off</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great quality -as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Works well but you must be diligent to following their directions re applying twice a day</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have a picture, but I have noticed a difference. and so did someone at work. I never had real thin eyebrows, but I wanted to add to what I have already, so that&#x27;s my story. Yes, it does work very well and if needed I WILL order again.</li>
            <li> I just tried this and have been using it for about 2 weeks...which is not long enough to expect results.  I think I have noticed some improvement though which is great.  I bought it because I have tried Neulash in the past and it was a great product...I&#x27;m hoping this will work as well for my eyebrows as the Neulash did for my lashes.</li>
            <li> Was hopeing for a solution to my thinning brows and this product delivers. Be patient I was and I see brows thickening and bare spots disappearing. I will continue to use its worth it!</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic, but a thin-browed skeptic, so I figured it was worth a try. Now I no longer have to fill in my brows to look awake! (Bonus: I swipe the brush across my eyelashes once I&#x27;ve finished applying it to my brows, and they are tremendously longer as well.)</li>
            <li> this product worked too well on me... I looked like Cara Delevinge at the end of two months and I absolutely loved it. I have never had eyebrows andt all of the sudden BAM bushy beautiful lucious brows. I bought my first wand from bloomingdales for 150$ becuase i am a sucker.... this is actually an amazing price and well worth it. *Seriously works but you really have to apply twice a day. I applied after i did my makeup in the morning before work, and after my shower before bed diligintly!</li>
            <li> This product works.  Worth every penny.  Has regrown bald patches in my brows and has inadvertently enhanced my eyelashes to almost twice their original length and thickness.  Would not be without it!</li>
            <li> Be patient, it takes time but It works.  My eyebrows are so thin now they are so much better.  The only thing is you have to keep using it or you eyebrows will return to their previous condition</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in my brows after 3 weeks of continuous use. I will keep applying the product to my brows , hopefully over time it will work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years because it works.  Tried others...nah.  Sticking with this one.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had GREAT results in the short time I have used it! I will be rebuying to finish growing out my poor eyebrows that were over threaded! I&#x27;ve seen amazing growth in just 6 weeks so I imagine my eyebrows will be fully restored soon!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical with this one. But a celebrity make-up artist recommended it and it works! My eyebrows free in much thicker. I have used Anastacia&#x27;s version and saw no results!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know product  like this existed; I could have regrowth my eyebrows a long time ago!  I wanted to even them out, my left eyebrow for some reason was a lot thinner than the right one... Now that I have enough eyebrows to work with on both sides I made an appointment to have them shaped on Saturday, I have a big smile on my face, I never thought I&#x27;d be doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using the serum twice a day; morning and night.</li>
            <li> good but not great results, eye brows grow back very slowly</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it has gradually made my brows thicker</li>
            <li> Good product.  Used it before</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.  I have purchased it before and it works.</li>
            <li> I bought this product becsuse I had my brows threaded, and the person took off to much in the front. I have used this for about 3 weeks now, and I can honestly say my brows are thicker.  The parts of my brow that were sparse are thicker  and the part I needed to grow back is starting to grow. I would totally buy this again.</li>
            <li> After diligent daily use, my sparse eyebrows had new growth, albeit darker. The price is less expensive here than I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect this to work but it does!  My brows were thinning and I needed more and more pencil to cover them.  At first it seemed that the existing hairs were getting thicker and longer, but now, after 3 months, I am seeing the tiny hairs start to grow and fill in!  I&#x27;m really happy!  Now, if only the hairs weren&#x27;t turning grey!  BTW, I use this 2x per day.</li>
            <li> The best there is!  I have tried other growth serums, but NeuBrow will make ALL the difference in growing new hairs that have been missing for so long.  My brows look thicker and fuller than they have in years.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to find the right color for eyebrows since mine are almost non-existent. At least this seems to stay on all day although it is pretty dark so I can only use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> This product really does work!</li>
            <li> This really works, within one month the hair on my eyebrows really grew. I have already purchased my second one and will continue to use it. Easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> This product really does work. My eyebrows have been disappearing for the past few years. I gave this a try and will purchase again. It took about a month to see the difference, but gosh, I have brows again!</li>
            <li> I wanted so badly to love this, but I do have eczema and it ended up causing a bit of a flare up on my eyelids. The customer service, however, was excellent and gladly refunded me for my purchase, so major props to them!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  My eyebrows are thicker and fuller.  I have new hairs growing in as well.  This will make your eyebrows darker as well.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My brows were over plucked as a teen and never grew back.  I tried Neubrow and within a few weeks saw a major change.  Three months later I have wonderful eyebrows!  I am 80 years old and have a blog on fashion and beauty &amp;#34;Senior Style Bible&amp;#34;  and have told all of my readers about this product.. It works!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, as I am 65 and didn&#x27;t know if I had any active eyebrow follicles after over-plucking as a teen.  It took three months (and the product lasted longer than that for the one tube), applying in the a.m. and before bedtime.  I do notice new growth, and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> They have these questions all wrong….this is an enhancement serum just like revitalash, and this stuff really works. Apply it twice a day for the first 3 months, then once a day is okay. I don&#x27;t want to apply less than that because my brows have never looked to good, and I don&#x27;t want to take a chance of changing that fact.</li>
            <li> Works OK, but I found something that works even better for much less money. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t post it because it&#x27;s a product from a friends dermatology office. But this is a little less expensive than Latisse and I think it works probably just as well.</li>
            <li> Oh My Gosh, talk about something that works.  Plucking your brows into a fine pencil line is now a thing of the past.  My brows are growing so fast and filling in like they looked years ago. They come back a little darker than before which is fine with me as I&#x27;m blonde and my brows have always been a little to light. This product works and does everything it claims. No skin redness or irritation and the results are better than you can imagine.  As you can tell I am sold</li>
