            <li>Makes your hair big, love it!</li>
            <li>Good product to add texture and helps fine hair from going limp.  </li>
            <li>The best thing is it doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, and a little portion goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I first got it at the beauty shop on the recommendation of my stylist.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair, and allergic to most of the chemical hair spray.</li>

            <li>I tried this for the first time when I got my hair cut last year</li>
            <li>This seems to be doing the trick so far!</li>
            <li>Also, I recently moved to NC and it&#x27;s been hot and humid.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and limp.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist put it on me at the salon, I thought wow I can get it cheaper on Amazon...</li>

            <li> and I sprinkle just a little on my roots where I need volume, after I blowdry my hair, and rub it in and get instant volume.  </li>

            <li> This product adds volume and texture, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Not really worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will get that \\&quot;weird</li>
            <li> Flip hair upside down and rub your fingertips at your scalp to move powder around.  </li>
            <li> Will take a little practice to master.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricy though.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s weird texture,leaves hair stiff to touch.</li>
            <li> Will not hold your hair if it&#x27;s dirty or too heavy.</li>

            <li> Good product. Highly recommend this product for people with thin hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser tried this on me, and a little goes a long way to fuller hair. It smells fresh and good, and I was going to buy it at the salon, but it cost $27 there--this is a much better buy. You sprinkle a little at the roots, then gently rub it in. I have very dark hair, and the white powder completely disappears.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> Great for volume!!  Really can&#x27;t live without it now. Best on clean hair.  Use a comb to make a part to your scalp.  Tap your finger on the bottle to sprinkle the powder gently into each part you create. I start on the right side of the head and work my way to left (maybe around 6 parts total). Flip hair upside down and rub your fingertips at your scalp to move powder around.  You will get a tacky feel in your hair.  This is where the volume comes from. Will take a little practice to master. But great stuff!!! Finish with hairspray.</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent seller.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time when I got my hair cut last year and I&#x27;ve used it ever since. it provides very good lift for people with fine, oily hair like myself...good alternative for people who can&#x27;t style their hair with thick, greasy gel. Will not hold your hair if it&#x27;s dirty or too heavy.</li>

            <li> Hated it. Will never use it. Feel wet and makes the hair dirty.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and limp. A light sprinkle of this stuff and bye bye teasing comb! It keeps my hair lifted at the root all day, I even had volume when I woke up! So happy I found this product, I will definitely order again!!</li>
            <li> Magic Powder to add volume that lasts all day.  My hair is very fine and usually loses style quickly, with the PowderFix powder it hold styles all day long.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! Even if you sleep on your hair overnight it still holds the volume</li>
