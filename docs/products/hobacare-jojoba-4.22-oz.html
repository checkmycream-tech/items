    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Best jojoba oil brand on the market, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Great buy!  </li>
            <li>Jojoba Oil is the best thing I&#x27;ve tried for my skin.</li>
            <li>The affordable price point and the quality are a great match.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of great jojoba oil brands.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Very nice glide for bodywork.</li>
            <li>This awesome oil makes fly-away hair shiny, healthy, and manageable.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Good price for the amount you receive.</li>
            <li>Good value compared to others ive looked at.</li>
            <li>Plus its good for the skin.</li>
            <li>my loving granddaughter loved it</li>
            <li>Good for so many things.</li>
            <li>Why pay more, this stuff is just as good.  </li>
            <li>Grandson liked this oil for his hair pretty good!</li>
            <li>It makes my face so soft and I also use it on my psoriasis when it flares up, works great!</li>
            <li>Worthwhile purchase id recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I use this in most of my homemade body products.</li>
            <li>I purchased this along with another brand that was more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Its an okay product, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily</li>
            <li>The oil  has a nice glide and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Good, pure JoJoba oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bathroom essential, it&#x27;s cheap and lasts a while, and this brand seems like one I&#x27;ll stick with as it&#x27;s a good value.  </li>
            <li>Overall no funny scent, LOVE the dispenser top its easy and never leaks when I travel, keeps the tangles at bay, and gives good shine.</li>
            <li>This oil absorbs quickly into skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Also, it is said to be the oil that is most like our natural oils that is lost when we wash.</li>
            <li>I mix it with Vit E oil, castor oil, and three scented essential oils and use daily on my skin to remove dirt and, perhaps surprisingly, OIL!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great item to have to add a drop or two to facial moisturizer, use on areas of super dry skin, or my girlfriend likes to use to remove her makeup.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time buying Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing that others with high reviews like this had the whole &amp;#34;discount for review&amp;#34; reviews and didn&#x27;t really feel like they were genuine.</li>
            <li>I read somewhere that pure Jojoba oil will solidify if put in a fridge</li>
            <li>Has good glide and works well even with an amateur like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>The small pouring spout built into the top makes its use even easier, by allowing you to use just the right amount.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve boughten (the first lasted me probably about 4 years!)  </li>
            <li>this is a nice one with less extra stuff in it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive,</li>
            <li>So if u can get it real organic &amp; pure with no additives like; mineral oil,or other cheap crap oils - than...lucky u;) This one is made in the USA ,and not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Smells a little like clean clothes that have been left outside for a day (in sunny weather).</li>
            <li>Really works well on psoriasis, among other skin problems.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is extremely easy to use, because it is not as heavy as other oils.</li>
            <li>Use it first before adding Aveno lotion and has worked very well for intense cold winter in Northeast part of the country</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> my loving granddaughter loved it</li>
            <li> this is the only product I use for cleansing and moisturizing my face. I have sensitive, combination skin and jojoba oil is the only way to keep blemishes and breakouts at bay.</li>
            <li> Good no smell dont worry about it</li>
            <li> Good, pure JoJoba oil.  This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve boughten (the first lasted me probably about 4 years!)  It&#x27;s a great item to have to add a drop or two to facial moisturizer, use on areas of super dry skin, or my girlfriend likes to use to remove her makeup.  It&#x27;s a bathroom essential, it&#x27;s cheap and lasts a while, and this brand seems like one I&#x27;ll stick with as it&#x27;s a good value.  Get a bottle.</li>
            <li> As advertised and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  No greasy residue on your client or your linens. Very nice glide for bodywork.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is extremely easy to use, because it is not as heavy as other oils. Also, it is said to be the oil that is most like our natural oils that is lost when we wash. The small pouring spout built into the top makes its use even easier, by allowing you to use just the right amount. This oil absorbs quickly into skin and hair. This awesome oil makes fly-away hair shiny, healthy, and manageable. Try it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Good price for the amount you receive.</li>
            <li> Best jojoba oil brand on the market, in my opinion. Good for so many things. Really works well on psoriasis, among other skin problems. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Grandson liked this oil for his hair pretty good!</li>
            <li> Good value compared to others ive looked at. Only have tried one other brand (Aveda ABC oil) years ago so I cant compare. Overall no funny scent, LOVE the dispenser top its easy and never leaks when I travel, keeps the tangles at bay, and gives good shine. Worthwhile purchase id recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I like this quite a bit. I read somewhere that pure Jojoba oil will solidify if put in a fridge so when I got it I tested it out. Indeed, it went solid. I bought this after seeing that others with high reviews like this had the whole &amp;#34;discount for review&amp;#34; reviews and didn&#x27;t really feel like they were genuine. I use this in most of my homemade body products.</li>
            <li> Why pay more, this stuff is just as good.  I purchased this along with another brand that was more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;They both work the same.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with winter dry skin. Use it first before adding Aveno lotion and has worked very well for intense cold winter in Northeast part of the country</li>
            <li> Great buy!  The affordable price point and the quality are a great match. I would definitely make this purchase again.</li>
            <li> Jojoba Oil is the best thing I&#x27;ve tried for my skin. It makes my face so soft and I also use it on my psoriasis when it flares up, works great!</li>
            <li> Love it- No different from any other jojoba oil I&#x27;ve tried. There are plenty of great jojoba oil brands.&lt;br /&gt;But this is a nice one with less extra stuff in it.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in a mixture of oils as a skin cleanser.  I mix it with Vit E oil, castor oil, and three scented essential oils and use daily on my skin to remove dirt and, perhaps surprisingly, OIL!  It actually helps grab onto the oil produced by my skin and does so without drying my face out.  I will never go back to using mass produced cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also have used this oil on my scalp (just the jojoba, not the mixture) when I started getting horribly dry itchy skin up there.  It relieved it immediately so I could sleep at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than online, the only other place I can get Jojoba oil is from an expensive health food store and the closest one to me is about a half hour drive.  I will definitely be buying from Amazon again for this product.</li>
            <li> Smells a little like clean clothes that have been left outside for a day (in sunny weather). That sort of neutral, natural-ish smell. Has good glide and works well even with an amateur like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying Jojoba oil. Its an okay product, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> As a massage therapist, I like using this on people&#x27;s faces. The oil  has a nice glide and absorbs quickly. Plus its good for the skin.</li>
            <li> Affordable, natural and believe it or not, a wonderful moisturizer under makeup!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s compared to very expensive Sperm Sperm Whale oil $$$$$$$. So if u can get it real organic &amp; pure with no additives like; mineral oil,or other cheap crap oils - than...lucky u;) This one is made in the USA ,and not bad at all. I tried 3 others 3x $$$ the price&#x3D;no difference to me.</li>
