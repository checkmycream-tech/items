            <li>i love love love it..</li>
            <li>I rarely wear it, but when I have, it&#x27;s worked nicely.</li>
            <li>This mascara applies with ease, seems to lengthen, lasts all day and washes off easily with make up remover  </li>
            <li>The regular L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic mascara is exceptional, and as effective as it&#x27;s advertised to be.  </li>
            <li>the delivery is fine.</li>
            <li>the product is fine.</li>
            <li>but that is fine</li>
            <li>When I was kite-surfing and spending a lot of time in the water, I tried every drug store mascara available.  </li>
            <li>Go swim first. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not impossible to remove.  </li>
            <li>Wears off of ends quickly.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not impossible.</li>
            <li>my lashes look amazing an beautiful.. bye bye fake lashes...</li>
            <li>I bought this mascara 2 weeks ago and it was well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>The one that worked best for me, was by Max Factor, in a black and blue tube.</li>
            <li>While it separates my lashes really well (no clumps!</li>
            <li>Very upset!</li>
            <li>The point is, I finally can wear a mascara that highlights my blond lashes and makes me look just a bit more glam.</li>
            <li>The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t remove easily eith makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge and is really waterproof.</li>
            <li>Its really all in the brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely had better as far as the waterproofing.  </li>
            <li>like many other waterproof mascaras that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>i only tried this mascara because my tried and true waterproof double extend was no longer available on subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li>on the hunt still for something a little better.</li>
            <li>It costs about $11 at my local Target so this is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>Next day, if you sleep in makeup like I do, the extended part of the lash is removed and if you apply more on top, it looks bulky and bad.</li>
            <li>I have a 20 month old and get in the water only to play and assist him, at this point.  </li>
            <li>After a few hours, tips of lashes are free of mascara, bases stay dark.  </li>
            <li>It is a little difficult to remove but with a good eye makeup remover</li>

            <li> As far as waterproof mascara goes, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> No smearing under eyes &amp; easy-off for waterproof.....also, I don&#x27;t find this formula irritating, drying or have issues with flaking.  </li>
            <li> :  Difficult to cover ends of lashes.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>

            <li> I have gone to bed without washing my makeup off (bad, I know!), and this mascara practically looks like I just put it on in the morning.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Container was a different color and did not seem to work as well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara EVER! Lengthens and volumnizes, makes your lashes looks naturally long! Love that the waterproof holds the curl.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite drugstore mascara. The smaller brush helps me coat even the tiniest lashes.</li>
            <li> I train hard at the gym and am dripping with sweat all through my workout. My other mascaras and eyeliners could never hold up. I bought this mascara 2 weeks ago and it was well worth the investment. It stays put. The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t remove easily eith makeup remover. I have to use 2 applications of my makeup remover to get it off.</li>
            <li> As far as waterproof mascaras go, this is a little above average.  However, I think including it in the Telescopic line, is misleading.  The regular L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic mascara is exceptional, and as effective as it&#x27;s advertised to be.  (See my review).  The waterproof version does no such thing.  Additionally, it does not have the same brush/wand.  It is thicker, (larger circumference), and variegated, (thicker in some parts than others).&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Does not feel, \\&quot;gummy,\\&quot; like many other waterproof mascaras that I have tried.  Does not flake or clump, like most waterproof mascaras.  Does not \\&quot;bleed,\\&quot; to under eye area.  It&#x27;s not impossible to remove.  (I use Pro Emu Oil, which I also buy from Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Difficult to cover ends of lashes.  Wears off of ends quickly.  After a few hours, tips of lashes are free of mascara, bases stay dark.  As it doesn&#x27;t flake or bleed, I have no idea where it goes???&lt;br /&gt;*I have not used it in the water for any length of time, or anything remotely resembling vigorous activity.  I have a 20 month old and get in the water only to play and assist him, at this point.  When I was kite-surfing and spending a lot of time in the water, I tried every drug store mascara available.  The one that worked best for me, was by Max Factor, in a black and blue tube. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
            <li> the delivery is fine. the product is fine. everything is fine.the only thing is that my stuff is a little broken. but that is fine</li>
            <li> I always like to read reviews of products before I buy them. On another site, a reviewer had previously written that they could go in the pool and this mascara would not come off. I assumed that they were exaggerating but now I believe it! I have worn this in the rain and while doing sports. It does not come off. Then there is the problem of taking it off. It is a little difficult to remove but with a good eye makeup remover it&#x27;s not impossible. The only reason (other than the difficulty removing it) that I gave this product four stars was because I am not a fan of the mascara brush. While it separates my lashes really well (no clumps!) I find it is harder to use because of the wide spaces between the lines of bristles. Overall I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The package came opened and dried out! USELESS! There goes money down the drain! Very upset! I&#x27;ve never had this happen before!</li>
            <li> No smearing under eyes &amp; easy-off for waterproof.....also, I don&#x27;t find this formula irritating, drying or have issues with flaking.  The wand is okay - very fine.  I may purchase again, but on the hunt still for something a little better.</li>
            <li> As far as waterproof mascara goes, I was disappointed.  It flakes and actually does run a little.  I&#x27;ve definitely had better as far as the waterproofing.  But the brush and look is great!</li>
            <li> Waterproof definitely. I love it. Next day, if you sleep in makeup like I do, the extended part of the lash is removed and if you apply more on top, it looks bulky and bad. I would suggest to remove every night. Go swim first. :)</li>
            <li> a gift for myself I love</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used - and I have tried many.  Loreal Voluminous is a close second but Paris Telescopic Shocking Extensions makes lashes long but no clumps.</li>
            <li> i only tried this mascara because my tried and true waterproof double extend was no longer available on subscribe and save.  this mascara blows.  it&#x27;s clumpy, the brush is weak, and the only thing shocking about the extensions is the complete lack thereof.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear it, but when I have, it&#x27;s worked nicely.</li>
            <li> Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Everything was good,</li>
            <li> I was looking for more volume for my lashes when I bought this product. The brush does not grab the lashes like you would expect. Due to that, it does not really give you any volume. Not to mention, it smelled wierd</li>
            <li> This mascara applies with ease, seems to lengthen, lasts all day and washes off easily with make up remover  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time with mascara. No matter how waterproof or smudgeproof it claims to be, halfway through the day, I always wind up looking like Alice Cooper. I am thrilled to announce that I have found my mascara! No &amp;#34;prince of darkness&amp;#34; look here! I can&#x27;t say as it stays on as long as some others. Somehow, by the end of the day, some of the tips of the mascara have floated off into the wind, but I have yet to see traces of how it goes. The point is, I finally can wear a mascara that highlights my blond lashes and makes me look just a bit more glam. WOO HOO!</li>
            <li> By far the best mascara I have ever used. It lengthens and curls. It doesn&#x27;t smudge and is really waterproof. It also doesn&#x27;t flake off.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara! The selling point for me is that this only mascara that will hold the curl all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and lengthens my lashes. For those wanting a mascara that thickens your lashes, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for you. I have tried a number of mascaras over the years from drugstore to high-end. I&#x27;ve always come back to this one. I was thrilled to see this mascara on Amazon and the price is great. It costs about $11 at my local Target so this is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> Finally, a mascara that doesn&#x27;t flake off with under eye cream and lotion! I love this stuff. It keeps my lashes separated and lengthens them. No clumping and NO raccoon eyes from mascara that wears off. I have gone to bed without washing my makeup off (bad, I know!), and this mascara practically looks like I just put it on in the morning. Lasts through sweating and swimming.</li>
            <li> i must say .. i love love love it.. my lashes look amazing an beautiful.. bye bye fake lashes...the best mascara... i recommended..</li>
            <li> Excellent mascara... I will buy again.  Its really all in the brush.</li>
