            <li>This product helped give me a great night&#x27;s sleep, the first ever wearing my mask!</li>
            <li>I tried using it for a week, because it was very comfortable, and I wanted to see if the fragrance would dissipate in time.</li>
            <li>I have ordered more already.  </li>
            <li>It fits well but it needs to be thicker to provide more padding.</li>
            <li>Works to keep pressure off my nose, but I still get areas of soreness below it from the Cpap mask / but much better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Cotton pads work better and don&#x27;t cause break outs around my nose.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product and as described.</li>
            <li>Makes the mask much more comfortable and l</li>
            <li>This makes her mask so much more comfortable to wear</li>
            <li>If I use a mask wipe to clean it, I think it sticks on my face better</li>
            <li>it works fine.</li>
            <li>These do a great job of keeping the bridge of my nose from becoming sore and red.</li>
            <li>The pad was comfortable; however when the cushion was placed over it - air leaked out and could not be used.</li>
            <li>It would have been comfortable if it worked.</li>
            <li>The gel pad surface is smooth, easy to clean, and pliable to fit my face.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this because it was quite a bit cheaper than the gecko gel pad.</li>
            <li>Even after washing it with mild soap and warm water several times every day, it did not get any better.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly good despite being smaller than the Gecko.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.  </li>
            <li>Worked well when it worked, which was rare.</li>
            <li>It seemed thicker than the Gecko and did not poke me in the eyes if I didn&#x27;t have it on quite right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simply place the gel pad on the bridge of your nose, and your mask fits right over it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash daily.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This fit better on my smallish face than the small size Gecko Pad and was easier to put on and keep on while putting my mask on.  </li>
            <li>I guess I am just super sensitive.</li>
            <li>If you have nose sores from your CPAP mask, use these, they really work.  </li>
            <li>Without this the bridge of your nose becomes very sore.</li>
            <li>I was ready to give up on the CPAP.</li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really help that much with leaking.</li>
            <li>If you have a  sleep apnea machine and a full face mask, it is essential to have the gel protector for your nose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m next trying a liner for my full face mask as it leaks around the mouth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the shape as well as my old one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at how well this works.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a week and waking up with puss-filled, very blood shot eyes, I finally decided I just could not tolerate it.</li>
            <li>Will have to live with the red mark.</li>
            <li>but I still was only able to wear my CPAP every other night due to redness and irritation.  </li>
            <li>Works well for me - makes mask more comfortable and prevents the deep and painful groove on the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li>It has stopped the area of my masks that generally leaks.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it had a very strong fragrance, which I could not tolerate.</li>

            <li> your small pads are not big enough to cover nasal area that cpap mask needs sealed so it wont leak air if I can I would like to exchange all three for larger pads please contact me at this e-mail address papajoe@bak.rr.com</li>
            <li> Even though I ordered the Petite/Small, it was still way too Big and just did not fit My Nose at All.</li>
            <li> This feels like a wet, slimy gummy worm on my face.</li>
            <li> It is the type of silicone that feels like wet jell-o, and attracts dust.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult at first to maneuver</li>
            <li> I often woke up with it pinning my eyes closed!</li>
            <li> I woke up with no mark on my nose, which was why I bought it and why I am not just giving it one star, but the area under it was wet and sweaty, which was no fun.</li>
            <li> but if you lay down and then put it on--hen the mask</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t create a tight seal around the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> These pads work well if your skin is turning red or your CPAP mask is irritating your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also found the scent to be quite a turnoff, despite washing it in heavily scented soap.</li>
            <li> The boomerang gel pad worked well to cushion my CPAP mask on the bridge of my nose, and I did not notice any excessive air leakage.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with the sensation of it.</li>
            <li> It was WAY to thick</li>
            <li> No more!  </li>
            <li> My mask used to leave big &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; marks on the bridge and sides of my nose, these marks were painful.  </li>

            <li> If you have nose sores from your CPAP mask, use these, they really work.  I have ordered more already.  They don&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li> after struggling for weeks with the masks, hoses, cpap etc this was finally the solution for all the mask leaks!!! thank you!</li>
            <li> No it did not work for me and my brother also bought one and did not worki</li>
            <li> It is not what I thought I was getting.  I don&#x27;t like the shape as well as my old one.</li>
            <li> This is a neat invention.  This has helped keep my Cpap mask in place.</li>
            <li> If you have a  sleep apnea machine and a full face mask, it is essential to have the gel protector for your nose. Without this the bridge of your nose becomes very sore. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up on the CPAP. This product helped give me a great night&#x27;s sleep, the first ever wearing my mask!</li>
            <li> solved leaks, and sore nose.</li>
            <li> The pad was comfortable; however when the cushion was placed over it - air leaked out and could not be used.</li>
            <li> Too big , mask leaks when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me. It creates leaks where the gel pad ends, because it lifts the mask away from the face.  It does not allow the mask to seal properly to the face.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Used 4 nights. Worked initially then the red mark on the bridge of my returned. Also discolored. Will have to live with the red mark.</li>
            <li> They slide off the nose underneath the CPAP mask while sleeping.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help the bridge of my nose. I still have a wrinkle from my mask in the morning. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> It was WAY to thick so it didn&#x27;t create a tight seal around the rest of my face. It would have been comfortable if it worked.</li>
            <li> It fits well but it needs to be thicker to provide more padding.</li>
            <li> Works well to prevent leaks from mask pad</li>
            <li> I bought this because the Wisp nasal mask began to create a sore on my nose after three days of perfect comfort.  The Boomerang seems to spread the redness out so I have a big red mark without the actual ulceration, but still, a big red mark all day every day is not what I had in mind.  I have switched to a cloth mask, instead.</li>
            <li> Works to keep pressure off my nose, but I still get areas of soreness below it from the Cpap mask / but much better than nothing. A must use for me</li>
            <li> Love it so far.  If I use a mask wipe to clean it, I think it sticks on my face better and now I don&#x27;t have a red area all around my nose.</li>
            <li> This fit better on my smallish face than the small size Gecko Pad and was easier to put on and keep on while putting my mask on.  It seemed thicker than the Gecko and did not poke me in the eyes if I didn&#x27;t have it on quite right. It stopped ulcers from forming on my nose but I still was only able to wear my CPAP every other night due to redness and irritation.  I guess I am just super sensitive. It seemed well made and durable. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Wearing the gel pad under my CPAP mask permits me to sleep through the night.  My mask used to leave big &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; marks on the bridge and sides of my nose, these marks were painful.  No more!  The gel pad surface is smooth, easy to clean, and pliable to fit my face.</li>
            <li> These pads work well if your skin is turning red or your CPAP mask is irritating your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply place the gel pad on the bridge of your nose, and your mask fits right over it.</li>
            <li> Great service. It&#x27;s a bit difficult at first to maneuver but if you lay down and then put it on--hen the mask it works fine. Washes up nicely to. Makes the mask much more comfortable and l I don&#x27;t have a red ridge on my nose anymore.</li>
            <li> false advertisement they do not work as stated. woke up during nite it had moved in my cpap mask and i was choking. dangerous to use resperitory therapy said should be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> Works well for me - makes mask more comfortable and prevents the deep and painful groove on the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> These do a great job of keeping the bridge of my nose from becoming sore and red.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t do anything for the bridge of my nose. Still got sore</li>
            <li> Worked well when it worked, which was rare. I found this riding up my face under the mask during the night. I often woke up with it pinning my eyes closed! I also found the scent to be quite a turnoff, despite washing it in heavily scented soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom to wear under her sleep apnea mask. She&#x27;s had a problem with it rubbing her nose. She really likes it. This makes her mask so much more comfortable to wear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how well this works.  It has stopped the area of my masks that generally leaks.</li>
            <li> I works well for the bridge of the nose and I like that it is reusable.  I&#x27;m next trying a liner for my full face mask as it leaks around the mouth.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help that much with leaking. Cotton pads work better and don&#x27;t cause break outs around my nose.</li>
            <li> Helped some but not a cure.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I needed. They arrived well packed  and in perfect condition. Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> The boomerang gel pad worked well to cushion my CPAP mask on the bridge of my nose, and I did not notice any excessive air leakage. Unfortunately it had a very strong fragrance, which I could not tolerate. I tried using it for a week, because it was very comfortable, and I wanted to see if the fragrance would dissipate in time. Even after washing it with mild soap and warm water several times every day, it did not get any better. I woke up with watery, itchy eyes from day one of using it. After using it for a week and waking up with puss-filled, very blood shot eyes, I finally decided I just could not tolerate it. I will continue to search for one I can use.</li>
            <li> Even though I ordered the Petite/Small, it was still way too Big and just did not fit My Nose at All.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be the answer to the marks on my nose.  This created an air leak in my mask and I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> A great product that works for my wife.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product and as described.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on and still leaves marks.</li>
            <li> This feels like a wet, slimy gummy worm on my face. I woke up with no mark on my nose, which was why I bought it and why I am not just giving it one star, but the area under it was wet and sweaty, which was no fun. It is the type of silicone that feels like wet jell-o, and attracts dust. I have a hard time with the sensation of it. Please can someone invent one that is breathable and still cushions the face?</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this because it was quite a bit cheaper than the gecko gel pad. It works alright except it is smaller than the gecko and can slip out of the mask leaving you without any padding.</li>
