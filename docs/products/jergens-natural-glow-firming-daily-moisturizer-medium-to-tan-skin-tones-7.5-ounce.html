    <ol>
            <li>Not the best</li>
            <li>And I have to say i&#x27;m impressed!!</li>
            <li>The best thing about this tanner is no stinking self tanner scent!</li>
            <li>It works wonderful.  </li>
            <li>so this is a great alternative!  </li>
            <li>This lotion is great!</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product and will visit this store again.</li>
            <li>But I have not seen any streaks, and my skin looks beautiful!!!</li>
            <li>and she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s firming abilities, but this is a very good tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>The odor of tanning products always bothered me but this one smells good!  </li>
            <li>I get compliments on my beautiful tan</li>
            <li>I tried this Jergens version, for Fair to Medium skin tones, and it&#x27;s PERFECT.  </li>
            <li>I use the \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; version of this lotion and get great results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but do not order it from this seller (Toys &amp; Gifts</li>
            <li>I used it anyway because it gave great color.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>This self tan is great.  </li>
            <li>it is of great quality</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>This sunless tanning lotion works beautifully but you need to keep on using it every day to achieve a good tan</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s authentic and delivered in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>This tanner is really great though and does a good job of creating a gradual color change.</li>
            <li>so while this was effective, i say tread with caution!</li>
            <li>However for something to keep as a great moisturizer I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>I use the fair to medium in the winter &amp; the medium to tan in the spring &amp; summer months.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start with the good things, i applied it to my legs and arms</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;ll be good if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>It is as a good moisturizer......</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>Just what I want...a nice toasty color done gradually but you will be happy with it after one use....</li>
            <li>Does smell good and moisturize though.</li>
            <li>one tip about using it... works best on clean, well-exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li>While I love this product and trust Jergens, I was happy to see that they added a firming solution to the product line.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and my skin is softer and retains more moisture.</li>
            <li>this is nice to have on while still having a good scent off the lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, and looks really good.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>the girls at my work started using it now and love their results!  </li>
            <li>No need for sun love this!</li>
            <li>I have been complemented on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; many times!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this tanning lotion!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This shouldn&#x27;t smell as strong as self tanner, because it isn&#x27;t one, and it also doesn&#x27;t deliver color that great either.</li>
            <li>The product itself is amazing</li>
            <li>I thought the color looked nice, but what&#x27;s the point when I don&#x27;t want to show off my skin?</li>
            <li>My favorite was L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Glow, but they seem to have discontinued the Fair Skin version.</li>
            <li>In all honestly.</li>
            <li>You can lay in a nice warm bed &amp; listen to relaxing music.</li>
            <li>So If you are ok with bleaching your towels, or can buy darker towels you are good.</li>
            <li>now and it gives my skin a nice tint and glow.</li>
            <li>Use it every 3 days or so...to keep a nice even tone to your skin.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the lotion on the pic got the cheapest kind of lotion.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product.just be sure  to wash your hands good after applying.</li>
            <li>properties but, let&#x27;s be honest, it has</li>
            <li>I liked this product because it gave me a darker appearance with a bit of a glow affect (hence the name)...</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan very easily</li>
            <li>It gives me an awesome glow and adds to any natural tan I have.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as others (but it still smells) and covered up my whiteness!</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you exfoliate though every time you are going to use it.  </li>
            <li>and so it&#x27;s more of an &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>You can darken more if you need to by applying more often.</li>
            <li>My skin looks noticeably more tan after just a couple hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite thing by any stretch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product has been clogging my pores, so I will be throwing my tube away.  </li>
            <li>Use more to get darker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it conistently for about 2 years now and have received so many compliments on how tan I am</li>
            <li>Gives you a nice lightly bronzed glow  </li>
            <li>Although most of you like this product.</li>
            <li>The smell is quite lovely.</li>
            <li>Yeah, people complain about you having a greater risk of cancer.</li>
            <li>I always get compliments on my sexy beach like tan.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it looks, it gave me the color i was looking for.</li>
            <li>so i have to keep buying more.</li>
            <li>I love this product as a moisturizer</li>
            <li>i guess i was hoping to look more bronzed?</li>
            <li>All in all, this product is a fantastic alternative to skin cancer and premature aging!</li>
            <li>Ok I have used two bottles of this stuff.</li>
            <li>, will def be getting some more :)  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS LOTION</li>
            <li>I was already bald on top.</li>
            <li>a tiempo : )</li>
            <li>I really love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I also love that this tanning lotion has firming elements, which leaves my skin softer and tighter.  </li>
            <li>(I wait about 10 minutes after application to make sure it dries).</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using this all summer for sure.</li>
            <li>/..i bought this at Walgreens and was very excited to use it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a whole lot more pleasant.</li>
            <li>but it smells pretty good to me.</li>
            <li>A couple days of using this has made a significant improvement!</li>
            <li>thats easy to remedy though, and i became more vigilant after i noticed.</li>
            <li>very sweet.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of giving a bit of natural color.  </li>
            <li>it gave me a nice natural tan and glow, i&#x27;m in love!  </li>
            <li>&amp; its easy, but</li>
            <li>It is easy to work..and will not turn your skin orange..</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve heard really great reviews on the foaming, so i think i&#x27;ll try that one next :)</li>
            <li>It also has this strong smell that my bf hates.</li>
            <li>I also have found that mixing it with face lotion and using it on your face works fine too.</li>
            <li>If you do not use gloves, make sure to wash your hands, otherwise they will turn super orange.</li>
            <li>The huge improvement is the smell.  </li>
            <li>1 HUGE WARNING</li>
            <li>This works great for people that don&#x27;t have the time to lay outside or hit a tanning bed!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy buying specialty stuff without the hassle of going to the store and reading labels and the drive etc.  </li>
            <li>Always wash hands after applying and smooth on evenly.</li>
            <li>so again, use this when you dont plan on doing anything important afterward.</li>
            <li>Nothing can be done because it&#x27;s genetics, and tanning/UV light will make my condition even worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a great self tanner.</li>
            <li>I buy this every year at the beginning of the summer to  get a light tan before going for my beach vacation.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so silky and smooth</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good, the color of the tan looks natural and it does not stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not SUPER-fair, my hair is brown, but I&#x27;m too fair for the L&#x27;Oreal product to look natural.  </li>
            <li>this means no streaks and super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s $8-$12 depending on where you buy and totally worth it!  </li>
            <li>Take full advantage of free shipping and the convenience of having these items delivered to your front door.  </li>
            <li>I love it,it &#x27;s exactly what I wantes</li>
            <li>If this is your first time using it, make sure you don&#x27;t do three days in a row...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells like tanning lotion, not unpleasant, which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li>really love it because it not only kind of clears up my skin, but it evens out my skin-tone.</li>
            <li>/cover up with a variety of perfumes and still feel feminine &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>and it honestly looks very natural not orangey like an oompa loompa.  </li>
            <li>Gives me a natural looking tan and I love the fragrance!  </li>
            <li>It gives you a nice, even color that looks totally natural!  </li>
            <li>I use Jergens in the summertime on my legs and it is a nice, natural looking self tanner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>All in all, for the price, its not a bad product.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the difference in a few hours was amazing, with no streaking or smudging.</li>
            <li>I must have gotten lucky before b/c</li>
            <li>highly doubt this will hide my spider veins, but maybe make the sight more bareable.</li>
            <li>Smells really good (only true for the &amp;#34;+ Firming&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I happened to see the new bottle because this product works so well.</li>
            <li>and I love the new look.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li>So I was pretty excited about this product&#x27;s development!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I finished the bottle I was bikini body ready!!</li>
            <li>I liked this product before, but now that they eliminated the &amp;#34;burnt-skin&amp;#34; smell that you typically get from tanning beds or self-tanners, it&#x27;s MUCH better.</li>
            <li>It imparts color gradually, so it&#x27;s easy enough to stop when you&#x27;re satisfied.</li>
            <li>It was great to use this product so that I could get a little color, moisture and firmness all in one shot.</li>
            <li>Safe and natural way to tan and doesn&#x27;t streak if you follow instructions.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fair skin and this color isn&#x27;t too much for me, even as it&#x27;s starting to become winter.</li>
            <li>It left me feeling greasy but it did gradually give me a nice tan.</li>
            <li>What I really liked is it didn&#x27;t have a funky odor that the product had last year.  </li>
            <li>I love how the color looks so natural.</li>
            <li>Glad they fixed the smell.</li>
            <li>looks more natural anyway.</li>
            <li>The color is great, get pretty dark after two applications.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to wait until your skin is dry and that the product has been absorbed before dressing, but sometimes you just cannot wait that long</li>
            <li>First off, I LOVE the new scent of this product.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was a good investment.</li>
            <li>right away-</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and the medium does not make me look too dark.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good enough to not feel self conscious when wearing shorts or skirts.  </li>
            <li>You can even use tanning stickers to have cute lil tatttoos to show how white you were before.</li>
            <li>I bought this when the weather started getting warmer because my legs were a lovely shade of gray-blue white.</li>
            <li>Need to try it for first time to make sure it doesn&#x27;t yellow on your skin.</li>
            <li>I like this product because unlike most self-bronzers, this one actually moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li>It gives me the look of a light, natural tan.</li>
            <li>but it does have a great thick consistency that absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>This gives you a really pretty color.</li>
            <li>Also, be sure and apply regularly or it will start to fade and be patchy, as will all self tanning products, spray tans, etc.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell of this one...not like the first ones by the same company...</li>
            <li>It really does reduce the appearance of cellulite!  </li>
            <li>I priced this in local drugstores and the price I found here was much more affordable.</li>
            <li>I have woken up in the middle of the night and no nasty DHA smell on my clothes, skin or sheets.</li>
            <li>it does have a floral scent to it when you first put it on (so maybe not for guys)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dont dislike but can be streaky unless you REALLY rub!</li>
            <li>and after a few days you could really tell and it looked good.</li>
            <li>so so excited about the fact that my legs look naturally brown and healthy, and the cellulite from my recent weight loss is almost completely gone already!</li>
            <li>Both products have give me large brown spots on my legs - that look like freckles that are about 1/4\\&quot; to 3/8\\&quot; in diameter.  </li>
            <li>it certainly works; you do get darker.</li>
            <li>It certainly does have  a smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it all.</li>
            <li>:) New version smells similar to a gourmand fragrance...</li>
            <li>so I have to exfoliate every day and it really does make a difference in the application.  </li>
            <li>really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very fair-skinned, and I buy the Medium to Tan toned lotion, because the stain is much darker</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s much easier to blend</li>
            <li>Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were very apologetic.  </li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I use this product from time to time and I enjoy it immensely!</li>
            <li>I did not like this product because it contained too much perfume.  </li>
            <li>and I did not expect much to begin with.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time to tan, nor can I really tan.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>The scent really is reduced from old-school tanning lotions.  </li>
            <li>I do not have time to go to the tanning bed, and I really want to avoid all the negatives of the tanning bed as well(like skin cancer).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak much to the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>absolutely unacceptable</li>
            <li>If you want an immediate sun-kissed look, suggest you use Lancôme&#x27;s Flash Bronzer; but for everyday, this one is nice because it does moisturize well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most natural looking I&#x27;ve found outside of the tanning bed or the sun.</li>
            <li>I mean sometimes I do a good job,</li>
            <li>This Jergens product gives me a color that makes my half-German skin look naturally tan and just right.  </li>
            <li>I used jergens natural glow for a year &amp; it never turned out right.</li>
            <li>I only recommend the light for those with incredibly light skin who generally can&#x27;t tan naturally.</li>
            <li>like so many other tanners  </li>
            <li>I have very light skin but use the medium to dark lotion.</li>
            <li>AND IT REALLY HELPS WITH DRY SKIN AND GIVE A LIGHT COLOR</li>
            <li>One caution is if I used it many days in a row, it would start to irritate the skin in more delicate areas such as the neck and chest.  </li>
            <li>If I could make a list of products that I couldn&#x27;t live without, this would be one of them!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff - bu-bye pasty arms and legs and hello summer dresses!</li>
            <li>I figured trying the firming version couldn&#x27;t hurt, but just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the extra cost any more, so I&#x27;ve switched to the medium tanning lotion without the firming due to the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I notice that my legs look better and the cellulitle is much less noticeable, so</li>
            <li>Jergens Natural Glow has always been great, so I feel like I just got the bottom of an old box that was left outside for several years and</li>
            <li>but I took the tape off and upon squeezing out the lotion from the spout, the lotion also squeezed out a hole in the top making a mess.</li>
            <li>throughout winter to look a tad bit healthier and to amplify normal tanning in the summer.</li>
            <li>Its okay to go everyday for a month.</li>
            <li>I normally have olive skin, but I feel like a ghost once my summer tan fades.</li>
            <li>Not little splotches here and there, but massive ones than can color from blue to red and greens, reaching in lengths of up to five inches spreading three inches across in great big splotches.</li>
            <li>This is why I love this stuff: 1) Acts as a true moisturizing lotion for everyday use (sometimes tanners dry out the skin) 2)</li>
            <li>As for the firming benefits, I definitely think my legs look firmer and the cellulite is less noticeable, but to be honest anytime</li>
            <li>It does smell a little when first applied but not nearly as bad as before</li>
            <li>If you start to notice new brown spots or moles discontinue use immediately.</li>
            <li>The new version says it&#x27;s \\&quot;without odor.\\</li>
            <li>started using the new formula a couple of weeks ago</li>
            <li>Only change was brown splotching on top, absolutely no change on sides.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff every day to give my skin a very natural looking glow.</li>
            <li>But so far I have high hopes for the product.</li>
            <li>im just very sensitive to this smell..</li>
            <li>It looks so natural after about 3 days!  </li>
            <li>The first several pictures are what the product *</li>
            <li>This product does not turn orange and no streaking so far!</li>
            <li>First of all, tanners are only streaky if you don&#x27;t know how to put them on correctly.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a dark tan, this isn&#x27;t the product for you but works great to make darker tanning products last longer and less spotty as it disappears.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the pictures, which advertise the new version, I received 2 bottles of the STINKY old version.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few days and already can tell a huge difference in my color.</li>
            <li>An added bonus is that I feel that daily use really helped as far as the appearance of  firming.</li>
            <li>so I gave it another try and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>When this tube is gone I will probably order another since I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to tan naturally and also, I don&#x27;t want skin cancer.</li>
            <li>I go through bottles of Jergens Natural Glow body lotion like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li>I have naturally olive skin.</li>
            <li>The old version smells</li>
            <li>However, I know I have sensitive skin, so this may not happen to you.</li>
            <li>It lasts a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have enough to really care</li>
            <li>I have been using Jergens Natural Glow for about 3 yrs.</li>
            <li>I really like this, but use it only in spring and summer.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect any &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; action, but I still like Jergens for its price point and predictability.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Jergens Natural Glow for years.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any change at all in my cellulite but, being a 40-something year old</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any streaking, just a really nice base color to start the summer with :)</li>
            <li>this formula is a little more thick than the original</li>
            <li>Twice I have tried using it - first the regular Natural Glow lotion and then a year later the Firming Lotion.  </li>
            <li>Now I remember having the same problem 2 summers ago and had the same issue --- the first time I used Natural Glow.</li>
            <li>He tried some in his teen years and said it left a mess every where, and the most it ever worked was underdeath his knees and on his hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really dark like continuosly lying in the tanning bed will give you, but that isn&#x27;t what I was going for.</li>
            <li>The new version definitely has a</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave yellow streaks and looks very natural on my skin type.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally in a hurry, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with streakiness with this Jergens tanner.</li>
            <li>28 year old daughter has used this product for several years - with no added brown spots, moles, or streaking.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not orange at all, smells like regular lotion, and builds a gradual, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s technically &amp;#34;too dark&amp;#34; for my skin, it still looks natural.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars only because it does not actually &#x27;firm&#x27; anything.</li>
            <li>have been using self tanners for years and this is a big improvement over the old ones.</li>
            <li>The packaging didn&#x27;t look like this one, but it had all the same labels: medium to tan color, firming lotion, Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow, etc.</li>
            <li>It took three or four days for the color to be noticeable and it&#x27;s the same natural color as before.  </li>
            <li>My skin has turned a nice bronze color that doesn&#x27;t look fake or overdone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should say I recommend this product for this purpose: if your legs are SUPER white and you want to get a little color on them before showing them off to the world.</li>
            <li>I was previously using the fair to medium version of this lotion, but found I had to use it every day for there to be any noticeable color, so I switched to medium and figured I could use it just a few times a week, using regular (cheaper) body lotion on other days.</li>
            <li>Having a little bit of color just makes everything more even and helps conceal the little bit of cellulite I do have.</li>
            <li>The color is a little on the orange side, and after using it for 4 days I noticed a pretty defined line from ankle to foot (i.e. foot was white, ankle was tan) but it did what I wanted it to do: gave my legs a nice brown color that won&#x27;t blind the passersby.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks when I apply a thin layer evenly.</li>
            <li>I applied quite a bit on right after a shower and gave a few minutes to dry.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Not the best</li>
            <li> And I have to say i&#x27;m impressed!!</li>
            <li> The best thing about this tanner is no stinking self tanner scent!</li>
            <li> It works wonderful.  </li>
            <li> so this is a great alternative!  </li>
            <li> This lotion is great!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product and will visit this store again.</li>
            <li> But I have not seen any streaks, and my skin looks beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> and she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s firming abilities, but this is a very good tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> The odor of tanning products always bothered me but this one smells good!  </li>
            <li> I get compliments on my beautiful tan</li>
            <li> I tried this Jergens version, for Fair to Medium skin tones, and it&#x27;s PERFECT.  </li>
            <li> I use the \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; version of this lotion and get great results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but do not order it from this seller (Toys &amp; Gifts</li>
            <li> I used it anyway because it gave great color.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  </li>
            <li> This self tan is great.  </li>
            <li> it is of great quality</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> This sunless tanning lotion works beautifully but you need to keep on using it every day to achieve a good tan</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s authentic and delivered in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This tanner is really great though and does a good job of creating a gradual color change.</li>
            <li> so while this was effective, i say tread with caution!</li>
            <li> However for something to keep as a great moisturizer I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> I use the fair to medium in the winter &amp; the medium to tan in the spring &amp; summer months.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with the good things, i applied it to my legs and arms</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;ll be good if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> It is as a good moisturizer......</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> Just what I want...a nice toasty color done gradually but you will be happy with it after one use....</li>
            <li> Does smell good and moisturize though.</li>
            <li> one tip about using it... works best on clean, well-exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li> While I love this product and trust Jergens, I was happy to see that they added a firming solution to the product line.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and my skin is softer and retains more moisture.</li>
            <li> this is nice to have on while still having a good scent off the lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, and looks really good.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> the girls at my work started using it now and love their results!  </li>
            <li> No need for sun love this!</li>
            <li> I have been complemented on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; many times!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This shouldn&#x27;t smell as strong as self tanner, because it isn&#x27;t one, and it also doesn&#x27;t deliver color that great either.</li>
            <li> The product itself is amazing</li>
            <li> I thought the color looked nice, but what&#x27;s the point when I don&#x27;t want to show off my skin?</li>
            <li> My favorite was L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Glow, but they seem to have discontinued the Fair Skin version.</li>
            <li> In all honestly.</li>
            <li> You can lay in a nice warm bed &amp; listen to relaxing music.</li>
            <li> So If you are ok with bleaching your towels, or can buy darker towels you are good.</li>
            <li> now and it gives my skin a nice tint and glow.</li>
            <li> Use it every 3 days or so...to keep a nice even tone to your skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the lotion on the pic got the cheapest kind of lotion.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product.just be sure  to wash your hands good after applying.</li>
            <li> properties but, let&#x27;s be honest, it has</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it gave me a darker appearance with a bit of a glow affect (hence the name)...</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan very easily</li>
            <li> It gives me an awesome glow and adds to any natural tan I have.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as others (but it still smells) and covered up my whiteness!</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you exfoliate though every time you are going to use it.  </li>
            <li> and so it&#x27;s more of an &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> You can darken more if you need to by applying more often.</li>
            <li> My skin looks noticeably more tan after just a couple hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite thing by any stretch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product has been clogging my pores, so I will be throwing my tube away.  </li>
            <li> Use more to get darker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it conistently for about 2 years now and have received so many compliments on how tan I am</li>
            <li> Gives you a nice lightly bronzed glow  </li>
            <li> Although most of you like this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is quite lovely.</li>
            <li> Yeah, people complain about you having a greater risk of cancer.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on my sexy beach like tan.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it looks, it gave me the color i was looking for.</li>
            <li> so i have to keep buying more.</li>
            <li> I love this product as a moisturizer</li>
            <li> i guess i was hoping to look more bronzed?</li>
            <li> All in all, this product is a fantastic alternative to skin cancer and premature aging!</li>
            <li> Ok I have used two bottles of this stuff.</li>
            <li> , will def be getting some more :)  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION</li>
            <li> I was already bald on top.</li>
            <li> a tiempo : )</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I also love that this tanning lotion has firming elements, which leaves my skin softer and tighter.  </li>
            <li> (I wait about 10 minutes after application to make sure it dries).</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this all summer for sure.</li>
            <li> /..i bought this at Walgreens and was very excited to use it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a whole lot more pleasant.</li>
            <li> but it smells pretty good to me.</li>
            <li> A couple days of using this has made a significant improvement!</li>
            <li> thats easy to remedy though, and i became more vigilant after i noticed.</li>
            <li> very sweet.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of giving a bit of natural color.  </li>
            <li> it gave me a nice natural tan and glow, i&#x27;m in love!  </li>
            <li> &amp; its easy, but</li>
            <li> It is easy to work..and will not turn your skin orange..</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve heard really great reviews on the foaming, so i think i&#x27;ll try that one next :)</li>
            <li> It also has this strong smell that my bf hates.</li>
            <li> I also have found that mixing it with face lotion and using it on your face works fine too.</li>
            <li> If you do not use gloves, make sure to wash your hands, otherwise they will turn super orange.</li>
            <li> The huge improvement is the smell.  </li>
            <li> 1 HUGE WARNING</li>
            <li> This works great for people that don&#x27;t have the time to lay outside or hit a tanning bed!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy buying specialty stuff without the hassle of going to the store and reading labels and the drive etc.  </li>
            <li> Always wash hands after applying and smooth on evenly.</li>
            <li> so again, use this when you dont plan on doing anything important afterward.</li>
            <li> Nothing can be done because it&#x27;s genetics, and tanning/UV light will make my condition even worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a great self tanner.</li>
            <li> I buy this every year at the beginning of the summer to  get a light tan before going for my beach vacation.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so silky and smooth</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good, the color of the tan looks natural and it does not stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not SUPER-fair, my hair is brown, but I&#x27;m too fair for the L&#x27;Oreal product to look natural.  </li>
            <li> this means no streaks and super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $8-$12 depending on where you buy and totally worth it!  </li>
            <li> Take full advantage of free shipping and the convenience of having these items delivered to your front door.  </li>
            <li> I love it,it &#x27;s exactly what I wantes</li>
            <li> If this is your first time using it, make sure you don&#x27;t do three days in a row...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells like tanning lotion, not unpleasant, which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li> really love it because it not only kind of clears up my skin, but it evens out my skin-tone.</li>
            <li> /cover up with a variety of perfumes and still feel feminine &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> and it honestly looks very natural not orangey like an oompa loompa.  </li>
            <li> Gives me a natural looking tan and I love the fragrance!  </li>
            <li> It gives you a nice, even color that looks totally natural!  </li>
            <li> I use Jergens in the summertime on my legs and it is a nice, natural looking self tanner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> All in all, for the price, its not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the difference in a few hours was amazing, with no streaking or smudging.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten lucky before b/c</li>
            <li> highly doubt this will hide my spider veins, but maybe make the sight more bareable.</li>
            <li> Smells really good (only true for the &amp;#34;+ Firming&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I happened to see the new bottle because this product works so well.</li>
            <li> and I love the new look.  </li>
            <li> I really like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li> So I was pretty excited about this product&#x27;s development!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I finished the bottle I was bikini body ready!!</li>
            <li> I liked this product before, but now that they eliminated the &amp;#34;burnt-skin&amp;#34; smell that you typically get from tanning beds or self-tanners, it&#x27;s MUCH better.</li>
            <li> It imparts color gradually, so it&#x27;s easy enough to stop when you&#x27;re satisfied.</li>
            <li> It was great to use this product so that I could get a little color, moisture and firmness all in one shot.</li>
            <li> Safe and natural way to tan and doesn&#x27;t streak if you follow instructions.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin and this color isn&#x27;t too much for me, even as it&#x27;s starting to become winter.</li>
            <li> It left me feeling greasy but it did gradually give me a nice tan.</li>
            <li> What I really liked is it didn&#x27;t have a funky odor that the product had last year.  </li>
            <li> I love how the color looks so natural.</li>
            <li> Glad they fixed the smell.</li>
            <li> looks more natural anyway.</li>
            <li> The color is great, get pretty dark after two applications.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to wait until your skin is dry and that the product has been absorbed before dressing, but sometimes you just cannot wait that long</li>
            <li> First off, I LOVE the new scent of this product.</li>
            <li> Other than that it was a good investment.</li>
            <li> right away-</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and the medium does not make me look too dark.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good enough to not feel self conscious when wearing shorts or skirts.  </li>
            <li> You can even use tanning stickers to have cute lil tatttoos to show how white you were before.</li>
            <li> I bought this when the weather started getting warmer because my legs were a lovely shade of gray-blue white.</li>
            <li> Need to try it for first time to make sure it doesn&#x27;t yellow on your skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product because unlike most self-bronzers, this one actually moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li> It gives me the look of a light, natural tan.</li>
            <li> but it does have a great thick consistency that absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> This gives you a really pretty color.</li>
            <li> Also, be sure and apply regularly or it will start to fade and be patchy, as will all self tanning products, spray tans, etc.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell of this one...not like the first ones by the same company...</li>
            <li> It really does reduce the appearance of cellulite!  </li>
            <li> I priced this in local drugstores and the price I found here was much more affordable.</li>
            <li> I have woken up in the middle of the night and no nasty DHA smell on my clothes, skin or sheets.</li>
            <li> it does have a floral scent to it when you first put it on (so maybe not for guys)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dont dislike but can be streaky unless you REALLY rub!</li>
            <li> and after a few days you could really tell and it looked good.</li>
            <li> so so excited about the fact that my legs look naturally brown and healthy, and the cellulite from my recent weight loss is almost completely gone already!</li>
            <li> Both products have give me large brown spots on my legs - that look like freckles that are about 1/4\\&quot; to 3/8\\&quot; in diameter.  </li>
            <li> it certainly works; you do get darker.</li>
            <li> It certainly does have  a smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it all.</li>
            <li> :) New version smells similar to a gourmand fragrance...</li>
            <li> so I have to exfoliate every day and it really does make a difference in the application.  </li>
            <li> really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned, and I buy the Medium to Tan toned lotion, because the stain is much darker</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s much easier to blend</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were very apologetic.  </li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> I use this product from time to time and I enjoy it immensely!</li>
            <li> I did not like this product because it contained too much perfume.  </li>
            <li> and I did not expect much to begin with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to tan, nor can I really tan.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> The scent really is reduced from old-school tanning lotions.  </li>
            <li> I do not have time to go to the tanning bed, and I really want to avoid all the negatives of the tanning bed as well(like skin cancer).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak much to the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> absolutely unacceptable</li>
            <li> If you want an immediate sun-kissed look, suggest you use Lancôme&#x27;s Flash Bronzer; but for everyday, this one is nice because it does moisturize well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most natural looking I&#x27;ve found outside of the tanning bed or the sun.</li>
            <li> I mean sometimes I do a good job,</li>
            <li> This Jergens product gives me a color that makes my half-German skin look naturally tan and just right.  </li>
            <li> I used jergens natural glow for a year &amp; it never turned out right.</li>
            <li> I only recommend the light for those with incredibly light skin who generally can&#x27;t tan naturally.</li>
            <li> like so many other tanners  </li>
            <li> I have very light skin but use the medium to dark lotion.</li>
            <li> AND IT REALLY HELPS WITH DRY SKIN AND GIVE A LIGHT COLOR</li>
            <li> One caution is if I used it many days in a row, it would start to irritate the skin in more delicate areas such as the neck and chest.  </li>
            <li> If I could make a list of products that I couldn&#x27;t live without, this would be one of them!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff - bu-bye pasty arms and legs and hello summer dresses!</li>
            <li> I figured trying the firming version couldn&#x27;t hurt, but just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the extra cost any more, so I&#x27;ve switched to the medium tanning lotion without the firming due to the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I notice that my legs look better and the cellulitle is much less noticeable, so</li>
            <li> Jergens Natural Glow has always been great, so I feel like I just got the bottom of an old box that was left outside for several years and</li>
            <li> but I took the tape off and upon squeezing out the lotion from the spout, the lotion also squeezed out a hole in the top making a mess.</li>
            <li> throughout winter to look a tad bit healthier and to amplify normal tanning in the summer.</li>
            <li> Its okay to go everyday for a month.</li>
            <li> I normally have olive skin, but I feel like a ghost once my summer tan fades.</li>
            <li> Not little splotches here and there, but massive ones than can color from blue to red and greens, reaching in lengths of up to five inches spreading three inches across in great big splotches.</li>
            <li> This is why I love this stuff: 1) Acts as a true moisturizing lotion for everyday use (sometimes tanners dry out the skin) 2)</li>
            <li> As for the firming benefits, I definitely think my legs look firmer and the cellulite is less noticeable, but to be honest anytime</li>
            <li> It does smell a little when first applied but not nearly as bad as before</li>
            <li> If you start to notice new brown spots or moles discontinue use immediately.</li>
            <li> The new version says it&#x27;s \\&quot;without odor.\\</li>
            <li> started using the new formula a couple of weeks ago</li>
            <li> Only change was brown splotching on top, absolutely no change on sides.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every day to give my skin a very natural looking glow.</li>
            <li> But so far I have high hopes for the product.</li>
            <li> im just very sensitive to this smell..</li>
            <li> It looks so natural after about 3 days!  </li>
            <li> The first several pictures are what the product *</li>
            <li> This product does not turn orange and no streaking so far!</li>
            <li> First of all, tanners are only streaky if you don&#x27;t know how to put them on correctly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a dark tan, this isn&#x27;t the product for you but works great to make darker tanning products last longer and less spotty as it disappears.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the pictures, which advertise the new version, I received 2 bottles of the STINKY old version.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days and already can tell a huge difference in my color.</li>
            <li> An added bonus is that I feel that daily use really helped as far as the appearance of  firming.</li>
            <li> so I gave it another try and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> When this tube is gone I will probably order another since I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to tan naturally and also, I don&#x27;t want skin cancer.</li>
            <li> I go through bottles of Jergens Natural Glow body lotion like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li> I have naturally olive skin.</li>
            <li> The old version smells</li>
            <li> However, I know I have sensitive skin, so this may not happen to you.</li>
            <li> It lasts a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have enough to really care</li>
            <li> I have been using Jergens Natural Glow for about 3 yrs.</li>
            <li> I really like this, but use it only in spring and summer.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect any &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; action, but I still like Jergens for its price point and predictability.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jergens Natural Glow for years.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change at all in my cellulite but, being a 40-something year old</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any streaking, just a really nice base color to start the summer with :)</li>
            <li> this formula is a little more thick than the original</li>
            <li> Twice I have tried using it - first the regular Natural Glow lotion and then a year later the Firming Lotion.  </li>
            <li> Now I remember having the same problem 2 summers ago and had the same issue --- the first time I used Natural Glow.</li>
            <li> He tried some in his teen years and said it left a mess every where, and the most it ever worked was underdeath his knees and on his hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really dark like continuosly lying in the tanning bed will give you, but that isn&#x27;t what I was going for.</li>
            <li> The new version definitely has a</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave yellow streaks and looks very natural on my skin type.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally in a hurry, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with streakiness with this Jergens tanner.</li>
            <li> 28 year old daughter has used this product for several years - with no added brown spots, moles, or streaking.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not orange at all, smells like regular lotion, and builds a gradual, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s technically &amp;#34;too dark&amp;#34; for my skin, it still looks natural.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars only because it does not actually &#x27;firm&#x27; anything.</li>
            <li> have been using self tanners for years and this is a big improvement over the old ones.</li>
            <li> The packaging didn&#x27;t look like this one, but it had all the same labels: medium to tan color, firming lotion, Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow, etc.</li>
            <li> It took three or four days for the color to be noticeable and it&#x27;s the same natural color as before.  </li>
            <li> My skin has turned a nice bronze color that doesn&#x27;t look fake or overdone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should say I recommend this product for this purpose: if your legs are SUPER white and you want to get a little color on them before showing them off to the world.</li>
            <li> I was previously using the fair to medium version of this lotion, but found I had to use it every day for there to be any noticeable color, so I switched to medium and figured I could use it just a few times a week, using regular (cheaper) body lotion on other days.</li>
            <li> Having a little bit of color just makes everything more even and helps conceal the little bit of cellulite I do have.</li>
            <li> The color is a little on the orange side, and after using it for 4 days I noticed a pretty defined line from ankle to foot (i.e. foot was white, ankle was tan) but it did what I wanted it to do: gave my legs a nice brown color that won&#x27;t blind the passersby.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks when I apply a thin layer evenly.</li>
            <li> I applied quite a bit on right after a shower and gave a few minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> It leaves a big brown stain in the center of the sheets, which does come out with oxyclean and is why I only buy white sheets.  </li>
            <li> I put it on everyday as my normal lotion.</li>
            <li> The only con is that it does take some time to dry</li>
            <li> Added plus, after only two applications it has made my old stretch marks on my hip less noticeable!</li>
            <li> This product in particular is your usual Jergens lotion</li>
            <li> So now I try to wear long sleeves and and long pants, if I put it on before bed.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of jergans for a long time.</li>
            <li> However, being tanner makes cellulite less apparent.</li>
            <li> However, the color develops only after numerous days of use and never gets very dark.  </li>
            <li> After I put it on, I do let it dry for about 15 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> What I do is exfoliate while I am in the shower, then when I am out dry off and apply it all over my body using gloves.</li>
            <li> Make sure to WASH YOUR HANDS after use, and be careful around your heel area so as not to get that \\&quot;dirty look\\&quot; on your heels.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t exfoliate or scrub yourself dry with a towel after bathing while using this product to help avoid patches.</li>
            <li> However, they were only $5 each, approximately half of what it is in stores, so I&#x27;ll just deal with it.</li>
            <li> I like to have a little color for when I wear short sleeves</li>
            <li> though as with any sunless bronzer/lotion when it says be careful about puting it around your knees, elbows, ankles, washing yours hands after application you better heed their warning or you will be on here writing a bad review over something you were told to be careful about.</li>
            <li> Be careful using this product.  </li>
            <li> When i could&#x27;ve just spent 150 a year on tanning...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really tried other tanning lotions, but I&#x27;d have to say this one is astonishing!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it takes less time to dry (about 10 mins).</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it leaves a slight stain on any white towels I have.</li>
            <li> I used it and woke up the next morning and noticed a very little difference</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ll still use this product but less often than everyday.</li>
            <li> The old version smelled so bad like the original fake tanner smell that I couldn&#x27;t even finish the old bottle I bought.</li>
            <li> other times I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> truly doesn&#x27;t have the stench the other self tanners do.  </li>
            <li> I use it under and over other moisturizers...</li>
            <li> My co-worker used to give me the stink eye all summer due to the smell.</li>
            <li> Once you are done applying it, let it dry for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I found this a bit hard to rub in and it took a long time to dry and sink in.</li>
            <li> the bottom flap was broken WITH a piece of clear tape covering it!</li>
            <li> To me, being too dark just looks unnatural and overdone.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with tanning products</li>
            <li> I use St. Tropez Buffing Mitt to apply the lotion and it cuts down on the streaking factor.  </li>
            <li> It smelled sortof acidic, sharp, harsh.</li>
            <li> There is also brown lotion residue around the cap, which indicates it&#x27;s been leaking, previously opened, or tampered with.</li>
            <li> Half</li>
            <li> it was on the slightly yellow/orange side though.</li>
            <li> Price paid was much less than in stores</li>
            <li> &quot; That&#x27;s not entirely true.</li>
            <li> And with the spider veins, it was a mess of purple on white.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> My hands came out mess</li>
            <li> I had the one that says medium to tan, and I did not get that dark at all, and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I looked stupid until I got back in the shower and exfoliated my little butt off right there.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s suppose to firm, and make cellulite look less visible.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little over a week, and I can visibly see an improvement in my skin color.</li>
            <li> Probably meant for little darker people or it looks orangeish</li>
            <li> It also comes off a little on my socks and running shoes when working out, but it&#x27;s not like running down my body like self tanners of the past.</li>
            <li> In my case, I use it everyday</li>
            <li> If you want a color I would go with something else, unless you use it like everyday.</li>
            <li> round...</li>
            <li> I use this tanning lotion as my everyday lotion but about once a week I&#x27;ll switch it up with some coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> I wasted 300 bucks all together.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after I shower</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t smell it at all after it&#x27;s dried.  </li>
            <li> I am somewhat pale but havent had to work as hard with other products.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s purple on darker pale, and that&#x27;s just a few hours after my first use.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> I have a very little bit of cellulite and it has done nothing to it.</li>
            <li> and it really wasn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply it at night after my shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about</li>
            <li> 4) Not too thick and heavy to use on the face as well 5)</li>
            <li> , I usually apply it 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the firming part works though</li>
            <li> It does tan with out the orangie color as in the past.  </li>
            <li> I love tanning beds, but I know they&#x27;re awful for your skin</li>
            <li> I am very pale.</li>
            <li> This just gives you that pretty base tan look.</li>
            <li> The things I hate are that i went through one bottle really fast</li>
            <li> I like the color I slowly get with this.</li>
            <li> this stuff stinks just as bad as the original formula.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing at all to change the color of my skin.</li>
            <li> It was the basic skin firming, nothing fancy or expensive, reduced cellulite, toned, and firmed!</li>
            <li> So I switched to the Medium-Dark one, but I&#x27;m half-German and its color is too dark for me, looks fake, like Snooki&#x27;s tan on the repulsive JERSEY SHORE tv</li>
            <li> I also like that you don&#x27;t end up with an orange glow but a subtle outdoor color.</li>
            <li> The smell does smell like self tanner, but it&#x27;s not that bad, and not nearly as strong as a lot of other products.  </li>
            <li> it starts off not so bad but definitely worsens as time goes by.</li>
            <li> and I hated the smell so much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fair skin</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s streaky and dumb looking.</li>
            <li> it does, however, have a pretty miserable smell.</li>
            <li> , I try very hard not to look at my backside anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a very serious case of spider veins.</li>
            <li> Although it does darken the skin in about a week; it is a orange shaded tint that looks fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry -</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s still chilly here)....</li>
            <li> I stopped using any faux tanning products because I was afraid that they would smell bad too.  </li>
            <li> Not feminine at all and very difficult to cover up even with high-quality perfume.</li>
            <li> I also do not think that it stains clothing that bad.  </li>
            <li> They either stink, turn you orange or stain your clothes really bad.</li>
            <li> Works like it says it does don&#x27;t smell that bad</li>
            <li> but i am disappointed..</li>
            <li> and this lotion is my secret!!!</li>
            <li> After having horrible experiences with turning orange from self tanners, I was afraid to try another product but after my friend raved about this I thought id try it.</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> ..love the look hate the smell :</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell that terrible, but still smells like a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> BUT...the packaging was HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought the smell was horrible though.  </li>
            <li> but i smelled that horrible tan smell while i was aleep..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This works great for people that don&#x27;t have the time to lay outside or hit a tanning bed!  It looks so natural after about 3 days!  I get many compliments!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months now and I have had a lot of compliments on my tan.  People have been asking me, &amp;#34;Where did you get that tan?&amp;#34;  I work in a salon and a lot of the clients have asked me that question.  I have used this product in the past when it first came out and I hated the smell so much.  I stopped using any faux tanning products because I was afraid that they would smell bad too.  I was shopping in Walmart and noticed that Jergens had changed the formula regarding the smell so I gave it another try and was pleasantly surprised.  It&#x27;s not bad at all.  I use St. Tropez Buffing Mitt to apply the lotion and it cuts down on the streaking factor.  You have to make sure you exfoliate though every time you are going to use it.  In my case, I use it everyday so I have to exfoliate every day and it really does make a difference in the application.  I also do not think that it stains clothing that bad.  It&#x27;s best to wait until your skin is dry and that the product has been absorbed before dressing, but sometimes you just cannot wait that long and it really wasn&#x27;t bad.  I usually apply it at night after my shower.  All in all, for the price, its not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Be careful using this product.  Twice I have tried using it - first the regular Natural Glow lotion and then a year later the Firming Lotion.  Both products have give me large brown spots on my legs - that look like freckles that are about 1/4\\&quot; to 3/8\\&quot; in diameter.  Then the second time the Firming lotion also created several brown moles of the same size - which I know where caused by the lotion because they suddenly appeared within a week of starting to use this product.  I also got orange streaking on my legs, even though I tried to rub it in really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 28 year old daughter has used this product for several years - with no added brown spots, moles, or streaking.  So my advice to you is to proceed with caution.  If you start to notice new brown spots or moles discontinue use immediately.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It&#x27;s not orange at all, smells like regular lotion, and builds a gradual, natural looking tan. I am very fair-skinned, and I buy the Medium to Tan toned lotion, because the stain is much darker and so it&#x27;s more of an &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; effect on my skin. Even though it&#x27;s technically &amp;#34;too dark&amp;#34; for my skin, it still looks natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really tried other tanning lotions, but I&#x27;d have to say this one is astonishing!&lt;br /&gt;I really love it because it not only kind of clears up my skin, but it evens out my skin-tone. If you want a color I would go with something else, unless you use it like everyday. However for something to keep as a great moisturizer I absolutely love this! If I could make a list of products that I couldn&#x27;t live without, this would be one of them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about it&#x27;s firming abilities, but this is a very good tanning lotion.  Doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as others (but it still smells) and covered up my whiteness! When this tube is gone I will probably order another since I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to tan naturally and also, I don&#x27;t want skin cancer.</li>
            <li> Gives me a natural looking tan and I love the fragrance!  The odor of tanning products always bothered me but this one smells good!  I am fair skinned and the medium does not make me look too dark.  You can darken more if you need to by applying more often.</li>
            <li> I am a regular indoor &amp; outdoor tanner. I&#x27;ve tried every brand of sunless tanning lotion out there. They either stink, turn you orange or stain your clothes really bad. I was convinced they all did that....... until I tried this! I use the fair to medium in the winter &amp; the medium to tan in the spring &amp; summer months. This stuff smells good, the color of the tan looks natural and it does not stain my clothes. After I put it on, I do let it dry for about 15 minutes or so. I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I go through bottles of Jergens Natural Glow body lotion like nobody&#x27;s business. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I have naturally olive skin. I use the \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; version of this lotion and get great results. My skin looks noticeably more tan after just a couple hours. With repeated applications, skin gets darker/richer tone. I use it year round... throughout winter to look a tad bit healthier and to amplify normal tanning in the summer. I get compliments on my beautiful tan *ALL THE TIME* and this lotion is my secret!!! It&#x27;s a great product, but do not order it from this seller (Toys &amp; Gifts USA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned, I have been using the product for years. Click on the very last picture offerred by this seller. That&#x27;s what the bottles used to look like. The first several pictures are what the product *currently* looks like in stores. (Note the shimmery blue bar about 1/3 from the bottom.) The old version smells disGUSSSSSSting. I like to use lotion after showers at night, but my boyfriend would complain about the smell. And if used in the morning or before a date, I would smell the stench on myself hours after using it. It smelled sortof acidic, sharp, harsh. Not feminine at all and very difficult to cover up even with high-quality perfume. I used it anyway because it gave great color. The new version says it&#x27;s \\&quot;without odor.\\&quot; That&#x27;s not entirely true. The new version definitely has a smell-- it&#x27;s just a whole lot more pleasant. :) New version smells similar to a gourmand fragrance... very sweet. It&#x27;s not my favorite thing by any stretch. But it&#x27;s much easier to blend/cover up with a variety of perfumes and still feel feminine &amp; clean. So I was pretty excited about this product&#x27;s development!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the pictures, which advertise the new version, I received 2 bottles of the STINKY old version. There is also brown lotion residue around the cap, which indicates it&#x27;s been leaking, previously opened, or tampered with. I would not recommend buying from this seller (Toys &amp; Gifts USA). However, they were only $5 each, approximately half of what it is in stores, so I&#x27;ll just deal with it. You get what you pay for. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. one tip about using it... works best on clean, well-exfoliated skin. Otherwise, yes, it will wash off the very next time you shower.</li>
            <li> On day 4 or 5, when the color started developing, I started to breakout on my chest and shoulders. I thought the color looked nice, but what&#x27;s the point when I don&#x27;t want to show off my skin? I realized the only change in my routine was this lotion and stopped applying it. As soon as I stopped using this, the breakouts stopped. Now I remember having the same problem 2 summers ago and had the same issue --- the first time I used Natural Glow. I didn&#x27;t relate the breakouts with this product now. I&#x27;m sure this product has been clogging my pores, so I will be throwing my tube away.  However, I know I have sensitive skin, so this may not happen to you. Just keep this in mind if you decide to try this product out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of self-tanners. My favorite was L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Glow, but they seem to have discontinued the Fair Skin version. So I switched to the Medium-Dark one, but I&#x27;m half-German and its color is too dark for me, looks fake, like Snooki&#x27;s tan on the repulsive JERSEY SHORE tv show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried this Jergens version, for Fair to Medium skin tones, and it&#x27;s PERFECT.  I&#x27;m not SUPER-fair, my hair is brown, but I&#x27;m too fair for the L&#x27;Oreal product to look natural.  This Jergens product gives me a color that makes my half-German skin look naturally tan and just right.  Not fakey at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like tanning lotion, not unpleasant, which is fine with me.  It seems earlier versions of the product had a stronger odor some objected to.  You can shower it off a couple hours after applying and then it leaves no odor at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo, Jergens!  And PLEASE don&#x27;t discontinue the Fair-to-Medium product, like L&#x27;Oreal did!</li>
            <li> Finally, an almost no smelling tanning lotion. Very easy to use. No streaking. Good price. Use more to get darker.</li>
            <li> I use this tanning lotion as my everyday lotion but about once a week I&#x27;ll switch it up with some coconut oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it conistently for about 2 years now and have received so many compliments on how tan I am and it honestly looks very natural not orangey like an oompa loompa.  Half the girls at my work started using it now and love their results!  This is why I love this stuff: 1) Acts as a true moisturizing lotion for everyday use (sometimes tanners dry out the skin) 2) Doesn&#x27;t streak 3) Smells really good (only true for the &amp;#34;+ Firming&amp;#34;) 4) Not too thick and heavy to use on the face as well 5) Gives you a nice lightly bronzed glow  I go through about 1 tube of this stuff every 2 weeks.  It&#x27;s $8-$12 depending on where you buy and totally worth it!  I can&#x27;t live without this stuff - bu-bye pasty arms and legs and hello summer dresses!</li>
            <li> It gives a nice artificial tan, but firming no. I have used this product for months now with no firming effects. Your legs might look slimmer when tanned but that is all it will do.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. I have been using it for a few days and already can tell a huge difference in my color. What I do is exfoliate while I am in the shower, then when I am out dry off and apply it all over my body using gloves. If you do not use gloves, make sure to wash your hands, otherwise they will turn super orange. I also have found that mixing it with face lotion and using it on your face works fine too. Once you are done applying it, let it dry for a few minutes. So far I haven&#x27;t had any streaking, just a really nice base color to start the summer with :)</li>
            <li> Although most of you like this product. I still don&#x27;t fancy it. I used jergens natural glow for a year &amp; it never turned out right. The smell is quite lovely. &amp; its easy, but once you take a shower &amp; shave it starts to fade off. In all honestly. Don&#x27;t waste your money, go to a tanning salon &amp; get a real tan. Yeah, people complain about you having a greater risk of cancer. But tanning is so relaxing. You can lay in a nice warm bed &amp; listen to relaxing music. You can even use tanning stickers to have cute lil tatttoos to show how white you were before. You don&#x27;t get cancer from tanning. It only effects you if you go everyday for 6 months straight. Its okay to go everyday for a month. Take a break for a month &amp; go again. I always get compliments on my sexy beach like tan. &amp; how it infact hides stretch marks. Jergans isn&#x27;t the same. I wasted 300 bucks all together. When i could&#x27;ve just spent 150 a year on tanning...</li>
            <li> While I love this product and trust Jergens, I was happy to see that they added a firming solution to the product line.  I love the way it feels on my legs.  On another note, I will not buy from KAO Brands, the Seller again.  I received the product with tape on it which should have been a clue but I took the tape off and upon squeezing out the lotion from the spout, the lotion also squeezed out a hole in the top making a mess. Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - The Seller contacted me and promptly refunded my money.  They were very apologetic.  I would buy from this vendor again.  I would give them another chance.</li>
            <li> I bought this when the weather started getting warmer because my legs were a lovely shade of gray-blue white. I should say I recommend this product for this purpose: if your legs are SUPER white and you want to get a little color on them before showing them off to the world. The color is a little on the orange side, and after using it for 4 days I noticed a pretty defined line from ankle to foot (i.e. foot was white, ankle was tan) but it did what I wanted it to do: gave my legs a nice brown color that won&#x27;t blind the passersby.</li>
            <li> No need for sun love this!</li>
            <li> After having horrible experiences with turning orange from self tanners, I was afraid to try another product but after my friend raved about this I thought id try it. This product does not turn orange and no streaking so far! Added plus, after only two applications it has made my old stretch marks on my hip less noticeable!</li>
            <li> I use Jergens in the summertime on my legs and it is a nice, natural looking self tanner.  I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I am very pale. I don&#x27;t tan very easily so I decided to try this out. There are some things I like and dislike about the product. I&#x27;ll start with the good things, i applied it to my legs and arms and they got darker within 30 minutes. It lasts a pretty long time. I love the way it looks, it gave me the color i was looking for. It doesn&#x27;t turn you orange at all. Another thing is i&#x27;ve heard people don&#x27;t like the smell but it smells pretty good to me. It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks. The things I hate are that i went through one bottle really fast so i have to keep buying more. If you apply it a lot however your skin turns yellow-ish looking so I have to take breaks, I usually apply it 3 times a week. Not the best but i like it and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I have been using it the last two summers and it really works.  It gives me an awesome glow and adds to any natural tan I have. Does not smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it leaves a slight stain on any white towels I have. So If you are ok with bleaching your towels, or can buy darker towels you are good.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  I have used this for about 3 years.  It doesn&#x27;t leave yellow streaks and looks very natural on my skin type.  Need to try it for first time to make sure it doesn&#x27;t yellow on your skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product from time to time and I enjoy it immensely! I also enjoy buying specialty stuff without the hassle of going to the store and reading labels and the drive etc.  Take full advantage of free shipping and the convenience of having these items delivered to your front door.  This product in particular is your usual Jergens lotion and I have never had a problem...it&#x27;s authentic and delivered in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product because it contained too much perfume.  I would not recommend this to anyone and would not buy it again</li>
            <li> First of all, tanners are only streaky if you don&#x27;t know how to put them on correctly. I mean sometimes I do a good job, other times I don&#x27;t so it&#x27;s streaky and dumb looking. This tanner is really great though and does a good job of creating a gradual color change. It doesn&#x27;t smell that terrible, but still smells like a tanning lotion. And then about the firming, nothing can really permanently firm you except exercise. However, being tanner makes cellulite less apparent. So that&#x27;ll be good if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. But don&#x27;t use this if you just want to be firmer.</li>
            <li> I love it,it &#x27;s exactly what I wantes</li>
            <li> Safe and natural way to tan and doesn&#x27;t streak if you follow instructions.  Always wash hands after applying and smooth on evenly.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every day to give my skin a very natural looking glow. I used it and woke up the next morning and noticed a very little difference and after a few days you could really tell and it looked good. The firming part, however, does nothing. I have a very little bit of cellulite and it has done nothing to it. I don&#x27;t have enough to really care and I did not expect much to begin with. I gave it 4 stars only because it does not actually &#x27;firm&#x27; anything. I love this product as a moisturizer and i would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like it since it moisturizes my skin as well gives it a tanning effect that I like without having to go out and physical get affected by the suns damaging rays.</li>
            <li> I like this product because unlike most self-bronzers, this one actually moisturizes well.  However, the color develops only after numerous days of use and never gets very dark.  If you want an immediate sun-kissed look, suggest you use Lancôme&#x27;s Flash Bronzer; but for everyday, this one is nice because it does moisturize well.  One caution is if I used it many days in a row, it would start to irritate the skin in more delicate areas such as the neck and chest.  Overall, I&#x27;ll still use this product but less often than everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any sort of product like this, but in the midst of some winter blues i gave it a try. I like the fact that it is a lotion and not a spray on tan or anything. this means no streaks and super easy to apply. it does, however, have a pretty miserable smell. it starts off not so bad but definitely worsens as time goes by. i recommend using this at night, assuming you&#x27;ll shower in the morning. it certainly works; you do get darker. it was on the slightly yellow/orange side though. i guess i was hoping to look more bronzed? the lotion leaves a hint of sparkle all over too. so again, use this when you dont plan on doing anything important afterward. I was a bit lax about washing my hands right away- big mistake. definitely had some funky-colored hands. thats easy to remedy though, and i became more vigilant after i noticed. so while this was effective, i say tread with caution!</li>
            <li> I have been using Jergens Natural Glow for about 3 yrs. now and it gives my skin a nice tint and glow. I have been complemented on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; many times!</li>
            <li> I really like this, but use it only in spring and summer.  It gives my legs just enough color so that I don&#x27;t look like a ghost when I go out.</li>
            <li> I liked this product before, but now that they eliminated the &amp;#34;burnt-skin&amp;#34; smell that you typically get from tanning beds or self-tanners, it&#x27;s MUCH better.</li>
            <li> First off, I LOVE the new scent of this product. The old version smelled so bad like the original fake tanner smell that I couldn&#x27;t even finish the old bottle I bought. I&#x27;m so glad I happened to see the new bottle because this product works so well. I put it on everyday as my normal lotion. It gives me the look of a light, natural tan. If you&#x27;re looking for a dark tan, this isn&#x27;t the product for you but works great to make darker tanning products last longer and less spotty as it disappears. I have very light skin but use the medium to dark lotion. I only recommend the light for those with incredibly light skin who generally can&#x27;t tan naturally. All in all, this product is a fantastic alternative to skin cancer and premature aging!</li>
            <li> truly doesn&#x27;t have the stench the other self tanners do.  Also supposed to help cellulite. I didn&#x27;t use it consistently enough to test that but it does have a great thick consistency that absorbs well.  That&#x27;s a WINNER!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to tan, nor can I really tan. I have a very serious case of spider veins. Not little splotches here and there, but massive ones than can color from blue to red and greens, reaching in lengths of up to five inches spreading three inches across in great big splotches. Nothing can be done because it&#x27;s genetics, and tanning/UV light will make my condition even worse.&lt;br /&gt;So think of legs that have never seen sun in about 15 years +. My legs were pale-pale. And with the spider veins, it was a mess of purple on white.&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s purple on darker pale, and that&#x27;s just a few hours after my first use.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t that bad. There is a smell, but it&#x27;s like any sort of skin cream. I like the scent of it actually.&lt;br /&gt;I highly doubt this will hide my spider veins, but maybe make the sight more bareable. Honestly, the difference in a few hours was amazing, with no streaking or smudging. I applied quite a bit on right after a shower and gave a few minutes to dry. Nothing rubbed off on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I have been wanting to use self tanning lotion for years, but husband told me to forget it. He tried some in his teen years and said it left a mess every where, and the most it ever worked was underdeath his knees and on his hands. My hands came out mess free.&lt;br /&gt;Will see how this does with my cellulite too. But so far I have high hopes for the product.</li>
            <li> This sunless tanning lotion works beautifully but you need to keep on using it every day to achieve a good tan</li>
            <li> Ok I have used two bottles of this stuff. I use it everyday after I shower and it&#x27;s suppose to firm, and make cellulite look less visible. It doesn&#x27;t make cellulite go away like you would expect, and it doesn&#x27;t really firm much either, but I guess I&#x27;m buying hope. It also has this strong smell that my bf hates. He always asks me if I put self tanner on. This shouldn&#x27;t smell as strong as self tanner, because it isn&#x27;t one, and it also doesn&#x27;t deliver color that great either. I had the one that says medium to tan, and I did not get that dark at all, and I use it everyday. I do want to try the Jergen&#x27;s express though... Guess I will try something else for firming.</li>
            <li> This self tan is great.  No need for pantyhose.  It is easy to work..and will not turn your skin orange..like so many other tanners  Use it every 3 days or so...to keep a nice even tone to your skin.  It will soften skin as well.</li>
            <li> I did my research before I bought this product.  And I have to say i&#x27;m impressed!! it gave me a nice natural tan and glow, i&#x27;m in love!  I&#x27;m not fair skin i&#x27;m acutally olive complextion and I love the new look.  I&#x27;m running out already, will def be getting some more :)  The only con is that it does take some time to dry i&#x27;ve heard really great reviews on the foaming, so i think i&#x27;ll try that one next :)</li>
            <li> I was previously using the fair to medium version of this lotion, but found I had to use it every day for there to be any noticeable color, so I switched to medium and figured I could use it just a few times a week, using regular (cheaper) body lotion on other days. I have extremely fair skin and this color isn&#x27;t too much for me, even as it&#x27;s starting to become winter. I like to have a little color for when I wear short sleeves and I wear shorts in the gym every day. Having a little bit of color just makes everything more even and helps conceal the little bit of cellulite I do have. However, I do not think this has any firming effects. I figured trying the firming version couldn&#x27;t hurt, but just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the extra cost any more, so I&#x27;ve switched to the medium tanning lotion without the firming due to the price.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using self tanners for years and this is a big improvement over the old ones. It stays on you, unless you rub it off and goes on evenly. It certainly does have  a smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it all. I put it on before bed, after I shower, and find it does come off on my sheets if I sweat in my sleep, which I tend to do. It leaves a big brown stain in the center of the sheets, which does come out with oxyclean and is why I only buy white sheets.  So now I try to wear long sleeves and and long pants, if I put it on before bed. It also comes off a little on my socks and running shoes when working out, but it&#x27;s not like running down my body like self tanners of the past. I never notice it coming on the rest of my clothes, and it always comes out in the wash.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the lotion on the pic got the cheapest kind of lotion. Never ordering again. Id prefer to go to walmart for the same price</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION I USE IT DAILY AND IT REALLY HELPS WITH DRY SKIN AND GIVE A LIGHT COLOR AS WELL. THANKS</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for months and the local store ran out so I ordered three of them from Amazon. The packaging didn&#x27;t look like this one, but it had all the same labels: medium to tan color, firming lotion, Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow, etc. It does nothing. I mean nothing at all to change the color of my skin. Jergens Natural Glow has always been great, so I feel like I just got the bottom of an old box that was left outside for several years and the chemicals no longer work in them.</li>
            <li> this is nice to have on while still having a good scent off the lotion. I used this during my off season from summer so I can still keep my tone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect any &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; action, but I still like Jergens for its price point and predictability.  The scent really is reduced from old-school tanning lotions.  You can still wear perfume and smell it rather than the tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I found this a bit hard to rub in and it took a long time to dry and sink in. It left me feeling greasy but it did gradually give me a nice tan. Not sure if the firming part works though</li>
            <li> It was great to use this product so that I could get a little color, moisture and firmness all in one shot. shop at home too</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my legs as summer is upon us.  What I really liked is it didn&#x27;t have a funky odor that the product had last year.  This is the 2nd year I have used Jergens tanning  lotion.  It does tan with out the orangie color as in the past.  I recommend this product.just be sure  to wash your hands good after applying. It is as a good moisturizer......</li>
            <li> I recently shaved my head and wanted to accelerate the \\&quot;browning\\&quot;. I was already bald on top. Used for a week, AM and PM always after showering. Only change was brown splotching on top, absolutely no change on sides. Worthless.</li>
            <li> Me gusto!  El producto es igual al que esta en la foto, llego en buen estado y a tiempo : )</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. I do not have time to go to the tanning bed, and I really want to avoid all the negatives of the tanning bed as well(like skin cancer). This gives you a really pretty color. It&#x27;s not really dark like continuosly lying in the tanning bed will give you, but that isn&#x27;t what I was going for. To me, being too dark just looks unnatural and overdone. This just gives you that pretty base tan look. As for the firming benefits, I definitely think my legs look firmer and the cellulite is less noticeable, but to be honest anytime I get a tan I notice that my legs look better and the cellulitle is much less noticeable, so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s the lotion that is actually firming, or if it&#x27;s just the fact that it gives you a tan. I love how the color looks so natural. It doesn&#x27;t streak or look orange at all. It&#x27;s very easy to use, and looks really good. Make sure to WASH YOUR HANDS after use, and be careful around your heel area so as not to get that \\&quot;dirty look\\&quot; on your heels. I use a sponge to apply to the backs of my hands. Also, be sure and apply regularly or it will start to fade and be patchy, as will all self tanning products, spray tans, etc. Don&#x27;t exfoliate or scrub yourself dry with a towel after bathing while using this product to help avoid patches. I really love this lotion. It&#x27;s the most natural looking I&#x27;ve found outside of the tanning bed or the sun. The smell does smell like self tanner, but it&#x27;s not that bad, and not nearly as strong as a lot of other products.  I use it at night about an hour before bed and then shower in the morning and it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this tanner is no stinking self tanner scent! I also like that you don&#x27;t end up with an orange glow but a subtle outdoor color. An added bonus is that I feel that daily use really helped as far as the appearance of  firming.</li>
            <li> I like the color I slowly get with this. I can&#x27;t speak much to the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; properties but, let&#x27;s be honest, it has it&#x27;s work cut out for it with that claim!!</li>
            <li> Works like it says it does don&#x27;t smell that bad But it does work and a tan body makes you look thinner can&#x27;t beat the price Get Some!</li>
            <li> I use it under and over other moisturizers...It works wonderful.  Just what I want...a nice toasty color done gradually but you will be happy with it after one use....I was...and I love the smell of this one...not like the first ones by the same company...Glad they fixed the smell.</li>
            <li> This is the only self tanner I will use. I&#x27;m generally in a hurry, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with streakiness with this Jergens tanner. It imparts color gradually, so it&#x27;s easy enough to stop when you&#x27;re satisfied. Once I&#x27;ve reached that point, instead of applying daily, I&#x27;ll use it a couple of times a week. I really like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell to it. Another plus is that I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it discoloring my clothing or, if used at night, my sheets. Overall, I think this is a great self tanner.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion!  It gives you a nice, even color that looks totally natural!  I love tanning beds, but I know they&#x27;re awful for your skin so this is a great alternative!  I also love that this tanning lotion has firming elements, which leaves my skin softer and tighter.  It really does reduce the appearance of cellulite!  I will definitely be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! I have been using it for a little over a week, and I can visibly see an improvement in my skin color. I normally have olive skin, but I feel like a ghost once my summer tan fades. A couple days of using this has made a significant improvement! My skin has turned a nice bronze color that doesn&#x27;t look fake or overdone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no streaking and the color hasn&#x27;t rubbed off on any of my clothes (I wait about 10 minutes after application to make sure it dries). It smells great, and my skin is softer and retains more moisture. Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The product itself is amazing it is of great quality BUT...the packaging was HORRIBLE. the bottom flap was broken WITH a piece of clear tape covering it! absolutely unacceptable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jergens Natural Glow for years.  It does a great job of giving a bit of natural color.  I&#x27;ve always thought the smell was horrible though.  My co-worker used to give me the stink eye all summer due to the smell. (no pun intended)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the new formula a couple of weeks ago and I love it.  It took three or four days for the color to be noticeable and it&#x27;s the same natural color as before.  The huge improvement is the smell.  It does smell a little when first applied but not nearly as bad as before and I can&#x27;t smell it at all after it&#x27;s dried.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any change at all in my cellulite but, being a 40-something year old, I try very hard not to look at my backside anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This probably won&#x27;t make you look like you&#x27;ve been to the islands or in the tanning bed but it&#x27;s good enough to not feel self conscious when wearing shorts or skirts.  It&#x27;s a heck of a lot cheaper than a spray tan and the color looks more natural anyway.</li>
            <li> I priced this in local drugstores and the price I found here was much more affordable. Very happy with this product and will visit this store again.</li>
            <li> Although it does darken the skin in about a week; it is a orange shaded tint that looks fake. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I buy this every year at the beginning of the summer to  get a light tan before going for my beach vacation. It is easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks when I apply a thin layer evenly.</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it gave me a darker appearance with a bit of a glow affect (hence the name)...but I noticed when I would go shave or shower it seemed like it would come off some. Other than that it was a good investment.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with tanning products..love the look hate the smell :/..i bought this at Walgreens and was very excited to use it but i smelled that horrible tan smell while i was aleep..it woke me lol im just very sensitive to this smell..but anyways i will continue to use but i am disappointed..</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of jergans for a long time. I bought a bottle of the skin firming lotion just because after my daughter was born. I needed lotion any way and what the hell, if the skin firming works ..yay, if not.. I still have my lotion. After I finished the bottle I was bikini body ready!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! It was the basic skin firming, nothing fancy or expensive, reduced cellulite, toned, and firmed! So when I saw this product after I lost all the weight after my second child I HAD TO BUY IT. Let me tell you I was NOT dissapointed. I did buy the darker one...shame on me. But it didn&#x27;t even have a devistating effect and my legs have not seen the sun in *sigh* 6 or 7 years...but after just 4 days of use, I am wearing the vintage denim skirt I picked up and am so so so excited about the fact that my legs look naturally brown and healthy, and the cellulite from my recent weight loss is almost completely gone already! My skin feels so silky and smooth I love it! I could not reccomend this product highly enough. Try it you will not be dissapointed. 1 HUGE WARNING though as with any sunless bronzer/lotion when it says be careful about puting it around your knees, elbows, ankles, washing yours hands after application you better heed their warning or you will be on here writing a bad review over something you were told to be careful about. I accidently rubbed my hand across my ankle....yeah I looked stupid until I got back in the shower and exfoliated my little butt off right there. But I have not seen any streaks, and my skin looks beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> Finally - they did it! this formula is a little more thick than the original but it doesn&#x27;t have that DHA stink and it takes less time to dry (about 10 mins). I&#x27;ve put this on the last two nights about an hour before bed and worn a sweat shirt (it&#x27;s still chilly here)....no smell. I have woken up in the middle of the night and no nasty DHA smell on my clothes, skin or sheets. The color is great, get pretty dark after two applications. If this is your first time using it, make sure you don&#x27;t do three days in a row...take a day off or you will \\&quot;freckle\\&quot; even if you exfoliate. Way to go Jergens...I&#x27;ll be using this all summer for sure. P.S. it does have a floral scent to it when you first put it on (so maybe not for guys)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RETRACTION!!! I&#x27;m sorry - I lied to you. I must have gotten lucky before b/c this stuff stinks just as bad as the original formula. NO THANK YOU - return</li>
            <li> Dont dislike but can be streaky unless you REALLY rub! I am somewhat pale but havent had to work as hard with other products. Does smell good and moisturize though. Probably meant for little darker people or it looks orangeish</li>
            <li> My wife regularly uses this product.  Price paid was much less than in stores and she is very happy with it.</li>
