            <li>/&gt;BOX LOOKS CHEAP AND FALLS APART&lt;</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the original one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentlemanly without being wimpy, sexy without smelling like a gigolo and crisp without smelling like a fruit basket.</li>
            <li>After my 10 day wait, I guess it&#x27;s always well worth it!</li>
            <li>Many commented positively on the smell.</li>
            <li>I had always received a good product UNTIL my last purchase on June 19th 2010.</li>
            <li>Adequate packing.</li>
            <li>el tiempo de entrega es super rapido y el producto de muy buena calidad los felcito y muchas gracias saludos</li>
            <li>If you want a good, clean smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower (and lasts a while), this is money well spent.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>JUST RIGHT.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spray too much or too quickly before an event becasue</li>
            <li>I wear a lot of colognes, this is one of my very favorites!</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I had to by it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is lightly spicy, but not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I will never buy it again from the same place, but will pay more to get it from Khols</li>
            <li>I would have paid lots more for the same product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>the initial sprays are strong...</li>
            <li>, it is not the regular scent, it smells more like alcohol with some similar perfume than the original Hugo Energise scent that I know very well.    </li>
            <li>It is fresh and very soft</li>
            <li>Really a quality product.</li>
            <li>so I asked around family members and friends and they confirmed that both bottles don&#x27;t smell the same.</li>
            <li>with out over powering a room thanks for making it affordable</li>
            <li>GREAT SCENT, NEVER GET TIRED OF IT.  </li>
            <li>so I guess that&#x27;s how much perfume there is inside.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the real one - go somewhere else</li>
            <li>I bought this product before and it doesn&#x27;t smell or last like the original.</li>
            <li>Spray light and enjoy heavily!</li>
            <li>Nice perfume, it last all day long.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this produto and shop</li>
            <li>Reallycool and not as popular as the other Hugo scents so you can feel like you are wearing something different.</li>
            <li>This is a terrific scent, with a clean, masculine scent.</li>
            <li>I would try to return it, but I don&#x27;t live in the USA</li>
            <li>The scent is young but not \\&quot;high</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this very same REAL cologne before and lasts HOURS 8+ even after showering!</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NOT TOO STRONG OR HEAVY,</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere anymore near my hometown.  </li>
            <li>and it is for young prople.</li>
            <li>so far I like the way it&#x27;s smelling on me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely the real deal.</li>
            <li>It starts out as strongly citrus and dies down to a longer lasting musk with citrus notes.</li>
            <li>I have a really active lifestyle and this spray has been useful in both business and social situations.</li>
            <li>I still have some left from my old one and when I compared the smell</li>
            <li>On July 17th (almost a month later) I finally tried the new bottle and</li>
            <li>The scent takes a little getting used to at first as it is grapefruit like.</li>
            <li>very soft and long lasting.</li>
            <li>but it is the first time that I have had any trouble with a purchase, I will try not to buy anything else here ever again.    </li>
            <li>definetly recommend to anyone who likes long lasting soft smells</li>
            <li>the product DOES NOT smell the same, it&#x27;s a VERY watered down knockoff or something, I don&#x27;t know how to describe this</li>
            <li>so I just placed the new bottle next to the other one in my bathroom.    </li>

            <li> definetly recommend to anyone who likes long lasting soft smells</li>
            <li> the product DOES NOT smell the same, it&#x27;s a VERY watered down knockoff or something, I don&#x27;t know how to describe this</li>
            <li> so I just placed the new bottle next to the other one in my bathroom.    </li>
            <li> It has a very subtle citrus smell that is not too strong but it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It has a very long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> Does not last very long; wears off in a couple of hours</li>
            <li> It is a subtle scent that really lasts.</li>
            <li> , i tried for 2 weeks and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last that much, average quality</li>
            <li> , I still had some left of the previous bottle</li>
            <li> I recommend it to any gentleman,  its characteristic odor leaves the other fascinated people.</li>
            <li> and it has a bitter scent to it</li>
            <li> some reason, I have a hard time finding this in local retail stores,though --</li>
            <li> It turned out to be a watered down version.</li>

            <li> , I have my purchases sent to an address that I have in the USA and they reship things to my address in my country, so returning the product would be a bit expensive for me.    </li>
            <li> Sorry to hear Boss is not longer producing it</li>

            <li> excellent recomended 100%</li>
            <li> I chose this rate because the product complies with the request exatamete.&lt;br /&gt;I like the timeliness of the delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;and highly recommend this produto and shop</li>
            <li> This is truly the best perfume for men I have ever tried. It is not too soft or to rough, it can be used in any season and lasts all day. Really a quality product.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband. It smells very good. He loves it. I would recommend this cologne and seller to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and it was in the best condition when i received it</li>
            <li> My girlfriend got this for me and it is great. The scent is young but not \\&quot;high school\\&quot;. It starts out as strongly citrus and dies down to a longer lasting musk with citrus notes. Reallycool and not as popular as the other Hugo scents so you can feel like you are wearing something different. Don&#x27;t spray too much or too quickly before an event becasue the initial sprays are strong...allow it time to breath on you. Well worth it. The girls love it.</li>
            <li> Guys, if you want to impress a woman and have her around your neck or over your chest at all times, then go and get this product!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere anymore near my hometown.  Found it on Amazon for about $20 less than what I used to pay in stores (and still no shipping charges; also arrived in less than a week)...</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift from my dad couple of years ago and got hooked to it. Many commented positively on the smell. I would definitely recommend this to all age groups...</li>
            <li> I have used this spray for 2+ years and will continue to do so. It has a very subtle citrus smell that is not too strong but it lasts all day. I have a really active lifestyle and this spray has been useful in both business and social situations. I bought the 2.5 oz sized bottle and it lasted me about 15 months so this is a great valued product.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this perfume since 2006 through amazon.com (Ships from and sold by Amazon.com), whenever I run out of it I just order another 4.2 ounces bottle. I had always received a good product UNTIL my last purchase on June 19th 2010. - The product arrived and everything seemed fine so I didn&#x27;t even test it, I still had some left of the previous bottle so I just placed the new bottle next to the other one in my bathroom.    On July 17th (almost a month later) I finally tried the new bottle and the product DOES NOT smell the same, it&#x27;s a VERY watered down knockoff or something, I don&#x27;t know how to describe this but there is something wrong with the scent, it is not the regular scent, it smells more like alcohol with some similar perfume than the original Hugo Energise scent that I know very well.    I thought that I was going crazy so I asked around family members and friends and they confirmed that both bottles don&#x27;t smell the same. - This is not the only thing I have bought from amazon.com but it is the first time that I have had any trouble with a purchase, I will try not to buy anything else here ever again.    I would try to return it, but I don&#x27;t live in the USA, I have my purchases sent to an address that I have in the USA and they reship things to my address in my country, so returning the product would be a bit expensive for me.

            <li> Nice perfume, it last all day long. It is the best of breed. Sorry to hear Boss is not longer producing it</li>
            <li> The bottle doesn&#x27;t have any cap and taking it for travel is gonna be awful. With nothing to cover the nozzle, I noticed that the perfume has leaked a bit.</li>
            <li> Hugo makes my favorite fragrances that match my personality. with out over powering a room thanks for making it affordable</li>
            <li> GREAT SCENT, NEVER GET TIRED OF IT.  IT&#x27;S NOT TOO STRONG OR HEAVY, JUST RIGHT.</li>
            <li> man it is good, get alot of compliments. I highly reccomend this colonge if you plan to win the heart of that special girl.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. its great for my boyfriend. why are so many words required for this review!!! Need three more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually wearing this scent today as I write this so I can tell you with some authority that it really gives your well dressed look the perfect aura. Another grown up choice.</li>
            <li> It is a great perfum, smeal so good and it is for young prople. This perfum is very good. Ok</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. the price is very good. I use it for every occasion, I received charm...I recommend it. It is fresh and very soft</li>
            <li> Great cologne, thanks! I love all the Hugo Boss colognes and this one is my favorite, again thank you so much!</li>
            <li> excellent product as described by the great aroma persists simply no doubt that is one of my favorites hope to buy it if necessary.</li>
            <li> My dad wanted this for Christmas. Got it at a great price.</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of colognes, this is one of my very favorites! Next day, grab your shirt and give it a whiff, you will still smell the great fragrance of Hugo Energise!</li>
            <li> This is a nice scent. I smelled some at the store today. It smells kind of familiar though. I held off on purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;Some of it got on my sweatshirt and so far I like the way it&#x27;s smelling on me. So I may go back and get it.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve ever had.  Smells are very hard to describe but I love it.  This and Obsession by Calvin Kline are my favorites.</li>
            <li> It is a good perfume. I recommend it to any gentleman,  its characteristic odor leaves the other fascinated people. Excellent product</li>
            <li> I currently using it. It has a very long lasting fragrance. After a while it does smell like a little tobacco-y!! But i like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hugo Boss Energise since 2005. This is the first time that I had to by it from Amazon. It turned out to be a watered down version. The box says 79% volume so I guess that&#x27;s how much perfume there is inside. The rest is something else. I still have some left from my old one and when I compared the smell - there&#x27;s a huge difference. If you are looking for the real one - go somewhere else, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do.</li>
            <li> The bottle have escape... :(</li>
            <li> SOY DE VENEZUELA, ME LLEGO EN PERFECTO COMO LO ESPERABA, MUY BUENO EL PREDUCTO YA LO HE COMPRADO EN OTRAS OPORTUNIDAD ESTE PERFUME Y ME ENCANTA NO LO CAMBIO POR NADA</li>
            <li> Awesome product and a magnet for attention. This fragrance grabs the sensory glands of everyone around. Spray light and enjoy heavily!</li>
            <li> Great perfume, excellent smell, perfect price,just GREAT, but the only wrong about this: it was not sealed... Please check that in future orders...</li>
            <li> el articulo es justo lo que esperaba, el articulo se encontraba en perfecto estado y sin detalles, lo recomiendo 100%, excelente</li>
            <li> I recieved it on time, the product is amazing, great quality, smell good! It&#x27;s the original one. I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> I bought some of this a couple of years ago at a TJ Maxx on a whim and it is my favorite scent of all time. It&#x27;s gentlemanly without being wimpy, sexy without smelling like a gigolo and crisp without smelling like a fruit basket. To me, it smells like very clean laundry on steroids. If you want a good, clean smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower (and lasts a while), this is money well spent.</li>
            <li> Lets start off by saying that this Cologne is a good Cologne. The scent takes a little getting used to at first as it is grapefruit like. It is a subtle scent that really lasts. I sprayed it on my jacket and it lasted over a week. I got tons of comments on it and one girl who borrowed my jacket didn&#x27;t wanna give it back. Great Cologne and great bottle.</li>
            <li> This Hugo is the best for day is exquisite, the people turn at look at you only for how u smell is realy nice i love it</li>
            <li> ITS A CHEAP KNOCK OFF....&lt;br /&gt;SIGH....&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS LIKE ALCOHOL.&lt;br /&gt;CAME NOT SEALED&lt;br /&gt;BOX LOOKS CHEAP AND FALLS APART&lt;br /&gt;ITS SUPPOSE TO BE A GIFT. BUT I CANT USE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WANT MY MONEY BACK....</li>

            <li> Very nice cologne, been warring it nearly 10 years now! But, when ordering it, it doesn&#x27;t give you the opportunity to overnight it! After my 10 day wait, I guess it&#x27;s always well worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product before and it doesn&#x27;t smell or last like the original. I will never buy it again from the same place, but will pay more to get it from Khols</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband since this has been his cologne for years and recently run out. BTW I love how it smells! It smells sooo good! It&#x27;s definitely the real deal. This comes in a big bottle and won&#x27;t run out anytime soon. I bought it for 30-something dollars so that was a good deal because at a mall, perfume store, etc. I would have paid lots more for the same product. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Does not last very long; wears off in a couple of hours</li>
            <li> great scent love this cologne. very soft and long lasting. definetly recommend to anyone who likes long lasting soft smells</li>
            <li> The scent sticks almost all day. It smells great. I recommend it for everyday use so even after working hours you&#x27;ll got the scent.</li>
            <li> Very good product, smells very nice!</li>
            <li> Bought this for hubby for Valentine&#x27;s day and he loved it, too.  Sure beats not having to go fight the crowds at the mall and pay full price for this perfume. It has a very sexy and manly smell.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  I&#x27;ve actually been very happy with most of the Hugo Boss scents,but this is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, I have a hard time finding this in local retail stores,though -- so, Amazon to the rescue!</li>
            <li> It came perfect in the box and smells great. I will be buying it again off here when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, everything is great!</li>
