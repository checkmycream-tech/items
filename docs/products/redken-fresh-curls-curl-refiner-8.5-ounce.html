    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have tried the CC caviar because I had heard it was the best, but I am keeping with the redken one.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair with this wonderful fragrant smell.</li>
            <li>This is the greatest curl cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t happen to have it laying around, I never would have gotten so many compliments on my hair at Christmas with my family!!!</li>
            <li>It is very good and the price is fair.</li>
            <li>Great product for curly/frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is great because it helps to define my curls</li>
            <li>Smells great too.</li>
            <li>This cream was amazing!</li>
            <li>Every one I have tried has washed away a fair amount of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good thing.</li>
            <li>Gives good body, minimizes frizz, no product buildup.  </li>
            <li>is noy good.</li>
            <li>Then you will have gorgeous bouncy healthy looking curls and not crunchy!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine so the top layer always is fly-away, and this is the best I&#x27;ve found for keeping it nice.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Im convinced it is this product that caused this kind of reasction..</li>
            <li>Never washed it, but ran it in luke warm water while taking a shower.</li>
            <li>I have tried a ton of products over the years; this is the best by far!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best detangler conditioner I have used.  </li>
            <li>Best product I have found to control frizz and create soft curls.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>if i want a more defined curl, i will sometimes mix it with a lightweight gel and scrunch.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>but really it&#x27;s more for frizz control and softening your hair.</li>
            <li>It works wonders--and may even be better (for my needs) than the Redken curl cream.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Curl Refiner for about a year and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this because it keeps my curls separate and hair not frizzy.</li>
            <li>So many times they change a formula</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re all for results, you may love this.</li>
            <li>I would like more but its discontinued</li>
            <li>The stuff works wonderfully for my long blond curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and in 45 years have never used anything as great as this product.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to like this product, but again, nothing else performs as good.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise the frizzies easily appear.</li>
            <li>Stays in your hair all day with easy manageability and no frizz.  </li>
            <li>Why did they stop making this - it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This product is light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Who knew one product could have such great results?</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not as good as the old one.</li>
            <li>You would think I would know this by know after having curly hair my whole life!!!</li>
            <li>Makes my long hair look great all day.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and works OK, but honestly I have the same or better results with most other bargain brands, like Garnier or Aussie or Frizz Ease.</li>
            <li>So, maybe I&#x27;ve only tried cheap brands before and this was the first time I \\&quot;splurged\\&quot; on hair products, but this is really a great product!:)&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i can use it in place of mousse which is great because with this hair, it is easy to have product build up and washing it everyday</li>
            <li>The smell is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>(- that isn&#x27;t super perfumy!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have super curly and course hair.</li>
            <li>It smells great and does not weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly very fine hair, not corse.  </li>
            <li>This is such a good product for my fine hair to help my hair stay soft and curly.</li>
            <li>Redken Fresh Curls eats your hair</li>
            <li>I applied the Fresh Curls.</li>
            <li>bought a group of 10 tubes of Redken Fresh Curls.</li>
            <li>I also have the Redken fresh curls mouse and the Tigi Curlesque styling products this is my fav.</li>
            <li>have pretty uncontrollable hair (medium, natural curls that LOOOVE to frizz), and this is the most controlled I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li>This is the only product that defines my curls perfectly without any heavy build up.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, light, light hold, clumps curls well enough.  </li>
            <li>This shipper is always very fast to get the products out.</li>
            <li>, it rinses out very easily, unlike other brands where you can still feel the product in your hair after showering and it leaves your hair looking really heavy/flat (like Garnier products do!)!</li>
            <li>I am an Black woman with fine, naturally wavy/curly hair and this product really works good for me.</li>
            <li>The Beyond he Zone cream prevents my hair from staying crunchy from the gel and really does kick up the curls!</li>
            <li>Now that this product is discontinued, and word on the internet is that their new curl line isn&#x27;t nearly as good, I looked around a few review sites and message boards to see what people were using as a replacement--and I found a GREAT product that I hope will help other people looking for the same thing.</li>
            <li>I always get told my hair looks great when I use this, and you only need a little bit-a dime size-</li>
            <li>The only problem is I have to use a HUGE amount each time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>This really helps.</li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t offer much hold.</li>
            <li>Was fast shipping also.</li>
            <li>I also suggested it a friend with thick wavy hair and she loved it just as much.</li>
            <li>I can still smell my hair for hours and not in a good way, it&#x27;s a decent grassy clean scent that&#x27;s drowned out by a very chemical scent, it smells like a hair relaxer a little.  </li>
            <li>then i took benedrill and went to bed straight after and and 3 hours later i develped rash and hives much wose than the first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and sticky, but natural looking and with a nice smell</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li>bought the Redken Fresh Curls Curl Refiner and the Redken Mousse at the same time, and I use them both in my hair together.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found out Redkin has a new on in place of this one</li>
            <li>so I bought two of this one not wanting to take a chance on the new one.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because i do have to use A LOT of this product for it to manage my frizz and because it has a very soft hold</li>
            <li>After that, I use 2 small pumps of this cream to add more curl, bounce, and softness before diffusing again.</li>
            <li>Curls were soft, manageable &amp; they stayed in place!</li>
            <li>Previously blamed it on different color safe shampoo/conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that can even kind of tame my hair!</li>
            <li>I use a little of it when my hair is almost dry to smooth strands and give it a nice scent... but not something I&#x27;d waste my money on again.</li>
            <li>Cannot find it anywhere near me.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair, no treatments and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy--just makes the natural wave come out.</li>
            <li>so my curls usually won&#x27;t last the whole day.</li>
            <li>The other mouse&#x27;s and cream&#x27;s do fine on my hair while its short</li>
            <li>It has a nice creamy texture which will separate or break apart the slightly crusted bunches if I rub my hands down my hair once or twice.</li>
            <li>Must wet hair first though.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair soft, without completely weighing it down or making it look like there&#x27;s too much product in it.</li>
            <li>One of the very few products I&#x27;ve used on my fine curly hair that actually does moisturize my hair.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful not to use too much or your hair will have a crunchy/wet look.</li>
            <li>a quarter sized dollop of this helps define my waves--greatly reducing frizz (when it&#x27;s dry, i often put a very small amount of frizz serum over the top).</li>
            <li>My hair appears dry and soft but not frizzy or fuzzy.</li>
            <li>I live in very humid FL and so am always looking for a product that can contain my curls without making them hard, brittle or sticky.  </li>

            <li> I live in very humid FL and so am always looking for a product that can contain my curls without making them hard, brittle or sticky.  </li>
            <li> Also hard to judge how much to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that this is no longer available in beauty salons/ supply stores.</li>
            <li> My hair is waist long with a lot of waves and some curls.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time too!</li>
            <li> Like the Redken cream, I use it after using gel and diffusing my hair until it&#x27;s almost dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I towel dry my hair a bit, I style it</li>
            <li> like my hair to at least come off looking as natural as possible, without the sense of a million products in it, and this product helps me achieve that result!</li>
            <li> I have ordered a few times and this time my product did seem to be &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; or it appeared to be less product than normal.  </li>
            <li> I flip my head over and put rub it slightly between my hands, put on, then put in on all the outside layer after flipping my head upright again, then blow dry with a dffuser.</li>
            <li> I either end up with half my hair usually the back dry and fluffy while the front or top gets stiff and hard and wet looking.</li>
            <li> I apply it with my hair still dripping wet.</li>
            <li> Might as well get the stuff that&#x27;s only a few dollars on sale at a store.</li>
            <li> and this is the only product I have found to tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other after wash product but this.</li>
            <li> I found the MAIN cause of my blonde colored hair turning that ugly brassy yellow color.</li>
            <li> so I can wear my hair down &amp; curly which I never ever do.</li>
            <li> This product leaves all my hair looking the same without none of it looking stiff or hard none of it is fluffy either.</li>
            <li> now that my curls are getting a little length to them.</li>
            <li> Try it for your curls, not too heavy and defintely not greasy.</li>

            <li> I went to the hair dressor, after she washed my hair and trimmed it, she applied the prouduct over my hair.when i came home i had a terrible night mare and when i woke up my body and scalp,face,legs,back were covered in really bad hives and rash...It was hard for me to breathe..then i took benedrill and went to bed straight after and and 3 hours later i develped rash and hives much wose than the first time.Im convinced it is this product that caused this kind of reasction..i know this because the itching and burning started from the scalp.. I am never going to use this item again........  DONT GET THIS PROUDCT</li>
            <li> WARNING: I found the MAIN cause of my blonde colored hair turning that ugly brassy yellow color. Redken Fresh Curls eats your hair color!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I colored my hair 3 days prior. Never washed it, but ran it in luke warm water while taking a shower. I applied the Fresh Curls. Later that night I noticed my hair was brassy. I used this stuff all through my hair. Previously blamed it on different color safe shampoo/conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always thought the cause of brassy was one of my \\&quot;COLOR SAFE\\&quot; shampoos or conditioners I&#x27;ve been going through. I never believe \\&quot;color safe\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners. Every one I have tried has washed away a fair amount of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a group of 10 tubes of Redken Fresh Curls. Cannot find it anywhere near me. The stuff works wonderfully for my long blond curly hair. I apply it with my hair still dripping wet. It has a nice creamy texture which will separate or break apart the slightly crusted bunches if I rub my hands down my hair once or twice. Giving my curls a controlled bounce. A good thing. The only problem is I have to use a HUGE amount each time I wash my hair. Otherwise the frizzies easily appear. Small dabs or a couple of lines in the palm don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and works OK, but honestly I have the same or better results with most other bargain brands, like Garnier or Aussie or Frizz Ease. I use a little of it when my hair is almost dry to smooth strands and give it a nice scent... but not something I&#x27;d waste my money on again. Might as well get the stuff that&#x27;s only a few dollars on sale at a store.</li>
            <li> i have thin, dry, wavy hair. a quarter sized dollop of this helps define my waves--greatly reducing frizz (when it&#x27;s dry, i often put a very small amount of frizz serum over the top). it leaves my hair soft, without completely weighing it down or making it look like there&#x27;s too much product in it. if i want a more defined curl, i will sometimes mix it with a lightweight gel and scrunch.</li>
            <li> This is such a good product for my fine hair to help my hair stay soft and curly. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair, no treatments and I use Redken Shampoo and Conditioner. I don&#x27;t use any other after wash product but this. It works by camling the frizz I suffer with and keeping my curls from seperating. I have thin hair, so when my curls seperate it looks fuzzy. This really helps. Try it for your curls, not too heavy and defintely not greasy. I also suggested it a friend with thick wavy hair and she loved it just as much.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best detangler conditioner I have used.  I get a lot of compliments on my hair, since I&#x27;ve been using this hair product.  It&#x27;s a winner, and I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
            <li> I am an Black woman with fine, naturally wavy/curly hair and this product really works good for me. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy--just makes the natural wave come out.</li>
            <li> Why did they stop making this - it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Yes, i have spiral springy curls and I absolutely love this product.  However, alone it&#x27;s not 100% , you need the mousse as well. Then you will have gorgeous bouncy healthy looking curls and not crunchy!</li>
            <li> This cream will help to define curls but wont leave them feeling crispy. It has a tiny bit of hold to it but really it&#x27;s more for frizz control and softening your hair. The smell is clean and fresh. I love this product and use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I still get frizz and this doesn&#x27;t offer much hold. I have to mix it with gel to get any long-lasting curl definition.</li>
            <li> I buy several bottles of this product at one time because I&#x27;m so afraid of running out! I have extremely thick, frizzy, curly hair and this is the only product I have found to tame the frizz. It smells great and does not weigh the hair down. Just be careful not to use too much or your hair will have a crunchy/wet look.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found to control frizz and create soft curls.  I have tried hundreds of products.  I am very disappointed this product seems to be discontinued by Redken.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly/frizzy hair.  It is a lotion and not a gel so it has a softer feel and is not crunchy.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Now that this product is discontinued, and word on the internet is that their new curl line isn&#x27;t nearly as good, I looked around a few review sites and message boards to see what people were using as a replacement--and I found a GREAT product that I hope will help other people looking for the same thing. It&#x27;s called Beyond The Zone Noodle Head Kick Up Your Curls Curling Creme and they have it on Amazon too. It works wonders--and may even be better (for my needs) than the Redken curl cream. Like the Redken cream, I use it after using gel and diffusing my hair until it&#x27;s almost dry. After that, I use 2 small pumps of this cream to add more curl, bounce, and softness before diffusing again. The Beyond he Zone cream prevents my hair from staying crunchy from the gel and really does kick up the curls! It also smells great--like coconut, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It is very good and the price is fair. I have tried the CC caviar because I had heard it was the best, but I am keeping with the redken one.</li>
            <li> I also have the Redken fresh curls mouse and the Tigi Curlesque styling products this is my fav. now that my curls are getting a little length to them. The other mouse&#x27;s and cream&#x27;s do fine on my hair while its short but when it starts getting longer its impossible to get the product in even. Also hard to judge how much to use. I either end up with half my hair usually the back dry and fluffy while the front or top gets stiff and hard and wet looking. This product leaves all my hair looking the same without none of it looking stiff or hard none of it is fluffy either. My hair appears dry and soft but not frizzy or fuzzy. It just looks the way I want it to, with my curls under control.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that defines my curls perfectly without any heavy build up. It leaves my hair with this wonderful fragrant smell. It&#x27;s unfortunate that this is no longer available in beauty salons/ supply stores.</li>
            <li> This shipper is always very fast to get the products out. I have ordered a few times and this time my product did seem to be &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; or it appeared to be less product than normal.  But I will order again and count this shippment as a &amp;#34;fluke&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! When I found out that it was discontinued, I bought 8 bottles of it! It&#x27;s the only thing that can even kind of tame my hair!</li>
            <li> So, maybe I&#x27;ve only tried cheap brands before and this was the first time I \\&quot;splurged\\&quot; on hair products, but this is really a great product!:)&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and sticky, but natural looking and with a nice smell (- that isn&#x27;t super perfumy!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Redken Fresh Curls Curl Refiner and the Redken Mousse at the same time, and I use them both in my hair together.&lt;br /&gt;After I towel dry my hair a bit, I style it and then I put in the Curl Refiner. After that I only need a bit of the mousse to take care of the last remaining frizz!&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty uncontrollable hair (medium, natural curls that LOOOVE to frizz), and this is the most controlled I&#x27;ve ever had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it rinses out very easily, unlike other brands where you can still feel the product in your hair after showering and it leaves your hair looking really heavy/flat (like Garnier products do!)! There&#x27;s none of that with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like my hair to at least come off looking as natural as possible, without the sense of a million products in it, and this product helps me achieve that result!</li>
            <li> One of the very few products I&#x27;ve used on my fine curly hair that actually does moisturize my hair.  It does not leave a stiff heavy residue on your hair, nor does it make your hair stiff.</li>
            <li> I permed my hair and needed something to ensure curls last. My hair is thick and heavy so my curls usually won&#x27;t last the whole day. This curl refiner works well. Just need a small ball of cream for my below shoulder length hair. Must wet hair first though.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Why did Redken stop making this?  I have naturally curly very fine hair, not corse.  This product is light and not greasy. Stays in your hair all day with easy manageability and no frizz.  Makes my long hair look great all day.  Please bring it back!</li>
            <li> I live in very humid FL and so am always looking for a product that can contain my curls without making them hard, brittle or sticky.  This product delivers.  (I pair it with Ringlet, also from Redken.)  I&#x27;ve been using Curl Refiner for about a year and love it.  I am so sad they seem to be discontinuing it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for naturally curly hair.  Gives good body, minimizes frizz, no product buildup.  Unfortunately, it is being discontinued by Redkin.</li>
            <li> Product was what I ordered, even though somewhat expensive due to limited supply.</li>
            <li> I love this because it keeps my curls separate and hair not frizzy. My hair is fine so the top layer always is fly-away, and this is the best I&#x27;ve found for keeping it nice. I always get told my hair looks great when I use this, and you only need a little bit-a dime size-I flip my head over and put rub it slightly between my hands, put on, then put in on all the outside layer after flipping my head upright again, then blow dry with a dffuser. It lasts for a long time too! I found out Redkin has a new on in place of this one so I bought two of this one not wanting to take a chance on the new one. So many times they change a formula and it&#x27;s not as good as the old one. Was fast shipping also.</li>
            <li> The scent sometimes makes me a bit nauseous.  The worst part though is that this product is laced with parabens.  All products that I&#x27;ve seen from Redken have multiple parabens, in this product it&#x27;s like the 5th or sixth ingredient??!  That&#x27;s insane.  Unfortunately though I haven&#x27;t found a cream that can make my curly hair look any better than when using this product.  Not greasy, light, light hold, clumps curls well enough.  Can&#x27;t complain about that.  I can still smell my hair for hours and not in a good way, it&#x27;s a decent grassy clean scent that&#x27;s drowned out by a very chemical scent, it smells like a hair relaxer a little.  I really don&#x27;t want to like this product, but again, nothing else performs as good.  If you don&#x27;t mind a cloud of parabens wafting aroudn you and you&#x27;re all for results, you may love this.</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair cut purposefully so I can wear my hair down &amp; curly which I never ever do. The stylist told me to use a curl refining cream on each individual section of my hair then twist the hair &amp; scrunch it. You would think I would know this by know after having curly hair my whole life!!! This cream was amazing! If I didn&#x27;t happen to have it laying around, I never would have gotten so many compliments on my hair at Christmas with my family!!! Who knew one product could have such great results? Curls were soft, manageable &amp; they stayed in place! No curling iron needed!</li>
            <li> I have super curly and course hair. I have tried a ton of products over the years; this is the best by far!</li>
            <li> My hair is waist long with a lot of waves and some curls. This product is great because it helps to define my curls and i can use it in place of mousse which is great because with this hair, it is easy to have product build up and washing it everyday is noy good. I gave it 4 stars because i do have to use A LOT of this product for it to manage my frizz and because it has a very soft hold but if you are into softer curls without the stffness of a gel or mouse, this is for you! Smells great too.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest curl cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t take a lot. I have naturally curly hair and in 45 years have never used anything as great as this product. Unfortunately, they quit making it and I cannot find it locally (Wyoming). THANK YOU - AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I would like more but its discontinued</li>
