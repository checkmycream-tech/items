            <li>Remains a product that soothes and has a great scent.</li>
            <li>AMAZON WAS GREAT AND REFUNDED MY MONEY.</li>
            <li>Great scent but</li>
            <li>This is a great buy.</li>
            <li>It a great fragrance one of my all time favites</li>
            <li>A great after shave.</li>
            <li>Very nice scent.</li>
            <li>Came fairly quickly in good shape.</li>
            <li>I think it is \\&quot;just right\\&quot; with good spicy fragrance, but not \\&quot;too much\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Delighted to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>It always delights me when I detect it on any man or boy, as I know they have good taste and style[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a good fragrance but not like before.</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Both products are good.</li>
            <li>Oh well, maybe it&#x27;ll make good weed killer.</li>
            <li>I GUESS IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD</li>
            <li>Wonderful products that are unique unto themselves.</li>
            <li>I was THRILLED to find it at Amazon, and just as thrilled at the great price and service.</li>
            <li>I know it isn&#x27;t made in Bermuda any more, but it still smells great and lasts.</li>
            <li>At $30 a bottle, it better be good for something, because it&#x27;s not going to make you smell good.</li>
            <li>Love it when my husband wears this!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just glad that it&#x27;s still around!</li>
            <li>When we were in Bermuda years ago, my husband discovered this amazing fragrance.</li>
            <li>Great item, really enjoy the Royall colognes.</li>
            <li>Nice and spicy, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>A nice item.  </li>
            <li>Nice to find a trustwothy and permanent source for this item</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best you will ever find.  </li>
            <li>great price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>so I was able to do a honest comparison.</li>
            <li>Nice to know I can get this favorite through Amazon now.</li>
            <li>We both love it.  </li>
            <li>It smelled more like scented rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li>When they grew up, both my sons started wearing it, and I love knowing that they are carrying on a tradition.    </li>
            <li>I have been using Royall Spice for 15+ years and love it.</li>
            <li>My guess is Royall reduced the amount of clove and added more alcohol.</li>
            <li>I was glad when I was able to find it again.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over 40 years, still my favorite.</li>
            <li>In fact he likes them better than l&#x27;occitane.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this product and have been buying it for many years.</li>
            <li>My favorite as is the Royall Bay Rhum.</li>
            <li>LOVE this scent.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Royall Spyce and I love it on my husband.</li>
            <li>Been using it for many years.  </li>
            <li>My favorite for 50+ years.</li>
            <li>Frankly I would rather pay more to have the great scent and the longevity of the classic.</li>
            <li>This stuff has a pretty good scent.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and have loved this Royall Spyce since we first smelled it in 1965.</li>
            <li>Great old time fragrance</li>
            <li>My hubby&#x27;s favorite, and one I enjoy on him.</li>
            <li>It was intense and unique, and a drop or two was good for all day.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells as a man should; clean, strong, elegant, and unique.  </li>
            <li>My husband has worn this for many years, and it&#x27;s unique and special like him.</li>
            <li>Great smelling men&#x27;s fragrance that we thought we could only get on the islands.</li>
            <li>This has the same great quality we&#x27;ve grown to expect thru the years.</li>
            <li>I think not quite as good as in the old days</li>
            <li>The original Royall Spyce is still made in Bermuda by the company Royall Lyme.  </li>
            <li>The bottle difference doesn&#x27;t bother me, but the difference in what is contained in it is significant.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to see this listed.  </li>
            <li>The scent is the same as I remember from 40 years ago, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>overall good quality....recommend...</li>
            <li>I really liked the old product a lot.</li>
            <li>TOM BE TRUE</li>
            <li>Usual good quality - a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to start looking for a new favorite, one that I and others can smell and enjoy.</li>
            <li>He has a mild fragance he loves it</li>
            <li>Twenty years ago we were young and we enjoyed each others, how can I say it....</li>
            <li>The original RS in the days of old was a superior fragrance second to none.  </li>
            <li>I am going elsewhere to buy the real thing from Bermuda, which will run about $50 but is well worth the additional cost to get the original scent.</li>
            <li>went a long way and once on the smell lasted nicely all day.</li>
            <li>Not bad, however, I will stick with the bay ruhm, which I have been using for 30 years, with much sucess</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a decent cologne but not at prices comparable to the original product made in Bermuda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I open another just to check and the second bottle is great</li>
            <li>If you are a lover, or loyal follower of Royall Spyce, find an old bottle on Ebay or someplace like that, or just resign yourself to reminiscing of how sweet it WAS.  </li>
            <li>My wife loved it so much she won&#x27;t let me use any other fragrance.</li>
            <li>I see that I&#x27;m not the first to notice something&#x27;s amiss at Royall Lyme.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I opened it was, \\&quot;Made under license in the USA\\&quot; on the label.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get it locally up until a couple years ago.  </li>
            <li>It was quite simply the finest most robust smelling cologne or after shave I had ever used before, or since.  </li>
            <li>Very distinctive and robust!</li>
            <li>This is my first try of Royall Spyce.</li>
            <li>This item is not the same as authentic Royall Spyce from Bermuda.    </li>
            <li>I first learned of Royall Spyce when I smelled it on a man in a crowd and followed him to find out what he was wearing.  </li>
            <li>My husband first used the lotion when we purchased it in Jamica.  </li>
            <li>Ordered four bottles, the first isn&#x27;t like what I&#x27;m use to having in this product.</li>
            <li>like most of the Royall products it does not last.</li>
            <li>I have been buying Royall Spyce for my husband since the year we were married, 1968.  </li>
            <li>I was so sad when we moved and couldn&#x27;t find it anymore but was VERY HAPPY when I discovered it online at AMAZON!  </li>
            <li>Thanks AMAZON!</li>
            <li>I first tried Royall Spyce in 1978, and I&amp;#34;ve used it ever since.</li>
            <li>The original formula which I still have is over 30 years old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years, after every shave, simply because it does what an aftershave should be designed to do:  instantly eliminate any post shaving irritation;  be an aroma you really like, no matter how many times you use it;  the aroma stays close to you, like a good poker hand;  and be agreeable to those who get close enough to smell it.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong for me, but, if you are looking for a strong Spice scent, this is the one for you.  </li>
            <li>Current Product is not as strong as before.</li>
            <li>The problem is the American made product is just not as good or long lasting as the original product made in Hamilton Bermuda.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of free enterprise and</li>
            <li>It is definitely a reasonable price for a bottle this size.</li>
            <li>I really wish it were being offered in an atomizer spray bottle instead however.</li>
            <li>About five or six years ago, I discovered it on Amazon at a much lower price and very rapid delivery.</li>
            <li>My wife is very upset.</li>
            <li>I really it.</li>
            <li>The second was a distinct lack of heady, fresh aroma from either bottle.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to buy this product at such a discount.</li>
            <li>Other reviews have suggested the formula has been changed and I have to agree, and the change was not for the better.</li>
            <li>Classic \\&quot;harvesting\\&quot; of a brand with a loyal following.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity of a long term wearing but first impression is very positive.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>AND IT SMELLED LIKE PURE ALCOHOL WITH A SPLASH OF THE OLD SCENT.  </li>
            <li>After it finally ran out I bought a bottle of this all purpose lotion locally years back and found it to be as rich and as fragrant as the original bottles I had.  </li>
            <li>When I splashed this on my face after shaving the burning was more intense than usual and it did not stop burning for tem minutes....</li>
            <li>Lasting aroma that remains fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Royall Lyme and Royall Spyce for DECADES, but when the last of my annual supply was running out, I quickly ordered one 8oz bottle each of Royall Lyme and Royall Spyce DIRECTLY FROM ROYALL LYME, so I know I wasn&#x27;t getting a counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>This new product is made in USA under license.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used them in years, and I needed some new cologne, so when I saw them on Amazon, I ordered the Bayrhum, the Lyme and the Spyce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t even be worth it for a far lesser price in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>The old one had a heavy metal screw top, probably pewter.  </li>
            <li>Another fine product to go down hill for profit sake.</li>
            <li>The scent is very masculine, and has hints of spices and carnations.</li>
            <li>Whoever it is, they should be sacked, the foreign license agreements cancelled and the original formula, MADE IN BERMUDA, reinstated.</li>
            <li>I first received a gift of RS over 25 years ago as a Christmas present from my wife.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle has been mixed incorrectly somehow and is not going to be used.</li>
            <li>I just finished my old bottle (that was made in Bermuda) and opened the new one I had purchased from this listing.  </li>
            <li>It just barely resembles what it used to smell like before in my opinion, plus it is no where near as strong or long lasting.  </li>
            <li>and we were surprised</li>
            <li>There is no question in my mind that RS has reformulated this lotion into a much cheaper version of its former self.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is similar, but much &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; in intensity and &amp;#</li>
            <li>The old one was made in and imported from Bermuda.  </li>
            <li>Things do change, but in this case, at least in my opinion, it wasn&#x27;t for the better.  </li>
            <li>I hope someday they bring back the real Royall Spyce.</li>
            <li>Royal Spyce has been a long time favorite of mine but only a few higher end mens stores carry it.</li>
            <li>Kind of like Old Spice if you used real ingredients instead of the fake chemicals they use to get the smells.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this is has become nothing but a cheap rip off, where they are also rubbing salt in the wound by charging you the original price.  </li>
            <li>This new product is not the same thing - not even close.  </li>
            <li>I still have a little of the original product left.  </li>
            <li>The new bottle is much larger, but the old one went much further.  </li>
            <li>I am more than a little sad about the loss of a fine product.</li>
            <li>It stinks so good that whenever I splash it on the ladies come pounding on my door.</li>
            <li>I Started buying this for my husband for 30 years and a bottle would last a long time because it was strong smelling a little</li>
            <li>However...this new batch is not as spicy and does not last nearly as long.</li>
            <li>Kinda strange that despite the paper label, Royall Spyce came in a bottle marked Royall Lyme on the glass - unlike my last bottle which was labeled Royall Spyce on the paper label AND the glass...</li>
            <li>That would be good if it were not so bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The original RS in the days of old was a superior fragrance second to none.  </li>
            <li> I am going elsewhere to buy the real thing from Bermuda, which will run about $50 but is well worth the additional cost to get the original scent.</li>
            <li> went a long way and once on the smell lasted nicely all day.</li>
            <li> Not bad, however, I will stick with the bay ruhm, which I have been using for 30 years, with much sucess</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a decent cologne but not at prices comparable to the original product made in Bermuda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I open another just to check and the second bottle is great</li>
            <li> If you are a lover, or loyal follower of Royall Spyce, find an old bottle on Ebay or someplace like that, or just resign yourself to reminiscing of how sweet it WAS.  </li>
            <li> My wife loved it so much she won&#x27;t let me use any other fragrance.</li>
            <li> I see that I&#x27;m not the first to notice something&#x27;s amiss at Royall Lyme.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened it was, \\&quot;Made under license in the USA\\&quot; on the label.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get it locally up until a couple years ago.  </li>
            <li> It was quite simply the finest most robust smelling cologne or after shave I had ever used before, or since.  </li>
            <li> Very distinctive and robust!</li>
            <li> This is my first try of Royall Spyce.</li>
            <li> This item is not the same as authentic Royall Spyce from Bermuda.    </li>
            <li> I first learned of Royall Spyce when I smelled it on a man in a crowd and followed him to find out what he was wearing.  </li>
            <li> My husband first used the lotion when we purchased it in Jamica.  </li>
            <li> Ordered four bottles, the first isn&#x27;t like what I&#x27;m use to having in this product.</li>
            <li> like most of the Royall products it does not last.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Royall Spyce for my husband since the year we were married, 1968.  </li>
            <li> I was so sad when we moved and couldn&#x27;t find it anymore but was VERY HAPPY when I discovered it online at AMAZON!  </li>
            <li> Thanks AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I first tried Royall Spyce in 1978, and I&amp;#34;ve used it ever since.</li>
            <li> The original formula which I still have is over 30 years old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, after every shave, simply because it does what an aftershave should be designed to do:  instantly eliminate any post shaving irritation;  be an aroma you really like, no matter how many times you use it;  the aroma stays close to you, like a good poker hand;  and be agreeable to those who get close enough to smell it.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong for me, but, if you are looking for a strong Spice scent, this is the one for you.  </li>
            <li> Current Product is not as strong as before.</li>
            <li> The problem is the American made product is just not as good or long lasting as the original product made in Hamilton Bermuda.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of free enterprise and</li>
            <li> It is definitely a reasonable price for a bottle this size.</li>
            <li> I really wish it were being offered in an atomizer spray bottle instead however.</li>
            <li> About five or six years ago, I discovered it on Amazon at a much lower price and very rapid delivery.</li>
            <li> My wife is very upset.</li>
            <li> I really it.</li>
            <li> The second was a distinct lack of heady, fresh aroma from either bottle.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to buy this product at such a discount.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have suggested the formula has been changed and I have to agree, and the change was not for the better.</li>
            <li> Classic \\&quot;harvesting\\&quot; of a brand with a loyal following.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity of a long term wearing but first impression is very positive.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> AND IT SMELLED LIKE PURE ALCOHOL WITH A SPLASH OF THE OLD SCENT.  </li>
            <li> After it finally ran out I bought a bottle of this all purpose lotion locally years back and found it to be as rich and as fragrant as the original bottles I had.  </li>
            <li> When I splashed this on my face after shaving the burning was more intense than usual and it did not stop burning for tem minutes....</li>
            <li> Lasting aroma that remains fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Royall Lyme and Royall Spyce for DECADES, but when the last of my annual supply was running out, I quickly ordered one 8oz bottle each of Royall Lyme and Royall Spyce DIRECTLY FROM ROYALL LYME, so I know I wasn&#x27;t getting a counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> This new product is made in USA under license.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used them in years, and I needed some new cologne, so when I saw them on Amazon, I ordered the Bayrhum, the Lyme and the Spyce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t even be worth it for a far lesser price in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> The old one had a heavy metal screw top, probably pewter.  </li>
            <li> Another fine product to go down hill for profit sake.</li>
            <li> The scent is very masculine, and has hints of spices and carnations.</li>
            <li> Whoever it is, they should be sacked, the foreign license agreements cancelled and the original formula, MADE IN BERMUDA, reinstated.</li>
            <li> I first received a gift of RS over 25 years ago as a Christmas present from my wife.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle has been mixed incorrectly somehow and is not going to be used.</li>
            <li> I just finished my old bottle (that was made in Bermuda) and opened the new one I had purchased from this listing.  </li>
            <li> It just barely resembles what it used to smell like before in my opinion, plus it is no where near as strong or long lasting.  </li>
            <li> and we were surprised</li>
            <li> There is no question in my mind that RS has reformulated this lotion into a much cheaper version of its former self.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is similar, but much &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; in intensity and &amp;#</li>
            <li> The old one was made in and imported from Bermuda.  </li>
            <li> Things do change, but in this case, at least in my opinion, it wasn&#x27;t for the better.  </li>
            <li> I hope someday they bring back the real Royall Spyce.</li>
            <li> Royal Spyce has been a long time favorite of mine but only a few higher end mens stores carry it.</li>
            <li> Kind of like Old Spice if you used real ingredients instead of the fake chemicals they use to get the smells.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is has become nothing but a cheap rip off, where they are also rubbing salt in the wound by charging you the original price.  </li>
            <li> This new product is not the same thing - not even close.  </li>
            <li> I still have a little of the original product left.  </li>
            <li> The new bottle is much larger, but the old one went much further.  </li>
            <li> I am more than a little sad about the loss of a fine product.</li>
            <li> It stinks so good that whenever I splash it on the ladies come pounding on my door.</li>
            <li> I Started buying this for my husband for 30 years and a bottle would last a long time because it was strong smelling a little</li>
            <li> However...this new batch is not as spicy and does not last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> Kinda strange that despite the paper label, Royall Spyce came in a bottle marked Royall Lyme on the glass - unlike my last bottle which was labeled Royall Spyce on the paper label AND the glass...</li>
            <li> That would be good if it were not so bad.  </li>
            <li> This new kid on the block is definitely a thumbs down...</li>
            <li> The new product, in my opinion, is not worth the premium price.</li>
            <li> I have a few remaining ounces left from an older 8oz.</li>
            <li> The new one is metal, but weighs much less, maybe an aluminum alloy?  </li>
            <li> As a long time user of Royall Spyce I&#x27;ve been pondering two recent observations:  </li>
            <li> but the lime doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Disappointing, I love the fragrance</li>
            <li> RS is expensive, and a little of it goes a long way, and along with my tendency to use it only on special occasions, it was quite some time before I used up my two, 2 oz bottles in the gift.</li>
            <li> I can only suspect that the maker has watered it down for the sake of profit.</li>
            <li> So, I keep a bottle front and center on the counter in the bathroom and use it after every shower.</li>
            <li> Apparently this has happened before as another customer recently complained that she had also received Royal Lyme instead of Spyce.</li>
            <li> DUE</li>
            <li> Bottle arrive half empty</li>
            <li> Perhaps if the &amp;#34;imported from Bermuda&amp;#34; version can still be found, it is the same (or at least closer) to what this once was.</li>
            <li> I like my spice scent a little milder.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is very weak, not at all like the old Bay Rum type odor.</li>
            <li> Compared to that which I bought in the 60&#x27;s, this is a pale copy.</li>
            <li> it was in a Royall Lyme bottle and had very little smell.</li>
            <li> At least I now know that I haven&#x27;t lost my mind nor sense of smell.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here that feel that Royall Spyce (RS) has changed its formula.  </li>
            <li> English Leather Spice is very difficult to find.</li>
            <li> Received it today and again its in the wrong bottle and hardly smell it,  this is not amazons fault.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just that the scent has been watered down (which it has), it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s now aggressively bad smelling.</li>
            <li> when we received it it was in the wrong bottle</li>
            <li> AND THISZ IS A FAKE.  </li>
            <li> I THINK IT IS A FAKE COMPANY.  </li>
            <li> , three bad bottles, what&#x27;s the chance of that?</li>
            <li> But the company that bottled it have changed the formula this is a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> I am now very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Very very very favorite! Smells like a jar of cloves!!</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this fragrance for about 30 years.  We both love it.  Nice and spicy, but not overpowering.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t the same fragrence. Amazon must permit the sale of knock offs</li>
            <li> I see that I&#x27;m not the first to notice something&#x27;s amiss at Royall Lyme.  At least I now know that I haven&#x27;t lost my mind nor sense of smell.  I&#x27;ve been wearing Royall Lyme and Royall Spyce for DECADES, but when the last of my annual supply was running out, I quickly ordered one 8oz bottle each of Royall Lyme and Royall Spyce DIRECTLY FROM ROYALL LYME, so I know I wasn&#x27;t getting a counterfeit.  The first thing I noticed when I opened it was, \\&quot;Made under license in the USA\\&quot; on the label.  The second was a distinct lack of heady, fresh aroma from either bottle.  It smelled more like scented rubbing alcohol.  Royall Lyme was, without doubt, the finest men&#x27;s fragrance in the world.  Not anymore.  Who at the helm of the company now?  An accountant?  Whoever it is, they should be sacked, the foreign license agreements cancelled and the original formula, MADE IN BERMUDA, reinstated.</li>
            <li> When we were in Bermuda years ago, my husband discovered this amazing fragrance. Since then, everything else has paled by comparison. I was THRILLED to find it at Amazon, and just as thrilled at the great price and service. The perfect guy gift!!!</li>
            <li> Great smelling men&#x27;s fragrance that we thought we could only get on the islands. Came fairly quickly in good shape.</li>
            <li> I Started buying this for my husband for 30 years and a bottle would last a long time because it was strong smelling a little went a long way and once on the smell lasted nicely all day.I was able to get it locally up until a couple years ago.  Then my Mother in law found it in  one the catalogs you get in the mail. She paid $40 for 4 oz and we were surprised when we received it it was in the wrong bottle it was in a Royall Lyme bottle and had very little smell. So I thought that I would try Amazon and see it if it was a fluke . Received it today and again its in the wrong bottle and hardly smell it,  this is not amazons fault. But the company that bottled it have changed the formula this is a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here that feel that Royall Spyce (RS) has changed its formula.  I first received a gift of RS over 25 years ago as a Christmas present from my wife.  I had never smelled anything like it before.  It was quite simply the finest most robust smelling cologne or after shave I had ever used before, or since.  RS is expensive, and a little of it goes a long way, and along with my tendency to use it only on special occasions, it was quite some time before I used up my two, 2 oz bottles in the gift. After it finally ran out I bought a bottle of this all purpose lotion locally years back and found it to be as rich and as fragrant as the original bottles I had.  Then last year I picked up another bottle of this very same lotion at an online fragrance store.  There is no question in my mind that RS has reformulated this lotion into a much cheaper version of its former self.  It just barely resembles what it used to smell like before in my opinion, plus it is no where near as strong or long lasting.  The original RS in the days of old was a superior fragrance second to none.  Unfortunately this is has become nothing but a cheap rip off, where they are also rubbing salt in the wound by charging you the original price.  It wouldn&#x27;t even be worth it for a far lesser price in my opinion.  If you are a lover, or loyal follower of Royall Spyce, find an old bottle on Ebay or someplace like that, or just resign yourself to reminiscing of how sweet it WAS.  This new kid on the block is definitely a thumbs down...</li>
            <li> The scent is the same as I remember from 40 years ago, which is a good thing.  Very distinctive and robust!</li>
            <li> Royall Spyce is a reliable fragrance that always performs well from batch to batch.  I think it is \\&quot;just right\\&quot; with good spicy fragrance, but not \\&quot;too much\\&quot;.  At Orvis they sell 4 ounces for $49.99.  Get it at Amazon for $31.29 for 8 ounces!!</li>
            <li> A nice item.  The scent is a little strong for me, but, if you are looking for a strong Spice scent, this is the one for you.  I like my spice scent a little milder.</li>
            <li> This is my first try of Royall Spyce. I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity of a long term wearing but first impression is very positive. I do like their Lyme but thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a pretty good scent. Kind of like Old Spice if you used real ingredients instead of the fake chemicals they use to get the smells. Personally I prefer the scent of the Royall Lyme...that stuff sticks w/ you all day (in a good way) and smells wonderful. If you are looking for a specialty aftershave, give both of these great scents a try.</li>
            <li> This item is made by Royall Fragrances in USA under license.  The original Royall Spyce is still made in Bermuda by the company Royall Lyme.  This item is not the same as authentic Royall Spyce from Bermuda.    I just finished my old bottle (that was made in Bermuda) and opened the new one I had purchased from this listing.  This one does NOT smell the same to me, and that is probably why some reviewers say that it is not what it used to be and smells different.    The listing should disclose that the item is made in USA.      I am going elsewhere to buy the real thing from Bermuda, which will run about $50 but is well worth the additional cost to get the original scent.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and have loved this Royall Spyce since we first smelled it in 1965. Delighted to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> Great item, really enjoy the Royall colognes. Kinda strange that despite the paper label, Royall Spyce came in a bottle marked Royall Lyme on the glass - unlike my last bottle which was labeled Royall Spyce on the paper label AND the glass...overall good quality....recommend...</li>
            <li> I first learned of Royall Spyce when I smelled it on a man in a crowd and followed him to find out what he was wearing.  The next day, my husband was wearing it and I found him to be irresistable when he wore it.  When they grew up, both my sons started wearing it, and I love knowing that they are carrying on a tradition.    This lotion smells as a man should; clean, strong, elegant, and unique.  It always delights me when I detect it on any man or boy, as I know they have good taste and style[[ASIN:B000C1W564 Royall Spyce By Royall Fragrances For Men. Aftershave Lotion Cologne 8 Ounces]]</li>
            <li> I was excited to buy this product at such a discount. Although the contents of the product appeared indeed to be \\&quot;Royal Spyce\\&quot; as denoted in the wrapping, the fragrance was actually mislabeled and I received \\&quot;Royal Lyme\\&quot; instead. Apparently this has happened before as another customer recently complained that she had also received Royal Lyme instead of Spyce. I am no trying to return it, but it appears that the fragrance is non-returnable. What gives?</li>
            <li> I have been using Royall Spice for 15+ years and love it. However...this new batch is not as spicy and does not last nearly as long. I have a few remaining ounces left from an older 8oz. bottle so I was able to do a honest comparison. My guess is Royall reduced the amount of clove and added more alcohol. It&#x27;s still a good fragrance but not like before. Frankly I would rather pay more to have the great scent and the longevity of the classic. Another fine product to go down hill for profit sake.</li>
            <li> Used to use this product in the 70&#x27;s-80&#x27;s.. Current Product is not as strong as before.Still like it though.&lt;br /&gt;Going to buy the Scent next month.</li>
            <li> I picked up a bottle of Royall Spyce in Bermuda years ago. My wife loved it so much she won&#x27;t let me use any other fragrance. So, I keep a bottle front and center on the counter in the bathroom and use it after every shower.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me a bottle of this over 25 years ago when she was in London.  I loved it.  It&#x27;s one of the only after shaves that I have ever used.  I was glad when I was able to find it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, after every shave, simply because it does what an aftershave should be designed to do:  instantly eliminate any post shaving irritation;  be an aroma you really like, no matter how many times you use it;  the aroma stays close to you, like a good poker hand;  and be agreeable to those who get close enough to smell it.  Oh and by the way:  Buying it through Amazon gets you a very good price.</li>
            <li> As a long time user of Royall Spyce I&#x27;ve been pondering two recent observations:  The fragrance seems very different; and I now see it for sale almost everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Checking the label revealed that this product is now made in the USA under license.  Classic \\&quot;harvesting\\&quot; of a brand with a loyal following.  It&#x27;s still a decent cologne but not at prices comparable to the original product made in Bermuda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of free enterprise and every company is entitled to the marketing strategy they choose - but I will be switching brands in the future.</li>
            <li> Both products are good. however, the bottle of Royall Lime that was the 2nd item in this order, did not have the cap on the bottle secured and so about halff of the product leaked out in the shipment.</li>
            <li> I still have a little of the original product left.  This new product is not the same thing - not even close.  The fragrance is similar, but much &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; in intensity and &amp;#34;staying power.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles have the same shape and similar markings.  The new bottle is much larger, but the old one went much further.  The old one was made in and imported from Bermuda.  This new product is made in USA under license.  The old one had a heavy metal screw top, probably pewter.  The new one is metal, but weighs much less, maybe an aluminum alloy?  The bottle difference doesn&#x27;t bother me, but the difference in what is contained in it is significant. What you get today is simply not the same product. The new product, in my opinion, is not worth the premium price. It might be about equivalent to a bottle of &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; which sells for about 1/3 the cost.  Perhaps if the &amp;#34;imported from Bermuda&amp;#34; version can still be found, it is the same (or at least closer) to what this once was. I really liked the old product a lot. It was intense and unique, and a drop or two was good for all day. The original formula which I still have is over 30 years old.  Things do change, but in this case, at least in my opinion, it wasn&#x27;t for the better.  I was really excited to see this listed.  I am now very disappointed.  I hope someday they bring back the real Royall Spyce.</li>
            <li> My husband first used the lotion when we purchased it in Jamica.  He has a mild fragance he loves it and so do I.</li>
            <li> still smells like i used to buy from bermuda.i will buy it again or will ask my wife to get it for my birthday.</li>
            <li> Remains a product that soothes and has a great scent. Arrived a day earlier than promised, and well packaged. It is definitely a reasonable price for a bottle this size. I really wish it were being offered in an atomizer spray bottle instead however.</li>
            <li> I have used this for decades. It&#x27;s a favlorite of mine. Nice to find a trustwothy and permanent source for this item</li>
            <li> NOT FOR EVERY BODY JUST ME.STAY AWAY ALL MINE. JUST KIDDING HAVE SOME. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT THANK YOU R</li>
            <li> Royal spice is now made in America.  That would be good if it were not so bad.  The problem is the American made product is just not as good or long lasting as the original product made in Hamilton Bermuda. I am more than a little sad about the loss of a fine product.</li>
            <li> Usual good quality - a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Ordered four bottles, the first isn&#x27;t like what I&#x27;m use to having in this product. When I splashed this on my face after shaving the burning was more intense than usual and it did not stop burning for tem minutes....this has never happened before with this product. I open another just to check and the second bottle is great doesn&#x27;t burn for ten minutes and works like it always has. The first bottle has been mixed incorrectly somehow and is not going to be used. So I would have to say the product is not as advertised and not the same.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 40 years, still my favorite.</li>
            <li> been using it for over 40 years</li>
            <li> Disappointing, I love the fragrance but it is so diminished I&#x27;m going to have to start looking for a new favorite, one that I and others can smell and enjoy. I can only suspect that the maker has watered it down for the sake of profit. Thank God I didn&#x27;t pay $70 retail (Including California tax), Amazon saved the day.</li>
            <li> Compared to that which I bought in the 60&#x27;s, this is a pale copy. Fragrance is very weak, not at all like the old Bay Rum type odor.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it because it reminded her some twenty years ago when we were in the Bahamas. Twenty years ago we were young and we enjoyed each others, how can I say it.... Well each others romances. It brought out wonderful memories.</li>
            <li> I think not quite as good as in the old days but my husband still loves royall spice and royall lime.  In fact he likes them better than l&#x27;occitane.</li>
            <li> I used to like all the Royall products. I hadn&#x27;t used them in years, and I needed some new cologne, so when I saw them on Amazon, I ordered the Bayrhum, the Lyme and the Spyce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, three bad bottles, what&#x27;s the chance of that? Other reviews have suggested the formula has been changed and I have to agree, and the change was not for the better. It&#x27;s not just that the scent has been watered down (which it has), it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s now aggressively bad smelling. Oh well, maybe it&#x27;ll make good weed killer. At $30 a bottle, it better be good for something, because it&#x27;s not going to make you smell good.</li>
            <li> Not bad, however, I will stick with the bay ruhm, which I have been using for 30 years, with much sucess</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product and have been buying it for many years. About five or six years ago, I discovered it on Amazon at a much lower price and very rapid delivery.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling men&#x27;s cologne I have used. My favorite as is the Royall Bay Rhum.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS SAME COLOGNE FOR YEARS AND THISZ IS A FAKE.  OPENED BOTTLE AND IT SMELLED LIKE PURE ALCOHOL WITH A SPLASH OF THE OLD SCENT.  I THINK IT IS A FAKE COMPANY.  THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A DEAL DUE TO THIS BOTTLE IS TWICE THE SIZE I GUESS IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TOM BE TRUE IT PROBABLY IS.  AMAZON WAS GREAT AND REFUNDED MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> Great scent but like most of the Royall products it does not last.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Royall Spyce for my husband since the year we were married, 1968.  I can&#x27;t get enough of it.  People stop us and ask what that cologne is.  I was so sad when we moved and couldn&#x27;t find it anymore but was VERY HAPPY when I discovered it online at AMAZON!  Thanks AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I first tried Royall Spyce in 1978, and I&amp;#34;ve used it ever since. The scent is very masculine, and has hints of spices and carnations. It is the lotion that suites my body chemistry. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!  Been using it for years!!!  :-D</li>
            <li> It stinks so good that whenever I splash it on the ladies come pounding on my door. My wife is very upset.</li>
            <li> I really it. English Leather Spice is very difficult to find. So I tried this. Very nice scent. It lasts. I like their lime scent a lot also but the lime doesn&#x27;t last too long. This is a great buy.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best you will ever find.  Love it when my husband wears this!</li>
            <li> It a great fragrance one of my all time favites</li>
            <li> LOVE this scent. I hope it is never discontinued. My husband has worn this for many years, and it&#x27;s unique and special like him. :) This is the only cologne you need.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Royall Spyce and I love it on my husband.</li>
            <li> Wonderful products that are unique unto themselves. Lasting aroma that remains fresh.</li>
            <li> Nice to know I can get this favorite through Amazon now. Royal Spyce has been a long time favorite of mine but only a few higher end mens stores carry it. A great after shave.</li>
            <li> Best after shave we&#x27;ve ever experienced.  Been using it for many years.  great price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Great old time fragrance</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne since 1970, that&#x27;s forty three years now.  It&#x27;s been the only cologne I&#x27;ve used in all that time and I&#x27;m just glad that it&#x27;s still around!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product. It&#x27; has taken years to find it again.</li>
            <li> My favorite for 50+ years. I know it isn&#x27;t made in Bermuda any more, but it still smells great and lasts. I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> Bottle arrive half empty</li>
            <li> My hubby&#x27;s favorite, and one I enjoy on him. This has the same great quality we&#x27;ve grown to expect thru the years.</li>
