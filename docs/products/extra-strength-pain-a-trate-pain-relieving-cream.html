            <li> Hubby has bad arthritis and this really gets to the pain.  It has almost no smell.  It&#x27;s not a heat generating type of pain relief but rather a topical analgesic.</li>
            <li> I find X-tra Strength Pain-A-Trate works very well. Does not take all the pain away, but makes it bearable. I have had other people try it and they say the same thing. My Arthritis will never go away, but am so glad I found this item. Thanx</li>

            <li> I had purchased one of these several years ago.  My hubby just starting having joint pains and nothing else seemed to work but this one!  Thus, the reason I decided to purchase 2 at one time.  He has thanked me many times over for buying this again for him...it works that good!!</li>
            <li> I use the product for an extreme itch/deep pain I have only at night on my upper arms.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this product would help but it has done very little to relieve my discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;I tried</li>
            <li> This is the best cream ever. My husband used to get up in the night for back pain and take hot shower he uses this before he goes to bed and sleeps all night long. I even like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> It works super great for me; however, my husband does not think it works as well as I do. Not greasy. I will definitely buy again.</li>
