            <li>cream is very nice and feels wonderful on, not too oily and leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Yay for phenomenal organic products!</li>

            <li>The best lotion for sensitive or acne prone skin, period!</li>
            <li>The cream goes on nice and leaves my skin feeling very smooth.  </li>

            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I Love What this cream is doing for my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I love this face cream.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh skin! :)</li>
            <li>It does have a medicinal smell that quickly fades leaving my skin feeling and looking amazing.</li>
            <li>I always feel good when I know I purchasing a fair trade item, which is totally the case with this face cream.  </li>
            <li>It has pure ingredients and it is fair trade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to use it at night and for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from acne and oily skin for most of my life, and this is surprisingly light and ultra healing.</li>
            <li>this lotion does have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of pricy, but it just takes a tiny dab to do so much good.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>My face feels great, and it also makes my skin super soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>(maybe it helps that it doesn&#x27;t smell as perfume-like as some face creams can, because I am a man), and the way it goes on is smooth and light.</li>
            <li>Nice and light and really absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li>Who cares anyway when the result is soft clear beautiful skin, without chemicals!</li>
            <li>I gotta admit it has a very distinct smell to it that took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway this is a very good product it helped my skin recover from acne and dark marks.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that by the time I am done using my first bottle my skin will be ever better than it is now.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t seem to clean my hair as well as others i like just FYI</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, but pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit costly, but completely worth it to have the irritations resolved.</li>
            <li>Okay, so as the other reviewers have mentioned, this product is made from Fair Trade ingredients.</li>
            <li>Kind of like peanut oil but a little more exotic.</li>
            <li>Other than the strong oder that lasts all day, this cream is amazing!</li>
            <li>A lot of lotions will make my face turn bright red when I apply them, but this doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong</li>
            <li>This is great for dry to oily skin, which I found interesting, but I&#x27;m guessing it is to replace the skins natural balance after you scrub your face off (that happened to me trying to &amp;#34;rub off&amp;#34; my acne.</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>Used this cream with the black soap &amp; it is great in the treatment of acne.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my face every morning and night and have noticed a huge difference in how clear and smooth my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>I put this on after I put on the Acure Radical Resurfacing lotion from Acure - for extra protection, anti-aging, and it just makes my skin feel so nice.</li>
            <li>Now this is important, If you buy this make sure you have a facial cleanser you can trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have literally used everything from Clinique to Lanc√¥me to proactive to Alba, My Chelle, Acure and every other natural product or store bought product on the planet, and this is by far the BEST lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Calms my cystic acne prone skin without clogging my pores, and does a nice job of moisturizing my dry areas.</li>
            <li>Plus, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily than normal during the day, it&#x27;s not too light but not too thick, and most importantly it has really been helping my acne.</li>
            <li>Alaffia Neems and Shea Buttler cream is fantastic for mature skin.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I just started using it two days ago, so i must give it more time to give a proper rating.</li>
            <li>i have found the quality of the Alalffia products to be terrific for the price...better than lots of more costly moisturizers, shampoos, etc.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone - young or old!  :-)</li>
            <li>and my skin feels normal!!</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and soft, so much healthier now</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong, especially for something that is applied to your face.  </li>
            <li>This cream works better than any of the medicines I am supposed to use to calm down the rosacea, so it has some anti-inflammatory properties.  </li>
            <li>I have never needed much in terms of lotion until now.</li>
            <li>feeling of the lotion is very soothing on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cream and will order again</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for acne sufferers!</li>
            <li>It did wonders for my face and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I just started to use the product so time will tell, but you would think the company should really look into fixing this situation.</li>
            <li>The smell is unusual.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this face cream.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Additionally, it moisturizes very well and plumps out a lot of the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>once I started using this, in addition to a more natural and simple skincare system, those pesky pimples went away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and tried the anti-aging Rooibos and Shea lotion, by alaffia, and it is not as good as this Neem and Shea skin recovery, at least not for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I was worried I would get blocked pores because it appears thick, heavy, but it absorbs right in and is just marvelous!</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate, and really love this product.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the main thing:</li>
            <li>So, anyways, I have a high maintenance need.  </li>
            <li>I am SO thankful and highly recommend Alaffia-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so i highly recommend the Rooisbois &amp; Shea or this Neem moisturizer...shampoos</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also made by hand in the USA, which is rare enough these days.</li>
            <li>I did not buy this off amazon, I bought it from my local whole foods store, but I wanted to write a review since I like it so much!</li>
            <li>For winter it is great for dry, dull skin.</li>
            <li>clear dramatically&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It soaks in and leaves a soft velvet texture.  </li>
            <li>I am always searching for a product that will really help my acne, and this is definitely one!</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, and my face burns when stepping out of a shower.</li>
            <li>I have rosecia on my cheeks and chin and this cream has almost completely reduced the redness.</li>
            <li>I have hormonal acne, mild rosacea, dry peeling skin between my eyebrows, and red sensitive/itchy skin around my nostrils that comes and goes (probably a fungal or bacterial imbalance from what I have read).  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to calm down your skin as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a major improvement with the dryness in face.</li>
            <li>only problem I have is the strong smell of what smells like menthol or eucalyptus - I&#x27;m not sure what that is for</li>
            <li>It does smell a little &amp;#34;grassy,&amp;#34; but once it is absorbed the smell goes away.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy, non-toxic, totally hydrating aaaand it has improved my blemishes.</li>
            <li>If you do not know what Neem oil smells like, I suggest you take a wiff of it at your local grocery or all natural market.</li>
            <li>my skin is so different and so dry that I really had no idea where to turn.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little heavy, better suited for the winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dealing with breakouts caused by hard water and this moisturizer is just light enough to keep my skin hydrated without clogging pores.</li>
            <li>Most of the products advertised on TV either did practically nothing or were harsh, causing my face to be riddled with dry, peeling spots for a few weeks AFTER I discontinued using them.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have never needed much in terms of lotion until now. I am in cancer therapy and one of the side- effects is dehydration/dry skin. Despite the 3-4 liters of water I drink a day my skin is so different and so dry that I really had no idea where to turn. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of lotions starting with standard face creams but they are so thick and heavy it was like wearing makeup or honey on my face and it felt like I was clogging my pours. Because I&#x27;ve been trying to cut toxicity out of my diet and skin care, I cut out a lot of the common lotions I had used including oil of olay and nutregena. Did I mention I am also prone to blemishes in the past and now too, now that my skin is stressed in a different way. So, anyways, I have a high maintenance need.  I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees but that was also way to sticky and heavy and then I found Alaffia&#x27;s Neem &amp; Shea (angelic chorale here).  I start with their Rooibos toner (amazing) and then use this and my skin feels normal!! It is not heavy, non-toxic, totally hydrating aaaand it has improved my blemishes. I am SO thankful and highly recommend Alaffia- they have a combination of lotions for face for every skin type. :)</li>
            <li> This cream is the best facial moisturizer I have EVER used.  I have hormonal acne, mild rosacea, dry peeling skin between my eyebrows, and red sensitive/itchy skin around my nostrils that comes and goes (probably a fungal or bacterial imbalance from what I have read).  I have been using this product since late October 2014 (about a month).  The peeling skin issues and red areas around my nostrils are healed.  No more itchy, dry spots.  I still get acne but in smaller areas and it heals faster!  A lot of lotions will make my face turn bright red when I apply them, but this doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;The feeling of the lotion is very soothing on my skin.  It soaks in and leaves a soft velvet texture.  The smell is strong, but pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit costly, but completely worth it to have the irritations resolved.</li>
            <li> Calms my cystic acne prone skin without clogging my pores, and does a nice job of moisturizing my dry areas. I like it very much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy, better suited for the winter. It did not cause a breakout but leaves the skin oily looking and shiny for a while.  It&#x27;s best to use it at night and for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream and will order again</li>
            <li> Alaffia Neems and Shea Buttler cream is fantastic for mature skin.  As soon as I apply it, my skin feels softer and moisturized.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best formula I have experienced for any type of skin recovery.  I use it on my face every morning and night and have noticed a huge difference in how clear and smooth my skin looks.  I would recommend this product to anyone - young or old!  :-)</li>
            <li> Okay, so as the other reviewers have mentioned, this product is made from Fair Trade ingredients. It&#x27;s also made by hand in the USA, which is rare enough these days. Here&#x27;s the main thing: It just works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like the smell (a little herbally) (maybe it helps that it doesn&#x27;t smell as perfume-like as some face creams can, because I am a man), and the way it goes on is smooth and light. You can hardly feel it after 5 seconds. But it makes your skin better. And that&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li> I like that this is from Alafia, which is one of the best companies for ingredient safety and integrity.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is very nice and feels wonderful on, not too oily and leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is the strong smell of what smells like menthol or eucalyptus - I&#x27;m not sure what that is for but I assume there&#x27;s a reason to have this ingredient in a skin recovery cream - however, I have sensitive skin and am allergic to several fragrances and have to be careful to apply only a small amount, or the smell just overwhelms me.&lt;br /&gt; And just so you know, neem oil smells a lot like roasted peanut butter, and I don&#x27;t detect any of that, could be it&#x27;s overwhelmed too, by the menthol &#x27;fragrance&#x27;</li>
            <li> Good quality product! Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how this cream once applied seems to keep your skin moisturized over time. My husband also likes the scent which is somewhere between lavender and patchouli with lemon grass highlights.</li>
            <li> I put this on after I put on the Acure Radical Resurfacing lotion from Acure - for extra protection, anti-aging, and it just makes my skin feel so nice. This is great for dry to oily skin, which I found interesting, but I&#x27;m guessing it is to replace the skins natural balance after you scrub your face off (that happened to me trying to &amp;#34;rub off&amp;#34; my acne. I promise I was younger...mayyybe) because you want your acne gone. Acne-prone faces DO need moisture. I would recommend this to calm down your skin as well. It does smell a little &amp;#34;grassy,&amp;#34; but once it is absorbed the smell goes away. Nice fresh skin! :)</li>
            <li> I have been through Lancome and Clarins, La Mer and Kiehl&#x27;s and Chanel and Oil Of Olay everything in between. This is the best moisturizer I have come across, and I will stay with it. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just another product that I feel work for me. I use to have very bad skin  clear dramatically&lt;br /&gt;I have introduced my African American friends to this and they love must try!</li>
            <li> I did not buy this off amazon, I bought it from my local whole foods store, but I wanted to write a review since I like it so much! I&#x27;m not sure if they changed this product or something, but I think it smells like fruit loops. Maybe I&#x27;m just crazy ha! I was nervous to get it when I saw all the reviews about it&#x27;s horrible smell, but I actually love the smell. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily than normal during the day, it&#x27;s not too light but not too thick, and most importantly it has really been helping my acne. Yay! I am always searching for a product that will really help my acne, and this is definitely one! I am hoping that by the time I am done using my first bottle my skin will be ever better than it is now. Highly recommend this for acne sufferers!</li>
            <li> Other than the strong oder that lasts all day, this cream is amazing!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> This cream saved my skin. I&#x27;ve been dealing with breakouts caused by hard water and this moisturizer is just light enough to keep my skin hydrated without clogging pores. Love it!</li>
            <li> It did wonders for my face and is very moisturizing. I had acne forming underneath my skin (painful and takes forever to pop out) and once I started using this, in addition to a more natural and simple skincare system, those pesky pimples went away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking 1 star off because of the smell. Thought it wasn&#x27;t too bad in the beginning but now I hold my breath when applying. It&#x27;s like a weird herbal scent, probably because of the patchouli. My bf says it makes my face smell like mold...not flattering.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate, and really love this product. Neem has a different smell and some people might not like it, but I do.</li>
            <li> I always feel good when I know I purchasing a fair trade item, which is totally the case with this face cream.  The cream goes on nice and leaves my skin feeling very smooth.  I gotta admit it has a very distinct smell to it that took some getting used to.  The smell is pretty strong, especially for something that is applied to your face.  I did get used to the smell though and will continue to use it.  I did read a multiple reviews on this product and there is a lot of discussion about the last third of the bottle getting wasted since the pump doesn&#x27;t work. I just started to use the product so time will tell, but you would think the company should really look into fixing this situation.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Nice and light and really absorbs into my skin. I usually put it on at night because it makes your face very shiny for a while. The smell is unusual. It smells like the outdoors to me: like a combination of cedar, neem, and citrus. It&#x27;s pretty strong but I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream.  Works well at night or day under makeup.  Smells a little strange because of the Neem but it dissipates and would not keep me from purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> The best lotion for sensitive or acne prone skin, period! I have literally used everything from Clinique to Lanc√¥me to proactive to Alba, My Chelle, Acure and every other natural product or store bought product on the planet, and this is by far the BEST lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. The reviews about the smell are a bit misleading, the smell is herbal and goes away after a few minutes. Who cares anyway when the result is soft clear beautiful skin, without chemicals! Yay for phenomenal organic products! Alaffia skin products are awesome! I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and tried the anti-aging Rooibos and Shea lotion, by alaffia, and it is not as good as this Neem and Shea skin recovery, at least not for my skin type. I need the moisture, anti aging and acne prevention. Order this you will be happy!</li>
            <li> This lotion is lite and great for skin, goes on easy and smooth. It has pure ingredients and it is fair trade. Now this is important, If you buy this make sure you have a facial cleanser you can trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this is a very good product it helped my skin recover from acne and dark marks.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a week. For winter it is great for dry, dull skin. I can see it being too moisturizing for summer and spring. If you do not know what Neem oil smells like, I suggest you take a wiff of it at your local grocery or all natural market. Its not for everyone and this is the predominant smell. Kind of like peanut oil but a little more exotic. I have dewy, happy, moisturized skin. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the feel on my face. I get a smoothness not dryness . I just started using it two days ago, so i must give it more time to give a proper rating.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a major improvement with the dryness in face. I can not handle the smell of the product. Use it every once in awhile to see if I can get results because my skin is so dry. Can&#x27;t get over the smell though</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, and my face burns when stepping out of a shower. This cream alleviates that burning almost instantly. It doesn&#x27;t help my psoriasis in reducing the redness on my face, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt either. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I seen no difference in my face and it smells annoying. I used it for about a month and stopped because it did nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> i have found the quality of the Alalffia products to be terrific for the price...better than lots of more costly moisturizers, shampoos, etc. so i highly recommend the Rooisbois &amp; Shea or this Neem moisturizer...shampoos i am less enamoured with...don&#x27;t seem to clean my hair as well as others i like just FYI</li>
            <li> I have been trying for a few years to find a face cream that will help my rosacea and sensitive, thinning skin.  Finally, the combination of neem and shea butter fits the bill.  I was worried I would get blocked pores because it appears thick, heavy, but it absorbs right in and is just marvelous! Most of the products advertised on TV either did practically nothing or were harsh, causing my face to be riddled with dry, peeling spots for a few weeks AFTER I discontinued using them.  This cream works better than any of the medicines I am supposed to use to calm down the rosacea, so it has some anti-inflammatory properties.  It also contains antioxidants and other nutrients such as Vitamin E and fatty acids.  Additionally, it moisturizes very well and plumps out a lot of the wrinkles.  My skin feels smooth and soft, so much healthier now and I have only been using it for a short time.  The women of India know what they are talking about when they let us in on their secret!</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve suffered from acne and oily skin for most of my life, and this is surprisingly light and ultra healing. Smells great and herbal (patchouli), with no shine (unlike some Cetaphil moisturizers that promise to control it). I can&#x27;t recommend this product or this company enough.Fair trade organic ingredients for this price? You can&#x27;t do any better.  This product is worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne prone skin, also check out their black soap. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> i purchased this to use for my teens acne. i have seen an improvement over the past several weeks. this lotion does have a strong smell. the current squeeze bottle is easier to use than the pump bottle it used to come in.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for about a week and it truly is a miracle cream.I cut myself and as soon as I got the bleeding to stop put the cream on and the next day you can&#x27;t tell that I even got cut. Also I have notice that my acne scars on my face have been fading. I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The item pictured on Amazon shows a pump bottle to dispense product. What I received was a squeeze tube--and I am not at all happy with this order. If you are going to send a squeeze tube, then picture that on the web site--misrepresentation of the product!</li>
            <li> I Love What this cream is doing for my face and neck. I had some sample packs from my local health food store, and I was hooked!&lt;br /&gt;The only con that I have about this cream is that I wish the tube came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> Used this cream with the black soap &amp; it is great in the treatment of acne.  Even my husband noticed the difference in my son&#x27;s skin!  My son has sensitive skin and acne medication would make things worse at times but this combo of black soap &amp; recovery cream took the redness out of the skin &amp; is clearing up the acne.  Recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream. It does have a medicinal smell that quickly fades leaving my skin feeling and looking amazing. I have rosecia on my cheeks and chin and this cream has almost completely reduced the redness. My face feels great, and it also makes my skin super soft to the touch. It&#x27;s kind of pricy, but it just takes a tiny dab to do so much good. This will be a forever product for me.</li>
