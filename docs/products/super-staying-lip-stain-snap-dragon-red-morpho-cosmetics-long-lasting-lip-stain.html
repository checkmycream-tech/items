            <li>But these colors are too bright for me to use as a cover up.  </li>

            <li>I read about this product when searching online for a good lip stain and someone raved about it.</li>
            <li>This is a good, long-lasting lip stain.</li>
            <li>Regardless, this is a gorgeous color...</li>
            <li>They sent me a lip pencil which is also a gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>Once it is on it will color your lips but not your cups, your napkins or your loved ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Texture</li>
            <li>Good luck!ther products I have tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I look forward to buying more products from this company - would be great if they came out with an even darker/brown-red/less bright stain.</li>
            <li>Great product, great freebies, all packed sweetly, with suggestions on use.  </li>
            <li>They even included a complimentary creamy lip pencil which works so well with the lip stain, and a beautiful butterfly sticker!</li>
            <li>Good product and nice color.  </li>
            <li>Was REALLY impressed with this product and seller - not only is it a great product, but it was beautifully packaged, and the seller even threw in a great lip pencil for free.</li>

            <li>This is lovely!</li>
            <li>You do not get better than these lip stains and glosses!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;2 stars because if it is applied perfectly, it looks pretty nice for an hour or two.</li>
            <li>Beautiful red, and it came with a lip pencil in a beautiful color!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I got it and was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>$20 may seem like a lot, but the tube looks like it going to last for months, and it works great and feels great!</li>
            <li>I am glad I ordered after reading the good reviews it received on here.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t find a way to wear this product.</li>
            <li>, it arrived quickly and was beautifully packaged.</li>
            <li>It is also very very strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m grateful it&#x27;ll be so easy to get it again when I run out!</li>
            <li>The lip stain arrived very nicely packaged with a complimentary lip liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried most of the available &#x27;stains&#x27; and &#x27;long-lasting&#x27; lip products and this is by and large the best.  </li>
            <li>Morpho&#x27;s Super Staying Stain is perfect: rich color that lasts and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Im 56 and have fine lines!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 20 dollars (very cheap for the value)  </li>
            <li>Not dry, gorgeous color and lasts Forever!!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I have tried SO many and they never stay.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found one that I truly love.  </li>
            <li>I like this better anyway.</li>
            <li>I just put it on with chapstick over top, and I look like a pin-up girl all day.  </li>
            <li>Love the product..</li>
            <li>Fantastic service!  </li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>My Cover Girl does a way better job.  </li>
            <li>color lasts a while, but more in the range of an hour or two, not 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Possibly the BEST Amazon vendor I&#x27;ve ever dealt with.  </li>
            <li>Love this color and plan to buy more soon.</li>
            <li>I love this lip stain.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter and her friends love it.</li>
            <li>I have used it many ways...</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this stain.</li>
            <li>(I think the color sticks better to it for some reason).  </li>
            <li>Also the color is THE PERFECT shade of red.  </li>
            <li>I love this lip stain.  </li>
            <li>This product is the best will never go back to lipstick!</li>
            <li>The color is the perfect red!</li>
            <li>I even got a free lip liner inclosed!</li>
            <li>It was runny and got all over one of my favorite dresses.</li>
            <li>Janine included a nice note and a complimentary lip pencil (which is also really nice.</li>
            <li>Always getting compliments :)</li>
            <li>I actually love this stuff even more.</li>
            <li>Maybe after I get tan it will look better.  </li>
            <li>Most expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish they made more colors.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>It feels minty and I just love it.</li>
            <li>The undertones are more brownish than purplish.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>If you want even more color, it layers well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I put gloss directly on top without thoroughly stripping all product off, it transfers to everything.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the bottle appearance and applicator are nice, the neck gets sufficient leakage that it allows minuscule drops to fly out with the action of opening the top, causing irreparable staining to two garments.</li>
            <li>Will buy in more colors.  </li>
            <li>My order arrived far faster than I was expecting, and it was beautifully packaged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a long-lasting lip stain for a long time, &amp; I believe this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>The product was wrapped beautifully by the seller, and that really made me feel special.</li>
            <li>Blotting it seems to lighten it some and makes it not so glaring, however , that causes it to come off more easily.  </li>
            <li>The owner was courteous, polite, and quick to respond.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a liquid, so it&#x27;s not as drying, and when applied lightly gives me that perfect red blush look that lasts.  </li>
            <li>I love the color of this lip stain its perfect and a true red.</li>
            <li>color is beautiful, but a little bright for my complexion.</li>
            <li>Plus the lipstain&#x27;s great, looks wonderfully natural, and LASTS  </li>
            <li>first stain and wonderfully happy! arrived fast (yesterday) and the true test...</li>
            <li>The customer service was as excellent as other people reported.  </li>
            <li>Of the five products this is what I was most excited about.</li>
            <li>Applying it with the applicator is convenient and easy to do.</li>
            <li>It will drip easily too so</li>
            <li>It is extremely easy to screw up, so if you are looking for something you can touch up on the go, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes apply a clear gloss on top and you&#x27;re good for the day.</li>
            <li>It is vibrant but not gaudy, and seems to look good on everyone.</li>
            <li>Snap Dragon is a lovely shade of berry red and has a very nice peppermint taste.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Snap Dragon Red - a gorgeous shade that is bright and vibrantly colorful - but still not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>No matter what I do, the color goes on beautiful but does NOT last.</li>
            <li>The seller is also fantastic - the product arrived very quickly; included an organza bag and even a lip pencil freebie (can&#x27;t wait to try).</li>
            <li>you desire beautifully bold color with staying power, this IS for you!</li>
            <li>To be perfectly honest, I would prefer a less brown undertone, but since the product really is the best I have found, I figure beggars can&#x27;t be choosers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a lip stain that stays and this product fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Neither product feathers which is so important</li>
            <li>Many claim but rarely ever deliver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth rich color with staying power).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and the seller packaged it beautifully with freebies and super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Snap Dragon Red is a BOLD color and it looks great.</li>
            <li>Nothing stays on forever, but this is a pretty good lip stain and it came with a free high end product to also try.  </li>
            <li>Fun!</li>
            <li>I then used over-the-counter brands for years and then was excited to hear about this product.    </li>
            <li>Also, the seller threw in a complimentary lip pencil and a note with tips on how to use the product!</li>
            <li>I think this lip stain stays on longer than most and is a pretty color.  </li>
            <li>I give it a thumbs up and a nd think the price was worth it!</li>
            <li>A liner needs to be used in order to make a clean outline of your lips.  </li>
            <li>Awsum lip stain color was great stayed on super long was so worth it!</li>
            <li>Gorgeous rich red!</li>
            <li>I love the lip pencil that came with this and the stain is not really a stain, but fades as the day goes on, I love that about it!</li>
            <li>I purchased 5 different lip stains from various vendors/brands and this was the perfect one!</li>
            <li>Luckily, I was able to get my money back from my credit card company, but I sure didn&#x27;t want to order it again.</li>
            <li>Simple, make sure you exfoliate your lips with a cloth, and make sure they&#x27;re moisturized.    </li>
            <li>I love this company and will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>This item was shipped quickly and even contained a matching lip pencil for FREE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>quickly on the lips</li>
            <li>B0021J367C Super</li>
            <li>that I love and recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I can easily control how bright the color becomes by dabbing a little bit on at a time.</li>
            <li>Whenever I wear this color (almost everyday :) ) I receive so many compliments!</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing like the picture they have of it on their light model.</li>
            <li>Lasts, stays, does not bleed and looks more natural than lipstick.  </li>
            <li>but my lips were nice and red</li>
            <li>It arrived within a week of ordering it, and I received a complimentary lip liner.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not even worth putting on.  </li>
            <li>Plus it has a non-greasy feel and a fun minty touch.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last my whole shift, but it lasts a good seven, eight hours after application.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure the color completely dries before rubbing lips together or applying a balm or chapstick or gloss.</li>
            <li>I liked the initial appearance.</li>
            <li>your lips are even 1% dry, it will adhere more to that area becoming even darker&lt;</li>
            <li>My package arrived quickly with some special extra touches that are pretty rare these days. :)</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness they were right.  </li>
            <li>This beautiful blue red is what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li>(since the stains are only available in red &amp; brown red), beautiful~!!</li>
            <li>This color was a bit bright for me, but I liked that it didn&#x27;t go on as dry as some other lip stains.  </li>
            <li>But, its great virtue is it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips like most of the other products I have tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to mess with constant primping.</li>
            <li>It came super quick, with a personal note from Morpho Cosmetics, and a free complimentary lip liner.</li>
            <li>I received the lip stain with a complimentary lip pencil and two cute blue morpho butterfly stickers that you bend and stick to something</li>
            <li>also can only use this if your lips are smooth smooth, so you might need to exfoliate them before use.</li>
            <li>It is really nice to put it on, let it dry well and then add glass, lipstick or plumper too.  </li>
            <li>Very, VERY saturated color.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty.  </li>
            <li>/lipsticks on top for various shade options.  </li>
            <li>It stays on forever, and I love the red color!!  </li>
            <li>So many ways to create different looks.</li>
            <li>Overall, pleased with this stain.</li>
            <li>Love that I don&#x27;t have to constantly re-apply.</li>
            <li>just use the lip stain, and use a light color lipstick or lip balm on top to tone done the dark color</li>
            <li>waste your money, it&#x27;s only good for an hour or two at the most.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice stain on your lips that will last most of the day and does not get blotchy after a while like some of the other ones.  </li>
            <li>It will go on pretty intense and you can leave it like that if you want, or you can lighten it by blotting it before it dries.  </li>
            <li>Being of fair skin, I was a little unsure about going for such a bold red, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this color would be the nice red red that was shown in the picture, but it is actually a little more purple and the color I associate with cheap lipsticks  </li>
            <li>Stays on okay,, but it makes your lips dry.</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t let the $20 price scare you, you do get a lot of product and because it&#x27;s a gel it doesn&#x27;t dry out like those $8 magic marker types.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a very moist gel stain and it stays on all day long.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be ordering again.</li>
            <li>This lipstain was certainly number 1 in one category.</li>
            <li>But the awesome thing about this is you can put on less and have a lighter color,  you really can put on as little or as much as you want.     </li>
            <li>In all my years supporting the e-economy with my steady stream of Amazon purchases I have never written a review before.</li>
            <li>me, putting it on first thing, when my lips are dry and have nothing on them, letting them dry completely after application, and then following up with gloss gives me the best result.</li>
            <li>Got here fast</li>
            <li>Plus, you really have to over-lay this product with some lip moisturizer as it is very drying.</li>
            <li>Finally, I really like the name \\&quot;Snap Dragon.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>You have to work fast once on your lips.</li>
            <li>I recommend it, plus the company has fabulous customer service, very personal and caring.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product and OCC&#x27;s Nomad Stained Gloss are my absolute favorites.</li>
            <li>I waited a couple of weeks before writing the review to really test the staying power.</li>
            <li>Absolutely awesome..you can build up the color.</li>
            <li>so it goes from a bright clear almost-pink to a deep red.  </li>
            <li>: So this is where Morpho really shines; this stain stays put --for reals.</li>
            <li>Instead, it really stains the lips red while letting your lips feel and look more natural.</li>
            <li>I love the lip stains, super long lasting.</li>
            <li>This red is a very nice deep red.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble with bleeding or feathering; the foam applicator gives a nice sharp outline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Or is it coz you&#x27;re smiling more due to the compliments???)</li>
            <li>The colour is an intense, true red which didn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li>It is not so much dark as deeply pigmented and still bright.</li>
            <li>Some may stay,but they get blotchy or bleed all over your first cup of coffee (doesn&#x27;t really look professional in that morning meeting).</li>
            <li>after I had a faint red still on my lips (and I only applied it lightly to begin with) very happy!</li>
            <li>It is a hard to come by absolutely dramatic, bright, beautiful, bold, wow &#x27;em red.</li>
            <li>Yes, the color loses its intensity after you drink your favorite beverage, BUT a quick touch up</li>
            <li>it does leave your lips looking rather dry after the product has set, but I just add some gloss or Burt&#x27;s Bees and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>The color is a true red, and not a blue-red or orange-red.</li>
            <li>I didnt want my new husband to be wearing my lipstick!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s can be layered for more or less color, is not at all drying for me, and I like the application wand.</li>
            <li>Not a subtle effect like I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Being realistic, over a period of 8 hours, you would  want to touch up the stain once.</li>
            <li>The color is the main problem for me.  </li>
            <li>I love that you can put on the lipstain in a couple different ways to get different effects.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of classic lipsticks, though; I prefer stains and glosses.</li>
            <li>I appreciate it most, however, because the color is also perfect for me (the Zinnia looks terrible on me).</li>
            <li>The Snapdragon is a deep, vibrant, pure red that can go on as light or as intense as you want it.  </li>
            <li>Our family is very blond with pale skin, and the color, to me, is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller thanks for shipping the stain so quickly.</li>
            <li>If you purchase stain for a light wash of color that won&#x27;t come off on anything (such as another person&#x27;s cheek), requiring touching up center of lips after lunch but otherwise wearing only gloss all day, this is NOT for you.</li>
            <li>It is considerably darker than in the photo -- more of an intense black cherry colour.</li>
            <li>Great staying power, just a little too dark for my taste.</li>
            <li>It is a bit hard to use at first and you may need to figure-out your favorite application tool ( I use a brush).</li>
            <li>You get a lot, is reasonably priced, and what a pretty ruby red!</li>
            <li>If you look at the lower right hand side of lips you will see a purple red color.  </li>
            <li>Oh, tossed the item after trying it once as new</li>
            <li>seller is a joy to do business with, very professional and obviously stands behind her product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides the lovely color, the other thing I like is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my lips or increase how fast they dry.</li>
            <li>Just give it a good long time to dry (I like to put it on right after foundation and let it dry the whole time I&#x27;m doing my other makeup).  </li>
            <li>But I will spring for a fresh tube now that I see how long I have had it.</li>
            <li>The only gel that doesn&#x27;t just smear off the first time you touch it when applying.</li>
            <li>Even with taking as much off as I could with a tissue paper as soon as I put it on, it was still red enough that my 19 mo old daughter saw right away that I was wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>I would like them to stain and last long like the the cheap aloe lipsticks  (MOOD LIPSTICKS) or like \\&quot;Tangee Lipstick\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Use a little for a light color, more for dark red lips!</li>
            <li>this is ok but doesn&#x27;t last long enough despite 2 applications after 1st dries</li>
            <li>It can be worn as sheer as you wish, by blotting off more or less of the stain after application.</li>
            <li>You can put on a tiny bit (a dab on the lips and then rub it in) for a gentle pink tone or put on a full layer for intense red.  </li>
            <li>This product came so quickly, at four days before it was expected to arrive!</li>
            <li>No need to reapply once during the day I throw a clear gloss on it and go about my business.  </li>
            <li>If you wanted a sheen over it,  any clear gloss would do.    </li>
            <li>I use a clear lip gloss over for a shiny finish.  </li>
            <li>This tops all the rest by far.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get clumpy, but I needed to frequently reapply it.</li>
            <li>I was worried that I&#x27;d never find a product to replace my old lip stain that was discontinued...</li>
            <li>Most lip stains I&#x27;ve used have been the marker type, that leave a weird residue and then wears off fast, within two hours if I so much as drink.  </li>
            <li>I give long lectures at work, and it lasts pretty well through 2 hours of talking and water drinking.</li>
            <li>(Try Vincent Longo gel stain, NOT lipstain, with the old ingredient list, NOT the one on HSN, and NOT the pearlessence variety which clumps and flakes and does not stain.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have also been having fun layering different sheer glosses</li>
            <li>The one thing I can say though that keeps me from a truly rave review is the applicator is not really the right way to get the stain on the lips.....</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, this is by far my favorite lip color, and</li>
            <li>One tube is going to last a long time since it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your whole lips.  </li>
            <li>I think it is worth the price, and see no reason to use any other lip stain.</li>
            <li>I e-mailed the company a few times with questions and they were fast to respond and very fast to ship.  </li>
            <li>I followed one of them and am using a brush to apply so that I can get a more subtle shade.</li>
            <li>It does not feel like a heavy coat of pantone paint like many others and is not nearly as drying.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable considering that this is so long lasting.</li>
            <li>Goes on even coats well, and you can make it as heavy or as light as you want, it will last.</li>
            <li>and you have the intense blue red once again.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for about a week and have already ordered 2 other colors and done a lipstick drawer clean-out that has me seeing the wood on the bottom of the drawer for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>it lasts forever, does not feel sticky or crusty once it dries and the color is crazy vibrant and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I really like this long lasting lip stain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found better staying power when I apply thin layers.</li>
            <li>During a very busy day I don&#x27;t reapply and at the end of the day there is noting left with regular lipstick.  </li>
            <li>In contrast to other lip stains I&#x27;ve tried, the Morpho product really is long-lasting.</li>
            <li>really wanted to like this, so have experimented endlessly.</li>
            <li>but it really does not last like I expected.</li>
            <li>Morpho went above and beyond when my package came late, which is so rare!  </li>
            <li>This is a true stain as it dries on your lips and does not come off for hours (at least 6 hours) and thats with eating and drinking.</li>
            <li>This might not be one you want to reapply in the bathroom if you have unsteady hands after having a few, ladies ;)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it too dark at all, however, I do find that the applicator applies too much product for my personal taste.  </li>
            <li>This is because in the sea of delivered-to-my-door scarves, toasters, toothbrushes and office supplies I have found much convenience but little that is so novel and  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s too intense, a little blotting immediately after applying</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The color is amazing &amp; goes on great</li>
            <li> I read about this product when searching online for a good lip stain and someone raved about it.</li>
            <li> This is a good, long-lasting lip stain.</li>
            <li> Regardless, this is a gorgeous color...</li>
            <li> They sent me a lip pencil which is also a gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> Once it is on it will color your lips but not your cups, your napkins or your loved ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Texture</li>
            <li> Good luck!ther products I have tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I look forward to buying more products from this company - would be great if they came out with an even darker/brown-red/less bright stain.</li>
            <li> Great product, great freebies, all packed sweetly, with suggestions on use.  </li>
            <li> They even included a complimentary creamy lip pencil which works so well with the lip stain, and a beautiful butterfly sticker!</li>
            <li> Good product and nice color.  </li>
            <li> Was REALLY impressed with this product and seller - not only is it a great product, but it was beautifully packaged, and the seller even threw in a great lip pencil for free.</li>

            <li> This is lovely!</li>
            <li> You do not get better than these lip stains and glosses!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;2 stars because if it is applied perfectly, it looks pretty nice for an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Beautiful red, and it came with a lip pencil in a beautiful color!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I got it and was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> $20 may seem like a lot, but the tube looks like it going to last for months, and it works great and feels great!</li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered after reading the good reviews it received on here.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t find a way to wear this product.</li>
            <li> , it arrived quickly and was beautifully packaged.</li>
            <li> It is also very very strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m grateful it&#x27;ll be so easy to get it again when I run out!</li>
            <li> The lip stain arrived very nicely packaged with a complimentary lip liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried most of the available &#x27;stains&#x27; and &#x27;long-lasting&#x27; lip products and this is by and large the best.  </li>
            <li> Morpho&#x27;s Super Staying Stain is perfect: rich color that lasts and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Im 56 and have fine lines!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 20 dollars (very cheap for the value)  </li>
            <li> Not dry, gorgeous color and lasts Forever!!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I have tried SO many and they never stay.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found one that I truly love.  </li>
            <li> I like this better anyway.</li>
            <li> I just put it on with chapstick over top, and I look like a pin-up girl all day.  </li>
            <li> Love the product..</li>
            <li> Fantastic service!  </li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> My Cover Girl does a way better job.  </li>
            <li> color lasts a while, but more in the range of an hour or two, not 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Possibly the BEST Amazon vendor I&#x27;ve ever dealt with.  </li>
            <li> Love this color and plan to buy more soon.</li>
            <li> I love this lip stain.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter and her friends love it.</li>
            <li> I have used it many ways...</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this stain.</li>
            <li> (I think the color sticks better to it for some reason).  </li>
            <li> Also the color is THE PERFECT shade of red.  </li>
            <li> I love this lip stain.  </li>
            <li> This product is the best will never go back to lipstick!</li>
            <li> The color is the perfect red!</li>
            <li> I even got a free lip liner inclosed!</li>
            <li> It was runny and got all over one of my favorite dresses.</li>
            <li> Janine included a nice note and a complimentary lip pencil (which is also really nice.</li>
            <li> Always getting compliments :)</li>
            <li> I actually love this stuff even more.</li>
            <li> Maybe after I get tan it will look better.  </li>
            <li> Most expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish they made more colors.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> It feels minty and I just love it.</li>
            <li> The undertones are more brownish than purplish.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this color.</li>
            <li> If you want even more color, it layers well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I put gloss directly on top without thoroughly stripping all product off, it transfers to everything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the bottle appearance and applicator are nice, the neck gets sufficient leakage that it allows minuscule drops to fly out with the action of opening the top, causing irreparable staining to two garments.</li>
            <li> Will buy in more colors.  </li>
            <li> My order arrived far faster than I was expecting, and it was beautifully packaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long-lasting lip stain for a long time, &amp; I believe this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> The product was wrapped beautifully by the seller, and that really made me feel special.</li>
            <li> Blotting it seems to lighten it some and makes it not so glaring, however , that causes it to come off more easily.  </li>
            <li> The owner was courteous, polite, and quick to respond.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a liquid, so it&#x27;s not as drying, and when applied lightly gives me that perfect red blush look that lasts.  </li>
            <li> I love the color of this lip stain its perfect and a true red.</li>
            <li> color is beautiful, but a little bright for my complexion.</li>
            <li> Plus the lipstain&#x27;s great, looks wonderfully natural, and LASTS  </li>
            <li> first stain and wonderfully happy! arrived fast (yesterday) and the true test...</li>
            <li> The customer service was as excellent as other people reported.  </li>
            <li> Of the five products this is what I was most excited about.</li>
            <li> Applying it with the applicator is convenient and easy to do.</li>
            <li> It will drip easily too so</li>
            <li> It is extremely easy to screw up, so if you are looking for something you can touch up on the go, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes apply a clear gloss on top and you&#x27;re good for the day.</li>
            <li> It is vibrant but not gaudy, and seems to look good on everyone.</li>
            <li> Snap Dragon is a lovely shade of berry red and has a very nice peppermint taste.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Snap Dragon Red - a gorgeous shade that is bright and vibrantly colorful - but still not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> No matter what I do, the color goes on beautiful but does NOT last.</li>
            <li> The seller is also fantastic - the product arrived very quickly; included an organza bag and even a lip pencil freebie (can&#x27;t wait to try).</li>
            <li> you desire beautifully bold color with staying power, this IS for you!</li>
            <li> To be perfectly honest, I would prefer a less brown undertone, but since the product really is the best I have found, I figure beggars can&#x27;t be choosers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a lip stain that stays and this product fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> Neither product feathers which is so important</li>
            <li> Many claim but rarely ever deliver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smooth rich color with staying power).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and the seller packaged it beautifully with freebies and super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Snap Dragon Red is a BOLD color and it looks great.</li>
            <li> Nothing stays on forever, but this is a pretty good lip stain and it came with a free high end product to also try.  </li>
            <li> Fun!</li>
            <li> I then used over-the-counter brands for years and then was excited to hear about this product.    </li>
            <li> Also, the seller threw in a complimentary lip pencil and a note with tips on how to use the product!</li>
            <li> I think this lip stain stays on longer than most and is a pretty color.  </li>
            <li> I give it a thumbs up and a nd think the price was worth it!</li>
            <li> A liner needs to be used in order to make a clean outline of your lips.  </li>
            <li> Awsum lip stain color was great stayed on super long was so worth it!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous rich red!</li>
            <li> I love the lip pencil that came with this and the stain is not really a stain, but fades as the day goes on, I love that about it!</li>
            <li> I purchased 5 different lip stains from various vendors/brands and this was the perfect one!</li>
            <li> Luckily, I was able to get my money back from my credit card company, but I sure didn&#x27;t want to order it again.</li>
            <li> Simple, make sure you exfoliate your lips with a cloth, and make sure they&#x27;re moisturized.    </li>
            <li> I love this company and will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped quickly and even contained a matching lip pencil for FREE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> quickly on the lips</li>
            <li> B0021J367C Super</li>
            <li> that I love and recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I can easily control how bright the color becomes by dabbing a little bit on at a time.</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear this color (almost everyday :) ) I receive so many compliments!</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing like the picture they have of it on their light model.</li>
            <li> Lasts, stays, does not bleed and looks more natural than lipstick.  </li>
            <li> but my lips were nice and red</li>
            <li> It arrived within a week of ordering it, and I received a complimentary lip liner.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not even worth putting on.  </li>
            <li> Plus it has a non-greasy feel and a fun minty touch.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last my whole shift, but it lasts a good seven, eight hours after application.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure the color completely dries before rubbing lips together or applying a balm or chapstick or gloss.</li>
            <li> I liked the initial appearance.</li>
            <li> your lips are even 1% dry, it will adhere more to that area becoming even darker&lt;</li>
            <li> My package arrived quickly with some special extra touches that are pretty rare these days. :)</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness they were right.  </li>
            <li> This beautiful blue red is what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li> (since the stains are only available in red &amp; brown red), beautiful~!!</li>
            <li> This color was a bit bright for me, but I liked that it didn&#x27;t go on as dry as some other lip stains.  </li>
            <li> But, its great virtue is it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips like most of the other products I have tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to mess with constant primping.</li>
            <li> It came super quick, with a personal note from Morpho Cosmetics, and a free complimentary lip liner.</li>
            <li> I received the lip stain with a complimentary lip pencil and two cute blue morpho butterfly stickers that you bend and stick to something</li>
            <li> also can only use this if your lips are smooth smooth, so you might need to exfoliate them before use.</li>
            <li> It is really nice to put it on, let it dry well and then add glass, lipstick or plumper too.  </li>
            <li> Very, VERY saturated color.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty.  </li>
            <li> /lipsticks on top for various shade options.  </li>
            <li> It stays on forever, and I love the red color!!  </li>
            <li> So many ways to create different looks.</li>
            <li> Overall, pleased with this stain.</li>
            <li> Love that I don&#x27;t have to constantly re-apply.</li>
            <li> just use the lip stain, and use a light color lipstick or lip balm on top to tone done the dark color</li>
            <li> waste your money, it&#x27;s only good for an hour or two at the most.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice stain on your lips that will last most of the day and does not get blotchy after a while like some of the other ones.  </li>
            <li> It will go on pretty intense and you can leave it like that if you want, or you can lighten it by blotting it before it dries.  </li>
            <li> Being of fair skin, I was a little unsure about going for such a bold red, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this color would be the nice red red that was shown in the picture, but it is actually a little more purple and the color I associate with cheap lipsticks  </li>
            <li> Stays on okay,, but it makes your lips dry.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t let the $20 price scare you, you do get a lot of product and because it&#x27;s a gel it doesn&#x27;t dry out like those $8 magic marker types.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a very moist gel stain and it stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This lipstain was certainly number 1 in one category.</li>
            <li> But the awesome thing about this is you can put on less and have a lighter color,  you really can put on as little or as much as you want.     </li>
            <li> In all my years supporting the e-economy with my steady stream of Amazon purchases I have never written a review before.</li>
            <li> me, putting it on first thing, when my lips are dry and have nothing on them, letting them dry completely after application, and then following up with gloss gives me the best result.</li>
            <li> Got here fast</li>
            <li> Plus, you really have to over-lay this product with some lip moisturizer as it is very drying.</li>
            <li> Finally, I really like the name \\&quot;Snap Dragon.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> You have to work fast once on your lips.</li>
            <li> I recommend it, plus the company has fabulous customer service, very personal and caring.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product and OCC&#x27;s Nomad Stained Gloss are my absolute favorites.</li>
            <li> I waited a couple of weeks before writing the review to really test the staying power.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome..you can build up the color.</li>
            <li> so it goes from a bright clear almost-pink to a deep red.  </li>
            <li> : So this is where Morpho really shines; this stain stays put --for reals.</li>
            <li> Instead, it really stains the lips red while letting your lips feel and look more natural.</li>
            <li> I love the lip stains, super long lasting.</li>
            <li> This red is a very nice deep red.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble with bleeding or feathering; the foam applicator gives a nice sharp outline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Or is it coz you&#x27;re smiling more due to the compliments???)</li>
            <li> The colour is an intense, true red which didn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> It is not so much dark as deeply pigmented and still bright.</li>
            <li> Some may stay,but they get blotchy or bleed all over your first cup of coffee (doesn&#x27;t really look professional in that morning meeting).</li>
            <li> after I had a faint red still on my lips (and I only applied it lightly to begin with) very happy!</li>
            <li> It is a hard to come by absolutely dramatic, bright, beautiful, bold, wow &#x27;em red.</li>
            <li> Yes, the color loses its intensity after you drink your favorite beverage, BUT a quick touch up</li>
            <li> it does leave your lips looking rather dry after the product has set, but I just add some gloss or Burt&#x27;s Bees and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> The color is a true red, and not a blue-red or orange-red.</li>
            <li> I didnt want my new husband to be wearing my lipstick!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s can be layered for more or less color, is not at all drying for me, and I like the application wand.</li>
            <li> Not a subtle effect like I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Being realistic, over a period of 8 hours, you would  want to touch up the stain once.</li>
            <li> The color is the main problem for me.  </li>
            <li> I love that you can put on the lipstain in a couple different ways to get different effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of classic lipsticks, though; I prefer stains and glosses.</li>
            <li> I appreciate it most, however, because the color is also perfect for me (the Zinnia looks terrible on me).</li>
            <li> The Snapdragon is a deep, vibrant, pure red that can go on as light or as intense as you want it.  </li>
            <li> Our family is very blond with pale skin, and the color, to me, is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller thanks for shipping the stain so quickly.</li>
            <li> If you purchase stain for a light wash of color that won&#x27;t come off on anything (such as another person&#x27;s cheek), requiring touching up center of lips after lunch but otherwise wearing only gloss all day, this is NOT for you.</li>
            <li> It is considerably darker than in the photo -- more of an intense black cherry colour.</li>
            <li> Great staying power, just a little too dark for my taste.</li>
            <li> It is a bit hard to use at first and you may need to figure-out your favorite application tool ( I use a brush).</li>
            <li> You get a lot, is reasonably priced, and what a pretty ruby red!</li>
            <li> If you look at the lower right hand side of lips you will see a purple red color.  </li>
            <li> Oh, tossed the item after trying it once as new</li>
            <li> seller is a joy to do business with, very professional and obviously stands behind her product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides the lovely color, the other thing I like is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my lips or increase how fast they dry.</li>
            <li> Just give it a good long time to dry (I like to put it on right after foundation and let it dry the whole time I&#x27;m doing my other makeup).  </li>
            <li> But I will spring for a fresh tube now that I see how long I have had it.</li>
            <li> The only gel that doesn&#x27;t just smear off the first time you touch it when applying.</li>
            <li> Even with taking as much off as I could with a tissue paper as soon as I put it on, it was still red enough that my 19 mo old daughter saw right away that I was wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> I would like them to stain and last long like the the cheap aloe lipsticks  (MOOD LIPSTICKS) or like \\&quot;Tangee Lipstick\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Use a little for a light color, more for dark red lips!</li>
            <li> this is ok but doesn&#x27;t last long enough despite 2 applications after 1st dries</li>
            <li> It can be worn as sheer as you wish, by blotting off more or less of the stain after application.</li>
            <li> You can put on a tiny bit (a dab on the lips and then rub it in) for a gentle pink tone or put on a full layer for intense red.  </li>
            <li> This product came so quickly, at four days before it was expected to arrive!</li>
            <li> No need to reapply once during the day I throw a clear gloss on it and go about my business.  </li>
            <li> If you wanted a sheen over it,  any clear gloss would do.    </li>
            <li> I use a clear lip gloss over for a shiny finish.  </li>
            <li> This tops all the rest by far.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get clumpy, but I needed to frequently reapply it.</li>
            <li> I was worried that I&#x27;d never find a product to replace my old lip stain that was discontinued...</li>
            <li> Most lip stains I&#x27;ve used have been the marker type, that leave a weird residue and then wears off fast, within two hours if I so much as drink.  </li>
            <li> I give long lectures at work, and it lasts pretty well through 2 hours of talking and water drinking.</li>
            <li> (Try Vincent Longo gel stain, NOT lipstain, with the old ingredient list, NOT the one on HSN, and NOT the pearlessence variety which clumps and flakes and does not stain.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have also been having fun layering different sheer glosses</li>
            <li> The one thing I can say though that keeps me from a truly rave review is the applicator is not really the right way to get the stain on the lips.....</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, this is by far my favorite lip color, and</li>
            <li> One tube is going to last a long time since it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your whole lips.  </li>
            <li> I think it is worth the price, and see no reason to use any other lip stain.</li>
            <li> I e-mailed the company a few times with questions and they were fast to respond and very fast to ship.  </li>
            <li> I followed one of them and am using a brush to apply so that I can get a more subtle shade.</li>
            <li> It does not feel like a heavy coat of pantone paint like many others and is not nearly as drying.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable considering that this is so long lasting.</li>
            <li> Goes on even coats well, and you can make it as heavy or as light as you want, it will last.</li>
            <li> and you have the intense blue red once again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a week and have already ordered 2 other colors and done a lipstick drawer clean-out that has me seeing the wood on the bottom of the drawer for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> it lasts forever, does not feel sticky or crusty once it dries and the color is crazy vibrant and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I really like this long lasting lip stain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found better staying power when I apply thin layers.</li>
            <li> During a very busy day I don&#x27;t reapply and at the end of the day there is noting left with regular lipstick.  </li>
            <li> In contrast to other lip stains I&#x27;ve tried, the Morpho product really is long-lasting.</li>
            <li> really wanted to like this, so have experimented endlessly.</li>
            <li> but it really does not last like I expected.</li>
            <li> Morpho went above and beyond when my package came late, which is so rare!  </li>
            <li> This is a true stain as it dries on your lips and does not come off for hours (at least 6 hours) and thats with eating and drinking.</li>
            <li> This might not be one you want to reapply in the bathroom if you have unsteady hands after having a few, ladies ;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it too dark at all, however, I do find that the applicator applies too much product for my personal taste.  </li>
            <li> This is because in the sea of delivered-to-my-door scarves, toasters, toothbrushes and office supplies I have found much convenience but little that is so novel and  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too intense, a little blotting immediately after applying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple stains, and I was left with dry crumbly lips with color that did not last.  </li>
            <li> only negative thing I could think to say is that the packaging isn&#x27;t pretty at all.</li>
            <li> 10 minute rule is the key to a long lasting lip.</li>
            <li> Staying Lip Gloss - Cho Cho, a red brown - Morpho Cosmetics - long lasting lip gloss]]</li>
            <li> will take enough off to tone it down considerably.</li>
            <li> It also hasn&#x27;t lasted past meals for me, but maybe I lick my lips too much.</li>
            <li> Looking for a long lasting lip stain for my wedding - I didnt want to reapply all day -</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a red lip stain for a long time now that would not flake and could be worn lighter/darker depending on the occasion.  </li>
            <li> The color is long lasting.</li>
            <li> It feels dry on your lips and the overall appearance of our lips looks artificial...or painted on...</li>
            <li> I generally use a moisturizer on my lips before applying colour, so was not aware of any drying with this stain.     </li>
            <li> The colour can be toned down by blotting it while damp for a less intense look.   </li>
            <li> , you want to be careful when applying it, because if you &amp;#34;color outside the lines&amp;#34; it&#x27;s going to look weird, and isn&#x27;t as easy to correct as a cream lipstick.</li>
            <li> but you can pretty much eliminate this by exfoliating your lips with a damp washcloth (a few hard swipes will do it) and then dabbing on a little moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It is very dark and does not look natural.  </li>
            <li> am not a verified buyer as I&#x27;d only bought the product directly from the company in the past.</li>
            <li> it lasts for so long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my lips look strange or flake off.  </li>
            <li> I have been on a long wear lip product binge for a while now.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I expected.</li>
            <li> It took a few minutes to dry completely.</li>
            <li> When I go out, I use the same color, Snap Dragon Red, and just apply it a little deeper.</li>
            <li> It stays just as long on your finger if you use your finger!</li>
            <li> This stuff does not come off, even after I applied clear gloss and later on in the day at least a couple applications of Carmex.  </li>
            <li> I let it dry for a minute</li>
            <li> (just let it dry a moment to set).  </li>
            <li> BUT if you have chapped lips it will accentuate any dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-It does dry my lips out&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lip stain can last me half a day with eating &amp; drinking.</li>
            <li> I have put a little of my Cover Girl over this product and my color did last longer.  </li>
            <li> , I like to apply it and not think about it except for a little powder later in the day.  </li>
            <li> once it starts to look bad (about an hour at most)</li>
            <li> The only thing is, it can be messy if it spills.  </li>
            <li> Be careful when opening.  </li>
            <li> On me the color is quite red, almost vampy purplish red if I put it on thick.</li>
            <li> otherwise, you get an ugly uneven spread with the dry parts taking in more color.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way....</li>
            <li> The applicator is great-you don&#x27;t need to use your fingers and therefore get them stained as you do with some of the other brands.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have to wear it with colored lip gloss or any other product that will transfer color.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t want to get it on your carpet or clothes you must be very careful.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not &amp;#34;Goths&amp;#34;, and the color is rather startling on a young face, but it seems to have come back in fashion.</li>
            <li> It can feel a tad dry and powdery once you&#x27;ve had it on for a few minutes</li>
            <li> Four stars because after a few weeks, lips get very dry and you&#x27;ll need to use lip moisturizer at night to re-hydrate.</li>
            <li> I hate to penalize a company for making something that works TOO well, but this really ought to be labeled as a lipstick not a stain because is is HIGHLY transferrable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does fade if you&#x27;re talking/eating a lot, but even after 10+ hours there is still enough of a tint that it looks like you&#x27;ve at least put on lipstick.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is quite dark as other reviewers have noted, and that&#x27;s why I bought it!</li>
            <li> OUT THERE HANDS DOWN.</li>
            <li> ; that it (eventually) breaks down to.</li>
            <li> It lasts way longer then other products I have tried!</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t stay on half of my lips.</li>
            <li> All lip stains are somewhat drying, but this one is less so.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-It does not fade evenly, all the little lines in your lips will be dark while the rest is lighter</li>
            <li> applying, then when dry a few minutes later, licking lips CAREFULLY (which stains my tongue terribly) to moisten, then completely wiping off all the lipstick with a tissue so that there is a STAIN left over.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty color so too bad it is not the answer to my quest for a lip stain that will last at least half a day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry up or feel thick on your lips.</li>
            <li> I prefer to dip a lip brush against the applicator and pick up a little stain, and apply it in layers to achieve the shade I want.</li>
            <li> There is a little stopper inside that should keep this from happening; however, mine has come out a couple of times and it can spill.  </li>
            <li> If it fades that&#x27;s fine, I just don&#x27;t want it to transfer, so that makes this product worthless for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I also got their other color of lip stain and like it, too!!).  </li>
            <li> A few licks....</li>
            <li> It goes on so thinly, like water, and it adhered to my entire lips!  </li>
            <li> I will still use it, but on those days I know I will have to check my lip color a few times during the day.</li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t moisturizing, it doesn&#x27;t seem to make the situation any WORSE, which is a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> I have (dyed) red hair and pale, yellow base skin, but with a lot of red blotchiness to my face.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> so it is extremely hard to apply within the lip line without making a bit of a mess.  </li>
            <li> It works at least as well as any drugstore brand I&#x27;ve tried and is much less drying.</li>
            <li> I usually avoid lip stains because the ones I&#x27;ve tried are drying.  </li>
            <li> I make it come off, so I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;d do after that :</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry lips, and lots of lip color products are immediately awful.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for the middle-aged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, if you out there reading this have also been on the long and expensive quest for a lip product you can apply and forget, I would recommend you give this one a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, if you out there reading this have also been on the long and expensive quest for a lip product you can apply and forget, I would recommend you give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find...</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t expect it to be that DARK!!!</li>
            <li> I hate wearing lipstick and gloss wears off too fast.  </li>
            <li> You will be shocked by how darkly it goes on in a single coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I want serious drama, I just put on layer after layer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It is crazy dark.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it dabbing over chap-stick to make it lighter, this made the color shift into lines even worse....</li>
            <li> lip stain is a game changer.</li>

            <li> I received the lip stain with a complimentary lip pencil and two cute blue morpho butterfly stickers that you bend and stick to something so they look like they are flying.  They are currently on my monitor...cute!  Anyway the lip stain.  I have tried SO many and they never stay.  Someone else said in their review \\&quot;this is the one you&#x27;re looking for\\&quot;.  Oh my goodness they were right.  This stuff does not come off, even after I applied clear gloss and later on in the day at least a couple applications of Carmex.  Just give it a good long time to dry (I like to put it on right after foundation and let it dry the whole time I&#x27;m doing my other makeup).  I highly recommend this product and the seller packaged it beautifully with freebies and super fast shipping.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased 5 different lip stains from various vendors/brands and this was the perfect one! It goes on smoothly and evenly.  It leaves a nice stain on your lips that will last most of the day and does not get blotchy after a while like some of the other ones.  The applicator is great-you don&#x27;t need to use your fingers and therefore get them stained as you do with some of the other brands.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The snap dragon stain is peeeerrrrrrrrfect!  Lasts, stays, does not bleed and looks more natural than lipstick.  Got here fast and I get tons of compliments.      Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great, non-sticky stain, it arrived quickly and was beautifully packaged. Awesome customer appreciation and awesome product</li>
            <li> I like this lip stain. it lasts for so long. I just didn&#x27;t expect it to be that DARK!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty.  But lasting long,ah,no.  A few licks....going,going,gone.  I would like them to stain and last long like the the cheap aloe lipsticks  (MOOD LIPSTICKS) or like \\&quot;Tangee Lipstick\\&quot;.  But these colors are too bright for me to use as a cover up.  I have vitiligo,and I have some on my lips.  Lipsticks wear off to soon,that&#x27;s the reason why I was looking into stains.  Haven&#x27;t found one that I truly love.  But will keep hunting.</li>
            <li> In contrast to other lip stains I&#x27;ve tried, the Morpho product really is long-lasting. The colour is an intense, true red which didn&#x27;t fade. Applying it with the applicator is convenient and easy to do. It took a few minutes to dry completely. The colour can be toned down by blotting it while damp for a less intense look.   I generally use a moisturizer on my lips before applying colour, so was not aware of any drying with this stain.     My order arrived far faster than I was expecting, and it was beautifully packaged. This product does all I&#x27;d hoped for. I think it is worth the price, and see no reason to use any other lip stain.</li>
            <li> I really like this long lasting lip stain. It lasts for hours. I just reapply lip balm for moisture since I have a tendency towards chapped lips. It&#x27;s not moisturizing. I don&#x27;t find it too dark at all, however, I do find that the applicator applies too much product for my personal taste.  I prefer to dip a lip brush against the applicator and pick up a little stain, and apply it in layers to achieve the shade I want. The price is very reasonable considering that this is so long lasting. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I usually avoid lip stains because the ones I&#x27;ve tried are drying.  Morpho&#x27;s Super Staying Stain is perfect: rich color that lasts and is comfortable to wear. I use it alone but I have also been having fun layering different sheer glosses/lipsticks on top for various shade options.  Fun! Great products.</li>
            <li> I read about this product when searching online for a good lip stain and someone raved about it. I decided to order some.  I e-mailed the company a few times with questions and they were fast to respond and very fast to ship.  I&#x27;m 43 and have tried a LOT of lip stains in my life and have always been disappointed. One time I was on vacation and there was a Sephora at a mall. I tried a lip stain they recommended. It wouldn&#x27;t stay on half of my lips. I returned it and got another one they recommended. It was crappy, too, but we were going home, so I was stuck keeping it. My lips are often chapped. Maybe that&#x27;s the problem. I then used over-the-counter brands for years and then was excited to hear about this product.    I got it and was thrilled with it. It goes on so thinly, like water, and it adhered to my entire lips!  I let it dry for a minute and it felt like I was wearing nothing but my lips were nice and red (I also got their other color of lip stain and like it, too!!).  One tube is going to last a long time since it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your whole lips.  It even has a pleasant minty smell when you put it on. My lips were still red after breakfast and then after lunch at work. I&#x27;m thinking of getting another so that I can keep one at work for when I forget to put it on in the mornings at home.       I used to like Mehru (a henna lip dye I got once at a store). But when mine ran out, and no store carried it, I placed an order online and never got the order after several months. Luckily, I was able to get my money back from my credit card company, but I sure didn&#x27;t want to order it again. Many others have mentioned this problem online, too, but now it doesn&#x27;t matter!  I like this better anyway. $20 may seem like a lot, but the tube looks like it going to last for months, and it works great and feels great!</li>
            <li> It is a great stain.......definitely does stain and stay.  The one thing I can say though that keeps me from a truly rave review is the applicator is not really the right way to get the stain on the lips.....the stain is VERY thin in viscosity so it is extremely hard to apply within the lip line without making a bit of a mess.  It will drip easily too so if you don&#x27;t want to get it on your carpet or clothes you must be very careful.  I have found it easier to use my finger on the wand and transfer the color that way......then your finger is red all day!  Plus, you really have to over-lay this product with some lip moisturizer as it is very drying.</li>
            <li> Very, VERY saturated color. Great staying power, just a little too dark for my taste.</li>
            <li> This is a liquid stain. It is difficult to apply and impossible to get out of anything if you have an inadvertent spill.  Stain lasts longer on a blouse than on the lips. It is a pretty color so too bad it is not the answer to my quest for a lip stain that will last at least half a day.</li>
            <li> This stain has staying power. Snap Dragon is a lovely shade of berry red and has a very nice peppermint taste. Do not use your finger to apply or blend it in, it will stain your finger for hours!!! Use a lipbrush to blend.</li>
            <li> It is considerably darker than in the photo -- more of an intense black cherry colour.</li>
            <li> first stain and wonderfully happy! arrived fast (yesterday) and the true test...I wore it to the dentist for a cleaning- and it lasted! after I had a faint red still on my lips (and I only applied it lightly to begin with) very happy!</li>
            <li> It stays on forever, and I love the red color!!  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find... I just put it on with chapstick over top, and I look like a pin-up girl all day.  And I am usually terrible with keeping lipstick on all day.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lip stain that stays and this product fit the bill.  When applied correctly this stain lasts for hours longer than a lipstuck.  No need to reapply once during the day I throw a clear gloss on it and go about my business.  As someone who needs color on lips to even out my complexion it is literally a lifesaver.  During a very busy day I don&#x27;t reapply and at the end of the day there is noting left with regular lipstick.  Love the product..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color and it has good staying power. It arrived within a week of ordering it, and I received a complimentary lip liner. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Was REALLY impressed with this product and seller - not only is it a great product, but it was beautifully packaged, and the seller even threw in a great lip pencil for free. I look forward to buying more products from this company - would be great if they came out with an even darker/brown-red/less bright stain.</li>
            <li> Fantastic service!  Ordered from Illinois and got it in three days - the Snap Dragon and Berry stains, and they included a lip pencil. Over the moon  about these silky, luscious, non-drying products.  You can believe the rave reviews!  The perfect start to Spring.</li>
            <li> This color was a bit bright for me, but I liked that it didn&#x27;t go on as dry as some other lip stains.  This seller is awesome and included some tips in the package.  I followed one of them and am using a brush to apply so that I can get a more subtle shade. Also, did I mention this seller is awesome? My package arrived quickly with some special extra touches that are pretty rare these days. :)</li>
            <li> This is a good, long-lasting lip stain. It can be worn as sheer as you wish, by blotting off more or less of the stain after application. The color is a true red, and not a blue-red or orange-red. Finally, I really like the name \\&quot;Snap Dragon.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is very red. You have to work fast once on your lips. It does stay on! Use a little for a light color, more for dark red lips!</li>
            <li> I love the color but it really does not last like I expected. My Cover Girl does a way better job.  I don&#x27;t have time at work to check my lips so I want to know that my lipstick is doing it&#x27;s job.  The price wasn&#x27;t too bad but it would have made me happier if there wouldn&#x27;t have been a shipping charge.  I have put a little of my Cover Girl over this product and my color did last longer.  I will still use it, but on those days I know I will have to check my lip color a few times during the day.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this lip stain its perfect and a true red. I have been looking for this for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller thanks for shipping the stain so quickly.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this color would be the nice red red that was shown in the picture, but it is actually a little more purple and the color I associate with cheap lipsticks  you can get for $3 at your local grocery store (which I use, if I want a purple color).&lt;br /&gt;You also can only use this if your lips are smooth smooth, so you might need to exfoliate them before use. otherwise, you get an ugly uneven spread with the dry parts taking in more color.&lt;br /&gt;The color lasts a while, but more in the range of an hour or two, not 8 hours. It also hasn&#x27;t lasted past meals for me, but maybe I lick my lips too much. It is also very very strong. You have to just dab (along the outside of your lips) and blend inward, and then erase erase erase, otherwise it looks cartoonish. Even with taking as much off as I could with a tissue paper as soon as I put it on, it was still red enough that my 19 mo old daughter saw right away that I was wearing makeup. Not a subtle effect like I was hoping for. Also, you NEED a mirror if you are going to put this on. It is extremely easy to screw up, so if you are looking for something you can touch up on the go, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars because if it is applied perfectly, it looks pretty nice for an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Possibly the BEST Amazon vendor I&#x27;ve ever dealt with.  Great product, great freebies, all packed sweetly, with suggestions on use.  Morpho went above and beyond when my package came late, which is so rare!  Plus the lipstain&#x27;s great, looks wonderfully natural, and LASTS  (just let it dry a moment to set).  Love this color and plan to buy more soon.</li>
            <li> I love this lip stain. it lasts forever, does not feel sticky or crusty once it dries and the color is crazy vibrant and smells nice. Did I mention it LASTS FOREVER!?</li>
            <li> As my prior review stated, this is a product for younger women or teens. My granddaughter and her friends love it. They&#x27;re not &amp;#34;Goths&amp;#34;, and the color is rather startling on a young face, but it seems to have come back in fashion. Our family is very blond with pale skin, and the color, to me, is overwhelming. My granddaughter says it is &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34;, and so it is. Not suitable for the middle-aged.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on evenly.  I&#x27;m sticking with Benetint.</li>
            <li> I have tried a LOT of lip stains. This tops all the rest by far. Beautiful red, and it came with a lip pencil in a beautiful color! I will be buying the Zinnia when it comes back in stock.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous rich red! Blotted, it leaves a matte stain that lasts and lasts! It does not bleed either.  I have used it many ways...alone, with gloss over it, with lighter lipstick over it, or I have dabbed this on over gloss or lipstick. So many ways to create different looks. I recommend it, plus the company has fabulous customer service, very personal and caring.&lt;br /&gt;Updated 12/1/14.....I still have the same tube bought 4 years ago! A little goes a long way.... Still love it! But I will spring for a fresh tube now that I see how long I have had it.</li>
            <li> Overall, pleased with this stain. it does leave your lips looking rather dry after the product has set, but I just add some gloss or Burt&#x27;s Bees and it&#x27;s fine. Love that I don&#x27;t have to constantly re-apply.</li>
            <li> This stain is different from all the others out there. It&#x27;s more like a very moist gel stain and it stays on all day long. I ordered the Snap Dragon Red - a gorgeous shade that is bright and vibrantly colorful - but still not too overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t dry up or feel thick on your lips. Instead, it really stains the lips red while letting your lips feel and look more natural. I am so glad I found this stain. The product was wrapped beautifully by the seller, and that really made me feel special.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple stains, and I was left with dry crumbly lips with color that did not last.  This stain does not leave a crumbly residue BUT if you have chapped lips it will accentuate any dry skin.  (I think the color sticks better to it for some reason).  Simple, make sure you exfoliate your lips with a cloth, and make sure they&#x27;re moisturized.    After that, apply the stain wait a minute and you&#x27;re golden. Being realistic, over a period of 8 hours, you would  want to touch up the stain once. But you can ensure that you&#x27;re going to have all day/night color.   As a preferance, I like to wear chapstick over it, but it isn&#x27;t neccessary. If you wanted a sheen over it,  any clear gloss would do.    Also the color is THE PERFECT shade of red.  Another review said the color is dark, which if you apply it like a normal lip gloss  it is a very deep blood red. But the awesome thing about this is you can put on less and have a lighter color,  you really can put on as little or as much as you want.     A little goes a long way, this is by far my favorite lip color, and yeah it&#x27;s 20 dollars (very cheap for the value)  but it will last a while.</li>
            <li> The color is the main problem for me.  It is very dark and does not look natural.  It does look like you have been coated with a shiny artificial product.  Blotting it seems to lighten it some and makes it not so glaring, however , that causes it to come off more easily.  A liner needs to be used in order to make a clean outline of your lips.  It feels dry on your lips and the overall appearance of our lips looks artificial...or painted on...</li>
            <li> I love this lip stain.  Nothing else even stays on my lips so it&#x27;s not even worth putting on.  This stays and doesn&#x27;t do anything crazy like bleed or get sticky, and you can put chapstick over it.  This is perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to mess with constant primping.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it stays on way longer than lipstick!  I&#x27;ve always had a problem with keeping lipstick on and this is great!  I have ordered this a number of times - I never want to run out of it.  The only thing is, it can be messy if it spills.  There is a little stopper inside that should keep this from happening; however, mine has come out a couple of times and it can spill.  But it is semi-permanent lip color - almost as good as having your lips tattooed!  I use it every day!</li>
            <li> The only gel that doesn&#x27;t just smear off the first time you touch it when applying. Goes on even coats well, and you can make it as heavy or as light as you want, it will last. THE BEST STAIN OUT THERE HANDS DOWN. This red is a very nice deep red.</li>
            <li> This product is great. You get a lot, is reasonably priced, and what a pretty ruby red! It came super quick, with a personal note from Morpho Cosmetics, and a free complimentary lip liner. You can make the product a sheer wash of red, or vampy Twilight-esque. I am glad I ordered after reading the good reviews it received on here.</li>
            <li> this is ok but doesn&#x27;t last long enough despite 2 applications after 1st dries</li>
            <li> This color is absolutely beautiful! Also, the seller threw in a complimentary lip pencil and a note with tips on how to use the product!</li>
            <li> This beautiful blue red is what I&#x27;ve been looking for! Whenever I wear this color (almost everyday :) ) I receive so many compliments! It even makes your teeth seem whiter! (Or is it coz you&#x27;re smiling more due to the compliments???) Regardless, this is a gorgeous color... Yes, the color loses its intensity after you drink your favorite beverage, BUT a quick touch up and you have the intense blue red once again. truth be told, I even like the &amp;#34;bee-stung red/blush&amp;#34; that it (eventually) breaks down to.</li>
            <li> This product is the best will never go back to lipstick! The color is the perfect red! And the seller sent tips on how to get the most out of the great stuff! I even got a free lip liner inclosed! great color also! Neither product feathers which is so important Im 56 and have fine lines! Will definitly be reordering! Oh the packaging was so nice! Yeah very very pleased! Click order today!</li>
            <li> Looking for a long lasting lip stain for my wedding - I didnt want to reapply all day - PLUS I didnt want my new husband to be wearing my lipstick!  This is great.  Snap Dragon Red is a BOLD color and it looks great.</li>
            <li> This product came so quickly, at four days before it was expected to arrive! The lip stain stays on impeccably well and lasts all day. They even included a complimentary creamy lip pencil which works so well with the lip stain, and a beautiful butterfly sticker! I love this company and will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package to the Stain and opened it. It was runny and got all over one of my favorite dresses. Be careful when opening.  Stays on okay,, but it makes your lips dry.</li>
            <li> I bought the snapdragon lip stain. Janine included a nice note and a complimentary lip pencil (which is also really nice. Smooth rich color with staying power). I am impressed by her hands-on (and really fast shipping!) response and amazed by the products. The snapdragon is a fabulously rich color with staying power!!! Plus it has a non-greasy feel and a fun minty touch. I will be getting the zinnia at some point to try it out too.. I love that you can put on the lipstain in a couple different ways to get different effects. I look forward to more morpho products!</li>
            <li> The color is amazing &amp; goes on great but it didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I expected. It doesn&#x27;t get clumpy, but I needed to frequently reapply it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  You can put on a tiny bit (a dab on the lips and then rub it in) for a gentle pink tone or put on a full layer for intense red.  It does fade if you&#x27;re talking/eating a lot, but even after 10+ hours there is still enough of a tint that it looks like you&#x27;ve at least put on lipstick.  I have tried most of the available &#x27;stains&#x27; and &#x27;long-lasting&#x27; lip products and this is by and large the best.  No caking, peeling, or splotchiness.</li>
            <li> Awesome seller~!! I love the lip stains, super long lasting. I bought two, and then bought another four, because I want to share them with my girls &amp; my mom.&lt;br /&gt;I just use the lip stain, and use a light color lipstick or lip balm on top to tone done the dark color (since the stains are only available in red &amp; brown red), beautiful~!! The lip stain can last me half a day with eating &amp; drinking.</li>
            <li> Finally, a lip stain that lasts and doesn&#x27;t parch your lips to desiccation.  The Snapdragon is a deep, vibrant, pure red that can go on as light or as intense as you want it.  It can feel a tad dry and powdery once you&#x27;ve had it on for a few minutes but you can pretty much eliminate this by exfoliating your lips with a damp washcloth (a few hard swipes will do it) and then dabbing on a little moisturizer.  And the lip stain lasts for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is glorious.  It&#x27;s a real red red, not bluish or orangey.  It will go on pretty intense and you can leave it like that if you want, or you can lighten it by blotting it before it dries.  I had no trouble with bleeding or feathering; the foam applicator gives a nice sharp outline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is a joy to do business with, very professional and obviously stands behind her product.  The lip stain arrived very nicely packaged with a complimentary lip liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every dime. I&#x27;d definitely order from her again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judy Lind</li>
            <li> does not last and does not stay!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a red lip stain for a long time now that would not flake and could be worn lighter/darker depending on the occasion.  Well, I have finally found it!  All lip stains are somewhat drying, but this one is less so.  To keep my lips moisturized, I simply put lip balm on over the lip stain after it dries.  The customer service was as excellent as other people reported.  The shipment includes a lip liner and a signed note.  I will certainly be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I love Morpho Cosmetics!  Their stains have become a makeup kit staple.  Beautiful color that stays.  Always getting compliments :)</li>
            <li> Awsum lip stain color was great stayed on super long was so worth it!</li>
            <li> This is lovely! Being of fair skin, I was a little unsure about going for such a bold red, but I&#x27;m glad I did. I can easily control how bright the color becomes by dabbing a little bit on at a time. The color stays put evenly and even seems to make my lips appear a bit fuller. The seller is also fantastic - the product arrived very quickly; included an organza bag and even a lip pencil freebie (can&#x27;t wait to try). Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was worried that I&#x27;d never find a product to replace my old lip stain that was discontinued...I actually love this stuff even more. Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this stain-it is my one &#x27;must have&#x27; beauty product!</li>
            <li> I hate wearing lipstick and gloss wears off too fast.  I wear make up every day but I like it low maintenance, I like to apply it and not think about it except for a little powder later in the day.  Most lip stains I&#x27;ve used have been the marker type, that leave a weird residue and then wears off fast, within two hours if I so much as drink.  This one is perfect.  It&#x27;s a liquid, so it&#x27;s not as drying, and when applied lightly gives me that perfect red blush look that lasts.  It doesn&#x27;t last my whole shift, but it lasts a good seven, eight hours after application.  When I go out, I use the same color, Snap Dragon Red, and just apply it a little deeper. It doesn&#x27;t make my lips look strange or flake off.  Just a tip, put a smudge in the middle of your upper and lower lips, then blend out with a Qtip.  It stays just as long on your finger if you use your finger!</li>
            <li> I am a lip product junkie. I&#x27;m not a fan of classic lipsticks, though; I prefer stains and glosses. This product and OCC&#x27;s Nomad Stained Gloss are my absolute favorites. It&#x27;s can be layered for more or less color, is not at all drying for me, and I like the application wand. I appreciate it most, however, because the color is also perfect for me (the Zinnia looks terrible on me). I have (dyed) red hair and pale, yellow base skin, but with a lot of red blotchiness to my face.&lt;br /&gt;For me, putting it on first thing, when my lips are dry and have nothing on them, letting them dry completely after application, and then following up with gloss gives me the best result. If I want serious drama, I just put on layer after layer.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a verified buyer as I&#x27;d only bought the product directly from the company in the past. I&#x27;m grateful it&#x27;ll be so easy to get it again when I run out!</li>
            <li> This item was shipped quickly and even contained a matching lip pencil for FREE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is beautiful, but a little bright for my complexion. Maybe after I get tan it will look better.  I would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Good product and nice color.  Nothing stays on forever, but this is a pretty good lip stain and it came with a free high end product to also try.  Great seller.</li>
            <li> No matter what I do, the color goes on beautiful but does NOT last.</li>
            <li> I think this lip stain stays on longer than most and is a pretty color.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.  It is really nice to put it on, let it dry well and then add glass, lipstick or plumper too.  I give it a thumbs up and a nd think the price was worth it!</li>
            <li> This lipstain was certainly number 1 in one category.Most expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money, it&#x27;s only good for an hour or two at the most.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for an awesome lip stain for years. This is a true stain as it dries on your lips and does not come off for hours (at least 6 hours) and thats with eating and drinking. This is a blood red color and you can make it darker by applying two coats. If you want a lighter red then apply to the bottom lip and press lips together, then use a lip brush to spread. Then wait 10 minutes before you do anything else.(this 10 minute rule is the key to a long lasting lip. don&#x27;t eat, drink, or apply gloss or balm for 10 minutes) After 10 minutes apply a clear gloss on top and you&#x27;re good for the day. I wish they made more colors. Also, don&#x27;t let the $20 price scare you, you do get a lot of product and because it&#x27;s a gel it doesn&#x27;t dry out like those $8 magic marker types.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product. I bought a set of five morpho products from Amazon and this was included. Of the five products this is what I was most excited about. I hate it :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It is crazy dark. Absolutely nothing like the picture they have of it on their light model. I&#x27;ve tried it out of the tube as well as with a lip brush... Just dotting and covering my entire lip.&lt;br /&gt;-If your lips are even 1% dry, it will adhere more to that area becoming even darker&lt;br /&gt;-It does not fade evenly, all the little lines in your lips will be dark while the rest is lighter&lt;br /&gt;-Staying power... once it starts to look bad (about an hour at most) I make it come off, so I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;d do after that :/&lt;br /&gt;-It does dry my lips out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus side?&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t bleed&lt;br /&gt;-Dries quickly on the lips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it dabbing over chap-stick to make it lighter, this made the color shift into lines even worse.... I honestly can&#x27;t find a way to wear this product. I don&#x27;t want to have to wear it with colored lip gloss or any other product that will transfer color. The point of a stain for me is that I can put it on, and I can drink out of my coffee cup, kiss my boyfriend, and eat my sandwich without it getting on anything. If it fades that&#x27;s fine, I just don&#x27;t want it to transfer, so that makes this product worthless for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I will say, is the company is wonderful. The owner was courteous, polite, and quick to respond. They make a lip gloss [[ASIN:B0021J367C Super Staying Lip Gloss - Cho Cho, a red brown - Morpho Cosmetics - long lasting lip gloss]] that I love and recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is quite dark as other reviewers have noted, and that&#x27;s why I bought it! It is a hard to come by absolutely dramatic, bright, beautiful, bold, wow &#x27;em red. It is not so much dark as deeply pigmented and still bright. With practice, you can control the amount of pigment. I&#x27;ve found better staying power when I apply thin layers. I waited a couple of weeks before writing the review to really test the staying power. I give long lectures at work, and it lasts pretty well through 2 hours of talking and water drinking. It can certainly last 8 hrs when not lecturing. It works at least as well as any drugstore brand I&#x27;ve tried and is much less drying. It does not feel like a heavy coat of pantone paint like many others and is not nearly as drying. This feels like it helps, not hurts, my lips. They sent me a lip pencil which is also a gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome..you can build up the color. The color is long lasting. Just make sure the color completely dries before rubbing lips together or applying a balm or chapstick or gloss. It feels minty and I just love it.</li>
            <li> You do not get better than these lip stains and glosses!  I am a lipstick gloss junkie and will only wear the long&lt;br /&gt; lasting varieties!  Many claim but rarely ever deliver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the Best!  And the owner Janine has personally helped when I purchased the wrong item, she went over and beyond to send me more than expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RATE THE PRODUCT AND COMPANY 10 STARS IF POSSIBLE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long-lasting lip stain for a long time, &amp; I believe this is perfect.  You can adjust the intensity of the color so it goes from a bright clear almost-pink to a deep red.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Color is way, way darker than it appears and it does not last.  Would never order again.  Oh, tossed the item after trying it once as new I would not want to wear it again.</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this stain, I&#x27;m soooooo glad i found it!!!</li>
            <li> In all my years supporting the e-economy with my steady stream of Amazon purchases I have never written a review before. This is because in the sea of delivered-to-my-door scarves, toasters, toothbrushes and office supplies I have found much convenience but little that is so novel and  life impacting to deserve public comment..until today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lip stain is a game changer. I have been using the product for about a week and have already ordered 2 other colors and done a lipstick drawer clean-out that has me seeing the wood on the bottom of the drawer for the first time in years. So without further raving here are the details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Color: I am guessing this is one of those products that looks quite different on different peeps, so do take this with a grain of salt. On me the color is quite red, almost vampy purplish red if I put it on thick. The undertones are more brownish than purplish.  Over the day as the color fades it goes to a bit of a wine/burgundy tone. To be perfectly honest, I would prefer a less brown undertone, but since the product really is the best I have found, I figure beggars can&#x27;t be choosers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Staying Power: So this is where Morpho really shines; this stain stays put --for reals. I have been on a long wear lip product binge for a while now. I have tried Vincent Longo, Stainiac, Stila, Aqua Rouge, The YSL stain, Laura Mercier Stain, all MAC products known to womankind, the list goes on. Not one of these comes close to Morpho. Some may stay,but they get blotchy or bleed all over your first cup of coffee (doesn&#x27;t really look professional in that morning meeting). Nothing comes close to this stain. Once it is on it will color your lips but not your cups, your napkins or your loved ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Texture: This is a thickish liquid stain. It is a bit hard to use at first and you may need to figure-out your favorite application tool ( I use a brush). But, its great virtue is it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips like most of the other products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you out there reading this have also been on the long and expensive quest for a lip product you can apply and forget, I would recommend you give this one a try. Good luck!ther products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you out there reading this have also been on the long and expensive quest for a lip product you can apply and forget, I would recommend you give this one a try. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I use a clear lip gloss over for a shiny finish.  Four stars because after a few weeks, lips get very dry and you&#x27;ll need to use lip moisturizer at night to re-hydrate.</li>
            <li> I love the lip pencil that came with this and the stain is not really a stain, but fades as the day goes on, I love that about it! It lasts way longer then other products I have tried! Fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li> Snap Dragon is purple in the application tube and when put on the lips.  If you look at the lower right hand side of lips you will see a purple red color.  That is the color you will receive in the mail. Joehanna</li>
            <li> I love this color. It is vibrant but not gaudy, and seems to look good on everyone. If it&#x27;s too intense, a little blotting immediately after applying will take enough off to tone it down considerably. If you want even more color, it layers well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any stain, you want to be careful when applying it, because if you &amp;#34;color outside the lines&amp;#34; it&#x27;s going to look weird, and isn&#x27;t as easy to correct as a cream lipstick. This might not be one you want to reapply in the bathroom if you have unsteady hands after having a few, ladies ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the lovely color, the other thing I like is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my lips or increase how fast they dry. I have pretty dry lips, and lots of lip color products are immediately awful. While this isn&#x27;t moisturizing, it doesn&#x27;t seem to make the situation any WORSE, which is a big deal for me. And it works well under a balm, which is critical for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I could think to say is that the packaging isn&#x27;t pretty at all. But I don&#x27;t buy lip stain for the tube!</li>
            <li> If you purchase stain for a light wash of color that won&#x27;t come off on anything (such as another person&#x27;s cheek), requiring touching up center of lips after lunch but otherwise wearing only gloss all day, this is NOT for you. (Try Vincent Longo gel stain, NOT lipstain, with the old ingredient list, NOT the one on HSN, and NOT the pearlessence variety which clumps and flakes and does not stain.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you desire beautifully bold color with staying power, this IS for you! You will be shocked by how darkly it goes on in a single coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this, so have experimented endlessly. I hate to penalize a company for making something that works TOO well, but this really ought to be labeled as a lipstick not a stain because is is HIGHLY transferrable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve been doing is: applying, then when dry a few minutes later, licking lips CAREFULLY (which stains my tongue terribly) to moisten, then completely wiping off all the lipstick with a tissue so that there is a STAIN left over. If I put gloss directly on top without thoroughly stripping all product off, it transfers to everything. Dispose of tissue carefully!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the bottle appearance and applicator are nice, the neck gets sufficient leakage that it allows minuscule drops to fly out with the action of opening the top, causing irreparable staining to two garments. I eliminated that issue by resorting to opening it with tissue (that I&#x27;m about to use to remove all of the product since I wanted a stain) around the neck as I open it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!  Not dry, gorgeous color and lasts Forever!!!!!!!!!  Will buy in more colors.  LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great color. Disappointed on the durability. If it lasted a couple of hours, that was a lot. I liked the initial appearance.</li>
