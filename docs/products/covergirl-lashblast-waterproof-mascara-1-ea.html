            <li>This one performs excellently as a replacement for Lancome&#x27;s Hypnose Drama waterproof with just 2 coats, and it&#x27;s still very good even with only one coat.</li>

            <li>Absolutely love this mascara!</li>
            <li>Love this mascara!</li>
            <li>It is amazing how great it works for being so cheap.</li>
            <li>It picks up the mascara in the tube without pumping and goes on my lashes nicely without clumping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have tried my fair share of mascaras and this is by far the best I have come by.  </li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve found so far, though!!!</li>
            <li>Never disappointed with CoverGirl mascara  good price good quality mascara.</li>
            <li>This is the best and if you curl your straight lashes this will keep them curled, which is often NOT the case with about 95% of most mascaras no matter what they claim.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara as it is waterproof, doesn&#x27;t clump during application, and does a great job lengthening and filling my eyelashes for a nice effect.</li>
            <li>It is waterproof which is great, but I did have problems removing it thoroughly at first.</li>
            <li>LashBlast Mascara proves that cheap can be good too, well, it is more than good, it is perfect, actually!</li>
            <li>I love that this mascara is waterproof.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>even more so it appears I&#x27;m not even wearing mascara.</li>
            <li>The Fusion worked way better for me.</li>
            <li>I Love it...</li>
            <li>I really love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love this product been using it since it came out .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more blunt and gives volume and doesn&#x27;t create chunks or the &amp;#34;spider lash&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>This is and has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li>Both regular and waterproof mascaras are wonderful and do not irritate eyes.</li>
            <li>I just LOVE this one.  </li>
            <li>I just LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>My lashes look darker, longer and have more volume</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara, but I still feel there are things that could be improved.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the formula of this mascara though.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I wont change any more.</li>
            <li>Waterproof makes sure that the mascara isn&#x27;t rubbed off by sweat or humidity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for 5+ years and love how waterproof it is.</li>
            <li>It is waterproof, for sure.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite mascara for awhile.</li>
            <li>The pic is just a light application and after all day wear!</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ts ok for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many waterproof mascaras, but none of them worked as well as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>one of my favorite mascaras everrr</li>
            <li>I tested this in hot Florida weather, Rainy weather, Swimming, Showers, and even Sleeping in it to see how it looks in the morning!!!</li>
            <li>Even when applying it goes on pretty good but doesn&#x27;t do a thing to lengthen.</li>
            <li>so they look so great, so natural</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t fit the top of the bottle</li>
            <li>I love the product, but I do not like the clean up.</li>
            <li>Works better than most affordable mascaras that I have tried, so worth getting.</li>
            <li>It lengthens and volumizes very nicely, with only the teensiest bit of clumping which is easy to comb out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic mascara for the price.</li>
            <li>and I STILL woke up with light \\&quot;raccoon</li>
            <li>It goes on clump free and lasts throughout the day</li>
            <li>To be fair, I ADORE the non-waterproof version of this mascara, and that one actually holds up okay in water.  </li>
            <li>Good enough for a day at the beach, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Dries up in the bottle pretty quick and leaves eyelash flakey but for a while makes you look nice</li>
            <li>Originally I put this on and it works.</li>
            <li>I was better off without wearing mascara in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Better in the swimming pool but who wants two waterproof mascaras for the beach and pool!</li>
            <li>Nice, clean, professional!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara as much as Dior...</li>
            <li>I have good lashes but this mascara is aweful, a total waist.</li>
            <li>maybe something that makes mine twice as thick AND lengthens, doesn&#x27;t clump ANY, doesn&#x27;t flake and is just perfect.  </li>
            <li>I have used the regular LashBlast in the orange tube and it was quite good.</li>
            <li>Although it takes a little more time and finessing to get it right, my lashes always look great.</li>
            <li>This waterproof version is much better than the regular because it gives my lashes even more length and stays all day.  </li>
            <li>this gets the job done for me and brings my lashes out better than any mascara I&#x27;ve used before that includes the high end brands as well.</li>
            <li>One of my new favorite covergirl mascaras.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof, so I can&#x27;t complain too much, but it doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as the Maybelline waterproof.</li>
            <li>It never fails to be my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; mascara!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I was glad when I seen it for less then all my locals stores plus a promotion coupon on top .</li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena eye make-up remover (cheap, but gentle and very effective).&lt;br /&gt;Covergirl</li>
            <li>While most of the mascaras I&#x27;ve used will stay fresh and last several months, this one started to deposit drier, more stubborn and difficult-to-remove clumps on my lashes within just 5 or 6 weeks of my opening the tube.</li>
            <li>No solution or rubbing could dislodge the large clumps and I ended up trashing a month&#x27;s worth of lenses.</li>
            <li>I am Asian and mascara can be challenging.  </li>
            <li>I swear it never fails.</li>
            <li>I saw it with the first stroke when applying it.  </li>
            <li>If there are others better for a similar price, I would like to know about them.  </li>
            <li>It flakes a bit on me when it first dries, but just I just use my makeup brush to get it off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll be buying unless something better comes along....</li>
            <li>Having said that, this is the first waterproof variety I have tried.</li>
            <li>I may try using disposable wands with this in the future to see if I get a better result.</li>
            <li>I always find myself coming back to it, and I make sure to keep this one in my bag at all times.</li>
            <li>I am embarrassed to tell you how many different mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I saw this one and thought the brush looked different and interesting and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>Take a finger tip&#x27;s worth and spend about 30 seconds or so gently rubbing it over your eyelid and lashes.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while to apply it, but I still really reccomend it to anyone who wants a bold lash look.</li>
            <li>With a good eye makeup remover that&#x27;s not a problem anymore though.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried more expensive mascaras because I feel like they should be better, but every time I stray I always come back to this!</li>
            <li>When I first ordered the product, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much to come from it.</li>
            <li>Easy to take off with the proper make up remover.</li>
            <li>The mascara flakes off the ridiculously large brush applicator and lands on contacts, where it refuses to come off.</li>
            <li>I switched from Clinique and other higher end brands but this is much better and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not worried about makeup while swimming, but it&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t run down my face if I decide to do that without taking makeup off!  </li>
            <li>This one looks fine once I comb through my lashes but not amazing or super special.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump at all and really extends my lashes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;#1 - The amount of mascara that comes out on the brush is way too much.</li>
            <li>If the opening was tighter to take some off I think it would be much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my eyes have been very irritated since i started using this.</li>
            <li>HOPING AN URGENT ANSWER,  THANKS.    </li>
            <li>I really like the brush.</li>
            <li>The mascara dies up too much.</li>
            <li>The upside of this, that cannot be said of Lancôme or Dior, is that it&#x27;s very inexpensive, so</li>
            <li>I will wear this mascara when I am going to the beach, lake, pool or in very humid situations</li>
            <li>The wand is very tricky.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it that much.</li>
            <li>Given the price of it, I didn&#x27;t think it would do much.</li>
            <li>I had used Lancome Definicils  but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much for mascara again.  </li>
            <li>Goes on well and very easy-to-use container.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>I have to repurchase this mascara much more often than other types.</li>
            <li>even if you have to buy a fresh tube more often than usual, you&#x27;ll still get 4 LashBlast mascaras for the the price of one designer/department store mascara.</li>
            <li>Everything is great about this minus the little clumps.</li>
            <li>It stays on longer and lengthens more than even more expensive mascaras that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>No matter how high end</li>
            <li>It stays on for all day and make my lashes look full and long.</li>
            <li>Follow that with a normal lathering fashwash to remove any remaining oily residue.  </li>
            <li>Makes my lashes nice and thick</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to remove if you use baby oil as a make up remover.</li>
            <li>Then wipe clean with a wet washcloth or a cotton pad.  </li>
            <li>, in my experience it starts to dry out rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I have recently discovered this inexpensive mascara after trying many other brands.</li>
            <li>Second time buying this exact item.</li>
            <li>It is a little bit hard to remove, but as long as you have a good eye remover, it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>However, after wearing it a few times, I&#x27;ve lost twice the amount of eyelashes way too easily.</li>
            <li>This mascara looks exactly like the regular version as far as the tube and brush.</li>
            <li>To be clear-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soft.</li>
            <li>I have never seen a mascara so soft.</li>
            <li>and I have to comb them through to get natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other mascaras to see if they would be better, but I always end up coming back to this specific brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product also seems to dry out faster than other mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past, and I wonder if there is less product in the tube, or if the larger wand lets more air into it, so it just dries out more quickly.</li>
            <li>Not thick enough.</li>
            <li>I also struggle to keep my lashes as full and healthy as possible, since they are relatively weak and fragile compared to average, and this mascara has absolutely destroyed all the care I&#x27;ve put into them for MONTHS.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous mascaras from high end mascaras from Sephora to a lot of the basic mascaras found in drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because it wants to give me unilashes and is a bit too wet for my liking.</li>
            <li>I usually prefer a brown/black, but this will work very well!!</li>
            <li>Keep rubbing gently until the cream turns dark gray.</li>
            <li>It works so well that I even got asked a few times if they were my real lashes!</li>
            <li>The other day I walked into a Sephora store and the sales agent asked me what kind of false eyelashes</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I tested this in hot Florida weather, Rainy weather, Swimming, Showers, and even Sleeping in it to see how it looks in the morning!!!</li>
            <li> Even when applying it goes on pretty good but doesn&#x27;t do a thing to lengthen.</li>
            <li> so they look so great, so natural</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t fit the top of the bottle</li>
            <li> I love the product, but I do not like the clean up.</li>
            <li> Works better than most affordable mascaras that I have tried, so worth getting.</li>
            <li> It lengthens and volumizes very nicely, with only the teensiest bit of clumping which is easy to comb out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic mascara for the price.</li>
            <li> and I STILL woke up with light \\&quot;raccoon</li>
            <li> It goes on clump free and lasts throughout the day</li>
            <li> To be fair, I ADORE the non-waterproof version of this mascara, and that one actually holds up okay in water.  </li>
            <li> Good enough for a day at the beach, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Dries up in the bottle pretty quick and leaves eyelash flakey but for a while makes you look nice</li>
            <li> Originally I put this on and it works.</li>
            <li> I was better off without wearing mascara in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Better in the swimming pool but who wants two waterproof mascaras for the beach and pool!</li>
            <li> Nice, clean, professional!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara as much as Dior...</li>
            <li> I have good lashes but this mascara is aweful, a total waist.</li>
            <li> maybe something that makes mine twice as thick AND lengthens, doesn&#x27;t clump ANY, doesn&#x27;t flake and is just perfect.  </li>
            <li> I have used the regular LashBlast in the orange tube and it was quite good.</li>
            <li> Although it takes a little more time and finessing to get it right, my lashes always look great.</li>
            <li> This waterproof version is much better than the regular because it gives my lashes even more length and stays all day.  </li>
            <li> this gets the job done for me and brings my lashes out better than any mascara I&#x27;ve used before that includes the high end brands as well.</li>
            <li> One of my new favorite covergirl mascaras.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof, so I can&#x27;t complain too much, but it doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as the Maybelline waterproof.</li>
            <li> It never fails to be my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; mascara!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I was glad when I seen it for less then all my locals stores plus a promotion coupon on top .</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena eye make-up remover (cheap, but gentle and very effective).&lt;br /&gt;Covergirl</li>
            <li> While most of the mascaras I&#x27;ve used will stay fresh and last several months, this one started to deposit drier, more stubborn and difficult-to-remove clumps on my lashes within just 5 or 6 weeks of my opening the tube.</li>
            <li> No solution or rubbing could dislodge the large clumps and I ended up trashing a month&#x27;s worth of lenses.</li>
            <li> I am Asian and mascara can be challenging.  </li>
            <li> I swear it never fails.</li>
            <li> I saw it with the first stroke when applying it.  </li>
            <li> If there are others better for a similar price, I would like to know about them.  </li>
            <li> It flakes a bit on me when it first dries, but just I just use my makeup brush to get it off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll be buying unless something better comes along....</li>
            <li> Having said that, this is the first waterproof variety I have tried.</li>
            <li> I may try using disposable wands with this in the future to see if I get a better result.</li>
            <li> I always find myself coming back to it, and I make sure to keep this one in my bag at all times.</li>
            <li> I am embarrassed to tell you how many different mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I saw this one and thought the brush looked different and interesting and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> Take a finger tip&#x27;s worth and spend about 30 seconds or so gently rubbing it over your eyelid and lashes.  </li>
            <li> It takes a while to apply it, but I still really reccomend it to anyone who wants a bold lash look.</li>
            <li> With a good eye makeup remover that&#x27;s not a problem anymore though.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried more expensive mascaras because I feel like they should be better, but every time I stray I always come back to this!</li>
            <li> When I first ordered the product, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much to come from it.</li>
            <li> Easy to take off with the proper make up remover.</li>
            <li> The mascara flakes off the ridiculously large brush applicator and lands on contacts, where it refuses to come off.</li>
            <li> I switched from Clinique and other higher end brands but this is much better and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not worried about makeup while swimming, but it&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t run down my face if I decide to do that without taking makeup off!  </li>
            <li> This one looks fine once I comb through my lashes but not amazing or super special.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump at all and really extends my lashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;#1 - The amount of mascara that comes out on the brush is way too much.</li>
            <li> If the opening was tighter to take some off I think it would be much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my eyes have been very irritated since i started using this.</li>
            <li> HOPING AN URGENT ANSWER,  THANKS.    </li>
            <li> I really like the brush.</li>
            <li> The mascara dies up too much.</li>
            <li> The upside of this, that cannot be said of Lancôme or Dior, is that it&#x27;s very inexpensive, so</li>
            <li> I will wear this mascara when I am going to the beach, lake, pool or in very humid situations</li>
            <li> The wand is very tricky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it that much.</li>
            <li> Given the price of it, I didn&#x27;t think it would do much.</li>
            <li> I had used Lancome Definicils  but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much for mascara again.  </li>
            <li> Goes on well and very easy-to-use container.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> I have to repurchase this mascara much more often than other types.</li>
            <li> even if you have to buy a fresh tube more often than usual, you&#x27;ll still get 4 LashBlast mascaras for the the price of one designer/department store mascara.</li>
            <li> Everything is great about this minus the little clumps.</li>
            <li> It stays on longer and lengthens more than even more expensive mascaras that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> No matter how high end</li>
            <li> It stays on for all day and make my lashes look full and long.</li>
            <li> Follow that with a normal lathering fashwash to remove any remaining oily residue.  </li>
            <li> Makes my lashes nice and thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to remove if you use baby oil as a make up remover.</li>
            <li> Then wipe clean with a wet washcloth or a cotton pad.  </li>
            <li> , in my experience it starts to dry out rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I have recently discovered this inexpensive mascara after trying many other brands.</li>
            <li> Second time buying this exact item.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit hard to remove, but as long as you have a good eye remover, it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> However, after wearing it a few times, I&#x27;ve lost twice the amount of eyelashes way too easily.</li>
            <li> This mascara looks exactly like the regular version as far as the tube and brush.</li>
            <li> To be clear-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soft.</li>
            <li> I have never seen a mascara so soft.</li>
            <li> and I have to comb them through to get natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other mascaras to see if they would be better, but I always end up coming back to this specific brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product also seems to dry out faster than other mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past, and I wonder if there is less product in the tube, or if the larger wand lets more air into it, so it just dries out more quickly.</li>
            <li> Not thick enough.</li>
            <li> I also struggle to keep my lashes as full and healthy as possible, since they are relatively weak and fragile compared to average, and this mascara has absolutely destroyed all the care I&#x27;ve put into them for MONTHS.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous mascaras from high end mascaras from Sephora to a lot of the basic mascaras found in drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because it wants to give me unilashes and is a bit too wet for my liking.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer a brown/black, but this will work very well!!</li>
            <li> Keep rubbing gently until the cream turns dark gray.</li>
            <li> It works so well that I even got asked a few times if they were my real lashes!</li>
            <li> The other day I walked into a Sephora store and the sales agent asked me what kind of false eyelashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put up a hard fight, but theres still quite a bit of mascara glued onto my lashes right now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive it&#x27;s from this mascara which sucks because I like that</li>
            <li> It puts so much on that my eyelashes stuck together no matter how hard I try to put it on evenly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> give super black thick and long lashes.</li>
            <li> And it stays put all day long.  </li>
            <li> The waterproof version lasts so long.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well this mascara separated my lashes, did not clump or flake and did not feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if they got a new brush or</li>
            <li> so the product would dry out.  </li>
            <li> Just a little extra flip of the hand and specks of mascara go flying around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I actually have trouble getting it off, even with my almay waterproof eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day, not really water-proof.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would end up with all the other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried over the years that claimed it lengthened.  </li>
            <li> what but my recent order of cover girl mascara is messy!</li>
            <li> Repeat on the other eye.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like it and its brush...</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have to worry about mascara dripping down my face if I get wet.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s very wet and does touch your lash line.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to loose a few lashes in the process.  </li>
            <li> It is VERYVERYVERY waterproof; I had a hard time removing even with my standard waterproof eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NOT worth it to put your eyes through this.  </li>
            <li> Package was a but dirty and bent but the actual mascara was normal.</li>
            <li> -- this is a crucial \\&quot;but\\&quot; for some people -- because it&#x27;s a fairly thick formula</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m stuck between a rock and a hard place of not using it anymore but being left with way less eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I use the other Covergirl Clumpblast in green bottle nonwaterproof as a primer and for my bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li> After a few seconds, you will see the cream begin to darken as it removes the mascara (and any other makeup).</li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning with black under my eyes and flakes STILL all around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive eyes and VERY thin, delicate skin around them, so this was the LAST thing I needed.  </li>
            <li> It stays on all day, but is difficult to remove in normal bathing.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to use a little Vaseline to get it off</li>
            <li> Not worth the hype!</li>
            <li> Use Cold Cream (Ponds or generic - both work equally well).  </li>
            <li> to name a few.  </li>
            <li> it will take your lashes with it and leave a few micro tears in your eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I think I have lost some eyelashes just in a few times using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cant even take this stuff off with makeup remover without tugging at my eyelashes and   shedding a few tears.  </li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s my everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> The only dramatic things this mascara does is stick my eyelashes together.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the money in the expensive stuff, it&#x27;s not better.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love that this mascara is waterproof.  It doesn&#x27;t clump at all and really extends my lashes.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great mascara, no clumps, stays on all day without smearing or running.</li>
            <li> Favourite mascara ever! give super black thick and long lashes.</li>
            <li> I am Asian and mascara can be challenging.  I love this mascara as much as Dior...Benefits...Chanel...to name a few.  My lashes hold the xurl all day without smudging.  I use the other Covergirl Clumpblast in green bottle nonwaterproof as a primer and for my bottom lashes.  I will say I hate that the wand is so fat and big but my lashes always look beautiful. When saleswomen from Sephora and Department Stores ask what I use for my lashes...nothing else needs to be said.</li>
            <li> Originally I put this on and it works. But it&#x27;s very wet and does touch your lash line. I have issues losing my eyelashes so having the mascara cover up the bald spots helps. However, after wearing it a few times, I&#x27;ve lost twice the amount of eyelashes way too easily. I&#x27;m positive it&#x27;s from this mascara which sucks because I like that it covers up where they do fall out. Now I&#x27;m stuck between a rock and a hard place of not using it anymore but being left with way less eyelashes. Looks horrible.</li>
            <li> This mascara will NOT come off.  I thought \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; meant just that... it would hold up against WATER and maybe soap as well... but I thought it would yield to makeup remover.  For the past 1/2 hour I&#x27;ve SCRUBBED the delicate skin around my eyes absolutely RAW.  I tried make up remover, oils, lotions, soap and water, even tried peeling it off!!  NOTHING will remove it- it will take your lashes with it and leave a few micro tears in your eyelids.  I&#x27;ve put up a hard fight, but theres still quite a bit of mascara glued onto my lashes right now.  I have VERY sensitive eyes and VERY thin, delicate skin around them, so this was the LAST thing I needed.  I also struggle to keep my lashes as full and healthy as possible, since they are relatively weak and fragile compared to average, and this mascara has absolutely destroyed all the care I&#x27;ve put into them for MONTHS.  To be clear- I applied 2 coats.  To be fair, I ADORE the non-waterproof version of this mascara, and that one actually holds up okay in water.  Absolutely NOT worth it to put your eyes through this.  Biggest mistake in my 15 years wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> I Hate it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 - The amount of mascara that comes out on the brush is way too much. If the opening was tighter to take some off I think it would be much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2- It puts so much on that my eyelashes stuck together no matter how hard I try to put it on evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3- I have always preferred/used waterproof mascara but this stuff is insane! I can&#x27;t get it off for anything. I use makeup remover and wash my face/eyes with a washcloth and face wash and it still won&#x27;t come off. I think I have lost some eyelashes just in a few times using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4- After wearing for awhile it flakes and am constantly getting mascara flakes in my eyes, which makes me rub my eyes and my eyes have been very irritated since i started using this. I wake up in the morning with black under my eyes and flakes STILL all around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use this mascara but haven&#x27;t for awhile. I definitely won&#x27;t be using this anymore!</li>
            <li> TO WHO CORRESPOND  I´VE BOUGHT MY COVER GIRL LASH BLAST WATERPROOF MASCARA - VERY BLACK AND THE DEBIT ON MY CREDIT CARD HAVE BEEN ALLREADY SUCCESFULLY PASSED. SINCE I´VE BOUGHT IT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ANY ANSWER OR NOTICE FROM MY MIAMI MAIL BOX OR FROM YOU BECAUSE THE PRODUCT DOES NOT ARRIVE YET. PLEASE GIVE ME ANY GUIDE NUMBER SO I CAN SEARCH FOR MY PRODUCT,  HOPING AN URGENT ANSWER,  THANKS.    RUBI DONOSO</li>
            <li> I have good lashes but this mascara is aweful, a total waist.It&#x27;s too soft. Even when applying it goes on pretty good but doesn&#x27;t do a thing to lengthen. The softness causes the lashes to shrink away even more so it appears I&#x27;m not even wearing mascara. I have never seen a mascara so soft. Not thick enough.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic mascara for the price. I really like the brush. It picks up the mascara in the tube without pumping and goes on my lashes nicely without clumping.&lt;br /&gt;It has all day staying power without flaking. It is waterproof which is great, but I did have problems removing it thoroughly at first. With a good eye makeup remover that&#x27;s not a problem anymore though.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried more expensive mascaras because I feel like they should be better, but every time I stray I always come back to this!</li>
            <li> I Hate it.  A. The mascara brush bristles are too short.  B. The mascara dies up too much. It literally sticks to your lashes like teeth and gums.   C. CLUMPY !!! The only dramatic things this mascara does is stick my eyelashes together. I was better off without wearing mascara in the first place.  D. I know its supposed to be waterproof but they went a little overboard. I cant even take this stuff off with makeup remover without tugging at my eyelashes and   shedding a few tears.  Be prepared to loose a few lashes in the process.  E.After wearing for about 5 or 6 hours, it begins to flake. I swear it never fails. I always end up with mascara flakes in my eye and having to pick them out. Then I have to walk around with bloodshot eyes or find some visine.  Just don&#x27;t buy it. Unless your trying to go blind and have no eyelashes, I would not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of this mascara. It clumped a ton and is nearly impossible to get off. The Fusion worked way better for me.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT WATER PROOF</li>
            <li> This is truly a WATERPROOF Mascara!!! I Love it...I tested this in hot Florida weather, Rainy weather, Swimming, Showers, and even Sleeping in it to see how it looks in the morning!!! Perfect coverage, no clumping, my lashes look longer and very FULL!!! My best MASCARA EVER!!!! (Tested Products-Honest Reviews)</li>
            <li> Especially in the heat, waterproof mascara stays in place!</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara. I have eyes that tend to water with allergies, so I need a mascara to just stay put and not wash away. I have that in this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product been using it since it came out . Being a college student you can&#x27;t always afford a 20$ mascara this gets the job done for me and brings my lashes out better than any mascara I&#x27;ve used before that includes the high end brands as well. I was glad when I seen it for less then all my locals stores plus a promotion coupon on top .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying for some time to find a drugstore mascara to replace the $30 Lancôme and Dior mascaras I was so fond of but that are now so ridiculously over-priced I can no longer justify the expense. This one performs excellently as a replacement for Lancome&#x27;s Hypnose Drama waterproof with just 2 coats, and it&#x27;s still very good even with only one coat. It lengthens and volumizes very nicely, with only the teensiest bit of clumping which is easy to comb out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT -- this is a crucial \\&quot;but\\&quot; for some people -- because it&#x27;s a fairly thick formula, in my experience it starts to dry out rather quickly. While most of the mascaras I&#x27;ve used will stay fresh and last several months, this one started to deposit drier, more stubborn and difficult-to-remove clumps on my lashes within just 5 or 6 weeks of my opening the tube. (Just as an FYI, I go makeup-free about 2 or 3 days/week.) The upside of this, that cannot be said of Lancôme or Dior, is that it&#x27;s very inexpensive, so even if you have to buy a fresh tube more often than usual, you&#x27;ll still get 4 LashBlast mascaras for the the price of one designer/department store mascara. It is VERYVERYVERY waterproof; I had a hard time removing even with my standard waterproof eye makeup remover. I ended up having to use a little Vaseline to get it off and I STILL woke up with light \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot; the next morning. So you can cry AND get caught in a rain storm with no worries.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to mascara for a number of years.  I always purchase the waterproof.  I&#x27;ve tried other mascaras to see if they would be better, but I always end up coming back to this specific brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waterproof quality is second to none.  It does not run.  If I end up going swimming after work, it stays in place.  I&#x27;m not worried about makeup while swimming, but it&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t run down my face if I decide to do that without taking makeup off!  This helps with my seasonal allergies too, when my eyes water.  I don&#x27;t have makeup everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t flake!  I like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about flaking.  And it stays put all day long.  I can go from work to a night out with no need to reapply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the brush.  It&#x27;s more blunt and gives volume and doesn&#x27;t create chunks or the &amp;#34;spider lash&amp;#34; look.  Nice, clean, professional!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Does not smudge at all!</li>
            <li> Good quality and great price!!!!</li>
            <li> Dries up in the bottle pretty quick and leaves eyelash flakey but for a while makes you look nice</li>
            <li> I use big name department store cosmetics....except for mascara- This is and has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last weekend, and in the space of 6 days, it ruined three pairs of my contact lenses. The mascara flakes off the ridiculously large brush applicator and lands on contacts, where it refuses to come off. No solution or rubbing could dislodge the large clumps and I ended up trashing a month&#x27;s worth of lenses. I am contacting CoverGirl to demand a refund. I would not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have recently discovered this inexpensive mascara after trying many other brands. It is amazing how great it works for being so cheap. It gives lashes incredible length and volume, without clumps or smudes. Both regular and waterproof mascaras are wonderful and do not irritate eyes. Oh, by the way, I do not find any difficulty removing it, even the waterproof version. I use Neutrogena eye make-up remover (cheap, but gentle and very effective).&lt;br /&gt;Covergirl LashBlast Mascara proves that cheap can be good too, well, it is more than good, it is perfect, actually!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  I just LOVE this one.  I thought it would end up with all the other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried over the years that claimed it lengthened.  This one actually DOES.  I saw it with the first stroke when applying it.  If you do want longer eyelashes....and what woman doesn&#x27;t....this is the one to get.  If there are others better for a similar price, I would like to know about them.  Sometimes a couple of lashes might stick together, but I don&#x27;t know of any mascara that can keep this from happening....but it&#x27;s worth it.  I just use my TweezerMan metal eyelash comb and that takes care of that.  It flakes a bit on me when it first dries, but just I just use my makeup brush to get it off.  But I do have longer lashes with this AND it curls them too.  I just LOVE this stuff.  It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll be buying unless something better comes along....maybe something that makes mine twice as thick AND lengthens, doesn&#x27;t clump ANY, doesn&#x27;t flake and is just perfect.  But I won&#x27;t hold my breath for that.  This is as good as it gets for now I think....love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and love it. It never fails to be my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; mascara!</li>
            <li> I like CoverGirl&#x27;s &amp;#34;Blast&amp;#34; series of mascara. Having said that, this is the first waterproof variety I have tried. I have used the regular LashBlast in the orange tube and it was quite good. This mascara looks exactly like the regular version as far as the tube and brush. It is a bit watery though and makes my lashes stick together. I have to use a lash comb to separate my lashes and fan them out after I apply this mascara. But once it dries, it IS waterproof. I swam in it, was in the rain with it on, and even showered with it on and it didn&#x27;t run or drip. It removes well with oil based eye makeup remover. My lashes look darker, longer and have more volume but I really hate that they get all stuck together and I have to comb them through to get natural looking lashes. I will wear this mascara when I am going to the beach, lake, pool or in very humid situations but I prefer non-waterproof mascara for daily use. This one looks fine once I comb through my lashes but not amazing or super special. Good enough for a day at the beach, that&#x27;s for sure. And I don&#x27;t have to worry about mascara dripping down my face if I get wet. I gave it three stars because it wants to give me unilashes and is a bit too wet for my liking. It performs well otherwise.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara, but I still feel there are things that could be improved. The wand is very tricky. Mascara always smudges onto the eyelid during application (can be corrected by having a cotton swab handy), and it feels kinda big and awkward to use. I LOVE the formula of this mascara though. Although it takes a little more time and finessing to get it right, my lashes always look great. This product also seems to dry out faster than other mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past, and I wonder if there is less product in the tube, or if the larger wand lets more air into it, so it just dries out more quickly. I have to repurchase this mascara much more often than other types. I may try using disposable wands with this in the future to see if I get a better result. Best I&#x27;ve found so far, though!!!</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I always find myself coming back to it, and I make sure to keep this one in my bag at all times. The waterproof version lasts so long.</li>
            <li> I have tried my fair share of mascaras and this is by far the best I have come by.  It stays on longer and lengthens more than even more expensive mascaras that I have tried.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day, but is difficult to remove in normal bathing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous mascaras from high end mascaras from Sephora to a lot of the basic mascaras found in drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CoverGirl LashBlast is always my go-to and the only one in my makeup bag now. I always get the waterproof one because it doesn&#x27;t melt or smudge in this summer time heat. It goes on clump free and lasts throughout the day so I never have to reapply. It&#x27;s not hard to remove if you use baby oil as a make up remover. I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this mascara creates volume, however it gives good coverage and doesn&#x27;t flake throughout the day. Objectives met - check.</li>
            <li> I receive the Cover Girl Lash Blast as a gift one year ago... and let me tell u I wont change any more. This mascara is just great and i have suggest my friends to change and they are just amazed as me with Lash Blast mascara... It covers everything, it makes your lashes look miles away, dosent get u the patch-lashes look so they look so great, so natural and i just love it!</li>
            <li> It has been 20 days since I placed my order &amp; I still have not received it yet. I am very disappointed with this dealer.</li>
            <li> This is the brand I use for beautiful lashes and to cover the gray hair along my edges!! Waterproof makes sure that the mascara isn&#x27;t rubbed off by sweat or humidity.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! I was even able to go swimming for a couple hours in our pool and it didn&#x27;t smear a bit and still looked great after! It is a little bit hard to remove, but as long as you have a good eye remover, it&#x27;s easy. Makes my eyelashes look awesome and I think this will be my go to mascara anytime I think I need waterproof.</li>
            <li> Very nice item, waterproof whit great quality, if you want some very nice and cute lashes buy this covergirl mascara</li>
            <li> This has always been one of my very favorite mascaras. No matter how high end i go, I always go back to this.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered the product, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much to come from it. Now, it&#x27;s my everyday mascara. It works so well that I even got asked a few times if they were my real lashes! It takes a while to apply it, but I still really reccomend it to anyone who wants a bold lash look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for 5+ years and love how waterproof it is. It stays on for all day and make my lashes look full and long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best mascara which I swear for and always keep buying for many years.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well in salt water - comes off in tiny bits that are left all over the face. Better in the swimming pool but who wants two waterproof mascaras for the beach and pool!</li>
            <li> Best mascara i have ever used!!! :)</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!!! It does not clump.  It is waterproof, for sure. I actually have trouble getting it off, even with my almay waterproof eye makeup remover. I tend to use this mascara as a base and I layer another one over this for added volume.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite mascara for awhile. This waterproof version is much better than the regular because it gives my lashes even more length and stays all day.  I can get the look of those &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; mascaras. I have had people think I wear fake eyelashes! Great stuff.  The pic is just a light application and after all day wear!</li>
            <li> Everything is great about this minus the little clumps. Second time buying this exact item.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but the brush is horrible.  It has very short, almost non-existent brush bristles so you can&#x27;t separate your lashes.  It goes on as a blob and then I have to separate with a pin (which is not safe, I know - but I have to do it somehow).  I tried a different brush but it doesn&#x27;t fit the top of the bottle so the product would dry out.  I won&#x27;t buy this mascara again because of the brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it that much. Not worth the hype!</li>
            <li> The mascara did not hold up to the rain. Also, it flaked way too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was a disappointment as a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I switched from Clinique and other higher end brands but this is much better and a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect last, length, and coverage!</li>
            <li> This mascara is clumpy and always ends up off my lashes and on the skin under my eyes. Would NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day, not really water-proof.  I&#x27;ve had allergies and it&#x27;s been smudging with my teary eyes.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever. Don&#x27;t waste the money in the expensive stuff, it&#x27;s not better. This is the best and if you curl your straight lashes this will keep them curled, which is often NOT the case with about 95% of most mascaras no matter what they claim.</li>
            <li> I am embarrassed to tell you how many different mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. I saw this one and thought the brush looked different and interesting and thought I would give it a try. Given the price of it, I didn&#x27;t think it would do much. I was totally blown away by the instant volume it created. The other day I walked into a Sephora store and the sales agent asked me what kind of false eyelashes I was using. Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ts ok for the price.</li>
            <li> I only use mascara, no eyeliner, and this does the job outlining my eyes by darkening, thickening, lengthening, and helping keep the curl to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if they got a new brush or what but my recent order of cover girl mascara is messy! Just a little extra flip of the hand and specks of mascara go flying around my eyes. I love the product, but I do not like the clean up.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara as it is waterproof, doesn&#x27;t clump during application, and does a great job lengthening and filling my eyelashes for a nice effect.</li>
            <li> Use Cold Cream (Ponds or generic - both work equally well).  Take a finger tip&#x27;s worth and spend about 30 seconds or so gently rubbing it over your eyelid and lashes.  After a few seconds, you will see the cream begin to darken as it removes the mascara (and any other makeup). Keep rubbing gently until the cream turns dark gray. Then wipe clean with a wet washcloth or a cotton pad.  Repeat on the other eye. Follow that with a normal lathering fashwash to remove any remaining oily residue.  I&#x27;ve been using this method for years - works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many waterproof mascaras, but none of them worked as well as I&#x27;d hoped.  I had used Lancome Definicils  but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much for mascara again.  I was pleasantly surprised how well this mascara separated my lashes, did not clump or flake and did not feel heavy.  I plan to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Goes on well and very easy-to-use container. Good shipping!!! I usually prefer a brown/black, but this will work very well!!</li>
            <li> Never disappointed with CoverGirl mascara  good price good quality mascara.</li>
            <li> Works better than most affordable mascaras that I have tried, so worth getting. Makes my lashes nice and thick so I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Package was a but dirty and bent but the actual mascara was normal.</li>
            <li> One of the best mascara on the market</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof, so I can&#x27;t complain too much, but it doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as the Maybelline waterproof. Other than that, I like it and its brush...no smudging at all.</li>
            <li> One of my new favorite covergirl mascaras. Does not flake and stays on all day. Easy to take off with the proper make up remover. Very low to no clumping if done correctly</li>
            <li> one of my favorite mascaras everrr</li>
