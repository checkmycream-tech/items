            <li>Great smelling shampoo for the guys.</li>
            <li>What can I say this is great shampoo/conditioner.</li>

            <li>It smells GREAT.</li>
            <li>I am happy to recommend this.</li>
            <li>This is a great product from Axe.</li>
            <li>They always have great items for men and they smell great as well.</li>
            <li>Being an Axe product there is an expectation that it will smell great, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice and pleasant, not too strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>What this does: It&#x27;s a good men&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It also represents a good value.</li>
            <li>He felt it did a good job of cleansing and conditioning his hair.</li>
            <li>it has a really good price point, and i think it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with Axe Shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is a great shampoo, check out the 3in1 product that is also a body wash, it is an even better way to simplify your life.</li>
            <li>bottle is kind of art deco space age, but it looks good in our art deco bathroom</li>
            <li>This is my husband and sons&#x27; favorite!  </li>
            <li>It has a very clean and pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>That will always be biased based on the user (personally I kind of like</li>
            <li>I assume it was used and liked.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>These combo products are great because this is the only way they ever use a conditioner, so it&#x27;s a real win.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so used to my husband using my shampoo and having that smell in his hair that this is a nice change to a &#x27;guy&#x27; smell.  </li>
            <li>I also thought it smelled nice.</li>
            <li>but I thought it was an apt</li>
            <li>I liked this well, but their \\&quot;Three in One\\</li>
            <li>Very easy to lather and rinse.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong, like most Axe products, but pleasant --i don&#x27;t know about \\&quot;irresistible\\&quot; though!!  </li>
            <li>Axe 2 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Apollo is a very good product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very cool, kind of aquatic scent.</li>
            <li>The strong cologne-like fragrances that the products are scented with are popular with boys his age</li>
            <li>I love the smell of their products, and this one was no exception.</li>
            <li>It is more of a gel consistency</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this one on my husband.</li>
            <li>My grandsons love Axe products, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better option.</li>
            <li>most shampoos I&#x27;ve used leave a sensation of oil if I don&#x27;t apply it twice</li>
            <li>The men in my life love this brand.  </li>
            <li>I think I will stick with separate shampoos and conditioners since they give me better results.</li>
            <li>This leaves your head feeling great and cleans your hair really well.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I picked up this Axe Apollo 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner combo for my pre-teen son since he likes using most bath and hygiene products by the brand.</li>
            <li>2 in 1 shampoos are my favorite for him, since he&#x27;s able to use use one bottle for everything.</li>
            <li>In many of his interviews, his response to the things that just happened in life was \\&quot;Like my momma</li>
            <li>despite the underlying message being \\&quot;to pick up more girls\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried- i.e. not super great as either a shampoo or a conditioner on their own, but good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picking up, having the Total Fresh item that works well as shampoo/conditioner and is also a good body wash would be ideal.</li>
            <li>ok, smells too strong.</li>
            <li>Turns out these Axe brand 2 in 1 shampoos are more like 3 in 1, since they are so strongly fragranced they also work as a men&#x27;s cologne, since the scent lingers quite a while.</li>
            <li>It has a strong fragrance, but the scent is appealing to me.  </li>
            <li>speaking of fun, I am in love with the push-button cap!  </li>
            <li>Some Axe products a really too strong, so I was very happy with this fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo and worth the price if you can find it as an add-on or special price.  </li>
            <li>It provides a great natural shine to your hair.  </li>
            <li>Works good, smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry ur hair out</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the way it leaves my hair smelling clean and conditioned.</li>
            <li>There should be a law that all shampoo containers be as easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seemed to work much better on his hair than mine, it felt clean, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li>but, it is really strong and lasts quite a while.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice masculine fragrance that he liked.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo gets your hair clean and keeps it soft!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and lathers really well!</li>
            <li>Axe products seem to be pretty popular these days and this 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner won&#x27;t detract from their popularity.  </li>
            <li>fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, nice smell; not overpowering, but it had a fresh, clean scent that my 8 year old loved.  </li>
            <li>So for what it&#x27;s worth, as a woman I really love the smell, but the \\&quot;man&#x27;s\\&quot; perspective was that it smelled too strong.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Axe 2 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Apollo, 12 Ounce, It blends well with my Husbands body chemistry making him smell so good that just like the funny clever commercials it makes me want to rock my astronaut all the time.</li>
            <li>HUGE disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item itself is great, but I had only received ONE bottle whereas I paid for six.</li>
            <li>cheap</li>
            <li>Great for me to take when I travel only have to pack one bottle.</li>
            <li>Is that important?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reminded of the ocean for some reason, no floral scent that I can detect, just a strong, clean</li>
            <li>and it conditioned lightly.  </li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels smooth and creamy and washes out clean leaving my hair feeling just washed for hours.  </li>
            <li>And to top it all off, the price is very reasonable for a brand name.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an AXE product, so leaves a strong, manly smell, which is a benefit unless that&#x27;s not what you want: all in all, a solid product at a good price...</li>
            <li>The Axe shampoo also prevents your hair from becoming oily and greasy while it allows your hair to stay fresh and clean feeling throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This new Apollo fragrance is a nice addition to the line I also like the that this is a 2in1 Shampoo/Conditioner</li>
            <li>It foams well, and leaves my hair clean and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I wanted my husband to have a shampoo that didn&#x27;t smell like an old man, I came across this great Aze product that really stood out.  </li>
            <li>My hair smelled great but after the week trial my scalp was itchy and my hair felt dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; and</li>
            <li>This is a very good 2 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner, It makes my husband&#x27;s hair soft and manageable, I just love to cuddle into his hair when we go to bed and just sniff him all night long....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for 3 weeks or so now, and overall i am very pleased with it and can easily recommend it.</li>
            <li>Both have a mild scent that&#x27;s pleasant enough but nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Cleans my old grey hair sparkling clean, leaves a Delightful aroma</li>
            <li>, really dont think you can find a better one for a guys</li>
            <li>They think this shampoo is cool.</li>
            <li>It does have a cool way of opening.  </li>
            <li>Shinny and full.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t care for 2-in-1 products (I prefer separate shampoo and conditioner), but this is a nice product.</li>
            <li>He also liked that it left his hair feeling clean and conditioned.</li>
            <li>If you like Axe products in general, and are okay with shampoo/conditioner-type hair cleansers, this is also a fine product.</li>
            <li>A new favorite product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell as it is very masculine and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>It rinses easily and the scent, while strong at first, lingers just a bit to keep me smelling fresh and masculine.</li>
            <li>This Ae 2 in 1 shampoo plus conditioner lathers up nicely and washes off easily enough.</li>
            <li>The smell is invigorating and fresh.</li>
            <li>but why not have as much fun in the shower as you</li>
            <li>Completely affordable AXE product, smells MANLY and works great: it&#x27;s a completely affordable price for a shampoo and conditioner combined, and works very well:</li>
            <li>It can be very drying, and strip hair of needed oils, but the boys loved the commercial, so I figured why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would smell as good as every other Axe product</li>
            <li>As far as the bright color goes, this just means more chemical coloring agents on your head, body, and down the drain to the environment.  </li>
            <li>, others leave a dryness sensation, but Axe seems to have the right balance between softness and cleanliness.</li>
            <li>Son loves this everything Axe - gifted it to him - with a few other Axe products, Amazon is competitive with Wal-Mart in price - when purchasing the amount (now $35) to get free S/H - this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>As I said, the ladies love it, well, at least my wife and my daughter, and since those are the most important ladies in my life, that counts for a lot.</li>
            <li>It left my hair smelling fresh and clean as well as easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Just a small amount is needed and it works into a great lather.</li>
            <li>According to the reactions the shampoo/conditioner lathered up very easily,rinsed away clean, and left  hair feeling soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>There is a strong fairly masculine scent, but it is not overpowering like some Axe products.</li>
            <li>and my scalp felt dry and kind of itchy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;THAT being said, I didn&#x27;t find the scent overly masculine or strong, so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li>it is a little cologne-like in smell, but since it is a good smell, I kept it at 5 stars.</li>
            <li>(Blushes)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All kidding aside this really is a great smelling product, at least to me</li>
            <li>It is a hot item.  </li>
            <li>He also felt the smell would be more suited towards the teenage crowd as opposed to the 30s crowd.</li>
            <li>Initially, I thought the smell was ok</li>
            <li>My son (college aged) used this product and he really liked it.</li>
            <li>It is much simpler than the traditional two-step process and the results are phenomenal.</li>
            <li>When I was growing up &#x60;WWW&#x27; stood for World-Wide Wrestling and the most profound statement of my early life was a quote from a wrestler named The Iceman King Parsons.  </li>
            <li>If you like cool, masculine aquatic scents I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
            <li>The smell was too strong for him, but at the same time, it didn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>lathers fine and definitely leaves hair softer than shampoo alone</li>
            <li>$ haha.</li>
            <li>Otherwise much cheaper at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>The scent really lingers on his hair.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a guy, so I don&#x27;t get much feedback on how well it works or what he likes, after all...</li>
            <li>I really like axe products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Instead just showering with this gives him a much lighter dose of cologne scent, not so overpowering.</li>
            <li>As this product is advertised for men, maybe those guys who have shorter hair won&#x27;t really notice.  </li>
            <li>&quot; Shampoo/Conditioner/Body Wash called Total Fresh is a product I am more likely to buy.  </li>
            <li>so it really does condition.  </li>
            <li>I would have enjoyed it more if mine wasn&#x27;t broken when I received it.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this is one of the only hair cleaning products I have seen in years that does not indicate whether it is for people with normal, dry, oily, or whatever type of hair.  </li>
            <li>This is good shampoo/conditioner, and works about the same as other combination products</li>
            <li>If your hair is exceptionally oily, you&#x27;ll need to use this a few times, as the conditioner neutralizes the shampoo action.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers great, and only a small amount is required.</li>
            <li>The blue gel also looks cool.  </li>
            <li>Good sudsing with only a little dab required for a man&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>It allows you to easily comb your hair when wet</li>
            <li>The conditioning is light, and just enough to keep my dry-normal hair soft and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in high school...</li>
            <li>It is nice enough but I am very, very picky about my hair and usually use two separate conditioners when I wash</li>
            <li>Axe used to have a body wash variety called \\&quot;Touch\\&quot; which was the best body wash fragrance I&#x27;d run across, and it&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li>, We have been a long time Axe products fans and tried every new one that comes out, and to date this is the one we like the most, Its just a personal preferences.</li>
            <li>Years ago when my husband and I first started dating he wore the men&#x27;s cologne Polo Sport, so that particular fragrance stands out to me when I smell something similar to it.</li>
            <li>An older teen, he is pretty picky about his products.  </li>
            <li>Axe has changed their design to these new cylindrical kinds of bottles (not actually pictured for this product on Amazon) and although they are relatively slim/easy to fit on a shower rack the tops aren&#x27;t sealed to the bottle.</li>
            <li>All the fragrances are amazing, subtle but deliciously masculine.</li>
            <li>This actually works out well, since my son normally puts on way too much cologne when he does use the bottle he has.</li>
            <li>Maybe the whole \\&quot;dry or oily\\&quot;  hair type thing doesn&#x27;t really matter and</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I can only imagine that on the inside (if you force twist it off) there is quite a large gap.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean, but not weighted down or greasy.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old son used the product and gave me his opinion - works</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need a heavy moisturizer and instead prefer a light treatment, this would be the shampoo for you.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old son picked it out because of it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>it cleans my hair and leaves it soft.  </li>
            <li>it does not do: My life does not resemble Axe commercials after using this product, at least not any more than it did before I tried it.  </li>
            <li>This from my 8 year old...</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t I asked my 8 year old if he wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>I did frequently get \\&quot;gosh you smell</li>
            <li>Well, after only a week of using this stuff my hair felt dry and kind of hard</li>
            <li>Its very subtle and nowhere near the level of axe cologne or anything.&lt;br /&gt;-&gt; Lathers up great, even with a small amount.</li>
            <li>I said the same thing for the AXE &amp;#34;Deep Space&amp;#34; body wash: I am a science fiction fan, so, it would be only natural for me to like this.</li>
            <li>I can barely keep my eyes open at that time of the day, but the minute I apply Axe 2 in 1 Apollo Shampoo Plus Conditioner</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not real musty/man and is more subtle.  </li>
            <li>I say this because whenever I leave it upside down the next morning the entire top of it is covered in blue soap from it slowly leaking out inside of the cap.</li>
            <li>After using it for a few days, you can certainly notice that the roots and hair becomes stronger.  </li>
            <li>shampoo wasn&#x27;t harsh but the conditioner was a little light for my preferences.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very satisfied with Axe Shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is a great shampoo, check out the 3in1 product that is also a body wash, it is an even better way to simplify your life.</li>
            <li> bottle is kind of art deco space age, but it looks good in our art deco bathroom</li>
            <li> This is my husband and sons&#x27; favorite!  </li>
            <li> It has a very clean and pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> That will always be biased based on the user (personally I kind of like</li>
            <li> I assume it was used and liked.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>
            <li> These combo products are great because this is the only way they ever use a conditioner, so it&#x27;s a real win.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so used to my husband using my shampoo and having that smell in his hair that this is a nice change to a &#x27;guy&#x27; smell.  </li>
            <li> I also thought it smelled nice.</li>
            <li> but I thought it was an apt</li>
            <li> I liked this well, but their \\&quot;Three in One\\</li>
            <li> Very easy to lather and rinse.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong, like most Axe products, but pleasant --i don&#x27;t know about \\&quot;irresistible\\&quot; though!!  </li>
            <li> Axe 2 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Apollo is a very good product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very cool, kind of aquatic scent.</li>
            <li> The strong cologne-like fragrances that the products are scented with are popular with boys his age</li>
            <li> I love the smell of their products, and this one was no exception.</li>
            <li> It is more of a gel consistency</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this one on my husband.</li>
            <li> My grandsons love Axe products, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better option.</li>
            <li> most shampoos I&#x27;ve used leave a sensation of oil if I don&#x27;t apply it twice</li>
            <li> The men in my life love this brand.  </li>
            <li> I think I will stick with separate shampoos and conditioners since they give me better results.</li>
            <li> This leaves your head feeling great and cleans your hair really well.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I picked up this Axe Apollo 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner combo for my pre-teen son since he likes using most bath and hygiene products by the brand.</li>
            <li> 2 in 1 shampoos are my favorite for him, since he&#x27;s able to use use one bottle for everything.</li>
            <li> In many of his interviews, his response to the things that just happened in life was \\&quot;Like my momma</li>
            <li> despite the underlying message being \\&quot;to pick up more girls\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried- i.e. not super great as either a shampoo or a conditioner on their own, but good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picking up, having the Total Fresh item that works well as shampoo/conditioner and is also a good body wash would be ideal.</li>
            <li> ok, smells too strong.</li>
            <li> Turns out these Axe brand 2 in 1 shampoos are more like 3 in 1, since they are so strongly fragranced they also work as a men&#x27;s cologne, since the scent lingers quite a while.</li>
            <li> It has a strong fragrance, but the scent is appealing to me.  </li>
            <li> speaking of fun, I am in love with the push-button cap!  </li>
            <li> Some Axe products a really too strong, so I was very happy with this fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and worth the price if you can find it as an add-on or special price.  </li>
            <li> It provides a great natural shine to your hair.  </li>
            <li> Works good, smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry ur hair out</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it leaves my hair smelling clean and conditioned.</li>
            <li> There should be a law that all shampoo containers be as easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seemed to work much better on his hair than mine, it felt clean, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li> but, it is really strong and lasts quite a while.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice masculine fragrance that he liked.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo gets your hair clean and keeps it soft!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and lathers really well!</li>
            <li> Axe products seem to be pretty popular these days and this 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner won&#x27;t detract from their popularity.  </li>
            <li> fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, nice smell; not overpowering, but it had a fresh, clean scent that my 8 year old loved.  </li>
            <li> So for what it&#x27;s worth, as a woman I really love the smell, but the \\&quot;man&#x27;s\\&quot; perspective was that it smelled too strong.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Axe 2 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Apollo, 12 Ounce, It blends well with my Husbands body chemistry making him smell so good that just like the funny clever commercials it makes me want to rock my astronaut all the time.</li>
            <li> HUGE disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item itself is great, but I had only received ONE bottle whereas I paid for six.</li>
            <li> cheap</li>
            <li> Great for me to take when I travel only have to pack one bottle.</li>
            <li> Is that important?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reminded of the ocean for some reason, no floral scent that I can detect, just a strong, clean</li>
            <li> and it conditioned lightly.  </li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels smooth and creamy and washes out clean leaving my hair feeling just washed for hours.  </li>
            <li> And to top it all off, the price is very reasonable for a brand name.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an AXE product, so leaves a strong, manly smell, which is a benefit unless that&#x27;s not what you want: all in all, a solid product at a good price...</li>
            <li> The Axe shampoo also prevents your hair from becoming oily and greasy while it allows your hair to stay fresh and clean feeling throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This new Apollo fragrance is a nice addition to the line I also like the that this is a 2in1 Shampoo/Conditioner</li>
            <li> It foams well, and leaves my hair clean and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I wanted my husband to have a shampoo that didn&#x27;t smell like an old man, I came across this great Aze product that really stood out.  </li>
            <li> My hair smelled great but after the week trial my scalp was itchy and my hair felt dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; and</li>
            <li> This is a very good 2 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner, It makes my husband&#x27;s hair soft and manageable, I just love to cuddle into his hair when we go to bed and just sniff him all night long....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 3 weeks or so now, and overall i am very pleased with it and can easily recommend it.</li>
            <li> Both have a mild scent that&#x27;s pleasant enough but nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Cleans my old grey hair sparkling clean, leaves a Delightful aroma</li>
            <li> , really dont think you can find a better one for a guys</li>
            <li> They think this shampoo is cool.</li>
            <li> It does have a cool way of opening.  </li>
            <li> Shinny and full.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t care for 2-in-1 products (I prefer separate shampoo and conditioner), but this is a nice product.</li>
            <li> He also liked that it left his hair feeling clean and conditioned.</li>
            <li> If you like Axe products in general, and are okay with shampoo/conditioner-type hair cleansers, this is also a fine product.</li>
            <li> A new favorite product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell as it is very masculine and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> It rinses easily and the scent, while strong at first, lingers just a bit to keep me smelling fresh and masculine.</li>
            <li> This Ae 2 in 1 shampoo plus conditioner lathers up nicely and washes off easily enough.</li>
            <li> The smell is invigorating and fresh.</li>
            <li> but why not have as much fun in the shower as you</li>
            <li> Completely affordable AXE product, smells MANLY and works great: it&#x27;s a completely affordable price for a shampoo and conditioner combined, and works very well:</li>
            <li> It can be very drying, and strip hair of needed oils, but the boys loved the commercial, so I figured why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would smell as good as every other Axe product</li>
            <li> As far as the bright color goes, this just means more chemical coloring agents on your head, body, and down the drain to the environment.  </li>
            <li> , others leave a dryness sensation, but Axe seems to have the right balance between softness and cleanliness.</li>
            <li> Son loves this everything Axe - gifted it to him - with a few other Axe products, Amazon is competitive with Wal-Mart in price - when purchasing the amount (now $35) to get free S/H - this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> As I said, the ladies love it, well, at least my wife and my daughter, and since those are the most important ladies in my life, that counts for a lot.</li>
            <li> It left my hair smelling fresh and clean as well as easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount is needed and it works into a great lather.</li>
            <li> According to the reactions the shampoo/conditioner lathered up very easily,rinsed away clean, and left  hair feeling soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li> There is a strong fairly masculine scent, but it is not overpowering like some Axe products.</li>
            <li> and my scalp felt dry and kind of itchy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;THAT being said, I didn&#x27;t find the scent overly masculine or strong, so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li> it is a little cologne-like in smell, but since it is a good smell, I kept it at 5 stars.</li>
            <li> (Blushes)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All kidding aside this really is a great smelling product, at least to me</li>
            <li> It is a hot item.  </li>
            <li> He also felt the smell would be more suited towards the teenage crowd as opposed to the 30s crowd.</li>
            <li> Initially, I thought the smell was ok</li>
            <li> My son (college aged) used this product and he really liked it.</li>
            <li> It is much simpler than the traditional two-step process and the results are phenomenal.</li>
            <li> When I was growing up &#x60;WWW&#x27; stood for World-Wide Wrestling and the most profound statement of my early life was a quote from a wrestler named The Iceman King Parsons.  </li>
            <li> If you like cool, masculine aquatic scents I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
            <li> The smell was too strong for him, but at the same time, it didn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> lathers fine and definitely leaves hair softer than shampoo alone</li>
            <li> $ haha.</li>
            <li> Otherwise much cheaper at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> The scent really lingers on his hair.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a guy, so I don&#x27;t get much feedback on how well it works or what he likes, after all...</li>
            <li> I really like axe products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Instead just showering with this gives him a much lighter dose of cologne scent, not so overpowering.</li>
            <li> As this product is advertised for men, maybe those guys who have shorter hair won&#x27;t really notice.  </li>
            <li> &quot; Shampoo/Conditioner/Body Wash called Total Fresh is a product I am more likely to buy.  </li>
            <li> so it really does condition.  </li>
            <li> I would have enjoyed it more if mine wasn&#x27;t broken when I received it.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this is one of the only hair cleaning products I have seen in years that does not indicate whether it is for people with normal, dry, oily, or whatever type of hair.  </li>
            <li> This is good shampoo/conditioner, and works about the same as other combination products</li>
            <li> If your hair is exceptionally oily, you&#x27;ll need to use this a few times, as the conditioner neutralizes the shampoo action.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers great, and only a small amount is required.</li>
            <li> The blue gel also looks cool.  </li>
            <li> Good sudsing with only a little dab required for a man&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> It allows you to easily comb your hair when wet</li>
            <li> The conditioning is light, and just enough to keep my dry-normal hair soft and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in high school...</li>
            <li> It is nice enough but I am very, very picky about my hair and usually use two separate conditioners when I wash</li>
            <li> Axe used to have a body wash variety called \\&quot;Touch\\&quot; which was the best body wash fragrance I&#x27;d run across, and it&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> , We have been a long time Axe products fans and tried every new one that comes out, and to date this is the one we like the most, Its just a personal preferences.</li>
            <li> Years ago when my husband and I first started dating he wore the men&#x27;s cologne Polo Sport, so that particular fragrance stands out to me when I smell something similar to it.</li>
            <li> An older teen, he is pretty picky about his products.  </li>
            <li> Axe has changed their design to these new cylindrical kinds of bottles (not actually pictured for this product on Amazon) and although they are relatively slim/easy to fit on a shower rack the tops aren&#x27;t sealed to the bottle.</li>
            <li> All the fragrances are amazing, subtle but deliciously masculine.</li>
            <li> This actually works out well, since my son normally puts on way too much cologne when he does use the bottle he has.</li>
            <li> Maybe the whole \\&quot;dry or oily\\&quot;  hair type thing doesn&#x27;t really matter and</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I can only imagine that on the inside (if you force twist it off) there is quite a large gap.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean, but not weighted down or greasy.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son used the product and gave me his opinion - works</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need a heavy moisturizer and instead prefer a light treatment, this would be the shampoo for you.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old son picked it out because of it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> it cleans my hair and leaves it soft.  </li>
            <li> it does not do: My life does not resemble Axe commercials after using this product, at least not any more than it did before I tried it.  </li>
            <li> This from my 8 year old...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t I asked my 8 year old if he wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> I did frequently get \\&quot;gosh you smell</li>
            <li> Well, after only a week of using this stuff my hair felt dry and kind of hard</li>
            <li> Its very subtle and nowhere near the level of axe cologne or anything.&lt;br /&gt;-&gt; Lathers up great, even with a small amount.</li>
            <li> I said the same thing for the AXE &amp;#34;Deep Space&amp;#34; body wash: I am a science fiction fan, so, it would be only natural for me to like this.</li>
            <li> I can barely keep my eyes open at that time of the day, but the minute I apply Axe 2 in 1 Apollo Shampoo Plus Conditioner</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not real musty/man and is more subtle.  </li>
            <li> I say this because whenever I leave it upside down the next morning the entire top of it is covered in blue soap from it slowly leaking out inside of the cap.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days, you can certainly notice that the roots and hair becomes stronger.  </li>
            <li> shampoo wasn&#x27;t harsh but the conditioner was a little light for my preferences.  </li>
            <li> if your hair is very dry, this conditioner won&#x27;t be adequate (i have long thick hair).  </li>
            <li> The scent is very powerful, but was very subtle after the hair was dry.</li>
            <li> That could be a positive or negative depending on how long you like to smell like the shampoo you used.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty subtle, and smells like a cologne with citrus undertones.  </li>
            <li> Easy to squeeze out and crazy blue color</li>
            <li> However, I am struggling to find any way to distinguish its effectiveness from any of the other zillions of similar products out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a big fan of all Axe products (see my other reviews) and keep an ample supply on hand for what ever.  </li>
            <li> I was particularly surprised by the dry feeling of my hair since I have really short hair and usually can&#x27;t tell one way or the other.  </li>
            <li> Can star to get a little intoxicating in sniff the bottle long enough.  </li>
            <li> (Maybe a little crunchier and less soft than I would prefer, but no</li>
            <li> This was replacement for empty bottle from X-Mas.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> The smell on this AXE one is not as obnoxious as other AXE products...</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s due to me being 74.  </li>
            <li> The Apollo fragrance smells just like Polo Sport cologne my husband use to wear, so I like it over all of the other Axe fragrances.</li>
            <li> the color is an unnatural opaque blue-green with shiny gold sparkles (neither here nor there, just describing that it looks pretty weird- does not affect usefulness).  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, and it&#x27;s about shoulder length, but this didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the other 2 in 1&#x27;s</li>
            <li> He likes a couple other of the Axe brand shampoos too.</li>
            <li> So I like the 2 in 1 types because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, but I also don&#x27;t have to put conditioner right along my scalp and have it get dirty faster.  </li>
            <li> I almost knocked it down  </li>
            <li> simply put a small portion in one hand, lather up, and rinse!  </li>
            <li> I have to buy it on amazon because it&#x27;s not available in my country.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and keeps my hair from being dried out.</li>
            <li> The AXE line of products has one of the few shampoos specifically made for men.</li>
            <li> At least it matches with the smell of the other Apollo line of products.</li>
            <li> However as a parent who noticed the distasteful silhouettes on the back after I purchased it, he probably won&#x27;t be using it nor will I buy it for him again.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying Axe products although, as a lazy person who is too sleepy to know which bottle</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where the astronaut comment came from, but he was game.  </li>
            <li> Yes I know that&#x27;s a bit creepy and weird, but hay he loves me and my corkiness any ways.</li>
            <li> Unfortunate for me, I don&#x27;t have to fight the girls off.  </li>

            <li> Very satisfied with Axe Shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Cleans my old grey hair sparkling clean, leaves a Delightful aroma</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Axe. I love the smell of their products, and this one was no exception. My 16 year old son used the product and gave me his opinion - works ok, smells too strong. So for what it&#x27;s worth, as a woman I really love the smell, but the \\&quot;man&#x27;s\\&quot; perspective was that it smelled too strong. The cleaning/conditioning was good/average. I would buy it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it leaves my hair smelling clean and conditioned.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Axe 2 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Apollo, 12 Ounce, It blends well with my Husbands body chemistry making him smell so good that just like the funny clever commercials it makes me want to rock my astronaut all the time.

LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also purchase the Axe Revitalizing Shower Gel Apollo, 16 Ounce Pack of 3) and the Axe Body spray, Apollo, 4 Ounce (Pack of 6) that complements the Axe 2 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Apollo, 12 Ounce.</li>
            <li> This is my husband and sons&#x27; favorite!  It is more of a gel consistency so it doesn&#x27;t pour out like water...lasts longer and smells great!</li>
            <li> Axe products seem to be pretty popular these days and this 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner won&#x27;t detract from their popularity.  This is something I will probably take with when traveling.  It is nice enough but I am very, very picky about my hair and usually use two separate conditioners when I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo wasn&#x27;t harsh but the conditioner was a little light for my preferences.  It allows you to easily comb your hair when wet but just doesn&#x27;t add the moisturizer that I need.  The scent is very nice and pleasant, not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t need a heavy moisturizer and instead prefer a light treatment, this would be the shampoo for you.</li>
            <li> Review has nothing to do with the scent. That will always be biased based on the user (personally I kind of like it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for why this is 2 stars...the bottle. Axe has changed their design to these new cylindrical kinds of bottles (not actually pictured for this product on Amazon) and although they are relatively slim/easy to fit on a shower rack the tops aren&#x27;t sealed to the bottle. As a matter of fact, I can only imagine that on the inside (if you force twist it off) there is quite a large gap. I say this because whenever I leave it upside down the next morning the entire top of it is covered in blue soap from it slowly leaking out inside of the cap.</li>
            <li> what can you say its 2 in 1</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would smell as good as every other Axe product but it just doesn&#x27;t. The smell is too strong and overpowering. At least it matches with the smell of the other Apollo line of products.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and lathers really well! Would recommend. Also like how you can just click a button and the bottle opens.</li>
            <li> come on - it&#x27;s shampoo.  I assume it was used and liked.</li>
            <li> The packaging is quite &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;. My 13 year old son picked it out because of it.  However as a parent who noticed the distasteful silhouettes on the back after I purchased it, he probably won&#x27;t be using it nor will I buy it for him again.</li>
            <li> Son loves this everything Axe - gifted it to him - with a few other Axe products, Amazon is competitive with Wal-Mart in price - when purchasing the amount (now $35) to get free S/H - this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Item itself is great, but I had only received ONE bottle whereas I paid for six.</li>
            <li> awesome nice feel and smell of the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;its cheap as well, i still want it to be like 1$ haha.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and worth the price if you can find it as an add-on or special price.  Otherwise much cheaper at Walmart.  Good sudsing with only a little dab required for a man&#x27;s hair.  Nice smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 3 weeks or so now, and overall i am very pleased with it and can easily recommend it. Here are some notes on my experience with it:&lt;br /&gt;-&gt; Great smell, really dont think you can find a better one for a guys shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;-&gt; If your worried about the heaviness of the scent, dont be. Its very subtle and nowhere near the level of axe cologne or anything.&lt;br /&gt;-&gt; Lathers up great, even with a small amount.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this one on my husband. The scent really lingers on his hair. It&#x27;s a very cool, kind of aquatic scent. If you like cool, masculine aquatic scents I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
            <li> My grandsons love Axe products, and this one is no exception. They think this shampoo is cool. According to the reactions the shampoo/conditioner lathered up very easily,rinsed away clean, and left  hair feeling soft and smelling good. These combo products are great because this is the only way they ever use a conditioner, so it&#x27;s a real win. The scent is very powerful, but was very subtle after the hair was dry.</li>
            <li> Axe 2 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Apollo in an excellent shampoo plus conditioner. It leaves my hair feeling clean, but not weighted down or greasy. The conditioning is light, and just enough to keep my dry-normal hair soft and not frizzy. The shampoo lathers great, and only a small amount is required. There is a strong fairly masculine scent, but it is not overpowering like some Axe products. Even my wife doesn&#x27;t mind using it. It is reasonably priced too. Axe 2 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Apollo is a very good product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using Axe shampoo I haven&#x27;t found a better option. My hair and head skin are extra greasy and most shampoos I&#x27;ve used leave a sensation of oil if I don&#x27;t apply it twice, others leave a dryness sensation, but Axe seems to have the right balance between softness and cleanliness. I have to buy it on amazon because it&#x27;s not available in my country. All the fragrances are amazing, subtle but deliciously masculine. It&#x27;s so soft I can use it daily, my hair looks great, feels great and my head skin also feels healthier! I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product out.  It works - it cleans my hair and leaves it soft.  However, I am struggling to find any way to distinguish its effectiveness from any of the other zillions of similar products out there.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo, seems weird since it&#x27;s a shampoo.  I&#x27;m just so used to my husband using my shampoo and having that smell in his hair that this is a nice change to a &#x27;guy&#x27; smell.  He&#x27;s a guy, so I don&#x27;t get much feedback on how well it works or what he likes, after all... it&#x27;s shampoo.  He likes it, he&#x27;s using it and I like the smell so I guess this all makes it a winner.</li>
            <li> Axe 2 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner, Apollo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is enough make you want to sniff this product all day.  It is so inviting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome product.  It does its job wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe is a wonderful brand of products.  It is a hot item.  The men in my life love this brand.  Words cannot describe how wonderful this brand is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> What this does: It&#x27;s a good men&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner.  The smell is pretty subtle, and smells like a cologne with citrus undertones.  It foams well, and leaves my hair clean and manageable.  (Maybe a little crunchier and less soft than I would prefer, but no complaints.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does not do: My life does not resemble Axe commercials after using this product, at least not any more than it did before I tried it.  Other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> My husband tried out this shampoo/conditioner. He loves that it has both shampoo and conditioner in one, because that just saves time and space. He also liked that it left his hair feeling clean and conditioned. The smell was too strong for him, but at the same time, it didn&#x27;t linger. That could be a positive or negative depending on how long you like to smell like the shampoo you used. He also felt the smell would be more suited towards the teenage crowd as opposed to the 30s crowd.</li>
            <li> I wanted my husband to have a shampoo that didn&#x27;t smell like an old man, I came across this great Aze product that really stood out.  With this 2 in 1, he gets that conditioner he needs too and it only takes him 1 chance to wash his hair, so it saves him time.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this is one of the only hair cleaning products I have seen in years that does not indicate whether it is for people with normal, dry, oily, or whatever type of hair.  Maybe the whole \\&quot;dry or oily\\&quot;  hair type thing doesn&#x27;t really matter and that is just marketing tool.  Well, after only a week of using this stuff my hair felt dry and kind of hard and my scalp felt dry and kind of itchy.  I was particularly surprised by the dry feeling of my hair since I have really short hair and usually can&#x27;t tell one way or the other.  Initially, I thought the smell was ok but, it is really strong and lasts quite a while.  Can star to get a little intoxicating in sniff the bottle long enough.  It does have a cool way of opening.  I would have enjoyed it more if mine wasn&#x27;t broken when I received it.  As far as the bright color goes, this just means more chemical coloring agents on your head, body, and down the drain to the environment.  This goes for the fragrances, too.</li>
            <li> I used the Axe 2 in 1 shampoo for a week and I felt like I was shampooing with a body wash.  My hair smelled great but after the week trial my scalp was itchy and my hair felt dry and brittle.  I think I will stick with separate shampoos and conditioners since they give me better results.</li>
            <li> I really like axe products. They work great and smell great. This is no exception. It is a great shampoo plus conditioner created for men. I love the smell as it is very masculine and not too overpowering. This leaves your head feeling great and cleans your hair really well. I would definetly get this product and use again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great quality and represents the Axe product line well.  Axe is known for their manly scent and this shampoo definitely delivers.  Very easy to lather and rinse.  After using it for a few days, you can certainly notice that the roots and hair becomes stronger.  It provides a great natural shine to your hair.  The Axe shampoo also prevents your hair from becoming oily and greasy while it allows your hair to stay fresh and clean feeling throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Since I have short hair I don&#x27;t really need conditioner.  So I like the 2 in 1 types because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, but I also don&#x27;t have to put conditioner right along my scalp and have it get dirty faster.  The smell on this AXE one is not as obnoxious as other AXE products... it&#x27;s not real musty/man and is more subtle.  That&#x27;s a plus in my book!  It cleans well and keeps my hair from being dried out. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This was replacement for empty bottle from X-Mas.  Works well on fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Will order it again.</li>
            <li> The AXE line of products has one of the few shampoos specifically made for men. This new Apollo fragrance is a nice addition to the line I also like the that this is a 2in1 Shampoo/Conditioner so you only need one bottle if you want both. In my opinion it is a great shampoo, check out the 3in1 product that is also a body wash, it is an even better way to simplify your life.</li>
            <li> Great smelling shampoo for the guys. My favorite shampoo. I hope Axe never changes the formula. Easy to squeeze out and crazy blue color</li>
            <li> I said the same thing for the AXE &amp;#34;Deep Space&amp;#34; body wash: I am a science fiction fan, so, it would be only natural for me to like this. You don&#x27;t have to be a sci-fi fan to use this, though.</li>
            <li> What can I say this is great shampoo/conditioner. People always notice my hair. They always tell me how great it looks. Shinny and full.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t care for 2-in-1 products (I prefer separate shampoo and conditioner), but this is a nice product. It has a pleasant smell and does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This Ae 2 in 1 shampoo plus conditioner lathers up nicely and washes off easily enough. It smells GREAT. It has a very clean and pleasant smell. Some Axe products a really too strong, so I was very happy with this fresh, clean smell. As I said, the ladies love it, well, at least my wife and my daughter, and since those are the most important ladies in my life, that counts for a lot. I almost knocked it down  becuase it is a little cologne-like in smell, but since it is a good smell, I kept it at 5 stars. It also represents a good value. I am happy to recommend this.</li>
            <li> My son (college aged) used this product and he really liked it. He felt it did a good job of cleansing and conditioning his hair. It has a nice masculine fragrance that he liked. I also thought it smelled nice.</li>
            <li> I like when i can get a two and one product. This way I only have one product to buy and one to use. It left my hair smelling fresh and clean as well as easy to manage. Great for me to take when I travel only have to pack one bottle. This is a great product from Axe. They always have great items for men and they smell great as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a big fan of all Axe products (see my other reviews) and keep an ample supply on hand for what ever.  Unfortunate for me, I don&#x27;t have to fight the girls off.  Maybe it&#x27;s due to me being 74.  I&#x27;m just saying....................All Axe products do the job.  Haven&#x27;t tried it on my car yet but who knows.,</li>
            <li> At 5:45 am the last thing I need to worry about is washing and conditioning my hair. I can barely keep my eyes open at that time of the day, but the minute I apply Axe 2 in 1 Apollo Shampoo Plus Conditioner it&#x27;s like an Arctic blast to wake me up. The smell is invigorating and fresh. Just a small amount is needed and it works into a great lather. It rinses easily and the scent, while strong at first, lingers just a bit to keep me smelling fresh and masculine. I will continue to buy this Axe shampoo &amp; conditioner combination. It is much simpler than the traditional two-step process and the results are phenomenal. A new favorite product.</li>
            <li> Years ago when my husband and I first started dating he wore the men&#x27;s cologne Polo Sport, so that particular fragrance stands out to me when I smell something similar to it. I picked up this Axe Apollo 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner combo for my pre-teen son since he likes using most bath and hygiene products by the brand. The strong cologne-like fragrances that the products are scented with are popular with boys his age and so he likes using just about anything by Axe. 2 in 1 shampoos are my favorite for him, since he&#x27;s able to use use one bottle for everything. Turns out these Axe brand 2 in 1 shampoos are more like 3 in 1, since they are so strongly fragranced they also work as a men&#x27;s cologne, since the scent lingers quite a while. This actually works out well, since my son normally puts on way too much cologne when he does use the bottle he has. Instead just showering with this gives him a much lighter dose of cologne scent, not so overpowering. The Apollo fragrance smells just like Polo Sport cologne my husband use to wear, so I like it over all of the other Axe fragrances. So if you&#x27;re a fan of products that resemble Polo Sport, this Apollo fragrance of this Axe shampoo is probably the one for you.</li>
            <li> This is good shampoo/conditioner, and works about the same as other combination products i&#x27;ve tried- i.e. not super great as either a shampoo or a conditioner on their own, but good to use if you&#x27;re traveling or at the gym and don&#x27;t want to carry extra items.  The smell is pretty strong, like most Axe products, but pleasant --i don&#x27;t know about \\&quot;irresistible\\&quot; though!!  the color is an unnatural opaque blue-green with shiny gold sparkles (neither here nor there, just describing that it looks pretty weird- does not affect usefulness).  If your hair is exceptionally oily, you&#x27;ll need to use this a few times, as the conditioner neutralizes the shampoo action.  if your hair is very dry, this conditioner won&#x27;t be adequate (i have long thick hair).  As this product is advertised for men, maybe those guys who have shorter hair won&#x27;t really notice.  If you like Axe products in general, and are okay with shampoo/conditioner-type hair cleansers, this is also a fine product. it has a really good price point, and i think it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo gets your hair clean and keeps it soft!</li>
            <li> Being an Axe product there is an expectation that it will smell great, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. The blue gel also looks cool.  Is that important?  No, but why not have as much fun in the shower as you can?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of fun, I am in love with the push-button cap!  There should be a law that all shampoo containers be as easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is kind of art deco space age, but it looks good in our art deco bathroom so that&#x27;s a plus too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels smooth and creamy and washes out clean leaving my hair feeling just washed for hours.  And to top it all off, the price is very reasonable for a brand name.</li>
            <li> When I was growing up &#x60;WWW&#x27; stood for World-Wide Wrestling and the most profound statement of my early life was a quote from a wrestler named The Iceman King Parsons.  In many of his interviews, his response to the things that just happened in life was \\&quot;Like my momma always said: &#x60;It be&#x27;s that way sometimes --- have mercy!\\&quot;  If life throws lemons your way, then wash it out with this Ace, Apollo-scent 2-in-1 Shampoo with conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get hit by a folding chair or crash and break a plastic table while being thrown from the upper rung of a wrestling rink, then you&#x27;re bound to want to take a shower and when you just don&#x27;t have time, 2-in-1 Axe shampoo and conditioner gets the job done, swimmingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have mercy.</li>
            <li> Completely affordable AXE product, smells MANLY and works great: it&#x27;s a completely affordable price for a shampoo and conditioner combined, and works very well: simply put a small portion in one hand, lather up, and rinse!  It&#x27;s an AXE product, so leaves a strong, manly smell, which is a benefit unless that&#x27;s not what you want: all in all, a solid product at a good price...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have the time for a two-step process. This does the job.</li>
            <li> My son volunteered to try out a variety of bath products.  An older teen, he is pretty picky about his products.  His review follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the Apollo Axe 2 in 1 scent targets a younger audience.  It has a strong fragrance, but the scent is appealing to me.  The scent lasts quite awhile after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in high school... despite the underlying message being \\&quot;to pick up more girls\\&quot;, since I began using Apollo Axe, no girl has purposefully touched my hair or has told me that I am irresistible.  HUGE disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the Apollo 2 in 1 did make my hair softer (it did its job, in a way).</li>
            <li> Works good, smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry ur hair out</li>
            <li> This from my 8 year old...but I thought it was an apt description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With five boys and a husband, we have A LOT of Axe products lying around the house-body spray, body wash, deodorant-you name it, we have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, never bought any of the shampoo or conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of &#x27;perfume&#x27; in any shampoo doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me.  It can be very drying, and strip hair of needed oils, but the boys loved the commercial, so I figured why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DID NOT like it on my hair!  I have a lot of hair, and it&#x27;s about shoulder length, but this didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the other 2 in 1&#x27;s I have used on my hair, and I&#x27;m blaming the fragrance.  My hair felt &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; and no, that isn&#x27;t how you want your hair.  It seemed to strip my hair of some of it&#x27;s shine as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT being said, I didn&#x27;t find the scent overly masculine or strong, so that&#x27;s a plus. I&#x27;m reminded of the ocean for some reason, no floral scent that I can detect, just a strong, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once don&#x27;t I asked my 8 year old if he wanted to try it. That&#x27;s where the astronaut comment came from, but he was game.  He lathered up with it and rushed over to me after he got his pajamas on to ask what I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, nice smell; not overpowering, but it had a fresh, clean scent that my 8 year old loved.  It seemed to work much better on his hair than mine, it felt clean, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for men, and since that&#x27;s who it&#x27;s made for...</li>
            <li> I found it a bit overpowering of a smell, but my young-adult son loves it.  He said that it lathered well and it conditioned lightly.  He likes a couple other of the Axe brand shampoos too.</li>
            <li> I liked this well, but their \\&quot;Three in One\\&quot; Shampoo/Conditioner/Body Wash called Total Fresh is a product I am more likely to buy.  Both have a mild scent that&#x27;s pleasant enough but nothing special.  Axe used to have a body wash variety called \\&quot;Touch\\&quot; which was the best body wash fragrance I&#x27;d run across, and it&#x27;s too bad I can&#x27;t find that.  I did frequently get \\&quot;gosh you smell nice\\&quot; compliments with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apollo lathers fine and definitely leaves hair softer than shampoo alone so it really does condition.  As someone who only used shampoo before, using a product like this has taught me that conditioner does make a difference.  I will keep buying Axe products although, as a lazy person who is too sleepy to know which bottle I&#x27;m picking up, having the Total Fresh item that works well as shampoo/conditioner and is also a good body wash would be ideal.</li>
