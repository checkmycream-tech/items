            <li>She loves it very much!!!!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this airbrush kit!</li>
            <li>This is a very awesome product and it is exactly what I am looking for and expect from makeup airbrush kit.  </li>
            <li>thing to note, be sure you thoroughly shake the bottles of foundation!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Ok!</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that I did it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The makeup was easy to apply and looked GREAT on.</li>
            <li>Came very quick and was packaged very nicely.</li>
            <li>I must say that between the concealer and the airbrush, my face looked amazing</li>
            <li>my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>kit was amazing while it worked.</li>
            <li>Makeup is light but covers great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really wanting to try airbrush makeup because it can leave your skin looking flawless.</li>
            <li>Better off buying a good brand of foundation instead.</li>
            <li>The bronzer that comes with this kit feels kind of sandy on skin</li>
            <li>airbrush gun itself, Is quite nice.</li>
            <li>The Movie Star and  Sand are both very close together, so I could get away with using either of them for foundation, I find mixing them is best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, This set is very affordable and excellent for beginners, and those looking to expand in the airbrush world.</li>
            <li>Plus you can always make your own too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, This set is very affordable and excellent for beginners, and those looking to expand in the airbrush world.</li>
            <li>Plus you can always make your own too.  </li>
            <li>and then she just started practicing with her own kit</li>
            <li>The price was right and she is very very happy with it, now i have to order more supplies for her.</li>
            <li>LOVE, an absolute perfect airbrush make-up kit.</li>
            <li>This make up comes off very easily.</li>
            <li>Out of the package, the system is very easy to set up</li>
            <li>The air brush gets clogged very easily compared to another one I have had and the makeup has no staying power even if you set it with a powder finish.</li>
            <li>The makeup also rubs off very easily, it&#x27;s almost like glue when you rub it.  </li>
            <li>I took everything out the box and it was very easy to put together.  </li>
            <li>instructions are very elaborate and easy to understand for even a person who may never have done any kind of make up before.</li>
            <li>More input on how to clean the airbrush would be great.</li>
            <li>The makeup application results are near flawless.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been working perfect so far.</li>
            <li>I must say I have been very impressed with the kit so far.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, would recommend!</li>
            <li>I love love love it!  </li>
            <li>I just wish there was more information on the make up part of the company, but the machine works great and the price is right.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I&#x27;ve tried out any type of airbrush system and I must say that I am quite happy with this</li>
            <li>They do peel off rather easy, if you want to make your own airbrush foundation.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better quality makeup in my opinion.</li>
            <li>, I jut wish the makeup would have been better.</li>
            <li>so glad I got Art of Air.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have found that oil-free makeup remover works better than the cleaner.</li>
            <li>Already looking into better gun.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>The art of airbrush make up kit has everything you need and more for your make up routine.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and you get so many extras in your kit.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for a honest review, regardless all thoughts are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this air gun  makeup system.  </li>
            <li>I will be able to cover my skin flaws well.</li>
            <li>I love the concept.</li>
            <li>I have since forcused more on my skin itself.</li>
            <li>My wife love this gift.</li>
            <li>Better day 2.</li>
            <li>Love the foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Definitely perfect for someone just starting out!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>(this kept my hand moving a lot more) and wala</li>
            <li>I love this system and reçcomend it to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li>Love the botanical plus.</li>
            <li>I have tried the lumines before and the lumines is a better quality product.</li>
            <li>I love this system.</li>
            <li>I just wish this would have lasted me more than a month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>After days of research on this kit vs Luminess, I decided to go with this kit since it was more affordable and it came with more extras with the kit.  </li>
            <li>The brush is great, the foundation not so much...  </li>
            <li>So instead I use the luminess foundation it worked better</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>While it is definitely a learning curve to the process, I&#x27;m extremely impressed with how well it can cover my imperfections and blemishes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left my face looking practically flawless.  </li>
            <li>Sputters spits and takes way way more foundation</li>
            <li>The color smears off with just touching it.</li>
            <li>It does give a more uniform look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light!</li>
            <li>I love it and my friends love it.</li>
            <li>The product itseld is absolutely wonderful and am hoping that I finally get one that works and doesn&#x27;t break on me.  </li>
            <li>So, I do wish they would use better labels.</li>
            <li>I received this free of charge, for my honest opinion.tsoever.</li>
            <li>I received this free of charge, for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Which came in handy when I took my airbrush apart to clean it.</li>
            <li>The makeup feels light and is very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The equipment works great and is easy and fast to apply the makeup.  </li>
            <li>it is every bit as good as the higher priced machines .</li>
            <li>Not as good as my first one</li>
            <li>I never wore makeup that often but now this is so easy I wear it more often.</li>
            <li>Love the makeup but comes off really easy of you sweat .</li>
            <li>This kit leaves a flawless finish, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how well it works at such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Feels great and not heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those that are looking for an airbrush system and don&#x27;t want to pay top dollar, this airbrush kit is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It seems really, really easy.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness used prime as return was easy.</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>I stopped using it because it comes off so easily.</li>
            <li>The carrying case makes it so easy to take anywhere</li>
            <li>It is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>the instructions are easy to read and follow&lt;</li>
            <li>Product itself isn&#x27;t easy to use when it comes to using the highlights and bronzer</li>
            <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it you can do very quickly.  </li>
            <li>and it comes off easy</li>
            <li>So easy.</li>
            <li>it comes off really easy to remove the needle.  </li>
            <li>did an unboxing video on my youtube channel and have been using this on special occasions, I love the bronzer it smells like coconut.</li>
            <li>May be great on younger skin, not so great on my 47 year old skin.</li>
            <li>The most important part right?!</li>
            <li>Powders are just fine over.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough and the makeup looks great.</li>
            <li>received the product in the mail fairly quickly and was very excited to put it to use.  </li>
            <li>So I looked on Amazon and found this and was super excited!</li>
            <li>Basically you have it all.&lt;br /&gt;You can even purchase colors available separately and use with this system.</li>
            <li>However, the only thing I haven&#x27;t been happy with is the fact that I can&#x27;t find the ingredients of the makeup.  </li>
            <li>machine is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Both were for light skin.</li>
            <li>It just surges and the go light blinks instead of continually humming and pushing air.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>itks important</li>
            <li>They apply so airy, and light, and sit right on top of your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what it was for, but everything else went together perfectly and machine works fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve faired pretty good on lines/crows feet but have issues with large pores and some age spots.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;m still learning how to integrate my normal skincare routine and using the airbrush system, I know that for times when I want to hide my imperfections I&#x27;ll be using the airbrush system for sure!  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works very well and very easy to use it just takes some practice to learn how to apply it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in airbrush. :-)</li>
            <li>I love this product however, I had to return the first one I bought because on day 28 the motor stopped</li>
            <li>It is totally clean.</li>
            <li>Fun and easy</li>
            <li>so I know how to clean and use and take care of the dang thing</li>
            <li>I studied youtube videos for application tutorials before it arrived, so I tried the techniques I learned and was able to get a very even and smooth finish with the makeup included.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Time consuming to clean</li>
            <li>The compressor is super nice as you can manually adjust the speed, vs a high, med, lo setting.</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I love this!</li>
            <li>Amazing I cut my regular makeup time almost in half and it looks flawless</li>
            <li>It worked great for the first 2 days, now its like the airpump only works 1/2 way...</li>
            <li>colors also are amazingly close to my natural color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full adjustable as opposed to 3 set speed like the others that I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>While i don&#x27;t think I would ever use the darker foundations, I suppose it&#x27;s a nice additional for the professional makeup artist who needs a varairty of shades.  </li>
            <li>However it did come with PAGES of text telling me how much I would love how it made me look.  </li>
            <li>this is a good deal, however on the third use</li>
            <li>This company is super sweet and this brand</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great deal, you get all of this for a fraction of the cost that other machines will cost you.</li>
            <li>also it is quick once yuo get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>Delivered quick.</li>
            <li>If water touch your face the make up would fade away quickly leaving spots with no make up.</li>
            <li>Started sputtering very first time using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but overall I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>The machine itself is very durable and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was really intimidated by this when I first got it, but after using it now three or four times I feel as if I get better each time I use</li>
            <li>The first time I tried, I looked like a clown!</li>
            <li>The first time I tried, I looked like a clown!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel that this is worth $100 considering the device broke so easily</li>
            <li>This kit is perfect for any person that is really wanting to start testing out airbrush makeup but doesn&#x27;t want to spend thousands of dollars on a more expensive machine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is well worth it..</li>
            <li>1st try was a success.</li>
            <li>After seeing the reviews I figured it was worth a try.....</li>
            <li>I am going to try another brand of makeup to see if it was worth the purchase</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this airbrush system and actually think its better than the luminess system that I had before.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>However, the two darker foundations unknown  and suntan glo were actually too dark for my best friend who is Persian, and has a gorgeous olive/tan skin tone.</li>
            <li>I mostly used youtube to understand how to use it, back bubble, and clean it.</li>
            <li>I had my face airbrushed for a wedding the other weekend and loved the results</li>
            <li>I saw the Art of Air kit and decided the price was right.  </li>
            <li>It takes practice to learn to put in on just right</li>
            <li>I guess I don&#x27;t really use it, takes more time to then then putting make up on normally</li>
            <li>but I was still able able to hide those capillaries and my dark circles under my eyes without feeling like I have makeup caked on my face.  </li>
            <li>Very professional and easy to use on myself.  </li>
            <li>but when I tried this I was delightfully surprised at how easy it was to use and the results that I got.  </li>
            <li>Really depends on your own personal skin type.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To mix, I found a great tutorial online that shows how to properly mix you need to put your desired shades in the &amp;#34;gun&amp;#34; and to cover the needle to block air and to press on the lever so that you see it kinda bubble up and repeat a couple of times and allow it to go back to</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean and what a difference between air brushing and using regular makeup!!</li>
            <li>It is dual action, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My wife is in school for cosmetology and has been working with some very accomplished people in the industry.  </li>
            <li>If you a MUA just starting out this Baby is super inexpensive and easy to use for your kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Machine was ok but the makeup definitely left something to be desired.</li>
            <li>It was my first ever try at airbrush makeup</li>
            <li>But I still love everything else overall!</li>
            <li>This is my first time owning something like this.</li>
            <li>Gun splattered  and stopped up first use.</li>
            <li>First off let me state that I am a freelance makeup artist.</li>
            <li>Hot days do not make a difference.</li>
            <li>First time user.</li>
            <li>I most recently went to an outdoor summer wedding in SoCal and my makeup lasted all night, even after dancing!  </li>
            <li>First 2-3 days a challenge.</li>
            <li>first product I have found that helps my makeup stay in place in the Texas heat</li>
            <li>Who knows, maybe those reviews help better prefect the product for future purchasers; in which case I am truly grateful!</li>
            <li>Simple to use and an elegant look after.</li>
            <li>they seem to really have fun, end  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have tried this brand</li>
            <li>This is my first foray into the art of airbrush makeup.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a lot more simple to use as well.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it has different levels of strength depending on your needs.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to use the product, so I had to watch some videos on youtube to learn how to properly apply the makeup.  </li>
            <li>First time using this air brush, tried it once and was content with the results.</li>
            <li>Hands down the most fantastic airbrush makeup I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li>I made sure to clean it after every use and was very careful with it</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t more popular, can&#x27;t wait to try the other darker colors for my kit in the future</li>
            <li>/&gt;The day before we were to leave for KY, probably twenty deep pimples from old acne scars, this wasn&#x27;t my first acid peel, decided to pop threw!!!!</li>
            <li>When applied properly, make-up is long-lasting &amp; gives a near flawless appearance over uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>Takes a little bit of time to get down but one you get the hang of it then its awesome.  </li>
            <li>ok .. have used over one month now.. spray nozzle VERY tricky, works only at full open..</li>
            <li>first learned about makeup airbrush from a commercial but thought it was something for the rich and glamourous.  </li>
            <li>The needle does not spray very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly I must compliment how well made this whole system is.</li>
            <li>but very time consuming..make up breaks out my skin and itches ..</li>
            <li>Is this a real company??????</li>
            <li>Plus being that you have to mix the liquids to put them into the machine you can really customize any shade for any person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You could do your nails, you could do art projects, you could do your whole body.</li>
            <li>To test this out I used my husband as a model and we airbrushed his whole body metallic gold using the Mehron body</li>
            <li>I really like this airbrush kit.  </li>
            <li>I think I may be putting to much on,</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it its a real breeze.  </li>
            <li>peice you use to apply the foundation will stop spraying the foundation on you skin and start spitting it on making you have to get a brush and apply foundation evenly (which defeated the whole purpose of buying</li>
            <li>It is sticky but I haven&#x27;t looked much into that yet</li>
            <li>The compressor works really well</li>
            <li>I did some searching on Amazon and found this kit at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thing I really like about this system is that the compressor is fully adjustable meaning to that you can fully control the air pressure using the knob on the compressor.  </li>
            <li>Im really considering returning.</li>
            <li>Very minimum noise.</li>
            <li>Didnt really like the product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>As you don&#x27;t have much control or variety.</li>
            <li>Really that choice is yours.</li>
            <li>I really like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks much more natural than regular makeup.</li>
            <li>We all can get a professional makeup without paying lots of money, we just need the right tools, and practice, lots of practice.</li>
            <li>will totally recommend this specially for this price its s</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was extremely easy to use, the directions are so simple a 4 yr old could follow them.</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice so far, but it has been easy to use.  </li>
            <li>the make upis very natural looking and gives the skin such a smooth appearance</li>
            <li>but you have to clean the tip of the wamd very gently with a wet q tip or it will get clogged and spray spackle all over your face.</li>
            <li>I do a little work on the side as a part time gig and because I love makeup so much.</li>
            <li>With minimal practice, airbrushing is quite easy to get the hang of.</li>
            <li>my friend bought a different brand, and I picked this one because there were so many different foundations, also it came with blush, bronzer, primer, and cleaner.</li>
            <li>Good makeup,  air compressor doesn&#x27;t work as well after only a few uses..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this company.</li>
            <li>and I had to put the motor on HIGH before anything would come out.</li>
            <li>I think with a little more use it will get easier and faster to apply the makeup.</li>
            <li>Spend a little bit more because you are going to have to buy another one anyways.</li>
            <li>I had a problem with my first one and this company stood behind their product and had amazing service.</li>
            <li>colors are to Light, and  I ordered the color midiun to dark to dark and still they send me the most ligth colors.</li>
            <li>Do note that like with normal makeup, it&#x27;s not for everyone.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal state</li>
            <li>You also can not blend any creams into this, so if you want to conceal with your normal concealer, use it under.</li>
            <li>The entire thing comes apart for cleaning, it is quite easy to put back together as well.</li>
            <li>I do notice the foundations have a slightly yellow or red tint to them depending,  This can easily be neutralized with color correcting primer.  </li>
            <li>only problem I have is finding the right shade.</li>
            <li>I just have an issue with space, where to set it up, since my bathroom is tiny, so I have to have this in the kitchen, so I&#x27;m not using it right now.</li>
            <li>the airbrush itself of course, as well as a long hose, making it super convenient to airbrushing others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trying to get in contact with the company to get a new one</li>
            <li>Got the new gun</li>
            <li>so they sent me a new package-</li>
            <li>I tried the new one</li>
            <li>Hard to keep clean, but I am playing around with using the cleaner and distilled water to figure out the right mixture (it&#x27;s the nature of an airbrush, not this one in particular).</li>
            <li>Completely changed my idea of air brush makeup!</li>
            <li>The instruction manual could use a little work but are easy to follow.</li>
            <li>To clean is also simple and only takes about two minutes after each use.  </li>
            <li>After watching a few YouTube videos and practice it was easy to get the hang of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I learned very quickly after a few videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i seem to go through a lot more toilet paper due to the influx of woman...</li>
            <li>The airbrush coverage is pretty good as well and does not apply thick or heavy.</li>
            <li>A complete makeup system for the glamorous DIVA</li>
            <li>It looks so natural and doesn&#x27;t come off for about 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>I had a different style before and this one is much nicer.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this makeup daily and absolutely looooove it.  </li>
            <li>Wow, what can I say.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>The only downside, is that you cant change your compressor color, (if you care about that sort of thing) and, they don&#x27;t have much of a selection in makeup.</li>
            <li>The quality though far exceeds their lack of choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The quality though far exceeds their lack of choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re out and touch your face wrong say good bye to the party you&#x27;re at, everything will have to come off.  </li>
            <li>Also, if it gets wet, it comes right off.  </li>
            <li>For someone as lazy as I am, I still found it really easy and quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smudged easily and turned very white and runny when it got even a little bit damp.</li>
            <li>I went to our local craft store and replaced with a professional airbrush and am much happier with the final outcome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great little product that I have been using it daily for the past month.  </li>
            <li>I had a few issues with it clogging and breaking but the company replaced the broken pieces which was great</li>
            <li>The actual system is not bad, but its the typical $40-$50 system you can get anywhere.</li>
            <li>I was ready to try airbrush makeup, but since I’m a beginner, I didn’t want to invest too much money into something I am not sure I’d like.  </li>
            <li>The finish is matte, just be careful if you use the pearl shimmer, as it is really concentrated.</li>

            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is, you should be able to press down and back, I cant press down.</li>
            <li>It works well, but hard to clean.</li>
            <li>You do get more foundations for that price, than all the other systems, and their makeup is larger containers, and less expensive than most.</li>

            <li>I found that using water helped some to get used to the feel of the product, but I really think it just takes practicing a few times with the actual product to get used to how much comes on your face and to get a feel for what you actually need for your personal</li>
            <li>My first round I didn&#x27;t do so well, but I washed it off and tried it again</li>
            <li>She watched a few videos on you-tube first</li>
            <li>A previous reviewer said that the foundations were sticky, and this is certainly the case if you do not shake the foundations well before application.</li>
            <li>I find the nozzle a little bigger than the first one.</li>
            <li>So, if you use it, put your machine on low, barely move your lever back and aim farther away from your face, so it isn&#x27;t over whelming!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using his air rusk kit daily for the past few months and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>take turns doing each other make up babbling non sense, laughing, screaming  acting like high school girls,</li>
            <li>Other similar compressors on the market only allow for low, med, and high setting while this compressor is fully adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The makeup was easy to apply and looked GREAT on.</li>
            <li> Came very quick and was packaged very nicely.</li>
            <li> I must say that between the concealer and the airbrush, my face looked amazing</li>
            <li> my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> kit was amazing while it worked.</li>
            <li> Makeup is light but covers great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really wanting to try airbrush makeup because it can leave your skin looking flawless.</li>
            <li> Better off buying a good brand of foundation instead.</li>
            <li> The bronzer that comes with this kit feels kind of sandy on skin</li>
            <li> airbrush gun itself, Is quite nice.</li>
            <li> The Movie Star and  Sand are both very close together, so I could get away with using either of them for foundation, I find mixing them is best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, This set is very affordable and excellent for beginners, and those looking to expand in the airbrush world.</li>
            <li> Plus you can always make your own too.  </li>

            <li> Plus you can always make your own too.  </li>
            <li> and then she just started practicing with her own kit</li>
            <li> The price was right and she is very very happy with it, now i have to order more supplies for her.</li>
            <li> LOVE, an absolute perfect airbrush make-up kit.</li>
            <li> This make up comes off very easily.</li>
            <li> Out of the package, the system is very easy to set up</li>
            <li> The air brush gets clogged very easily compared to another one I have had and the makeup has no staying power even if you set it with a powder finish.</li>
            <li> The makeup also rubs off very easily, it&#x27;s almost like glue when you rub it.  </li>
            <li> I took everything out the box and it was very easy to put together.  </li>
            <li> instructions are very elaborate and easy to understand for even a person who may never have done any kind of make up before.</li>
            <li> More input on how to clean the airbrush would be great.</li>
            <li> The makeup application results are near flawless.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been working perfect so far.</li>
            <li> I must say I have been very impressed with the kit so far.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love love love it!  </li>
            <li> I just wish there was more information on the make up part of the company, but the machine works great and the price is right.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve tried out any type of airbrush system and I must say that I am quite happy with this</li>
            <li> They do peel off rather easy, if you want to make your own airbrush foundation.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better quality makeup in my opinion.</li>
            <li> , I jut wish the makeup would have been better.</li>
            <li> so glad I got Art of Air.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have found that oil-free makeup remover works better than the cleaner.</li>
            <li> Already looking into better gun.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> The art of airbrush make up kit has everything you need and more for your make up routine.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and you get so many extras in your kit.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for a honest review, regardless all thoughts are 100% my own.</li>

            <li> I love this air gun  makeup system.  </li>
            <li> I will be able to cover my skin flaws well.</li>
            <li> I love the concept.</li>
            <li> I have since forcused more on my skin itself.</li>
            <li> My wife love this gift.</li>
            <li> Better day 2.</li>
            <li> Love the foundation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Definitely perfect for someone just starting out!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li> (this kept my hand moving a lot more) and wala</li>
            <li> I love this system and reçcomend it to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> Love the botanical plus.</li>
            <li> I have tried the lumines before and the lumines is a better quality product.</li>
            <li> I love this system.</li>
            <li> I just wish this would have lasted me more than a month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> After days of research on this kit vs Luminess, I decided to go with this kit since it was more affordable and it came with more extras with the kit.  </li>
            <li> The brush is great, the foundation not so much...  </li>
            <li> So instead I use the luminess foundation it worked better</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> While it is definitely a learning curve to the process, I&#x27;m extremely impressed with how well it can cover my imperfections and blemishes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my face looking practically flawless.  </li>
            <li> Sputters spits and takes way way more foundation</li>
            <li> The color smears off with just touching it.</li>
            <li> It does give a more uniform look.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light!</li>
            <li> I love it and my friends love it.</li>
            <li> The product itseld is absolutely wonderful and am hoping that I finally get one that works and doesn&#x27;t break on me.  </li>
            <li> So, I do wish they would use better labels.</li>
            <li> I received this free of charge, for my honest opinion.tsoever.</li>
            <li> I received this free of charge, for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Which came in handy when I took my airbrush apart to clean it.</li>
            <li> The makeup feels light and is very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> The equipment works great and is easy and fast to apply the makeup.  </li>
            <li> it is every bit as good as the higher priced machines .</li>
            <li> Not as good as my first one</li>
            <li> I never wore makeup that often but now this is so easy I wear it more often.</li>
            <li> Love the makeup but comes off really easy of you sweat .</li>
            <li> This kit leaves a flawless finish, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how well it works at such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Feels great and not heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those that are looking for an airbrush system and don&#x27;t want to pay top dollar, this airbrush kit is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It seems really, really easy.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness used prime as return was easy.</li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because it comes off so easily.</li>
            <li> The carrying case makes it so easy to take anywhere</li>
            <li> It is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> the instructions are easy to read and follow&lt;</li>
            <li> Product itself isn&#x27;t easy to use when it comes to using the highlights and bronzer</li>
            <li> but otherwise it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it you can do very quickly.  </li>
            <li> and it comes off easy</li>
            <li> So easy.</li>
            <li> it comes off really easy to remove the needle.  </li>
            <li> did an unboxing video on my youtube channel and have been using this on special occasions, I love the bronzer it smells like coconut.</li>
            <li> May be great on younger skin, not so great on my 47 year old skin.</li>
            <li> The most important part right?!</li>
            <li> Powders are just fine over.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough and the makeup looks great.</li>
            <li> received the product in the mail fairly quickly and was very excited to put it to use.  </li>
            <li> So I looked on Amazon and found this and was super excited!</li>
            <li> Basically you have it all.&lt;br /&gt;You can even purchase colors available separately and use with this system.</li>
            <li> However, the only thing I haven&#x27;t been happy with is the fact that I can&#x27;t find the ingredients of the makeup.  </li>
            <li> machine is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Both were for light skin.</li>
            <li> It just surges and the go light blinks instead of continually humming and pushing air.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> itks important</li>
            <li> They apply so airy, and light, and sit right on top of your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it was for, but everything else went together perfectly and machine works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve faired pretty good on lines/crows feet but have issues with large pores and some age spots.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;m still learning how to integrate my normal skincare routine and using the airbrush system, I know that for times when I want to hide my imperfections I&#x27;ll be using the airbrush system for sure!  </li>
            <li> Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works very well and very easy to use it just takes some practice to learn how to apply it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in airbrush. :-)</li>
            <li> I love this product however, I had to return the first one I bought because on day 28 the motor stopped</li>
            <li> It is totally clean.</li>
            <li> Fun and easy</li>
            <li> so I know how to clean and use and take care of the dang thing</li>
            <li> I studied youtube videos for application tutorials before it arrived, so I tried the techniques I learned and was able to get a very even and smooth finish with the makeup included.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Time consuming to clean</li>
            <li> The compressor is super nice as you can manually adjust the speed, vs a high, med, lo setting.</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I love this!</li>
            <li> Amazing I cut my regular makeup time almost in half and it looks flawless</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first 2 days, now its like the airpump only works 1/2 way...</li>
            <li> colors also are amazingly close to my natural color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full adjustable as opposed to 3 set speed like the others that I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> While i don&#x27;t think I would ever use the darker foundations, I suppose it&#x27;s a nice additional for the professional makeup artist who needs a varairty of shades.  </li>
            <li> However it did come with PAGES of text telling me how much I would love how it made me look.  </li>
            <li> this is a good deal, however on the third use</li>
            <li> This company is super sweet and this brand</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a great deal, you get all of this for a fraction of the cost that other machines will cost you.</li>
            <li> also it is quick once yuo get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> Delivered quick.</li>
            <li> If water touch your face the make up would fade away quickly leaving spots with no make up.</li>
            <li> Started sputtering very first time using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but overall I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> The machine itself is very durable and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was really intimidated by this when I first got it, but after using it now three or four times I feel as if I get better each time I use</li>
            <li> The first time I tried, I looked like a clown!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried, I looked like a clown!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel that this is worth $100 considering the device broke so easily</li>
            <li> This kit is perfect for any person that is really wanting to start testing out airbrush makeup but doesn&#x27;t want to spend thousands of dollars on a more expensive machine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is well worth it..</li>
            <li> 1st try was a success.</li>
            <li> After seeing the reviews I figured it was worth a try.....</li>
            <li> I am going to try another brand of makeup to see if it was worth the purchase</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this airbrush system and actually think its better than the luminess system that I had before.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> However, the two darker foundations unknown  and suntan glo were actually too dark for my best friend who is Persian, and has a gorgeous olive/tan skin tone.</li>
            <li> I mostly used youtube to understand how to use it, back bubble, and clean it.</li>
            <li> I had my face airbrushed for a wedding the other weekend and loved the results</li>
            <li> I saw the Art of Air kit and decided the price was right.  </li>
            <li> It takes practice to learn to put in on just right</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t really use it, takes more time to then then putting make up on normally</li>
            <li> but I was still able able to hide those capillaries and my dark circles under my eyes without feeling like I have makeup caked on my face.  </li>
            <li> Very professional and easy to use on myself.  </li>
            <li> but when I tried this I was delightfully surprised at how easy it was to use and the results that I got.  </li>
            <li> Really depends on your own personal skin type.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To mix, I found a great tutorial online that shows how to properly mix you need to put your desired shades in the &amp;#34;gun&amp;#34; and to cover the needle to block air and to press on the lever so that you see it kinda bubble up and repeat a couple of times and allow it to go back to</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean and what a difference between air brushing and using regular makeup!!</li>
            <li> It is dual action, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My wife is in school for cosmetology and has been working with some very accomplished people in the industry.  </li>
            <li> If you a MUA just starting out this Baby is super inexpensive and easy to use for your kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Machine was ok but the makeup definitely left something to be desired.</li>
            <li> It was my first ever try at airbrush makeup</li>
            <li> But I still love everything else overall!</li>
            <li> This is my first time owning something like this.</li>
            <li> Gun splattered  and stopped up first use.</li>
            <li> First off let me state that I am a freelance makeup artist.</li>
            <li> Hot days do not make a difference.</li>
            <li> First time user.</li>
            <li> I most recently went to an outdoor summer wedding in SoCal and my makeup lasted all night, even after dancing!  </li>
            <li> First 2-3 days a challenge.</li>
            <li> first product I have found that helps my makeup stay in place in the Texas heat</li>
            <li> Who knows, maybe those reviews help better prefect the product for future purchasers; in which case I am truly grateful!</li>
            <li> Simple to use and an elegant look after.</li>
            <li> they seem to really have fun, end  </li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have tried this brand</li>
            <li> This is my first foray into the art of airbrush makeup.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot more simple to use as well.  </li>
            <li> and I love that it has different levels of strength depending on your needs.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to use the product, so I had to watch some videos on youtube to learn how to properly apply the makeup.  </li>
            <li> First time using this air brush, tried it once and was content with the results.</li>
            <li> Hands down the most fantastic airbrush makeup I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> I made sure to clean it after every use and was very careful with it</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t more popular, can&#x27;t wait to try the other darker colors for my kit in the future</li>
            <li> /&gt;The day before we were to leave for KY, probably twenty deep pimples from old acne scars, this wasn&#x27;t my first acid peel, decided to pop threw!!!!</li>
            <li> When applied properly, make-up is long-lasting &amp; gives a near flawless appearance over uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit of time to get down but one you get the hang of it then its awesome.  </li>
            <li> ok .. have used over one month now.. spray nozzle VERY tricky, works only at full open..</li>
            <li> first learned about makeup airbrush from a commercial but thought it was something for the rich and glamourous.  </li>
            <li> The needle does not spray very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly I must compliment how well made this whole system is.</li>
            <li> but very time consuming..make up breaks out my skin and itches ..</li>
            <li> Is this a real company??????</li>
            <li> Plus being that you have to mix the liquids to put them into the machine you can really customize any shade for any person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You could do your nails, you could do art projects, you could do your whole body.</li>
            <li> To test this out I used my husband as a model and we airbrushed his whole body metallic gold using the Mehron body</li>
            <li> I really like this airbrush kit.  </li>
            <li> I think I may be putting to much on,</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it its a real breeze.  </li>
            <li> peice you use to apply the foundation will stop spraying the foundation on you skin and start spitting it on making you have to get a brush and apply foundation evenly (which defeated the whole purpose of buying</li>
            <li> It is sticky but I haven&#x27;t looked much into that yet</li>
            <li> The compressor works really well</li>
            <li> I did some searching on Amazon and found this kit at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing I really like about this system is that the compressor is fully adjustable meaning to that you can fully control the air pressure using the knob on the compressor.  </li>
            <li> Im really considering returning.</li>
            <li> Very minimum noise.</li>
            <li> Didnt really like the product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> As you don&#x27;t have much control or variety.</li>
            <li> Really that choice is yours.</li>
            <li> I really like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks much more natural than regular makeup.</li>
            <li> We all can get a professional makeup without paying lots of money, we just need the right tools, and practice, lots of practice.</li>
            <li> will totally recommend this specially for this price its s</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was extremely easy to use, the directions are so simple a 4 yr old could follow them.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice so far, but it has been easy to use.  </li>
            <li> the make upis very natural looking and gives the skin such a smooth appearance</li>
            <li> but you have to clean the tip of the wamd very gently with a wet q tip or it will get clogged and spray spackle all over your face.</li>
            <li> I do a little work on the side as a part time gig and because I love makeup so much.</li>
            <li> With minimal practice, airbrushing is quite easy to get the hang of.</li>
            <li> my friend bought a different brand, and I picked this one because there were so many different foundations, also it came with blush, bronzer, primer, and cleaner.</li>
            <li> Good makeup,  air compressor doesn&#x27;t work as well after only a few uses..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this company.</li>
            <li> and I had to put the motor on HIGH before anything would come out.</li>
            <li> I think with a little more use it will get easier and faster to apply the makeup.</li>
            <li> Spend a little bit more because you are going to have to buy another one anyways.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my first one and this company stood behind their product and had amazing service.</li>
            <li> colors are to Light, and  I ordered the color midiun to dark to dark and still they send me the most ligth colors.</li>
            <li> Do note that like with normal makeup, it&#x27;s not for everyone.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal state</li>
            <li> You also can not blend any creams into this, so if you want to conceal with your normal concealer, use it under.</li>
            <li> The entire thing comes apart for cleaning, it is quite easy to put back together as well.</li>
            <li> I do notice the foundations have a slightly yellow or red tint to them depending,  This can easily be neutralized with color correcting primer.  </li>
            <li> only problem I have is finding the right shade.</li>
            <li> I just have an issue with space, where to set it up, since my bathroom is tiny, so I have to have this in the kitchen, so I&#x27;m not using it right now.</li>
            <li> the airbrush itself of course, as well as a long hose, making it super convenient to airbrushing others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trying to get in contact with the company to get a new one</li>
            <li> Got the new gun</li>
            <li> so they sent me a new package-</li>
            <li> I tried the new one</li>
            <li> Hard to keep clean, but I am playing around with using the cleaner and distilled water to figure out the right mixture (it&#x27;s the nature of an airbrush, not this one in particular).</li>
            <li> Completely changed my idea of air brush makeup!</li>
            <li> The instruction manual could use a little work but are easy to follow.</li>
            <li> To clean is also simple and only takes about two minutes after each use.  </li>
            <li> After watching a few YouTube videos and practice it was easy to get the hang of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I learned very quickly after a few videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i seem to go through a lot more toilet paper due to the influx of woman...</li>
            <li> The airbrush coverage is pretty good as well and does not apply thick or heavy.</li>
            <li> A complete makeup system for the glamorous DIVA</li>
            <li> It looks so natural and doesn&#x27;t come off for about 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> I had a different style before and this one is much nicer.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this makeup daily and absolutely looooove it.  </li>
            <li> Wow, what can I say.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> The only downside, is that you cant change your compressor color, (if you care about that sort of thing) and, they don&#x27;t have much of a selection in makeup.</li>
            <li> The quality though far exceeds their lack of choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The quality though far exceeds their lack of choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re out and touch your face wrong say good bye to the party you&#x27;re at, everything will have to come off.  </li>
            <li> Also, if it gets wet, it comes right off.  </li>
            <li> For someone as lazy as I am, I still found it really easy and quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smudged easily and turned very white and runny when it got even a little bit damp.</li>
            <li> I went to our local craft store and replaced with a professional airbrush and am much happier with the final outcome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great little product that I have been using it daily for the past month.  </li>
            <li> I had a few issues with it clogging and breaking but the company replaced the broken pieces which was great</li>
            <li> The actual system is not bad, but its the typical $40-$50 system you can get anywhere.</li>
            <li> I was ready to try airbrush makeup, but since I’m a beginner, I didn’t want to invest too much money into something I am not sure I’d like.  </li>
            <li> The finish is matte, just be careful if you use the pearl shimmer, as it is really concentrated.</li>

            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is, you should be able to press down and back, I cant press down.</li>
            <li> It works well, but hard to clean.</li>
            <li> You do get more foundations for that price, than all the other systems, and their makeup is larger containers, and less expensive than most.</li>

            <li> I found that using water helped some to get used to the feel of the product, but I really think it just takes practicing a few times with the actual product to get used to how much comes on your face and to get a feel for what you actually need for your personal</li>
            <li> My first round I didn&#x27;t do so well, but I washed it off and tried it again</li>
            <li> She watched a few videos on you-tube first</li>
            <li> A previous reviewer said that the foundations were sticky, and this is certainly the case if you do not shake the foundations well before application.</li>
            <li> I find the nozzle a little bigger than the first one.</li>
            <li> So, if you use it, put your machine on low, barely move your lever back and aim farther away from your face, so it isn&#x27;t over whelming!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using his air rusk kit daily for the past few months and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> take turns doing each other make up babbling non sense, laughing, screaming  acting like high school girls,</li>
            <li> Other similar compressors on the market only allow for low, med, and high setting while this compressor is fully adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This method of applicantion has done better than any other I have tired and I like the water based foundation</li>
            <li> And much less expensive than a popular L brand.</li>
            <li> Take care of it and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This makeup is quite long lasting</li>
            <li> It takes a very long time to get my entire face covered.</li>
            <li> This makeup left my skin dry and wrinkly.</li>
            <li> I have even bought a different brand of airbrush foundation and did the same as I did with the other colors.</li>
            <li> Turned 50 recently and my past make-up habits are just not working so well anymore  and don&#x27;t want the old lady cakey makeup look.  </li>
            <li> Been thinking about getting one for a long time  </li>
            <li> cleaning process is to long.</li>
            <li> This product is above and beyond what was expected.</li>
            <li> Been waiting for this for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cords are too long and take up a lot&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Did not cover up pores or minor imperfections.</li>
            <li> I ended up using fourth of the bottle for one use and quickly blending with my hand because it randomly spits.</li>
            <li> and I was up and running in less than 5 minutes - barely any assembly required.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to do it!</li>
            <li> Do not pay extra for this makeup with the system.... find one for $50 and get other makeup.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item 5 weeks ago and the little pull back nob used to pull back the needle and let the liquid spray out broke 2 days ago.</li>
            <li> The makeup was too dry for my skin type.  </li>
            <li> One little dribble while you&#x27;re drinking water, and you have a streak down your chin where the makeup completely came off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a super expensive system.</li>
            <li> The airbrush came with a broken trigger, and by the next day a new one was here.</li>
            <li> But the makeup not so much, if you hardly even touch your face or rub your eyes it comes off in little flakes.</li>
            <li> I also like the papaya for a little extra color to my face.  </li>
            <li> It was grammatical rough and pieces part of tips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much into makeup</li>
            <li> not very convienant.</li>
            <li> Easier to use than I had expected.</li>
            <li> worked as expected.</li>
            <li> And takes only a few minutes</li>
            <li> of Air comes with a pamphlet containing minimal instructions, also a parts list.</li>
            <li> I am older and my foundation was seeking into my skin, making my wrinkles appear worse, problems solved with the air brush foundation.</li>
            <li> (I have heard other systems makeup that lets you use creams over it, but I am not positive at this time.)  </li>
            <li> The other thing is there is  LITERALLY NO INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH PRODUCT...</li>
            <li> because this was money well spent!</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t have experience with other airbrush makeup</li>
            <li> They have no eye-shadows, nor any other blush, bronzer, or highlighters.</li>
            <li> They have no eye-shadows, nor any other blush, bronzer, or highlighters.</li>
            <li> Compressor did not work from the start and the item came with very few instructions for actual assembly and use.  </li>
            <li> I have mixed a few drops of this one and that one, airbrush makeup that came with it, and am still having trouble.</li>
            <li> I could hardly tell if the make up was coming out properly.</li>
            <li> the only complaint is i dont get mirror time anymore</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> i like the air brush but the make up is not worth it.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> After sitting a few days, certain colors in particular have their pigments settle and separate from the base.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have it down 100% yet</li>
            <li> (I used watered down acrylic paint in it, for nail art...</li>
            <li> You can use other brands in this machine, so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> You can use other brands in this machine, so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> I suggest any other airbrush machine other than this!!</li>
            <li> Got less than 10 uses out of the thing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it as yet because I&#x27;m not real sure how.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quicker and less mess than&lt;br /&gt;bottled</li>
            <li> The key is small circles, and at least 6 inches from your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew that she wanted an airbrush makeup system, so I purchased this one after doing a little research.  </li>
            <li> Meaning if you get sweaty, or little water droplets fall on your face, you&#x27;ll look like you sprinkled milk on your face.  </li>
            <li> and I sat down and practiced!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now and have no complaints</li>
            <li> I have been using it weekly for a few months now and have not had any issues.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few times to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> but I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> You know there is always a few duds in an abundance of anything...</li>
            <li> It took a few times to get the hang of and learn</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy on the skin.  </li>
            <li> itks great1 took me a few times to lget it rightl.</li>
            <li> You can buy art of air online in quite a few places)</li>
            <li> So no rubbing into your skin ,and it feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> Its fairly small, I am not sure how it compares to other airbrush systems compressors as I&#x27;ve never tried them.  </li>
            <li> I have a few small capillaries that causes redness around my nose</li>
            <li> And the airbrush is to much to be cleaning all the time, its bad, I not using to offen.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how it was well rated at all.</li>
            <li> NO MORE....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to get it even and not have it look overdone.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever wear make up, but when I do, I impress my husband, family, friends, and sometimes myself.</li>
            <li> and i cry just a little and with that i had left a big spot on my chick with out make up it looked horrible.</li>
            <li> can somebody tell me why the make up is so delicate and fade away with the water.</li>
            <li> Smelled a little weird</li>
            <li> Cleaning is a little difficult.</li>
            <li> Not happy, the.</li>
            <li> I would advise staying away from this &amp;#34; professional&amp;#34; rip-off.</li>
            <li> The make up is poor quality.</li>
            <li> The other bad thing is this makeup runs under moisture.  </li>
            <li> It is seriously changing the way I do makeup!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed, even moreso because I&#x27;m just outside the 30 day period for getting a replacement unit.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bee difficult to learn to use for me since I&#x27;ve never used this type of makeup kit before, but it is well made</li>
            <li> Difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> a word of caution  don&#x27;t use a silicone based primer for water based makeup it will seperate and make matters worse!.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT IS DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE AIR BRUSH</li>
            <li> Looked to complicated..</li>
            <li> the lever on the gun broke off leaving it useless.</li>
            <li> but this procedure is very expensive....</li>
            <li> /&gt; Read some of the bad reviews, and I feel bad for them because my experience went so well...</li>
            <li> Products specifically are really bad</li>
            <li> The bad thing about this system is the makeup.  </li>
            <li> if it doesn&#x27;t crap out on you.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not an issue if you&#x27;re like me and hate searching for parts to assemble.  </li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m crazy about it!!</li>
            <li> My skin looked awful and  </li>
            <li> no make up contents via the awful website, call</li>
            <li> The makeup is the worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The needle does not spray very well. It takes a very long time to get my entire face covered.</li>
            <li> great for post mortem use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using his air rusk kit daily for the past few months and absolutely love it. I love it and I get alot compliments from friends.</li>
            <li> Machine was ok but the makeup definitely left something to be desired. I couldn&#x27;t get the makeup to set and stay. It smudged easily and turned very white and runny when it got even a little bit damp. I actually ended up returning this machine and got the photo finish air brush kit. It&#x27;s much better quality makeup in my opinion. I gave it 2 stars because the machine and bag were both good, I jut wish the makeup would have been better.</li>
            <li> Great Product Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Been thinking about getting one for a long time  so glad I got Art of Air.</li>
            <li> Came very quick and was packaged very nicely. Been using it for couple months and I love it. Hard to keep clean, but I am playing around with using the cleaner and distilled water to figure out the right mixture (it&#x27;s the nature of an airbrush, not this one in particular). I have found that oil-free makeup remover works better than the cleaner. It did come with a makeshift instruction manual but wasn&#x27;t quite as helpful as hoped. It was grammatical rough and pieces part of tips. More input on how to clean the airbrush would be great. I mostly used youtube to understand how to use it, back bubble, and clean it.</li>
            <li> My skin looked awful and  the up keep of the system was  to  time consuming</li>
            <li> Brush sprays when it feels like it. Already looking into better gun. It is totally clean.</li>
            <li> Not happy, the. colors are to Light, and  I ordered the color midiun to dark to dark and still they send me the most ligth colors. And the airbrush is to much to be cleaning all the time, its bad, I not using to offen.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the hang of it.I just wish there was more information on the make up part of the company, but the machine works great and the price is right. it is every bit as good as the higher priced machines . I love it</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:84a84f91bb73880c106a76ef1da8cc1c]] A complete makeup system for the glamorous DIVA look.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly I must compliment how well made this whole system is. The art of airbrush make up kit has everything you need and more for your make up routine. The machine itself is very durable and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are very elaborate and easy to understand for even a person who may never have done any kind of make up before. It was my first ever try at airbrush makeup and I must say I never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;The gun/ brush is very smooth and the spray is very nicely spread out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit includes 6 shades of foundation for you to mix and match and make the color that matches yours perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Then there is an anti aging primer, blush, shimmer and bronzer. Basically you have it all.&lt;br /&gt;You can even purchase colors available separately and use with this system. Your eye makeup too can be done with this.&lt;br /&gt;This is a water based system and you can use any water based makeup foundations in this.&lt;br /&gt;I will totally recommend this specially for this price its s great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can watch the video for a comprehensive look at the product and its features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by- Shazia</li>
            <li> ok .. have used over one month now.. spray nozzle VERY tricky, works only at full open..no variable control... cleaning is a must every use, alcohol helps.. but very time consuming..make up breaks out my skin and itches ..what is in it?? no list on makeup of contents, one page xeroxed instructions, no make up contents via the awful website, call and you get an machine.. with no return call.. Is this a real company?????? my experience says maybe not!  I would advise staying away from this &amp;#34; professional&amp;#34; rip-off.</li>
            <li> I got to pick a makeup airbrush kit for mothers day, and I picked this one. there are several out there that seem to be comparable. my friend bought a different brand, and I picked this one because there were so many different foundations, also it came with blush, bronzer, primer, and cleaner. I didn&#x27;t care for the shimmer glow stuff, and the blush ended up being the same color as the foundation. But I still love everything else overall! I am so excited to perfect my technique. It seems really, really easy. We&#x27;ll see how I look out in the sunlight! :D I also use a translucent powder over airbrush to set it. I&#x27;m not much into makeup and I stopped wearing foundation probably 15-20 years ago bc its so cakey looking. I am in love with this airbrush kit! I will be buying blush soon also.</li>
            <li> Excellent service AND PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the results of my airbrush kit.  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean.  The makeup application results are near flawless. I love it.  However, the only thing I haven&#x27;t been happy with is the fact that I can&#x27;t find the ingredients of the makeup.  If anybody has been successful finding them, please email me: midnyght@myway.com .  Thank you in advance for the email.&lt;br /&gt;I do makeup for models and some of them are asking about ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright I guess I don&#x27;t really use it, takes more time to then then putting make up on normally</li>
            <li> This is my first time owning something like this. There is definitely a learning curve but once you get it, it&#x27;s beautiful. I&#x27;ve worn the make-up all day at work, didn&#x27;t even need a touch up! I&#x27;m used to having to basically remove all of my make-up and redo it halfway through my day, with this there wasn&#x27;t even a spot that needed it. I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of the product too. The instruction manual could use a little work but are easy to follow.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed. Gun splattered  and stopped up first use. I cleaned and worked with it... (I&#x27;ve had others) not what I thought.</li>
            <li> First off let me state that I am a freelance makeup artist. I do a little work on the side as a part time gig and because I love makeup so much. I&#x27;ve been really wanting to try airbrush makeup because it can leave your skin looking flawless. Plus being that you have to mix the liquids to put them into the machine you can really customize any shade for any person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine is fabulous. It came very quickly, was packaged beautifully and you get so many extras in your kit. Along with foundation you get blush, bronzer, a highlight and a anti aging primer. This kit is perfect for any person that is really wanting to start testing out airbrush makeup but doesn&#x27;t want to spend thousands of dollars on a more expensive machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was extremely easy to use, the directions are so simple a 4 yr old could follow them. The neat thing is that you could do all kinds of things with this airbrush machine. You could do your nails, you could do art projects, you could do your whole body. To test this out I used my husband as a model and we airbrushed his whole body metallic gold using the Mehron body paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great deal, you get all of this for a fraction of the cost that other machines will cost you. I highly recommend it. I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for a honest review, regardless all thoughts are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Good makeup,  air compressor doesn&#x27;t work as well after only a few uses..</li>
            <li> This unit does not work at all , the make up will not spray unless the pump is at highest setting and then it splatters. Tried cleaning and that did not help so sending back. Thank goodness used prime as return was easy.</li>
            <li> I really like this airbrush kit.  The equipment works great and is easy and fast to apply the makeup.  The colors that are included are a good range of colors o that I can mix different shades to match my skin tone.  I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now and have no complaints</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice so far, but it has been easy to use.  It does give me a flawless complexion and yet feels like I am not wearing any foundation.  I think with a little more use it will get easier and faster to apply the makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and wish I would have saved my $100. It&#x27;s really hard to get it even and not have it look overdone. I am 58 with good skin and not alot of wrinkles, but I just don&#x27;t have the touch I guess. I could hardly tell if the make up was coming out properly. The other thing is there is  LITERALLY NO INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH PRODUCT...NOTHING..NADA AND BELIEVE ME I SEARCHED ONLINE. Not even a proper video on youtube. How do you use the primer??? Why no instructions? Anyone want to buy it from me for 1/2 price? I only used it 4 times and I give up!</li>
            <li> I love it. It looks so natural and doesn&#x27;t come off for about 24 hrs. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and I can&#x27;t get enough. Hot days do not make a difference. Its awesome. :)</li>
            <li> I love this air gun  makeup system.  So easy to use and it is well worth it..lots of product that will last months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used it 3 times and learning to mix colors for under eyes and for blush . guess there is a video on line that I can watch just have done so  yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bee difficult to learn to use for me since I&#x27;ve never used this type of makeup kit before, but it is well made and I&#x27;m hoping once I get the hang of it I will be able to cover my skin flaws well.</li>
            <li> I love the concept. It does what is says. After watching a few YouTube videos and practice it was easy to get the hang of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Aunt and Uncle&#x27;s 50th Wedding Annaversary Cellebration we coming up. I thought that I had enough to time to do an acid peel on my face and all of the peeling and such would be over with. Things were going as planned until I forgot to wear any sunblock, I had just bought three different types of 30 block, and went to check on my garden.&lt;br /&gt;The day before we were to leave for KY, probably twenty deep pimples from old acne scars, this wasn&#x27;t my first acid peel, decided to pop threw!!!! You have to finish popping them, with the correct tool, or they will just keep leaking! I was in tears and almost canceled!&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I had already ordered some really good concealer from Amazon and I sat down and practiced! I must say that between the concealer and the airbrush, my face looked amazing considering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is finding the right shade. I have mixed a few drops of this one and that one, airbrush makeup that came with it, and am still having trouble. I have since not needed the concealer underneath as I did in the beginning. I have even bought a different brand of airbrush foundation and did the same as I did with the other colors. Both were for light skin. The same results 😁.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not given up!!!! I think I may be putting to much on, etc... It could be several things. I have since forcused more on my skin itself. I don&#x27;t have to leave my house often so now is the time to do that while I can. This came threw for me in front of a lot of family, a lot that I had not seen in years. They had no idea what was going on under my airbrushed foundation!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very awesome product and it is exactly what I am looking for and expect from makeup airbrush kit.  I have been using it weekly for a few months now and have not had any issues.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My wife love this gift.</li>
            <li> The machine is great. Works perfect. My only recommendation is to try different brand of makeup. This make up comes off very easily. If it rains, expect spots to come off. If you rest your chin in your hand while sitting at your desk, expect the makeup to come off. Also, as some reviewers said, it does not come with installation instructions. You basically have to figure it out. There&#x27;s one metal part i didn&#x27;t use. I&#x27;m not sure what it was for, but everything else went together perfectly and machine works fine. I&#x27;ve had it for several months.</li>
            <li> First time user. Fun and easy</li>
            <li> nothing great about it. not very convienant. cleaning process is to long.</li>
            <li> Works very well and very easy to use it just takes some practice to learn how to apply it. Just do not over do it...</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first 2 days, now its like the airpump only works 1/2 way...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother for mothers day.  She loves it so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Easier to use than I had expected. Completely changed my idea of air brush makeup! Where can I get refills?</li>
            <li> Best product ever. Smelled a little weird but golly I loved the thing. Had all my friends lined up to get their makeup done and then the thing breaks 😣 I&#x27;ve airbrushed before with cake decorating so I know how to clean and use and take care of the dang thing but it was an electrical problem with the air compressor itself! It just surges and the go light blinks instead of continually humming and pushing air. Trying to get in contact with the company to get a new one but that&#x27;s such a hassle 😣 great product if it doesn&#x27;t crap out on you. Got less than 10 uses out of the thing. Might hook it up to my cake airbrusher</li>
            <li> Quality airbrush mechanism and compressor. 1st try was a success. Easy to use, would recommend!</li>
            <li> Like this  airbrush machine</li>
            <li> My niece loves this,and it is much better than the expensive ones</li>
            <li> The price was right and she is very very happy with it, now i have to order more supplies for her.LOL</li>
            <li> I was ready to try airbrush makeup, but since I’m a beginner, I didn’t want to invest too much money into something I am not sure I’d like.  I saw the Art of Air kit and decided the price was right.  Out of the package, the system is very easy to set up and I was up and running in less than 5 minutes - barely any assembly required.  I studied youtube videos for application tutorials before it arrived, so I tried the techniques I learned and was able to get a very even and smooth finish with the makeup included.  I have a few small capillaries that causes redness around my nose but this makeup’s coverage is great.  The makeup feels like but I was still able able to hide those capillaries and my dark circles under my eyes without feeling like I have makeup caked on my face.  Airbrush makeup is incredibly natural-looking and best of all, does not budge!  I most recently went to an outdoor summer wedding in SoCal and my makeup lasted all night, even after dancing!  I got compliments that night about how good my skin looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note, be sure you thoroughly shake the bottles of foundation!  After sitting a few days, certain colors in particular have their pigments settle and separate from the base.  A previous reviewer said that the foundations were sticky, and this is certainly the case if you do not shake the foundations well before application.</li>
            <li> I had a few issues with it clogging and breaking but the company replaced the broken pieces which was great so I am back in business to use it again.</li>
            <li> First 2-3 days a challenge. Watched a video. Better day 2. Love the foundation. No. Yuck if I touch my face.</li>
            <li> Amazing I cut my regular makeup time almost in half and it looks flawless I am soooo happy I can&#x27;t wait until I get more makeup clients to use it on</li>
            <li> I was able to use the sprayer which was not as difficult as I thought it would be.  The makeup was too dry for my skin type.  Had to send it back.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because it comes off so easily. One little dribble while you&#x27;re drinking water, and you have a streak down your chin where the makeup completely came off.</li>
            <li> The air brush splatters from time to time. The make up is poor quality. I use dinar make up or luminess mack up in it now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I just don&#x27;t have it down 100% yet</li>
            <li> I never wore makeup that often but now this is so easy I wear it more often. Love it!</li>
            <li> Definitely perfect for someone just starting out! The airbrush came with a broken trigger, and by the next day a new one was here. This kit leaves a flawless finish, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how well it works at such a cheap price. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in airbrush. :-)</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!  first product I have found that helps my makeup stay in place in the Texas heat</li>
            <li> Great product. Looks beautiful on my clients and easy to use. And the price is awesome for what all you get! Best deal I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li> bought for my daughters and they are very pleased</li>
            <li> So happy with this product. It took me a few times to get the hang of it but now I&#x27;m crazy about it!!</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I love this! It is seriously changing the way I do makeup! I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to do it!</li>
            <li> I had a different style before and this one is much nicer.  The carrying case makes it so easy to take anywhere you go.  I never take it out of the case, no even when I use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to use for a wedding but I use it everyday. I will not go back to using regular makeup. It&#x27;s fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love it!! I hardly ever wear make up, but when I do, I impress my husband, family, friends, and sometimes myself. We all can get a professional makeup without paying lots of money, we just need the right tools, and practice, lots of practice.</li>
            <li> Ok! so let me start with: I am an Personal Trainer. I have no education in cosmo....I had my face airbrushed for a wedding the other weekend and loved the results (also that it stays on forever!) but this procedure is very expensive.... So I looked on Amazon and found this and was super excited! After seeing the reviews I figured it was worth a try.....and I am so glad that I did it! This product is above and beyond what was expected. I love love love it!  I am no expert in quality but I can say this...&lt;br /&gt;- It is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- the instructions are easy to read and follow&lt;br /&gt;- the make up sets beautifully on ones skin and face&lt;br /&gt;- the applications is takes no time AT ALL&lt;br /&gt;- the make upis very natural looking and gives the skin such a smooth appearance&lt;br /&gt; Read some of the bad reviews, and I feel bad for them because my experience went so well... You know there is always a few duds in an abundance of anything... Who knows, maybe those reviews help better prefect the product for future purchasers; in which case I am truly grateful! because this was money well spent!</li>
            <li> I have been using this makeup daily and absolutely looooove it.  It took a few times to get the hang of and learn but once you get the hang of it its a real breeze.  I posted some videos on youtube, search &#x27;airbrush makeup by brenda&#x27; Awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this system for about a month now and love making myself beautiful with this.  My girlfriends come over on Friday night and we take turns using this.  It&#x27;s easy enough and the makeup looks great.</li>
            <li> I will never not wear airbrush makeup again</li>
            <li> Difficult to use.  Not even</li>
            <li> The actual system is not bad, but its the typical $40-$50 system you can get anywhere. The makeup is the worst. Its sticky and nasty. I am sticking to the MAC airbrush makeup. Do not pay extra for this makeup with the system.... find one for $50 and get other makeup.</li>
            <li> Love the makeup but comes off really easy of you sweat . The colors are beautiful. The machine sprays great. Is great to try and see if you like airbrush</li>
            <li> The air compressor and it&#x27;s self work great. But the makeup not so much, if you hardly even touch your face or rub your eyes it comes off in little flakes. The compressor was great but I&#x27;d recommend a different brand of the airbrush makeup</li>
            <li> My wife is in school for cosmetology and has been working with some very accomplished people in the industry.  I knew that she wanted an airbrush makeup system, so I purchased this one after doing a little research.  She said she loved it and it doesn&#x27;t clog.  That&#x27;s all I needed to hear.</li>
            <li> Been waiting for this for a long time. Not as good as my first one but it will do. I find the nozzle a little bigger than the first one. Simple to use and an elegant look after.</li>
            <li> I just got this and used it. I absolutely LOVE it. Super easy to use. My first round I didn&#x27;t do so well, but I washed it off and tried it again (this kept my hand moving a lot more) and wala my skin looks amazing. I tried the foundation, highlighter and bronzer. All are awesome. My skins is not sticky as some people stated. I am older and my foundation was seeking into my skin, making my wrinkles appear worse, problems solved with the air brush foundation. I HIGHLY recommend it. I also have to add I had a problem with my first one and this company stood behind their product and had amazing service. For the price, it&#x27;s a winner across the board!</li>
            <li> I love this product !! Once u get the hang of it my makeup is done in 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I like this but the knob you press for the spray to work is broke. It just flops back and forth. What should I do?</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations. I love this system and reçcomend it to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> Turned 50 recently and my past make-up habits are just not working so well anymore  and don&#x27;t want the old lady cakey makeup look.  I&#x27;ve faired pretty good on lines/crows feet but have issues with large pores and some age spots.  Standard makeup including mineral powder seems to settle in my pores or look cakey but I still have oily skin and am prone to break-outs (go figure on that one).  This method of applicantion has done better than any other I have tired and I like the water based foundation also it is quick once yuo get the hang of it.  I have found that applying a water based primer before airbrushing mades a difference too but a word of caution  don&#x27;t use a silicone based primer for water based makeup it will seperate and make matters worse!.</li>
            <li> The air brush part of this order is great, however the makeup is sticky and when applied around my eyes it shows wrinkles to the max. I am going to try another brand of makeup to see if it was worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Hands down the most fantastic airbrush makeup I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Feels great and not heavy on my skin. Love the botanical plus. Thank you Art of Air.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this airbrush system and actually think its better than the luminess system that I had before.  Do note that these airbrush systems need to be cleaned after each use to prevent clogging.  Remember it&#x27;s a tool and needs to be maintained.  Take care of it and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described, shipping on time.</li>
            <li> She loves it very much!!!! I have told everyone about it!!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible product. It was embarrassing to use. It becomes blotchy after a while. and then the airbrush broke. Spend a little bit more because you are going to have to buy another one anyways. I am not sure how it was well rated at all. Did not even last 1 month. Products specifically are really bad</li>
            <li> Very happy with this system! It does take some practice but the results are beautiful. When applied properly, make-up is long-lasting &amp; gives a near flawless appearance over uneven skin tone. Customer service was promt &amp; fair. I highly recommend this company.</li>
            <li> I have tried the lumines before and the lumines is a better quality product. Things that I did not like about this product:&lt;br /&gt;The blush had no color&lt;br /&gt;The cords are too long and take up a lot&lt;br /&gt;  of space on my counter.&lt;br /&gt;The peice you use to apply the foundation will stop spraying the foundation on you skin and start spitting it on making you have to get a brush and apply foundation evenly (which defeated the whole purpose of buying the product)&lt;br /&gt;The compressor looks out-dated.</li>
            <li> It works well, but hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I love this system. Looks much more natural than regular makeup. Goes on smooth. And much less expensive than a popular L brand. I had to combine two shades to get my match, but only took 3 times and got it. I have recommended this to several of my closest friends!</li>
            <li> The air brush gets clogged very easily compared to another one I have had and the makeup has no staying power even if you set it with a powder finish. Hate this!!! Going in the trash!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Upon seeing my issue I was contacted by the company and offered a replacement airbrush gun since my product was still under warranty. Got the new gun and it&#x27;s been working perfect so far. So happy this was offered as I really do love this airbrush system! Updating my review and upping the stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit was amazing while it worked. I purchased this item 5 weeks ago and the little pull back nob used to pull back the needle and let the liquid spray out broke 2 days ago. The makeup was easy to apply and looked GREAT on. I just wish this would have lasted me more than a month. I don&#x27;t really feel that this is worth $100 considering the device broke so easily and I babied it! I made sure to clean it after every use and was very careful with it and it still broke after using it only 4 days a week for just over 4 weeks. I&#x27;m very disappointed, even moreso because I&#x27;m just outside the 30 day period for getting a replacement unit. I can no longer use this at all as the needle no longer retracts meaning the foundation won&#x27;t spray out anymore. If this lasted longer I would totally recommend it and even give it a 5 star rating, however with this breaking within 1 month using it I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover redness, have experimented with all shades. Started sputtering very first time using.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> With all the recent tv commercials on airbrush makeup I just wanted to give it a try.  After days of research on this kit vs Luminess, I decided to go with this kit since it was more affordable and it came with more extras with the kit.  I must say I have been very impressed with the kit so far.  No problems with the machinery and the foundation is very good.  I like it!</li>
            <li> The air pump, hose, and gun are all things you could purchase yourself.  They&#x27;re all generic items you could find if you looked.  But that&#x27;s not an issue if you&#x27;re like me and hate searching for parts to assemble.  So the system gets a pass...  The bad thing about this system is the makeup.  It is sticky but I haven&#x27;t looked much into that yet (sticky even when you shake it).  The makeup also rubs off very easily, it&#x27;s almost like glue when you rub it.  So if you&#x27;re out and touch your face wrong say good bye to the party you&#x27;re at, everything will have to come off.  This makeup will peel off on the area you touch.  The other bad thing is this makeup runs under moisture.  Meaning if you get sweaty, or little water droplets fall on your face, you&#x27;ll look like you sprinkled milk on your face.  Not something I would use if I was going out.  Only use if you want to play around or test.  But I don&#x27;t have experience with other airbrush makeup so Take my words with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li> EASE IN USING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOMETIMES THE MAKE-UP DOES NOT COME OUT OF THE AIR-BRUSH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE AIR BRUSH PERFECTLY CLEAN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;headline is :EASE IN USING</li>
            <li> happy wife happy life,no joke this was a surprise gift for my wife,(and  all her girlfriends)  i could never explain how happy they all are, they line up every occasion,(fridaynight) take turns doing each other make up babbling non sense, laughing, screaming  acting like high school girls, omg  they seem to really have fun, end  result is they look great they save a heck of a lot of money on make up and im a hero....the only complaint is i dont get mirror time anymore and i seem to go through a lot more toilet paper due to the influx of woman...great product at a great price...had it for about four month&#x27;s now, trust me i would hear about any complaints if there where any...</li>
            <li> I need a video to see how this is to be used. I thought one came with the product but didn&#x27;t. I haven&#x27;t used it as yet because I&#x27;m not real sure how.</li>
            <li> The brush is great, the foundation not so much...  So instead I use the luminess foundation it worked better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my airbrush for a month and it clogged up and the lever broke! I am so pissed. Looking into seeing if there was a warranty!</li>
            <li> Great airbrush and airbrush makeup.  I love it</li>
            <li> amazing!!!  I love it!!!  Cleaning is a little difficult.</li>
            <li> worked as expected. (y)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday but when I tried this I was delightfully surprised at how easy it was to use and the results that I got.  Do note that like with normal makeup, it&#x27;s not for everyone.  Really depends on your own personal skin type.</li>
            <li> I run a makeup school and bought this kit to give to one of my students.  This is the first time that I have tried this brand but overall I am very pleased with it.  The machines are standard but I do like the fact that you can adjust the pressure of the compressor.  It&#x27;s full adjustable as opposed to 3 set speed like the others that I&#x27;ve seen.  The airbrush coverage is pretty good as well and does not apply thick or heavy.</li>
            <li> Airbrush works great but the makeup is not the best</li>
            <li> Wow, what can I say.  It&#x27;s such a great little product that I have been using it daily for the past month.  The makeup feels light and is very easy to apply.  I get a great finish and have gotten many compliments.  I will be rebuying some of their foundation soon.</li>
            <li> This is my first foray into the art of airbrush makeup.  While it is definitely a learning curve to the process, I&#x27;m extremely impressed with how well it can cover my imperfections and blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot more simple to use as well.  I was really intimidated by this when I first got it, but after using it now three or four times I feel as if I get better each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get your kit you literally receive everything that you need to start doing airbrush makeup.  The compressor works really well and I love that it has different levels of strength depending on your needs.  To clean is also simple and only takes about two minutes after each use.  For someone as lazy as I am, I still found it really easy and quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors also are amazingly close to my natural color.  I found for myself, I prefer to use the &amp;#34;Movie Star&amp;#34; and a couple of drops of &amp;#34;Sand&amp;#34; and one drop of the pearl shimmer for my perfect shade.  I also like the papaya for a little extra color to my face.  I started out taking about ten minutes and now it&#x27;s taking about five minutes to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To mix, I found a great tutorial online that shows how to properly mix you need to put your desired shades in the &amp;#34;gun&amp;#34; and to cover the needle to block air and to press on the lever so that you see it kinda bubble up and repeat a couple of times and allow it to go back to it&#x27;s normal state and then to test the color on a tissue prior to using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I found that using water helped some to get used to the feel of the product, but I really think it just takes practicing a few times with the actual product to get used to how much comes on your face and to get a feel for what you actually need for your personal routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m still learning how to integrate my normal skincare routine and using the airbrush system, I know that for times when I want to hide my imperfections I&#x27;ll be using the airbrush system for sure!

            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve tried out any type of airbrush system and I must say that I am quite happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first learned about makeup airbrush from a commercial but thought it was something for the rich and glamourous.  I did some searching on Amazon and found this kit at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product in the mail fairly quickly and was very excited to put it to use.  I took everything out the box and it was very easy to put together.  I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to use the product, so I had to watch some videos on youtube to learn how to properly apply the makeup.  I learned very quickly after a few videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I really like about this system is that the compressor is fully adjustable meaning to that you can fully control the air pressure using the knob on the compressor.  Other similar compressors on the market only allow for low, med, and high setting while this compressor is fully adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I played around with the different types of foundations that were included.  There were a total of 6 bottles of foundation ranging from tan to a medium complexion.  While i don&#x27;t think I would ever use the darker foundations, I suppose it&#x27;s a nice additional for the professional makeup artist who needs a varairty of shades.  I found one shade &amp;#34;Sand&amp;#34; which was perfect for me.  It left my face looking practically flawless.  It does not feel heavy on the skin.  No blotchy or caked feeling at all.  It looked perfect natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that are looking for an airbrush system and don&#x27;t want to pay top dollar, this airbrush kit is fantastic.  I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Delivered quick. Product itself isn&#x27;t easy to use when it comes to using the highlights and bronzer but otherwise it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> Got my order on time very happy</li>
            <li> May be great on younger skin, not so great on my 47 year old skin. Did not cover up pores or minor imperfections.</li>
            <li> Great airbrush makeup system.  Makeup is light but covers great.  It takes practice to learn to put in on just right but once you get the hang of it you can do very quickly.  I would recommend this as an alternative to the more expensive airbrush system.</li>
            <li> itks great1 took me a few times to lget it rightl. itks important and i didnkt know, but you have to clean the tip of the wamd very gently with a wet q tip or it will get clogged and spray spackle all over your face. i didnt have a problem with the makeup being orange-y. So, yes ot gets 5 ★&amp;#34;s! Happy customer! :-)</li>
            <li> Sputters spits and takes way way more foundation then the 4-8 drops. 4 drops covers the chin. I ended up using fourth of the bottle for one use and quickly blending with my hand because it randomly spits. Im really considering returning. Not worth the money. Better off buying a good brand of foundation instead.</li>
            <li> Compressor did not work from the start and the item came with very few instructions for actual assembly and use.  However it did come with PAGES of text telling me how much I would love how it made me look.  If it don&#x27;t spray, I don&#x27;t pay.  Returned it.</li>
            <li> Looked to complicated.. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> This is the best!! Easy to use and clean and what a difference between air brushing and using regular makeup!! It&#x27;s quicker and less mess than&lt;br /&gt;bottled liquid makeup. Love it!</li>
            <li> First time using this air brush, tried it once and was content with the results. The bronzer that comes with this kit feels kind of sandy on skin and it comes off easy, I dont know if I didnt apply it in the proper way. It&#x27;s very easy to use and perfect size! Very minimum noise.</li>
            <li> Time consuming to clean</li>
            <li> Returning the product. The color smears off with just touching it. Didnt really like the product. Used the bronzer and took forever to take the glitter out with the brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> If you a MUA just starting out this Baby is super inexpensive and easy to use for your kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did an unboxing video on my youtube channel and have been using this on special occasions, I love the bronzer it smells like coconut. This company is super sweet and this brand I&#x27;m surprised isn&#x27;t more popular, can&#x27;t wait to try the other darker colors for my kit in the future&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;wdug6tNIKPw</li>
            <li> It does give a more uniform look.  I just have an issue with space, where to set it up, since my bathroom is tiny, so I have to have this in the kitchen, so I&#x27;m not using it right now.</li>
            <li> i like the air brush but the make up is not worth it. If water touch your face the make up would fade away quickly leaving spots with no make up. Did some one knows why? can somebody tell me why the make up is so delicate and fade away with the water. I went to a funeral and i cry just a little and with that i had left a big spot on my chick with out make up it looked horrible.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!!  Buying more makeup for it!! So easy.</li>
            <li> IVE HAD THE DAM THING 2 DAYS, AND IT BROKE...THE LEVER YA USE TO CONTROL THE AIR DONT WORK NO MORE....DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT....</li>
            <li> I guess for the amount of stuff you get this is a good deal, however on the third use the lever on the gun broke off leaving it useless. Checked Art of Air website and the gun itself is only $19.99. You definetly get what you pay for so be prepared to replace airbrush gun sooner rather than later. I went to our local craft store and replaced with a professional airbrush and am much happier with the final outcome. I do still use the compressor and makeup.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s so light! And takes only a few minutes it goes on so even!</li>
            <li> The airbrush machine works great.  Very professional and easy to use on myself.  However, I will be ordering different makeup from another brand.  This makeup left my skin dry and wrinkly. Almost like I had face paint on.  Also, if it gets wet, it comes right off.  I am planning on using airbrush makeup for my wedding day and do not want it to run if I cry, so I will be using Dinair brand airbrush makeup as it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> Horrible... I am professiona makeup artist and a licensed cosmetologist, I iswd this once and it broke. I didn&#x27;t need a super expensive system. Just one that worked. I suggest any other airbrush machine other than this!! I emailed the company asking them for a replacement or to return and never heard back. Save your money!!!! Keep shopping!</li>
            <li> LOVE, an absolute perfect airbrush make-up kit. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit of time to get down but one you get the hang of it then its awesome.  I love it and my friends love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product however, I had to return the first one I bought because on day 28 the motor stopped so they sent me a new package- I just wanted the motor. I tried the new one and I had to put the motor on HIGH before anything would come out. It&#x27;s almost like I got a refurbished one. I&#x27;m returning this one as well and am going to wait a month before I buy yet a third one.  The product itseld is absolutely wonderful and am hoping that I finally get one that works and doesn&#x27;t break on me.  I really do LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!!!  Thank you!  S. Flynn</li>
            <li> Wow. What can I say, I  have been dying for an airbrush makeup system for quite some time now. Searching everywhere for the best product, the best deal, and finally how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Airbrush makeup is revolutionary, and folks. It isn&#x27;t just for Hollywood anymore.  You can do just about anything with airbrush, foundation, eyebrows, eye-shadow even eyeliner, don&#x27;t forget you can also do contouring and highlighting! With minimal practice, airbrushing is quite easy to get the hang of. The key is small circles, and at least 6 inches from your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art of Air comes with a pamphlet containing minimal instructions, also a parts list. Which came in handy when I took my airbrush apart to clean it. (I used watered down acrylic paint in it, for nail art...tutorial on that later) It comes with your compressor, 6 foundations, (the amazon one I received did. You can buy art of air online in quite a few places) a foundation primer, a pearl shimmer,  peach blush, and bronzer, Also the airbrush itself of course, as well as a long hose, making it super convenient to airbrushing others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First. The compressor is super nice as you can manually adjust the speed, vs a high, med, lo setting. Which for me I decided I wouldn&#x27;t like. As you don&#x27;t have much control or variety. Really that choice is yours. As for the compressor it is louder than some I have heard watching YouTube videos, but it is fairly quiet considering. Its fairly small, I am not sure how it compares to other airbrush systems compressors as I&#x27;ve never tried them.  I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The airbrush gun itself, Is quite nice. It is dual action, and easy to use.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is, you should be able to press down and back, I cant press down. As for the brush its self, I thought maybe I broke it, at one point. Turns out, it is supposed to come apart like that, for cleaning purposes. The gun is polished chrome, and the handle isn&#x27;t plastic, but not quite metal it comes off really easy to remove the needle.  The entire thing comes apart for cleaning, it is quite easy to put back together as well. Just make sure you don&#x27;t bend your needle, as that renders your airbrush useless. This gun looks fairly standard among all airbrush kits. I know temptu, and luminess use different ones. (Luminess has a plastic end, and temptu has some that you attach your bottles into)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the makeup. The most important part right?! I received the following foundations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Star&lt;br /&gt;Sand&lt;br /&gt;Buff Beige&lt;br /&gt;Honey&lt;br /&gt;Golden  Olive&lt;br /&gt;Suntan Glo&lt;br /&gt;Unknown (named rubbed off)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t read the label on the last one, as it wore off. So, I do wish they would use better labels. They do peel off rather easy, if you want to make your own airbrush foundation. (Tutorial on that later, if you like) The Movie Star and  Sand are both very close together, so I could get away with using either of them for foundation, I find mixing them is best. (To mix, add drops of each, put your finger over the end of the nozzle, and pull back to back bubble)  However, the two darker foundations unknown  and suntan glo were actually too dark for my best friend who is Persian, and has a gorgeous olive/tan skin tone. I do notice the foundations have a slightly yellow or red tint to them depending,  This can easily be neutralized with color correcting primer.  The foundations themselves, are not sticky, cakey, or watery. They apply so airy, and light, and sit right on top of your skin. So no rubbing into your skin ,and it feeling heavy. With that being said, I can say these are not waterproof. So, apply a finishing powder. Or spray.  You also can not blend any creams into this, so if you want to conceal with your normal concealer, use it under. Powders are just fine over. (I have heard other systems makeup that lets you use creams over it, but I am not positive at this time.)  This makeup is quite long lasting I wore it all day with no problems whatsoever. The finish is matte, just be careful if you use the pearl shimmer, as it is really concentrated. So, if you use it, put your machine on low, barely move your lever back and aim farther away from your face, so it isn&#x27;t over whelming! The first time I tried, I looked like a clown! Note: you need to shake these well before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, This set is very affordable and excellent for beginners, and those looking to expand in the airbrush world. You do get more foundations for that price, than all the other systems, and their makeup is larger containers, and less expensive than most. The only downside, is that you cant change your compressor color, (if you care about that sort of thing) and, they don&#x27;t have much of a selection in makeup. They have no eye-shadows, nor any other blush, bronzer, or highlighters. You can use other brands in this machine, so that&#x27;s a plus! Plus you can always make your own too.  The quality though far exceeds their lack of choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this free of charge, for my honest opinion.tsoever.

            <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it! She watched a few videos on you-tube first and then she just started practicing with her own kit and now she uses it every day and her make-up looks flawless and beautiful!!</li>
