            <li>The colors are nice though</li>
            <li>Colours are nice.</li>
            <li>the colors are great and is the right size for me</li>
            <li>Love Love Love the colors!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to use them up quickly, then be done with OPI for good.</li>
            <li>OPI is my favorite brand of mainstream nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I love the gold one.</li>
            <li>I love O.P.I.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this color collection, however, two of the colors have a matte finish.</li>
            <li>My preference is for a glossy finish, so just make sure you have a topcoat if you&#x27;re like me.</li>
            <li>Love opi nail polish</li>
            <li>Nice bold colors.  </li>
            <li>The formula and the wide brushes are awesome!  </li>
            <li>the pink is the most beautiful one...</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Loving it..and the shipping was fast..</li>
            <li>However, the colors are amazing, and the samples are more than enough to try out.</li>
            <li>As popular and expensive OPI is, I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the quality of the nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want the full size bottles</li>
            <li>Now I do sort of wish I bought the full sizes</li>
            <li>So cool.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s 3.75ml~1/8 oz super mini.</li>
            <li>OPI nail polish is always high quality, and I love these colors.  </li>
            <li>Love it, small but good to try out.</li>
            <li>so when Gwen collaborated with them of course I knew the colors would be hot!</li>
            <li>and if you really like it get the large bottle :)</li>
            <li>Fun colors.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive these little gems as I loved the colors included.</li>
            <li>They come right off too, don&#x27;t touch anything the paint scratches right off.</li>
            <li>I loved the pink the most and went to the drugstore to get the bigger one.</li>
            <li>Overall quite pleased.</li>
            <li>This is my first using OPI Nail Polish.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had cheaper priced nail polishes that go on better and last</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I only got a mini quad.  </li>
            <li>Both the black and gold come out perfect with two coats, whereas the hot pink and burgundy-maroon are sufficient with one coat.</li>
            <li>but I was never in love with the flat gold color.</li>
            <li>The gold, brown and black go on nice, look great but don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the description carefully.</li>
            <li>I wanted the minis of this collection because it&#x27;s rare that I use an entire bottle of polish, and it&#x27;s a good way of trying different colors without spending a lot of money (at the time I was short on $$ and was in a hurry to try these colors :</li>
            <li>They stay super shiny even without a top coat and stays on for a long time with very minimal chipping.</li>
            <li>Love the hot pink and dark maroon colors.</li>
            <li>The satin/matte black can come out looking more like a deep charcoal gray.</li>
            <li>I use the black for nail art (stripes or animal print) love the smaller bottles too!</li>
            <li>favorite is the black (OPI - 4 in the morning), it has a satin finish with a slight shimmer.  </li>
            <li>The pink and a dark wine color is very vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li>I love every color, especially the black because it&#x27;s a matte black and the gold is glamorous.</li>
            <li>They are small in size..but worth the price..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Beautiful set of colors! The satin/matte black can come out looking more like a deep charcoal gray.

            <li> Perfect Christmas gift</li>
            <li> Very tiny bottles. The picture makes them appear regular sized. Be sure to read the description carefully.</li>
            <li> OPI is a great brand anyway so when Gwen collaborated with them of course I knew the colors would be hot!

            <li> Just what I was looking for.  I didn&#x27;t want the full size bottles yet I wanted the collection so this was perfect.  Delivered quickly</li>
            <li> OPI is my favorite brand of mainstream nail polish.  The formula and the wide brushes are awesome!

You get 2 crèmes and 2 satin finishes.  All of them are great.....Now I do sort of wish I bought the full sizes, it messes up my storage with my other polish collections. LOL&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is the black (OPI - 4 in the morning), it has a satin finish with a slight shimmer.  So cool.</li>
            <li> They are small in size..but worth the price..the pink is the most beautiful one... Great finish..Loving it..and the shipping was fast..</li>
            <li> Every color in this collection is awesome!  Mini bottles won&#x27;t last long. Maybe 3/4 mani&#x27;s but that&#x27;s fine. Still a great deal from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the gold one. it fits perfect with my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s 3.75ml~1/8 oz super mini. But enough for me to keep using for at least a year.</li>

            <li> Smaller than anticipated.</li>
            <li> I love every color, especially the black because it&#x27;s a matte black and the gold is glamorous. These colors don&#x27;t need several costs. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> lovely color! I love O.P.I.</li>
            <li> I thought these colors were going to be great!! But no they are not. They come right off too, don&#x27;t touch anything the paint scratches right off. I&#x27;d return it but then I&#x27;d lose money smdh</li>
            <li> Love it, small but good to try out.</li>
