            <li>recipient was pleased with the scent</li>
            <li>I love Hanae Mori and wear and myself.  </li>
            <li>I love the woodsy smell.</li>
            <li>Hanae Mori&#x27;s &amp;#34;Him&amp;#34; is much more wearable.</li>
            <li>I knew amazon would have a better deal.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne.  </li>
            <li>I may not quite know how to pronounce it, but it is a very unique and distinctive musky scent.</li>
            <li>VERY UNIQUE.</li>
            <li>It was much more mild than i thought but still smells nice.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant as a daily fragrance.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting a free sample through Sephora, gave it to my boyfriend and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>this cologne is priced well, better than the parfum version where i originally bought in store.  </li>
            <li>For men is my favorite cologne, this not a bad follow-up.</li>
            <li>Smells great and last a lot longer than some.</li>
            <li>I picked this up after getting a free sample from another store.</li>
            <li>And while I liked Obsession, I always felt it was much too &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; to wear all day.</li>
            <li>Very happy with purchase, normal shipping seemed quick, about one third the price of what Nordstroms wanted.</li>
            <li>Was leaning towards light blue but more than satisfied with this .</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too sweet and not too musky.</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast!</li>
            <li>This colonge smells amazing, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>It lasts also so this is very much worth the money.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think my husband would like it because he likes fresh scents.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised at how cheap it is</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I first received it as a sample from Sephora and couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it.</li>
            <li>My husband is more of a Dior, Gucci, and Versace Eros, and Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male type of guy</li>
            <li>It has an exotic fragrance and stand all day long.</li>
            <li>This fragrance smells spectacular and for anything less than $50 is an absolute steal.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Based on the notes I expected more darkness and spices.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>too much of alcohol.</li>
            <li>It is very manly and sensual.</li>
            <li>I first got this as a sampler during my black Friday shopping and when I got home and smelled it I instantly fell in love with it, so much so that I went and bought a bottle!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for the price.. Have seen in stores for $100</li>
            <li>Such an amazing not overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li>I typically wear leather and sandalwood from bath junkie, or lucky brand or giovenechy pi.</li>
            <li>This one is really clean and subtle and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product arrived on time &amp; as expected. The fragrance is not different then ones sold in sold! Great buy! Will definitely buy from seller again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>
            <li> it was the second time i bought it and would do it again!!!!!!! just great</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Packaged very well. Smells amazing. Nothing but love here!</li>
            <li> Sender was on time! Everything to way I espected.... Awesome</li>
            <li> Such an amazing not overwhelming smell. I ended up getting a free sample through Sephora, gave it to my boyfriend and fell in love with it. I just had to go and find an actual bottle. I wouldn&#x27;t mind keeping it for myself such it smells that great!</li>
            <li> unfortunately I ordered the wrong item. I meant to order the perfume which has a better fragrance - not the eau de toilette...so I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance for the price. Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> love it love it love it ...&lt;br /&gt;its smell so goood&lt;br /&gt;way cheaper then the department store!!!</li>
            <li> I first got this as a sampler during my black Friday shopping and when I got home and smelled it I instantly fell in love with it, so much so that I went and bought a bottle! The smell is I would describe as a medium scent. I would say this could go as a uni-sex cologne but it is a little to spicy to go that far. I honestly hate spicy cologne gucci and quite a few other very well known brands are like this and I pass on them, but this has a spicy scent that is mixed in with possibly some floral note, dare I say. But it comes together perfectly! This scent will seem different from smelling the bottle versus putting it on, so keep that in mind! The initial smell is great also but the smell once it drys is amazing! It lasts also so this is very much worth the money. I was actually surprised at how cheap it is I was expecting to pay around 70 for it.</li>
            <li> This colonge smells amazing, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Very nice scent!! Highly recommend for the price.. Have seen in stores for $100</li>
            <li> It arrived very fast! Excellent product and service! Thanks!</li>

I usually don&#x27;t go for this type if scent  it comes of as a musk and woodsy type of scent, but it is a really nice scent.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband he loves it. So do I!</li>
            <li> Everything ok. Have not tried yet the perfume</li>
            <li> was given as a gift.  was recommended as a nice fragrance. recipient was pleased with the scent&lt;br /&gt;very nice recommendation</li>
            <li> This is nice, but was somewhat disappointed. Based on the notes I expected more darkness and spices.  It was much more mild than i thought but still smells nice. HM. For men is my favorite cologne, this not a bad follow-up.</li>
            <li> I loved it. It has an exotic fragrance and stand all day long.</li>
            <li> I love Hanae Mori and wear and myself.  I saw this for HiM and bought it for my husband.  We both love it, very good fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like all of the Hanae Mori stuff. For the wife and for me, they are all reasonably priced and smell wonderful. This one is really clean and subtle and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Great price and super shipping thru Amazon too.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> A great scent for men!  My wife likes it.  Buying here was about 50% of what the local department store was charging.</li>
            <li> it smells very good, thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrant and good price. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells spectacular and for anything less than $50 is an absolute steal. Very happy with my purchase. Very elegant smell and bottle/box design.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent after 15 mins</li>
            <li> What a great smell.... I love the woodsy smell. I typically wear leather and sandalwood from bath junkie, or lucky brand or giovenechy pi. Was leaning towards light blue but more than satisfied with this .</li>
            <li> Smells bad...&lt;br /&gt;Tried to re-gift it ..</li>
            <li> Great item. Great fragerance and great price.</li>
            <li> Smells great and last a lot longer than some.</li>
            <li> too much of alcohol. doesn&#x27;t last for long.&lt;br /&gt;guaranteed to be delivered by Monday, bu actually was delivered on Wednesday</li>
            <li> I picked this up after getting a free sample from another store. I immediately recognized the scent as a toned-down take on [[ASIN:B001RCHCGU CK Obsession for Men]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong vanilla, cola, cedar, and cinnamon notes throughout, and even the coloration is similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the bottle arrived, it was just as I remembered. And while I liked Obsession, I always felt it was much too &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; to wear all day. Hanae Mori&#x27;s &amp;#34;Him&amp;#34; is much more wearable. However, while Obsession will stick to your clothes for days, this starts to taper off after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Tried this at Nordstrom&#x27;s, it was going for $75. I knew amazon would have a better deal. The smell isn&#x27;t too sweet and not too musky. Good balance.</li>
            <li> I may not quite know how to pronounce it, but it is a very unique and distinctive musky scent. VERY UNIQUE.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne.  It&#x27;s a different scent than any other my husband had previously.  It is very manly and sensual.</li>
            <li> This smells like a cowboy in a business suit. Trying to talk every guy I know into purchasing.</li>
            <li> Just what we ordered and a great price.</li>
            <li> Goes well with Ph levels and not an overpowering smell. Very pleasant as a daily fragrance. Definately a recommendation for your collection!</li>
            <li> Extremely hot, great one for men.deserve 5 star</li>
            <li> this cologne is priced well, better than the parfum version where i originally bought in store.  i like the woodsy spice smell this cologne gives off.</li>
            <li> A lot of compliments withing the last month</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase, normal shipping seemed quick, about one third the price of what Nordstroms wanted.</li>
