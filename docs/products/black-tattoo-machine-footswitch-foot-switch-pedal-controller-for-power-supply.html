            <li>best ive had yet</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>works great arrived way ahead of schedule</li>
            <li>Good foot pedal</li>
            <li>My friends son was very pleased with this product, the price, as well as the time it took to receive it</li>
            <li>I received it in good condition and undamaged cheap shipping.  </li>
            <li>It has grips on the top and bottom.</li>
            <li>It was a really cheap price and made a good quick replacement</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>That was perfect because I actually bought it for the purpose of making a custom pedal for my friend out of a red stapler like the one in Office Space.</li>
            <li>as good as any pedal from any other supplier</li>
            <li>The tattoo pedal doesn&#x27;t work right</li>
            <li>pretty good pedal just put together poorly ,that&#x27;s what I get for going the cheap route.</li>
            <li>I am disappointed in the product, but I will still order from the company, good prices, good shipping time/rates.</li>
            <li>I am not just rating this item with 5 stars because I feel like it; though I have not put this to use yet it came fairly fast and through the Post Office with Priority Mail.</li>
            <li>Man when i bought it, I was really looking forward to using this</li>
            <li>the pedal itself is good but the cord for it is only 3&#x27; LONG!!!!</li>
            <li>They just need to go into detail a little more about their products.</li>
            <li>From the time I pulled this foot pedal from the plastic it has stuck, Never had a new feel to it at all.</li>
            <li>To see both pedals in action check out my video of them on YouTube.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints about this pedal so far, it works like it should.</li>
            <li>3&#x27; of cord will barely even reach the floor from my workstation.</li>
            <li>they were contact petal at one time ,that means if the petals, got two contacts one on top one on bottom and when the touch ,you generate power to to power supply box,but the last few they sent me were the petals ,with a little switch</li>
            <li>I ordered this to replace my broken one and it came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>its small and thin, good bang for the buck</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not top of the line but very durable and responsive for a cheapy.</li>
            <li> and I know this will last a long time.   </li>
            <li> Cord is ONLY 3 FEET long so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> and they last half the time ,because the cheap switches wear out,but for the price order one every time you make and order and you  will always have one on hand thanks ,crazy rick</li>
            <li> They need to say excatly how long the cord is.</li>
            <li> then I expected</li>
            <li> what i wanted and expected</li>
            <li> wtf, my old pedal, same design, had an 8&#x27; cord.</li>
            <li> Just your average pedal.</li>
            <li> It still works if you hold it down but is not how&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels durable but not top quality of course.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy about it at all</li>
            <li> but unfortunately when i received it it was broken as heck.</li>
            <li> I know when I put this to use I will not be unsatisfied or mad</li>

    <ol>
            <li> second time i used it the switch inside broke. It still works if you hold it down but is not how&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; it is supposed to function.l</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace my broken one and it came pretty fast. It feels durable but not top quality of course. It has grips on the top and bottom. It was a really cheap price and made a good quick replacement so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> works great arrived way ahead of schedule best ive had yet</li>
            <li> When I unboxed it it had an extra wire and plug assembly with it.  That was perfect because I actually bought it for the purpose of making a custom pedal for my friend out of a red stapler like the one in Office Space. To see both pedals in action check out my video of them on YouTube. The video is called Red Stapler Sustain Pedal.</li>
            <li> Good foot pedal&lt;br /&gt;lighter then I expected</li>
            <li> The tattoo pedal doesn&#x27;t work right at all I&#x27;m not happy about it at all</li>
            <li> the pedal itself is good but the cord for it is only 3&#x27; LONG!!!! wtf, my old pedal, same design, had an 8&#x27; cord. They need to say excatly how long the cord is. Even the picture shows the cord being longer. 3&#x27; of cord will barely even reach the floor from my workstation. I am disappointed in the product, but I will still order from the company, good prices, good shipping time/rates. They just need to go into detail a little more about their products.</li>
            <li> what i wanted and expected</li>
            <li> I am not just rating this item with 5 stars because I feel like it; though I have not put this to use yet it came fairly fast and through the Post Office with Priority Mail. I received it in good condition and undamaged cheap shipping.  I know when I put this to use I will not be unsatisfied or mad and I know this will last a long time.   Permanent costumer.  A++</li>
            <li> stays on until you click it off</li>
            <li> My friends son was very pleased with this product, the price, as well as the time it took to receive it</li>
            <li> pretty good pedal just put together poorly ,that&#x27;s what I get for going the cheap route.</li>
            <li> as good as any pedal from any other supplier</li>
            <li> no problems.plug n play away</li>
            <li> From the time I pulled this foot pedal from the plastic it has stuck, Never had a new feel to it at all.</li>
            <li> Just your average pedal. Nothing special. This is reliable and durable. The last pedal you will ever need or the spare in your close.</li>
            <li> Man when i bought it, I was really looking forward to using this but unfortunately when i received it it was broken as heck. The screws kinda we&#x27;re falling out and so i replaced it.... the replacement they sent.... was broke too..</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this pedal so far, it works like it should. its small and thin, good bang for the buck</li>
            <li> Cuts out and does not stay on when depressed at all.</li>
            <li> I bought a lot of these petals ,so I never lack, if one goes out I got a back up they were contact petal at one time ,that means if the petals, got two contacts one on top one on bottom and when the touch ,you generate power to to power supply box,but the last few they sent me were the petals ,with a little switch and they last half the time ,because the cheap switches wear out,but for the price order one every time you make and order and you  will always have one on hand thanks ,crazy rick</li>
            <li> For under 6 bucks including shipping, this foot pedal is solid. It&#x27;s not top of the line but very durable and responsive for a cheapy. Cord is ONLY 3 FEET long so keep that in mind.</li>
