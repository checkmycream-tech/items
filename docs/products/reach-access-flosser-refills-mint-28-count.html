            <li>#34;You take great care of your teeth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>lol my mom and</li>
            <li>These 28-count refills come in very handy.  </li>
            <li>Nice way to floss withut having to stick your hands in your mouth!</li>
            <li>No damage to the packaging, everything was intact and in good condition once I opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>they fit perfectly on the flosser.</li>
            <li>Price is good.</li>
            <li>I like having a good supply on hand even though you can reuse each flosser a number of times.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Price is just as good as in store price.</li>
            <li>and they arrived in good shape.</li>
            <li>great and very handy to keep available</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Great for kids, too, as they can handle these better than floss.  </li>
            <li>Probably the best thing to do is to use a fresh one each time, but I use them 2-3 times and just rinse after each use and have never had any problems.</li>
            <li>make a mint-flavor that is good, and you need to own the Reach &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to attach them too since this is just re-fills, not the stick.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>

            <li>it is nice to find them in a quantity pack.  </li>

            <li>I have been wanting use these kind of flosses over the ones you wrap around your fingers.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re buying these refills, it&#x27;s because you already own the flossing tool (and you presumably like it, too).</li>

            <li>Absolutely happy with this order and how quickly it was delivered.  </li>
            <li>Reach Flossers are great for quick touch-ups before you go out, or post-meal cleanings after something like corn-on-the-cob.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I knocked one star off because I don&#x27;t see why these can&#x27;t be produced and sold more cost effectively.</li>
            <li>I have a cavity prone 9 year old, and these have made a wonderful difference in her checkups, instead of asking...</li>
            <li>Good price for a very useful product.</li>
            <li>These give me the motivation I need to floss- makes the job so easy!</li>
            <li>Oh yes this is easy!  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love Reach Access Flossers!  </li>
            <li>They do the job just fine!</li>
            <li>I had a stroke in my forties &amp; my right hand never fully returned to normal function, so I have to use a handled flosser like this, &amp; these were the ones I liked best.</li>
            <li>Having refills in large volume is great.</li>
            <li>The mint is so refreshing; it&#x27;s like mouthwash and flossing rolled into one</li>
            <li>Quantity ordering makes the price much more tolerable.</li>
            <li>I love flossing with this.</li>
            <li>Better prices by about 20% and availability</li>
            <li>I just hope they are never discontinued! :)</li>
            <li>Ok - it&#x27;s dental floss, and it does what dental floss does.  </li>
            <li>These are much better than trying to use floss tape.</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is great and these make flossing so much easier .</li>
            <li>My favorite flosser.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am amazed that many pharmacies don&#x27;t carry the refills and I am grateful to Amazon for providing a convenient on-line source.</li>
            <li>Prompt and Safe Undamaged Delivery Sealed works well with the applicator</li>
            <li>Great flosser, very minty.</li>
            <li>Best way to floss teeth regularly with minimum effort.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Reach flosser tool for many years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always complimented by my dental hygienist that my gums look healthy.  </li>
            <li>The Reach Access Flosser uses a much better quality floss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>and I love floss my teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much more ergonomic way to floss.  </li>
            <li>My dentist even noticed improvement at my last dental check up!  :D</li>
            <li>And I love that she does not have food in her teeth.</li>
            <li>Ok but maker has changed branding.</li>
            <li>I like the unflavored ones better than the mint.</li>
            <li>I am so glad my dentist turned me on to these</li>
            <li>and I hope they continue and get Lots more Merchandise to purchase ON-LINE.</li>
            <li>I love these minty flossers.</li>
            <li>We love Reach Access flossers.  </li>
            <li>We would buy more if they were cheaper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many problems with floss over the years.</li>
            <li>I would like it better if it were more durable but all in all works just like it is supposed to</li>
            <li>Should last a while now and the pricing is excellent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These refills cost way more than a container of string.</li>
            <li>how many cavities this time, we ask, are there any cavities?  </li>
            <li>I love these flossers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to find the fliossers.  </li>
            <li>Now I have to use up more words</li>
            <li>Very happy with the product, came as advertised, just like the product I used to be able to purchase locally.  </li>
            <li>So glad I can still get them here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than trying to get your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I love these they r so easy to use</li>
            <li>love it keeping teeth flossed is so easy for the entire family with the reach holder and these are a good price stocking stuffers too!</li>
            <li>The price was great and they even arrived early.</li>
            <li>More importantly because these items seems to be out Of stock everywhere.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good packaging.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just so much easier to use than floss, and do just as good a job.</li>
            <li>nice minty flavor...makes flossing fun</li>
            <li>The Reach Access Flosser is an effective flossing tool, and the premium is worth it.</li>
            <li>A far more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works well.  </li>
            <li>Makes flossing easy.  </li>
            <li>the Reach Flosser makes it easy to do and takes them no time at all.  </li>
            <li>Keep looking until you find the original, unflavored Reach Access Flosser refills, and enjoy your clean mouth!  :-)</li>
            <li>These are the easy button for flossing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as easy as brushing my teeth, rather than an anxiety ridden ordeal.</li>
            <li>In comes the Access flosser, and now it&#x27;s easy to get to every side of every tooth, including the 4 wisdom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love them works really great and do not have to keep running back to store every 2 weeks like with others.</li>
            <li>first time I have liked to floss</li>
            <li>I cannot fit one of my fingers into my mouth to hold the floss, so these make flossing a twice a day an easy choir.</li>
            <li>I enjoy that this is a 3-pack and easy to find.</li>
            <li>The Reach Flosser is much more pleasant than forcing your fingers in your mouth with regular floss.</li>
            <li>The mint flavored flosses are a great change from the regular ones.</li>
            <li>It was just as it said it was and fit my requirements.</li>
            <li>I would like to have these be available with a travel size of wand and a travel container for them.</li>
            <li>These mint-flavored refills for my Reach Access Flosser really do the trick and leave a nice mint taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy shopping with Amazon</li>
            <li>They are a far superior way to floss.  </li>
            <li>Great for flossing daily and keeping your gums clean.  </li>
            <li>If you already have the arm which these attach to, flossing is easy and quick.</li>
            <li>dentist says they aren&#x27;t as good as real floss, but far better than nothing and</li>
            <li>Clean teeth</li>
            <li>Prefered the plain kind but didn&#x27;t find any as good a deal</li>
            <li>Great product..flosses as expected...</li>
            <li>But these mint flavored refills leave an extremely sickly sweet, and somewhat minty, taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get a much faster and deeper floss with these - about 1 minute of my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad for $12.</li>
            <li>I love using the Reach flosser since it makes flossing easy and not messy.</li>
            <li>Received quickly as always do with Amazon.</li>
            <li>Item came as order and quickly.</li>
            <li>- Arrived quick, as estimated.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and as promised.  </li>
            <li>This order came quickly and it was what I wanted - as advertised.  </li>
            <li>came quick.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>With these, I can regularly floss and reach those teeth, leading to better dental checkups!  </li>
            <li>Great little flossers</li>
            <li>Using it is like using a toothbrush, no awkward hand contortions and no aching fingertips.</li>
            <li>My periodontist was surprised to see at how healthy my gums have become</li>
            <li>Teeth get flossed, gums don&#x27;t bleed, mouth feels fresh...</li>
            <li>A good product and works as expected.</li>
            <li>My husband and 5 yr old use them and love them.</li>
            <li>Fresh mint smell.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, which is why I buy them in quantity.  </li>
            <li>These have made it possible for my kids to floss their own teeth well.  </li>
            <li>me, the whole point of flossing is to have a clean, fresh mouth.  </li>
            <li>The right price &amp; time to get them delivered.</li>
            <li>They have just the right amount of mint in there.</li>
            <li>I could never make the floss rub against my teeth the right way.</li>
            <li>The company shipped these right away</li>
            <li>The mint crystals make flossing a little more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Got these for my son - seem to work well and easy for his young hands to work with.</li>
            <li>But, I actually use them daily and my oral hygeine has been greatly enhanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>gave 5 star because they are hard to find in the stores and the pricew for them was right, great</li>
            <li>I was never able to floss effectively until I began using the Reach flossing tool, which I find extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is nice as well but definitely not the main selling point of these flosser refills.</li>
            <li>I like these more than the regular refuls because they are mint.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what they said it was</li>
            <li>I have been using the Reach flosser religiously on a daily basis for the past two years and attribute that use to the best checkup/cleaning I have had in decades.</li>
            <li>Love the Reach Access Flosser and use daily.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>exactly what I have been looking for in the grocery store but couldn&#x27;t find.  </li>
            <li>I discovered the Reach Access Flossers, I have no more problems, and am able to do a more thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>To me, they&#x27;re easier and more convenient than regular flossing.  </li>
            <li>absolutely a 5 star rating for me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many, and finally found this.  </li>
            <li>Item came extremely fast!</li>
            <li>The price is better than I can find locally.</li>
            <li>My first purchase (not here) was the Dentek.  </li>
            <li>This was the first refill I&#x27;ve needed since seeing my hygienist in August.</li>
            <li>Obviously, make sure you have the handle.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>do sometimes have trouble finding the refills, so I&#x27;m delighted Amazon has them.</li>
            <li>and I find them very effective in removing hard to reach places between the teeth.</li>
            <li>extra bonus, is that the Floss String, is very sturdy, adding to a better cleaning.</li>
            <li>This makes it so much easier to reach the teeth way at the back of my mouth, and it does just as good a job as traditional floss.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice if they made a floss holder with the same dimensions so you could just be economical and use regular floss instead of paying for replacements.</li>
            <li>These easily reach way in the back and between the teeth.</li>
            <li>These should last someone 1-2 years easily.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than a brick and mortar store.  </li>
            <li>This tool makes it so much easier to string the floss in hard-to-reach places.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it really does.</li>
            <li>I was expecting mint flavored floss, but this has mint flavor on the sides of the flosser, and it&#x27;s really, really minty.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My husbands teeth are really close together</li>
            <li>My whole family loves them now.</li>
            <li>Thanks - arrived promptly and as advertised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quite repulsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use Reach Access Flosser, it makes floss teeth much easier than before</li>
            <li>I really hope they don&#x27;t go out of production because this beats sticking your fingers in your mouth with a string of floss.</li>
            <li>thanks for carrying them.</li>
            <li>They are so much easier and quicker to use.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t fit my fat fingers into the back of my mouth, so my molars are neglected.</li>
            <li>They keep changing the design of the floss holder so we end up with either extra refills that don&#x27;t fit anything or a holder we can&#x27;t get refills for.</li>
            <li>Makes flossing your teeth so much easier.</li>
            <li>Just as described and works very well</li>
            <li>as with everything, these are MUCH cheaper on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>much easier/quicker to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for lazy adults too!</li>
            <li>They snap on a long plastic handle which makes it easy for children  to reach between their teeth and floss their teeth themselves.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if using these is as good as real flossing, but it definitely helps me to &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; more regularly.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to use, especially when you are reaching toward the back of you mouth.  </li>
            <li>Other have more of a minty flavor than these.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only so excited I can get about floss, but these make flossing way easier.</li>
            <li>Does the job, reasonably priced and I greatly prefer using this tool than using floss string alone because floss string requires a certain amount of manual agility and is even more difficult when your teeth are not perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>Great especially for teeth with very little space between.</li>
            <li>I use them every day and they work much better than conventional floss</li>
            <li>great for reaching the hard to reach places in the back of your mouth while flossing.</li>
            <li>so he sometimes has trouble using other flossers but he is able to use these without a problem They are hard to find around our area so being able to order them from Amazon really is handy.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend these, been using them for 4 years and don&#x27;t dread flossing my teeth since.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Could be a little more durable.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to release any form of negativity from their life, their family&#x27;s life, and their business or professional life.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without these refills.  </li>
            <li>My tight teeth break these fairly easily, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the floss.</li>
            <li>I love Reach Access Flossers - no more sticking your fingers in your mouth</li>
            <li>I hope Ms Burney writes more books on the subject as I highly respect her as a spiritual healer, teacher and now author.  </li>
            <li>We have been clients of hers for many years both personally and professionally and purchased her book to keep our personal lives and professional healing practice clear in between spiritual tune ups from Ms. Burney.  </li>
            <li>Easy to snap on and really help floss hard to reach teeth.</li>
            <li>When I purchased these it was because I couldn&#x27;t find them at stores, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>Actually floss too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just listing simple details at this point, there isn&#x27;t much to say.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 71 years old</li>
            <li>wow wow,wow,wow, and so on and so on.</li>
            <li>We just wish the price point was lower considering how frequently you should floss....</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t break before you complete the cleaning</li>
            <li>They reach where traditional &amp;#34;finger floss&amp;#34; can&#x27;t reach and they&#x27;re comfortable in a way other handheld flossers aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the Reach flossers to the stand-alone ones because the long handle makes it much easier to get to the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li>It is becoming hard to find these in the grocery stores.  </li>
            <li>They can be a bit expensive when compared to a container of floss but for how easy they are to use and the time they save it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I am North of 60 and started going to a new, younger Dentist two years ago.</li>
            <li>They snap right on to &amp;#34;The Flosser&amp;#34; and make the task much less of a chore.</li>
            <li>but these flossers seriously make flossing so easy.  </li>
            <li>I have plenty to last me a long time, but this was affordable and came straight to my door.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Never going back to the old thing.</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I have been having a hard time finding the floss refills in stores, so I was excited to find them on Amazon in a three pack.  </li>
            <li>these new refills are not good at all, they break upon the first use.....</li>

            <li> lol my mom and</li>
            <li> These 28-count refills come in very handy.  </li>
            <li> Nice way to floss withut having to stick your hands in your mouth!</li>
            <li> No damage to the packaging, everything was intact and in good condition once I opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> they fit perfectly on the flosser.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Great for kids, too, as they can handle these better than floss.  </li>
            <li> Probably the best thing to do is to use a fresh one each time, but I use them 2-3 times and just rinse after each use and have never had any problems.</li>
            <li> make a mint-flavor that is good, and you need to own the Reach &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to attach them too since this is just re-fills, not the stick.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>

            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I knocked one star off because I don&#x27;t see why these can&#x27;t be produced and sold more cost effectively.</li>
            <li> I have a cavity prone 9 year old, and these have made a wonderful difference in her checkups, instead of asking...</li>
            <li> Good price for a very useful product.</li>
            <li> These give me the motivation I need to floss- makes the job so easy!</li>
            <li> Oh yes this is easy!  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love Reach Access Flossers!  </li>
            <li> They do the job just fine!</li>
            <li> I had a stroke in my forties &amp; my right hand never fully returned to normal function, so I have to use a handled flosser like this, &amp; these were the ones I liked best.</li>
            <li> Having refills in large volume is great.</li>
            <li> The mint is so refreshing; it&#x27;s like mouthwash and flossing rolled into one</li>
            <li> Quantity ordering makes the price much more tolerable.</li>
            <li> I love flossing with this.</li>
            <li> Better prices by about 20% and availability</li>
            <li> I just hope they are never discontinued! :)</li>
            <li> Ok - it&#x27;s dental floss, and it does what dental floss does.  </li>
            <li> These are much better than trying to use floss tape.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is great and these make flossing so much easier .</li>
            <li> My favorite flosser.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am amazed that many pharmacies don&#x27;t carry the refills and I am grateful to Amazon for providing a convenient on-line source.</li>
            <li> Prompt and Safe Undamaged Delivery Sealed works well with the applicator</li>
            <li> Great flosser, very minty.</li>
            <li> Best way to floss teeth regularly with minimum effort.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Reach flosser tool for many years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always complimented by my dental hygienist that my gums look healthy.  </li>
            <li> The Reach Access Flosser uses a much better quality floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> and I love floss my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much more ergonomic way to floss.  </li>
            <li> My dentist even noticed improvement at my last dental check up!  :D</li>
            <li> And I love that she does not have food in her teeth.</li>
            <li> Ok but maker has changed branding.</li>
            <li> I like the unflavored ones better than the mint.</li>
            <li> I am so glad my dentist turned me on to these</li>
            <li> and I hope they continue and get Lots more Merchandise to purchase ON-LINE.</li>

            <li> We would buy more if they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many problems with floss over the years.</li>
            <li> I would like it better if it were more durable but all in all works just like it is supposed to</li>
            <li> Should last a while now and the pricing is excellent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These refills cost way more than a container of string.</li>
            <li> how many cavities this time, we ask, are there any cavities?  </li>
            <li> I love these flossers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to find the fliossers.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to use up more words</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product, came as advertised, just like the product I used to be able to purchase locally.  </li>
            <li> So glad I can still get them here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than trying to get your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I love these they r so easy to use</li>
            <li> love it keeping teeth flossed is so easy for the entire family with the reach holder and these are a good price stocking stuffers too!</li>
            <li> The price was great and they even arrived early.</li>
            <li> More importantly because these items seems to be out Of stock everywhere.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good packaging.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just so much easier to use than floss, and do just as good a job.</li>
            <li> nice minty flavor...makes flossing fun</li>
            <li> The Reach Access Flosser is an effective flossing tool, and the premium is worth it.</li>
            <li> A far more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well.  </li>
            <li> Makes flossing easy.  </li>
            <li> the Reach Flosser makes it easy to do and takes them no time at all.  </li>
            <li> Keep looking until you find the original, unflavored Reach Access Flosser refills, and enjoy your clean mouth!  :-)</li>
            <li> These are the easy button for flossing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as easy as brushing my teeth, rather than an anxiety ridden ordeal.</li>
            <li> In comes the Access flosser, and now it&#x27;s easy to get to every side of every tooth, including the 4 wisdom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love them works really great and do not have to keep running back to store every 2 weeks like with others.</li>
            <li> first time I have liked to floss</li>
            <li> I cannot fit one of my fingers into my mouth to hold the floss, so these make flossing a twice a day an easy choir.</li>
            <li> I enjoy that this is a 3-pack and easy to find.</li>
            <li> The Reach Flosser is much more pleasant than forcing your fingers in your mouth with regular floss.</li>
            <li> The mint flavored flosses are a great change from the regular ones.</li>
            <li> It was just as it said it was and fit my requirements.</li>
            <li> I would like to have these be available with a travel size of wand and a travel container for them.</li>
            <li> These mint-flavored refills for my Reach Access Flosser really do the trick and leave a nice mint taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy shopping with Amazon</li>
            <li> They are a far superior way to floss.  </li>
            <li> Great for flossing daily and keeping your gums clean.  </li>
            <li> If you already have the arm which these attach to, flossing is easy and quick.</li>
            <li> dentist says they aren&#x27;t as good as real floss, but far better than nothing and</li>
            <li> Clean teeth</li>
            <li> Prefered the plain kind but didn&#x27;t find any as good a deal</li>
            <li> Great product..flosses as expected...</li>
            <li> But these mint flavored refills leave an extremely sickly sweet, and somewhat minty, taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get a much faster and deeper floss with these - about 1 minute of my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad for $12.</li>
            <li> I love using the Reach flosser since it makes flossing easy and not messy.</li>
            <li> Received quickly as always do with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Item came as order and quickly.</li>
            <li> - Arrived quick, as estimated.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and as promised.  </li>
            <li> This order came quickly and it was what I wanted - as advertised.  </li>
            <li> came quick.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> With these, I can regularly floss and reach those teeth, leading to better dental checkups!  </li>
            <li> Great little flossers</li>
            <li> Using it is like using a toothbrush, no awkward hand contortions and no aching fingertips.</li>
            <li> My periodontist was surprised to see at how healthy my gums have become</li>
            <li> Teeth get flossed, gums don&#x27;t bleed, mouth feels fresh...</li>
            <li> A good product and works as expected.</li>
            <li> My husband and 5 yr old use them and love them.</li>
            <li> Fresh mint smell.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, which is why I buy them in quantity.  </li>
            <li> These have made it possible for my kids to floss their own teeth well.  </li>
            <li> me, the whole point of flossing is to have a clean, fresh mouth.  </li>
            <li> The right price &amp; time to get them delivered.</li>
            <li> They have just the right amount of mint in there.</li>
            <li> I could never make the floss rub against my teeth the right way.</li>
            <li> The company shipped these right away</li>
            <li> The mint crystals make flossing a little more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Got these for my son - seem to work well and easy for his young hands to work with.</li>
            <li> But, I actually use them daily and my oral hygeine has been greatly enhanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> gave 5 star because they are hard to find in the stores and the pricew for them was right, great</li>
            <li> I was never able to floss effectively until I began using the Reach flossing tool, which I find extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is nice as well but definitely not the main selling point of these flosser refills.</li>
            <li> I like these more than the regular refuls because they are mint.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what they said it was</li>
            <li> I have been using the Reach flosser religiously on a daily basis for the past two years and attribute that use to the best checkup/cleaning I have had in decades.</li>
            <li> Love the Reach Access Flosser and use daily.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> exactly what I have been looking for in the grocery store but couldn&#x27;t find.  </li>
            <li> I discovered the Reach Access Flossers, I have no more problems, and am able to do a more thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> To me, they&#x27;re easier and more convenient than regular flossing.  </li>
            <li> absolutely a 5 star rating for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many, and finally found this.  </li>
            <li> Item came extremely fast!</li>
            <li> The price is better than I can find locally.</li>
            <li> My first purchase (not here) was the Dentek.  </li>
            <li> This was the first refill I&#x27;ve needed since seeing my hygienist in August.</li>
            <li> Obviously, make sure you have the handle.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> do sometimes have trouble finding the refills, so I&#x27;m delighted Amazon has them.</li>
            <li> and I find them very effective in removing hard to reach places between the teeth.</li>
            <li> extra bonus, is that the Floss String, is very sturdy, adding to a better cleaning.</li>
            <li> This makes it so much easier to reach the teeth way at the back of my mouth, and it does just as good a job as traditional floss.  </li>
            <li> Would be nice if they made a floss holder with the same dimensions so you could just be economical and use regular floss instead of paying for replacements.</li>
            <li> These easily reach way in the back and between the teeth.</li>
            <li> These should last someone 1-2 years easily.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than a brick and mortar store.  </li>
            <li> This tool makes it so much easier to string the floss in hard-to-reach places.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it really does.</li>
            <li> I was expecting mint flavored floss, but this has mint flavor on the sides of the flosser, and it&#x27;s really, really minty.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> My husbands teeth are really close together</li>
            <li> My whole family loves them now.</li>
            <li> Thanks - arrived promptly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quite repulsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Reach Access Flosser, it makes floss teeth much easier than before</li>
            <li> I really hope they don&#x27;t go out of production because this beats sticking your fingers in your mouth with a string of floss.</li>
            <li> thanks for carrying them.</li>
            <li> They are so much easier and quicker to use.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t fit my fat fingers into the back of my mouth, so my molars are neglected.</li>
            <li> They keep changing the design of the floss holder so we end up with either extra refills that don&#x27;t fit anything or a holder we can&#x27;t get refills for.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing your teeth so much easier.</li>
            <li> Just as described and works very well</li>
            <li> as with everything, these are MUCH cheaper on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> much easier/quicker to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good for lazy adults too!</li>
            <li> They snap on a long plastic handle which makes it easy for children  to reach between their teeth and floss their teeth themselves.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if using these is as good as real flossing, but it definitely helps me to &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; more regularly.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use, especially when you are reaching toward the back of you mouth.  </li>
            <li> Other have more of a minty flavor than these.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only so excited I can get about floss, but these make flossing way easier.</li>
            <li> Does the job, reasonably priced and I greatly prefer using this tool than using floss string alone because floss string requires a certain amount of manual agility and is even more difficult when your teeth are not perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> Great especially for teeth with very little space between.</li>
            <li> I use them every day and they work much better than conventional floss</li>
            <li> great for reaching the hard to reach places in the back of your mouth while flossing.</li>
            <li> so he sometimes has trouble using other flossers but he is able to use these without a problem They are hard to find around our area so being able to order them from Amazon really is handy.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend these, been using them for 4 years and don&#x27;t dread flossing my teeth since.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Could be a little more durable.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to release any form of negativity from their life, their family&#x27;s life, and their business or professional life.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without these refills.  </li>
            <li> My tight teeth break these fairly easily, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the floss.</li>
            <li> I love Reach Access Flossers - no more sticking your fingers in your mouth</li>
            <li> I hope Ms Burney writes more books on the subject as I highly respect her as a spiritual healer, teacher and now author.  </li>
            <li> We have been clients of hers for many years both personally and professionally and purchased her book to keep our personal lives and professional healing practice clear in between spiritual tune ups from Ms. Burney.  </li>
            <li> Easy to snap on and really help floss hard to reach teeth.</li>
            <li> When I purchased these it was because I couldn&#x27;t find them at stores, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> Actually floss too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just listing simple details at this point, there isn&#x27;t much to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 71 years old</li>
            <li> wow wow,wow,wow, and so on and so on.</li>
            <li> We just wish the price point was lower considering how frequently you should floss....</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t break before you complete the cleaning</li>
            <li> They reach where traditional &amp;#34;finger floss&amp;#34; can&#x27;t reach and they&#x27;re comfortable in a way other handheld flossers aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Reach flossers to the stand-alone ones because the long handle makes it much easier to get to the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> It is becoming hard to find these in the grocery stores.  </li>
            <li> They can be a bit expensive when compared to a container of floss but for how easy they are to use and the time they save it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I am North of 60 and started going to a new, younger Dentist two years ago.</li>
            <li> They snap right on to &amp;#34;The Flosser&amp;#34; and make the task much less of a chore.</li>
            <li> but these flossers seriously make flossing so easy.  </li>
            <li> I have plenty to last me a long time, but this was affordable and came straight to my door.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Never going back to the old thing.</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have been having a hard time finding the floss refills in stores, so I was excited to find them on Amazon in a three pack.  </li>
            <li> these new refills are not good at all, they break upon the first use.....</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t buy them for the mint; I bought them for the extreme ease of use that Reach offers.</li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time reaching the teeth in the back and these make it so much easier!</li>
            <li> If you have kids and have a hard time getting to them to floss consistently</li>
            <li> Buy a couple of them, though, because they don&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me about these a few years ago, and they&#x27;re getting harder and harder to find, but they&#x27;re worth the money.</li>
            <li> For some reason, these are really hard to find in my town (and possibly in yours), so thank goodness Amazon ships them so fast with Prime</li>
            <li> I find most other flossers to be too thick or stiff.</li>
            <li> and I can get my back teeth with very little to no trouble at all. ^_^</li>
            <li> they are much better then cutting off my circulation using dental floss.</li>
            <li> I have been using these flossers for a long time</li>
            <li> The long handle helps to reach every tooth and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Flossers as pictured and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I hope they will continue to have these flosser refills for a long while...  </li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re rinsing the floss off after each use, you can floss with each one until it breaks</li>
            <li> Now i have enough to last for a bit, and these are oddly not easy to find locally.</li>
            <li> love them next to impossible to find in albuquerque</li>
            <li> Other floss-holders I have tried were still too big.</li>
            <li> and it was hard for me to reach the very back of the teeth by using old style floss technique, which is wrapping floss around the fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Until</li>
            <li> was not flossing regularly with conventional string floss due to the difficulty of getting my fat fingers to all the areas of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Came as and when expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived in time; product exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> This was as expected.</li>
            <li> everything as expected.  </li>
            <li> I found the \\&quot;electric\\&quot;, battery operated Reach flosser a few years back and bought a few, gave one to my husband and also bought a few of the regular flossers to put in travel bags.</li>
            <li> Like it but not as much as other mint flosser refills.  </li>
            <li> I have used these in the past but to find them in the local store is almost always a challenge.  </li>
            <li> (unfortunately, the minty flavor will go away after the first 3-4 flossing sessions).</li>
            <li> With floss it was too difficult, and many of the smaller flossers were too big or awkward for her little mouth.  </li>
            <li> you have any difficulty in reaching areas with conventional floss, give them a try.</li>
            <li> Bought these to make it easier to floss hard to reach spots in the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It slips, it&#x27;s hard to reach back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I love this flosser because I hate wrapping dental floss around my fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble flossing my teeth due to tight spacing.</li>
            <li> have Scleroderma, and the &#x27;tightening of the skin&#x27;, around my mouth, makes it quite difficult to use a normal flosser.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> I tie the floss too tight, so my fingers turn purple.</li>
            <li> Reach is really small and fits back into the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t got the flossing tool, and stumbled upon this review as a result of Amazon search, then you might consider buying one and then buying refills if you&#x27;re tired of the ends of your fingers turning red from the conventional floss &amp;#34;tourniquet&amp;#34; technique (wrapping floss around your fingers).</li>
            <li> Yes, I know hate is a strong word.  </li>
            <li> Note these tips have mint flavor infused in them which is an added little bonus.</li>
            <li> These little minty refills are tasty too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Reach Access Flossers for quite a few Years, and they work great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why these are not generally  available.</li>
            <li> The order arrived a few days after I ordered them.  </li>
            <li> few tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have back teeth that are tight and difficult to reach without stretching the corners of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I always hate wrapping the floss around my fingers, and then nearly gagging when I have to get to my back teeth!  </li>
            <li> The floss would break, shred, snap hard and cause my gums to bleed, and my fingers would turn purple and hurt from the floss wound too tightly around them.</li>
            <li> No more sticking your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li> dentist kept saying: floss everyday!  </li>
            <li> No more hurt fingers and torn nails.  </li>
            <li> I had been unable to find them in local stores.</li>
            <li> will only want to use each one maybe twice, after that, you will see that the fibers on the floss strip away, leaving just a very thin filament piece that will hurt your gums if you use it alone.  </li>
            <li> I took a star off because I find the packaging annoying, really common for me to dump a week&#x27;s worth of refills in the sink or on the floor trying to get one out of the package.</li>
            <li> Before I never liked floss my teeth because I have a small mouth</li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get your fingers around the floss without it digging in and causing frustration.</li>
            <li> They are just getting hard to find on retail store shelf.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find Reach floss refills these days.  </li>
            <li> I hardly see them anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
            <li> Getting hard to find for some reason.  </li>
            <li> I have no more to say about this product!</li>
            <li> Now I can actually floss without cutting off the circulation in my fingers, which was bad because I already have circulatory issues in my fingers and the affects would last for hours.  </li>
            <li> No more frustrating wax flossing trying to get in-between teeth.</li>
            <li> I hate normal floss.  </li>
            <li> I hate normal floss.  </li>
            <li> Shocked by what they charge in the stores for the same product!  </li>
            <li> This is the thing for you if your mouth finds it hard to accomodate two hands and a line of floss!  </li>
            <li> and though I have tried never could....until I found these little jewels!!!  </li>
            <li> The mint flavor is very subtle, not overpowering whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> always hated REGULAR flossing, it cuts into and hurts my fingers.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical...</li>
            <li> Expensive but work well.</li>
            <li> These things are so expensive everywhere.</li>
            <li> I was having a difficult time flossing until I tried the Reach Access Flosser.  </li>
            <li> I know that seems petty, but I legitimately don&#x27;t want to start my day off frustrated by my subpar flossing capabilities.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> I typically hate flossing</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> I used to hate flossing until my niece introduced me to the Reach flosser.  </li>
            <li> They hated the string type flosses.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product! Came as and when expected. Also it seemed like the best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> Easy to snap on and really help floss hard to reach teeth. The mint is so refreshing; it&#x27;s like mouthwash and flossing rolled into one</li>
            <li> Breaking out after 2 use</li>
            <li> These give me the motivation I need to floss- makes the job so easy! Hard to find. Great value. Just as advertised. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than a brick and mortar store.  I like these more than the regular refuls because they are mint.  great for reaching the hard to reach places in the back of your mouth while flossing.</li>
            <li> Quantity ordering makes the price much more tolerable. I cannot fit one of my fingers into my mouth to hold the floss, so these make flossing a twice a day an easy choir.</li>
            <li> I love flossing with this. No more sticking your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without these refills.  I typically hate flossing but these flossers seriously make flossing so easy.  They glide effortlessly between the teeth and pull out a ton of gunk.  The mint flavor is nice as well but definitely not the main selling point of these flosser refills.</li>
            <li> these are always sold out at our local store.  it is nice to find them in a quantity pack.  Easier to use than regular dental floss.</li>
            <li> This is the best flossing system I have found. My hands are too big to floss with and the type that you wrap the floss around never worked. These easily reach way in the back and between the teeth. They can be a bit expensive when compared to a container of floss but for how easy they are to use and the time they save it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor pieces fall off in the package.</li>
            <li> Does the job, reasonably priced and I greatly prefer using this tool than using floss string alone because floss string requires a certain amount of manual agility and is even more difficult when your teeth are not perfectly straight. This tool makes it so much easier to string the floss in hard-to-reach places. I use about one each week so this packet will last me for a while.</li>
            <li> I actually floss now!  My Dentist was impressed.  It was exactly what they said it was</li>
            <li> I was having problems finding these refills locally when I decided to check Amazon. Better prices by about 20% and availability so I purchased three 3 packs.  I am North of 60 and started going to a new, younger Dentist two years ago. Had lots of problems with bleeding gums. Had to do the periodontal cleaning and the Dentist suggested using the Reach flosser because I had problems with getting my fat fingers back into the back of my mouth.  At my last check up in December, the hygienist told me that she did not see a bit of bleeding.  I have been using the Reach flosser religiously on a daily basis for the past two years and attribute that use to the best checkup/cleaning I have had in decades.</li>
            <li> Perfect product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This system has turned me into a flosser. I took a star off because I find the packaging annoying, really common for me to dump a week&#x27;s worth of refills in the sink or on the floor trying to get one out of the package. I now transfer them all into a tupperware-type container, which i souldn&#x27;t have to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble flossing my teeth due to tight spacing. The floss would break, shred, snap hard and cause my gums to bleed, and my fingers would turn purple and hurt from the floss wound too tightly around them. I found the \\&quot;electric\\&quot;, battery operated Reach flosser a few years back and bought a few, gave one to my husband and also bought a few of the regular flossers to put in travel bags. The floss holds up well and doesn&#x27;t begin to shred. The mint flavored flosses are a great change from the regular ones. Makes flossing every day a pleasure instead of a chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do sometimes have trouble finding the refills, so I&#x27;m delighted Amazon has them. I just hope they are never discontinued! :)</li>
            <li> When I purchased these it was because I couldn&#x27;t find them at stores, which surprised me. I had a stroke in my forties &amp; my right hand never fully returned to normal function, so I have to use a handled flosser like this, &amp; these were the ones I liked best. They also have a breath freshner that works as you floss. The right price &amp; time to get them delivered.</li>
            <li> Like it but not as much as other mint flosser refills.  Other have more of a minty flavor than these.  However, WalMart doesn&#x27;t have them any longer.  I was disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> I have often tried to convince my dentist that flossing is the devil&#x27;s work. I hate it. It&#x27;s hard to get your fingers around the floss without it digging in and causing frustration. I know that seems petty, but I legitimately don&#x27;t want to start my day off frustrated by my subpar flossing capabilities. Bah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At my last dentist visit I was given the Reach Access Flosser sample pack. I was skeptical... then optimistic... then a total flossing fan girl. The Reach makes it effortless. Using it is like using a toothbrush, no awkward hand contortions and no aching fingertips. It&#x27;s solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this multipack of refills is a great price. The flosser tip doesn&#x27;t get replaced every time you use it. Rinse it off after using it and replace it about once a week. This pack will seemingly last months. Note these tips have mint flavor infused in them which is an added little bonus.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these anywhere local anymore. Makes flossing a joy. Yeah, it really does.</li>
            <li> Seller Provided Quality Service. Also this is a great product!</li>
            <li> These are the only flossers that I use. I find most other flossers to be too thick or stiff. The mint crystals make flossing a little more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> love it keeping teeth flossed is so easy for the entire family with the reach holder and these are a good price stocking stuffers too!</li>
            <li> This is the only way I can floss my teeth because they are so close together.  It even reaches the back teeth!</li>
            <li> Great for flossing daily and keeping your gums clean.  Does not taste anything like mint no flavor but it got my flossing done</li>
            <li> Ok - it&#x27;s dental floss, and it does what dental floss does.  I was expecting mint flavored floss, but this has mint flavor on the sides of the flosser, and it&#x27;s really, really minty.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these, been using them for 4 years and don&#x27;t dread flossing my teeth since. The Reach Flosser is much more pleasant than forcing your fingers in your mouth with regular floss.</li>
            <li> I have been using these flossers for a long time and I find them very effective in removing hard to reach places between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Arrived in time; product exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Expensive but work well.</li>
            <li> I love these they r so easy to use and I can get my back teeth with very little to no trouble at all. ^_^</li>
            <li> This floss product makes flossing a pleasure.  Very easy to use. Refills last acouple days.  Does an excellent job.  Don&#x27;t have to struggle to get all areas.</li>
            <li> Received quickly as always do with Amazon. Love the Reach Access Flosser and use daily. The long handle helps to reach every tooth and wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> exactly what I have been looking for in the grocery store but couldn&#x27;t find.  Thanks</li>
            <li> These are great!  Easy to use and works well.  These are much better than trying to use floss tape. My husbands teeth are really close together so he sometimes has trouble using other flossers but he is able to use these without a problem They are hard to find around our area so being able to order them from Amazon really is handy.  Love these!</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is great and these make flossing so much easier . You can also just carry one in your purse.</li>
            <li> My favorite flosser.  This thing got me to floss daily!</li>
            <li> these new refills are not good at all, they break upon the first use.....they used to be wonderful... what happened??????</li>
            <li> Diana Burney has captured in book form what she so expertly does in person.  We have been clients of hers for many years both personally and professionally and purchased her book to keep our personal lives and professional healing practice clear in between spiritual tune ups from Ms. Burney.  The book is both easy to read and use and gives great tools and explanations as to how and why to perform the exercises.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to release any form of negativity from their life, their family&#x27;s life, and their business or professional life.  I hope Ms Burney writes more books on the subject as I highly respect her as a spiritual healer, teacher and now author.  Congratulations on a great book!&lt;br /&gt;I.W. Chicago, IL</li>
            <li> Excellent to outstanding!</li>
            <li> My husband likes these and it helps to buy them in a larger quantity. Flossers as pictured and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Love it. Actually floss too much. My whole family loves them now. I gave as presents to everyone.</li>
            <li> These things are so expensive everywhere.</li>
            <li> If you need it out from in between your teeth, this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It was just as it said it was and fit my requirements. That makes it a 5 star since I can&#x27;t think of a way to improve it or the delivery.</li>
            <li> I was never able to floss effectively until I began using the Reach flossing tool, which I find extremely easy to use. My periodontist was surprised to see at how healthy my gums have become and I can think of only one reason for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed that many pharmacies don&#x27;t carry the refills and I am grateful to Amazon for providing a convenient on-line source. If I could not replenish my supply I would consider it a disaster.</li>
            <li> Item came as order and quickly. I would consider ordering again in time. I have plenty to last me a long time, but this was affordable and came straight to my door.</li>
            <li> It is becoming hard to find these in the grocery stores.  The product itself is great as the flosser works as needed.  The only downfall is the price of paying for them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Prompt and Safe Undamaged Delivery Sealed works well with the applicator</li>
            <li> Great flosser, very minty. Works with The Reach Floss Handle.  Great especially for teeth with very little space between. The price was great and they even arrived early.</li>
            <li> I have used these in the past but to find them in the local store is almost always a challenge.  I will like that I can order the multiple packs so that I have plenty on hand.  I would like to have these be available with a travel size of wand and a travel container for them.</li>
            <li> Thanks - arrived promptly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> first time I have liked to floss</li>
            <li> Makes flossing easy.  I&#x27;m not sure if using these is as good as real flossing, but it definitely helps me to &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; more regularly.</li>
            <li> Best way to floss teeth regularly with minimum effort.  If you have kids and have a hard time getting to them to floss consistently the Reach Flosser makes it easy to do and takes them no time at all.  Good for lazy adults too!</li>
            <li> These mint-flavored refills for my Reach Access Flosser really do the trick and leave a nice mint taste in my mouth.  High quality product and the best flossing device I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Reach flosser tool for many years.  I&#x27;m always complimented by my dental hygienist that my gums look healthy.  Use this flosser just 30 seconds once or twice a day and you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> My local store replaced these with the Listerine brand.  The Reach Access Flosser uses a much better quality floss.</li>
            <li> - Arrived quick, as estimated.&lt;br /&gt;- No damage to the packaging, everything was intact and in good condition once I opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;- Everything accounted for. I&#x27;m just listing simple details at this point, there isn&#x27;t much to say. I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. It was a nice deal.</li>
            <li> Teeth get flossed, gums don&#x27;t bleed, mouth feels fresh... it&#x27;s a trifecta of goodness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hater - I love, love, love Reach Access Flossers!  But all the local stores quit stocking the regular refills, and started stocking these &amp;#34;mint flavored&amp;#34; refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the whole point of flossing is to have a clean, fresh mouth.  Well, that, and it makes visits to the dentist much more pleasant.  But these mint flavored refills leave an extremely sickly sweet, and somewhat minty, taste in my mouth.  It&#x27;s really quite repulsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: move on.  Keep looking until you find the original, unflavored Reach Access Flosser refills, and enjoy your clean mouth!  :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get a much faster and deeper floss with these - about 1 minute of my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is compared to holding a string that you have to spend time maneuvering in your mouth for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never going back to the old thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Reach Access Flossers for quite a few Years, and they work great.&lt;br /&gt;I have Scleroderma, and the &#x27;tightening of the skin&#x27;, around my mouth, makes it quite difficult to use a normal flosser.&lt;br /&gt;Since I discovered the Reach Access Flossers, I have no more problems, and am able to do a more thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The Flavored Refills (Mint, Tooth Paste) leave My mouth feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;One extra bonus, is that the Floss String, is very sturdy, adding to a better cleaning.</li>
            <li> Delicious! These are the easy button for flossing. Love them! My dentist says thank you.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. All was in tact. Now i have enough to last for a bit, and these are oddly not easy to find locally.</li>
            <li> Why has Wal Mart and Walgreens no longer carrying these things. I have used them for awhile now, would like to continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Before I never liked floss my teeth because I have a small mouth and it was hard for me to reach the very back of the teeth by using old style floss technique, which is wrapping floss around the fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Until I use Reach Access Flosser, it makes floss teeth much easier than before and I love floss my teeth. I&#x27;ve been using Reach Access for years.</li>
            <li> great and very handy to keep available</li>
            <li> Bought these to make it easier to floss hard to reach spots in the back of my mouth.  To me, they&#x27;re easier and more convenient than regular flossing.  That said, the cost of these does add up over time.  I knocked one star off because I don&#x27;t see why these can&#x27;t be produced and sold more cost effectively.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much more ergonomic way to floss.  The mint flavor helps too.  The 3 pack is a great value.  They snap right on to &amp;#34;The Flosser&amp;#34; and make the task much less of a chore.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product and I like it as well!  I have no more to say about this product!</li>
            <li> I was having a difficult time flossing until I tried the Reach Access Flosser.  Now I can actually floss without cutting off the circulation in my fingers, which was bad because I already have circulatory issues in my fingers and the affects would last for hours.  I have been having a hard time finding the floss refills in stores, so I was excited to find them on Amazon in a three pack.  The item arrived promptly and saved me from driving all over town looking for the refills.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It came sealed and bundled together neatly.  I was happy that I could buy these floss refills.  I could not find them at my regular stores.  The Reach Access Flosser is the best floss stick!  I hope they will continue to have these flosser refills for a long while...  Free Super Saver Shipping is the best!</li>
            <li> This is the thing for you if your mouth finds it hard to accomodate two hands and a line of floss!  I have back teeth that are tight and difficult to reach without stretching the corners of my mouth.  With these, I can regularly floss and reach those teeth, leading to better dental checkups!  Great for kids, too, as they can handle these better than floss.  You need the Reach Access Flosser, under $3 at Amazon, to use these.  One refill, if rinsed well, will work for morning and evening flossing.  Don&#x27;t forget to floss the surface of both teeth, not just in-between.</li>
            <li> Love them! They have just the right amount of mint in there. they fit perfectly on the flosser. and they are a 3 pack at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those who could never floss!!!!  Couldn&#x27;t reach back and floss those back teeth....dentist kept saying: floss everyday!  I&#x27;m 71 years old and though I have tried never could....until I found these little jewels!!!  Oh yes this is easy!  and they leave a good taste in your mouth too!  absolutely a 5 star rating for me!</li>
            <li> Great buy! More importantly because these items seems to be out Of stock everywhere. There are no retailers carrying it that I know of</li>
            <li> The product is a great kelp...it is directed at those of us who don&#x27;t floss the way our dentists&#x27; would prefer!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t floss unless I have a Reach flosser.  No more frustrating wax flossing trying to get in-between teeth. This makes flossing a breeze. My dentist even noticed improvement at my last dental check up!  :D</li>
            <li> I always use these. They work great.</li>
            <li> Great price, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> A good product and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Nice way to floss withut having to stick your hands in your mouth!</li>
            <li> I used to hate flossing until my niece introduced me to the Reach flosser.  This makes it so much easier to reach the teeth way at the back of my mouth, and it does just as good a job as traditional floss.  These little minty refills are tasty too.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Reach floss products for years. No doubt the best way to floss and maneuver every detail of your teeth. They are just getting hard to find on retail store shelf.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution for flossing. Don&#x27;t know why these are not generally  available.</li>
            <li> Absolutely happy with this order and how quickly it was delivered.  The best!!</li>
            <li> Great, can&#x27;t seem to find them in the drug stores!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  No more hurt fingers and torn nails.  Wish I had known about these years ago.</li>
            <li> This was as expected. Price is good.</li>
            <li> Very good. Have used them before.</li>
            <li> My husband and 5 yr old use them and love them. Fresh mint smell.</li>
            <li> I love Reach Access Flossers - no more sticking your fingers in your mouth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many, and finally found this.  They still break occasionally but it&#x27;s the only thing that works.  Worth the price, which is why I buy them in quantity.  The mint taste is nice.</li>
            <li> does exactly what it says on the tin ... and at a great price!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves these.  And I love that she does not have food in her teeth.</li>
            <li> Ok but maker has changed branding.</li>
            <li> On time and as promised.  I&#x27;ve been using these for years and they work great.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time.  The place where I purchased them, never carries refills???  Thank God this store had them.  I use them every day and they work much better than conventional floss</li>
            <li> I hate normal floss.  Yes, I know hate is a strong word.  It doesn&#x27;t matter.  I hate normal floss.  With Reach, flossing is so relatively simple.  These 28-count refills come in very handy.  Buy a couple of them, though, because they don&#x27;t last that long.  The mint flavor is very subtle, not overpowering whatsoever.  In fact, it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  But I didn&#x27;t buy them for the mint; I bought them for the extreme ease of use that Reach offers.</li>
            <li> I like the unflavored ones better than the mint.</li>
            <li> Item came extremely fast! Exactly what I needed and the price was very fair. The directions say to replace each day but that&#x27;s not necessary and wasteful. I dip mine into some mouth wash after each use and rinse it. I only replace them every week or two and my dentist always compliments my flossing. These should last someone 1-2 years easily. Not bad for $12.</li>
            <li> love them next to impossible to find in albuquerque</li>
            <li> They do the job just fine!</li>
            <li> I was buying these at Walmart and now they don&#x27;t carry them. My husband and I both use these daily. Great find and price</li>
            <li> I have used this type of flosser for years  They are very easy to use, especially when you are reaching toward the back of you mouth.  I like having a good supply on hand even though you can reuse each flosser a number of times.  The price is better than I can find locally.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and as promised.  Great price on these, too.  There&#x27;s only so excited I can get about floss, but these make flossing way easier.</li>
            <li> I exclusively floss with the Reach Access and while it is WAY more expensive than traditional floss, I WILL floss if I use these. If you don&#x27;t like flossing because you don&#x27;t like wrapping it on your fingers and jamming your fingers in your mouth, you should try this. A far more pleasant experience. The mint flavor is a really nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my kids (18 and 21).  This product is the only way I could get my kids to floss.  They hated the string type flosses.  One of the greatest inventions for kids.  They are still flossing every day with this tool.  I highly recommend.  Will buy again.  Fast delivery and good packaging.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> If you have hand and or wrist and or finger problems which make normal flossing difficult, these (in conjunction with the Reach handle sold seperately) are a true godsend and will allow you to floss without difficulty.</li>
            <li> Great product..flosses as expected...great mint taste!</li>
            <li> I use these flossers because they are easier to use than just the regular floss in the dispenser.  Easier to get to all of your teeth.</li>
            <li> I needed flosser refills and these from Amazon fitted the bill perfectly at a good price :-)</li>
            <li> It is hard to find Reach floss refills these days.  I enjoy that this is a 3-pack and easy to find.</li>
            <li> I am so glad my dentist turned me on to these they are much better then cutting off my circulation using dental floss.</li>
            <li> I ordered these refills for my grandchildren&#x27;s flosser handles.. They snap on a long plastic handle which makes it easy for children  to reach between their teeth and floss their teeth themselves.  The order arrived a few days after I ordered them.  I had been unable to find them in local stores. I will order refills from this vendor again whenever we begin to run out.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me about these a few years ago, and they&#x27;re getting harder and harder to find, but they&#x27;re worth the money. They&#x27;re just so much easier to use than floss, and do just as good a job. If you don&#x27;t like cramming your fingers into your mouth either, then try this.</li>
            <li> I, too, used to get these at Walmart. Last time I bought them they were at Walgreens. I bought the last ones on the shelf that day. I really hope they don&#x27;t go out of production because this beats sticking your fingers in your mouth with a string of floss. Like Tony the Tiger would say, \\&quot;they&#x27;re G-R-E-A-T!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> awesome,wow,wow,wow, wow wow,wow,wow, and so on and so on. i would hope everybody would use this product. thanks for carrying them.</li>
            <li> Got these for my son - seem to work well and easy for his young hands to work with.</li>
            <li> nice minty flavor...makes flossing fun</li>
            <li> Prefered the plain kind but didn&#x27;t find any as good a deal</li>
            <li> Amazon products help me a great deal and I hope they continue and get Lots more Merchandise to purchase ON-LINE.</li>
            <li> I love this flosser because I hate wrapping dental floss around my fingers. These also have a nice minty taste.</li>
            <li> I love these minty flossers. I have always used the Reach flooser with the handle and using these refills is a breeze...</li>
            <li> I have been wanting use these kind of flosses over the ones you wrap around your fingers.  They are so much easier and quicker to use.  My first purchase (not here) was the Dentek.  Big mistake!  Dentek catches on your tooth and just dangles there, and is a pain to use.  I will always use Reach from now on!</li>
            <li> We love Reach Access flossers.  We just wish the price point was lower considering how frequently you should floss.... 1-2 times per day!  We reuse them, which isn&#x27;t ideal.  We would buy more if they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> The best flosser ever</li>
            <li> I like these.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Could be a little more durable.  the floss keep breaking when I floss my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many problems with floss over the years. I can&#x27;t fit my fat fingers into the back of my mouth, so my molars are neglected. I tie the floss too tight, so my fingers turn purple. I could never make the floss rub against my teeth the right way. I ended up not flossing, and thus, neglecting my dental health. 17 cavities. It was bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my dentist, Dr. Janssen, turned me onto these access flossers. They are wonderful. They reach where traditional &amp;#34;finger floss&amp;#34; can&#x27;t reach and they&#x27;re comfortable in a way other handheld flossers aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s as easy as brushing my teeth, rather than an anxiety ridden ordeal. After six months of using them, I came back for my cleaning and it only lasted 20 minutes. That&#x27;s what 2 brushings and a flossing a day will do for you! But I couldn&#x27;t have kept up that routine without these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend these (with the handle, of course) if you find yourself ignoring your flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. You can ignore the manufacturer&#x27;s advice to discard them after one use. As long as you&#x27;re rinsing the floss off after each use, you can floss with each one until it breaks (unfortunately, the minty flavor will go away after the first 3-4 flossing sessions). This was the first refill I&#x27;ve needed since seeing my hygienist in August. They last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;2. Obviously, make sure you have the handle. Otherwise they&#x27;re useless.&lt;br /&gt;3. For some reason, these are really hard to find in my town (and possibly in yours), so thank goodness Amazon ships them so fast with Prime Membership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy flossing!</li>
            <li> Strength of floss is excellent.  Can be used several times and does not break.  Price is just as good as in store price.</li>
            <li> I always hate wrapping the floss around my fingers, and then nearly gagging when I have to get to my back teeth!  If you already have the arm which these attach to, flossing is easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Fits like a charm and has a mint flavor to it. I would like it better if it were more durable but all in all works just like it is supposed to</li>
            <li> These are like fish lips in retail stores around here. I hardly see them anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon FTW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, these work great.</li>
            <li> Getting hard to find for some reason.  Should last a while now and the pricing is excellent.</li>
            <li> As advertised!  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My tight teeth break these fairly easily, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the floss. My regular floss breaks too. I have large-ish hands, so this product was a godsend for me. Other floss-holders I have tried were still too big. Reach is really small and fits back into the hard to reach places. Would be nice if they made a floss holder with the same dimensions so you could just be economical and use regular floss instead of paying for replacements.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Access flossers for months now. They are a far superior way to floss.  I bought this flavor and have now run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not flossing regularly with conventional string floss due to the difficulty of getting my fat fingers to all the areas of my mouth. In comes the Access flosser, and now it&#x27;s easy to get to every side of every tooth, including the 4 wisdom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These refills cost way more than a container of string. But, I actually use them daily and my oral hygeine has been greatly enhanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any difficulty in reaching areas with conventional floss, give them a try. You&#x27;ll like them.</li>
            <li> This order came quickly and it was what I wanted - as advertised.  I enjoy shopping with Amazon and it&#x27;s carriers because it saves searching stores for the items I need.</li>
            <li> I buy the reach flosser and refills for my husband on the advice of his dentist (I use a Water Pick). He likes them a lot and they last a long time. The company shipped these right away and they arrived in good shape. The only issue I have is with the Reach company. They keep changing the design of the floss holder so we end up with either extra refills that don&#x27;t fit anything or a holder we can&#x27;t get refills for.</li>
            <li> Great little flossers</li>
            <li> These have made it possible for my kids to floss their own teeth well.  I have a cavity prone 9 year old, and these have made a wonderful difference in her checkups, instead of asking... how many cavities this time, we ask, are there any cavities?  I even use them to floss my 2 year olds teeth and she doesn&#x27;t complain.  With floss it was too difficult, and many of the smaller flossers were too big or awkward for her little mouth.  We love these!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying these refills, it&#x27;s because you already own the flossing tool (and you presumably like it, too). So buy these refills to save some money over refills purchased at your local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t got the flossing tool, and stumbled upon this review as a result of Amazon search, then you might consider buying one and then buying refills if you&#x27;re tired of the ends of your fingers turning red from the conventional floss &amp;#34;tourniquet&amp;#34; technique (wrapping floss around your fingers). The Reach Access Flosser is an effective flossing tool, and the premium is worth it.</li>
            <li> I love these flossers.  I have always had a hard time reaching the teeth in the back and these make it so much easier!</li>
            <li> Shocked by what they charge in the stores for the same product!  I love using the Reach flosser since it makes flossing easy and not messy.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing your teeth so much easier. I much prefer the Reach flossers to the stand-alone ones because the long handle makes it much easier to get to the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Use these all the time. Having refills in large volume is great.</li>
            <li> Like the concept but they seem to be sweetened with something because they hurt my teeth afterwards.</li>
            <li> Arrived intact and on time and as promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to find the fliossers.  I can&#x27;t find them in the drugstore anymore.</li>
            <li> Reach Flossers are great for quick touch-ups before you go out, or post-meal cleanings after something like corn-on-the-cob.  They&#x27;re fast and easy.  You also need a Reach Access Flosser, which is a handle that holds the Flosser Refills.  Both are required to have a useable \\&quot;system\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Had no idea I could buy this through Amazon Prime... Works as advertised on my &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; flosser. Great price, delivered in two days and I didn&#x27;t have to fight traffic to get to the drug store.</li>
            <li> everything as expected.  Now I have to use up more words so I&#x27;ll type some nonsense in here and finish</li>
            <li> gave 5 star because they are hard to find in the stores and the pricew for them was right, great</li>
            <li> The bottom line here are the rave reviews I get from my dentist and hygienist saying &amp;#34;You take great care of your teeth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Good price for a very useful product.</li>
            <li> just in case anyone&#x27;s wondering. they send you three 28 packs. total of 84 flosser refills. lol my mom and I had a big debate about this.</li>
            <li> Just as described and works very well</li>
            <li> They stopped carrying these in the stores in my area and then I thought - you can find anything on Amazon!  Very happy with the product, came as advertised, just like the product I used to be able to purchase locally.  So glad I can still get them here.</li>
            <li> My wife just loves to use these with the holder.  It&#x27;s better than trying to get your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Best way to floss EVER! None of the problems that regular flossing has:&lt;br /&gt;I always hated REGULAR flossing, it cuts into and hurts my fingers. It slips, it&#x27;s hard to reach back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Once you learn the tricks this is the greatest. I can floss while driving.</li>
            <li> came quick.  exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> I have used for a number of years and is the only way I will floss</li>
            <li> I like these a lot and have used them for years.  I used to buy them at Wallgreen&#x27;s but as with everything, these are MUCH cheaper on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist says they aren&#x27;t as good as real floss, but far better than nothing and much easier/quicker to use.&lt;br /&gt;They make a mint-flavor that is good, and you need to own the Reach &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to attach them too since this is just re-fills, not the stick.&lt;br /&gt;You will only want to use each one maybe twice, after that, you will see that the fibers on the floss strip away, leaving just a very thin filament piece that will hurt your gums if you use it alone.  Probably the best thing to do is to use a fresh one each time, but I use them 2-3 times and just rinse after each use and have never had any problems.</li>
            <li> Wonderful minty flavor.</li>
            <li> Clean teeth well and they don&#x27;t break before you complete the cleaning</li>
            <li> love them works really great and do not have to keep running back to store every 2 weeks like with others. Good supply!</li>
