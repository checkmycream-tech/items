            <li>The inside product is a clay like mask that smells like sand at the beach and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This clay mask is very smooth and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product.</li>

            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I will update if anything changes. :]</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>innisfree is a great Korean brand, because, their main ingredients come from Jeju island, their packaging are made of recycled paper, their labels made of tangerine skin and innisfree is trying to be earth friendly.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Skin so smooth after wash.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by a friend who live in Iteawon, Korea and apparently it is one of the best and affordable product with  Etude House</li>
            <li>But it does smells nice and the packaging is very environmental friendly though.</li>
            <li>People with very, very oily skin will appreciate this mask and find more use out of it, though.</li>
            <li>This product got hyped up and I was really excited to try it</li>
            <li>Love it so much !  </li>
            <li>My blackheads aren&#x27;t completely gone, but they&#x27;re so much better!</li>
            <li>It went on very smooth and you didn&#x27;t need to use much, but it was nothing special.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling amazing, super soft like a baby!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take some time to get it all off with water when you use the full mask, so I&#x27;d recommend putting this on before you plan to take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product came quickly even though it was shipped from Korea.</li>
            <li>Worth to try</li>
            <li>, i tried this one in my mom and sister too and they love the finish of the mask, you feel your pores really clean, the only thing is after you use it you have to mosturize your skin</li>
            <li>After I finish using it my face feels so smooth clear and clean.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everyone yo enjoy.</li>
            <li>Then it slowly hardens just a bit, not to the point where you can&#x27;t move your face and you just get some warm water and wash it off and your face is feeling baby butt smooth!</li>
            <li>International shipping and packaged very securely.</li>
            <li>AWARE THAT SELLER TO ITS CUSTOMERS.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
            <li>:) i havent seen obvious effects on pores</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it leaves one&#x27;s face feeling cool, soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and it gets worse during hot humid summers and this products is great as a weekly face mask.</li>
            <li>Leave the skin very soft right after wash off the mask.  </li>
            <li>though it helped my oily/acne prone skin for a little while, it wasn&#x27;t amazing.</li>
            <li>I still like it, it leaves my skin feeling soft and tightens my pores just slightly but other than that, not all that awesome.</li>
            <li>I say that because I primarily use this on my nose, where I have a pore problem and I suddenly started getting pimples on my nose instead of just blackheads.</li>
            <li>It really cleared some of the acne spots on my chin</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitiv</li>
            <li>I have been using it daily for about 5-6 days on the advice of an esthetician and plan to go a full 14 to see if it can completely eradicate my blackheads.</li>
            <li>I used different brands mud masks and nothing like this volcano clay mask, you can see the result right away.  </li>
            <li>leave my skin very soft</li>
            <li>very natural</li>
            <li>34 year old white male with huge pores.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure if this made my face break out more or not.</li>
            <li>I bought the Jeju Volcanic Pore Mask as a last attempt to get rid of the large pores and blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>and i didn&#x27;t really notice any big changes on my face.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on, easy to remove, a small amount goes a long way (so I assume reviewers who had a hard time removing it might have used way too much).  </li>
            <li>It does not clean all the blackheads, but it works better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>(again, these will not disappear nothing will give you back your 12 year old skin when you&#x27;re 40, just hope for skin at 40 that looks radiant and dewy).  </li>
            <li>Other masks that I&#x27;ve used in the past were so full of alcohol that my face would feel super dry after usage</li>
            <li>It does seem to dry up your skin if you&#x27;re having a very oily day, but it has clogged my pores a couple times, which is the opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Really helps to make away with dark spots but not with blackhead</li>
            <li>Seems dry and hard, but its texture is smooth when you apply it on.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> excellent product, i tried this one in my mom and sister too and they love the finish of the mask, you feel your pores really clean, the only thing is after you use it you have to mosturize your skin well cause it leaves it little bit tight and dry.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel brighter for using this, and it does help with blackheads but it never completely removes them. I would say it works about 50% on pores and I&#x27;m not sure if this made my face break out more or not.I say that because I primarily use this on my nose, where I have a pore problem and I suddenly started getting pimples on my nose instead of just blackheads. It did make my skin feels softer though and brighter as I said. No real reduction in pores and I used it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> This product came quickly even though it was shipped from Korea. International shipping and packaged very securely. The inside product is a clay like mask that smells like sand at the beach and is very easy to apply. Then it slowly hardens just a bit, not to the point where you can&#x27;t move your face and you just get some warm water and wash it off and your face is feeling baby butt smooth! It really cleared some of the acne spots on my chin and sometimes I even like to use this as a spot treatment. Really great product would buy again :~)</li>
            <li> I have large pores and it gets worse during hot humid summers and this products is great as a weekly face mask. I have yet to try an innisfree product that I don&#x27;t like. Great weekly face pampering. After I finish using it my face feels so smooth clear and clean. I bought innisfree volcanic cleanser with it and love them both.</li>
            <li> This product got hyped up and I was really excited to try it but it was a little disappointing. I still like it, it leaves my skin feeling soft and tightens my pores just slightly but other than that, not all that awesome.</li>
            <li> This clay mask is very smooth and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use this as a spot treatment so it will last a while but it works great as a mask as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take some time to get it all off with water when you use the full mask, so I&#x27;d recommend putting this on before you plan to take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it leaves one&#x27;s face feeling cool, soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, easy to remove, a small amount goes a long way (so I assume reviewers who had a hard time removing it might have used way too much).  I use it after an oil cleanser/rice enzyme exfoliation and it leaves my skin supple, pores reduced (again, these will not disappear nothing will give you back your 12 year old skin when you&#x27;re 40, just hope for skin at 40 that looks radiant and dewy).  Quite impressed and happy about the results.  Filled to the very top which is a great way of selling a product.  All in all pleased and will buy it again</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, I really do feel like it helps my skin, it looks and feel healthier after.</li>
            <li> After using the mask, my nose looks a lot cleaner and the blackheads are not visible. It does not clean all the blackheads, but it works better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> leave my skin very soft</li>
            <li> It had a great consistency. It went on very smooth and you didn&#x27;t need to use much, but it was nothing special. It broke me out after a while and though it helped my oily/acne prone skin for a little while, it wasn&#x27;t amazing. Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen an obvious impact of this product. But it may require a longer time for it to take effect.</li>
            <li> 34 year old white male with huge pores. This product shrunk the Pores quite a bit. I would recommend this product. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product. I feel like it truly works; I was also recommended some other products which I will try out without any doubt.  I have seen a difference while using this product that I&#x27;m pleased with. :)</li>
            <li> I bought the Jeju Volcanic Pore Mask as a last attempt to get rid of the large pores and blackheads on my nose. I&#x27;m 34, fair-complected and Caucasian. My blackheads aren&#x27;t completely gone, but they&#x27;re so much better! I was shocked to see results after one use. And my nose doesn&#x27;t shine anymore. *This would be perfect to use before a date!* I have been using it daily for about 5-6 days on the advice of an esthetician and plan to go a full 14 to see if it can completely eradicate my blackheads. Buy this mask. A little goes a long way &amp; I&#x27;ve had really great results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for a few weeks now, and I have seen some improvement on my pores and oiliness. Its great but id probably not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling amazing, super soft like a baby!</li>
            <li> the pores will come up to the surface so it&#x27;s easy to clean. Felt my skin a little bit brighter after use.</li>
            <li> AWARE THAT SELLER TO ITS CUSTOMERS. THANK, ALL OK.</li>
            <li> I use it weekly on my T-zone. My skin is super happy afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a heating or cooling feeling. Seems dry and hard, but its texture is smooth when you apply it on. By the way, I have finished two jars already.&lt;br /&gt;Also innisfree is a great Korean brand, because, their main ingredients come from Jeju island, their packaging are made of recycled paper, their labels made of tangerine skin and innisfree is trying to be earth friendly. And it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
            <li> Love it so much !  Leave the skin very soft right after wash off the mask.  I used different brands mud masks and nothing like this volcano clay mask, you can see the result right away.  My skin is very sensitiv and I have no break out using this product.  Highly recommend to everyone yo enjoy.</li>
            <li> It does seem to dry up your skin if you&#x27;re having a very oily day, but it has clogged my pores a couple times, which is the opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It&#x27;s a clay mask, they&#x27;re not for everyone, I prefer BHA containing products and egg pore soaps to solve my pore problems. People with very, very oily skin will appreciate this mask and find more use out of it, though.</li>
            <li> I do not know....Maybe it is working?</li>
            <li> a very best product, so efficacy for my skin .....I love it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;l&#x27;argile laisse une peau douce et les points noirs disparaissent peu à peu , j&#x27;adoooore</li>
            <li> it seemed to tightened my pores a bit, but it didn&#x27;t has those dramatic effects and i didn&#x27;t really notice any big changes on my face.  But it does smells nice and the packaging is very environmental friendly though.</li>
            <li> So good! Worth to try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks but it has helped my skin a lot. I have oily, acne prone skin, and it helps eliminate the oil and helped my acne in a few spots so far. Definitely will repurchase. I will update if anything changes. :]</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Skin so smooth after wash.</li>
            <li> i am in love with this brand! very natural and it does not leaves your skin dry :) i havent seen obvious effects on pores but i still like this product!</li>
            <li> Really helps to make away with dark spots but not with blackhead</li>
            <li> Been using it for a week and it is working wonder. Other masks that I&#x27;ve used in the past were so full of alcohol that my face would feel super dry after usage but this doesn&#x27;t. It was recommended by a friend who live in Iteawon, Korea and apparently it is one of the best and affordable product with  Etude House</li>
            <li> I love it.. Other than the fact that there are no English instructions...</li>
            <li> just like what i wish,good musk</li>
