            <li>Good product, but my 3c/4a low porosity hair doesn&#x27;t seem to like shea butter or protein too much.</li>
            <li>But my mature, gray 4a coils began to beg for more butters, oils and curl styling creams, and I stopped using gel.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> best deep conditioner! its melts into the hair and leaves its so curly. It hard to not use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I have fine textured, 4A, natural hair and this did not do much for my hair.  The conditioner is very thick and just doesn&#x27;t penetrate my hair shaft very well, it just sits on top of my hair.  I tried this as a leave in also, but it still did not work for me.  The ingredient list is fantastic with all the rich, nourishing ingredients most naturals look for, without having any silicones or petroleum.  I wanted to like it, my hair just didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m finishing up the bottle but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love love love this conditioner! I have 4c natural hair and this gets my hair super soft and moisturized. Also shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Best deep treatment for fine curly natural hair! It is a really good buy, try it you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!! Helps with crazy frizz too. I highly recommend this to any one with wavy/curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The only deep conditioner that really moisturize my hair, with good slip. I am definitely going to continue using it. This is a very thick conditioner and a little goes a long way. your hair feels soft and moisturized after a deep condition treatment.</li>
            <li> Good product, but my 3c/4a low porosity hair doesn&#x27;t seem to like shea butter or protein too much. Curls got way too tight and girly looking for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still liked the smell and texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I used Jessicurl products. I&#x27;m familiar with TooShea, confident coils, etc.  But my mature, gray 4a coils began to beg for more butters, oils and curl styling creams, and I stopped using gel. I have been Using Devacurl Heaven in Hair and Onesta Moisture Balancing conditioner for finger detangle and deep condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser popped this in my face, and gave me a sample.  Beautiful! It melts right into the hair and my fingers can easily detangle it. I use unscented since I&#x27;m fragrance sensitive.  You don&#x27;t need a lot.It is light but extremely moisturizing and detangling.  Nice alternative to my tried and true standards. I hear some gals use this as a leave in, but the leave-in I use is peerless.</li>
            <li> The best deep conditioner for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this conditioner!  In fact, this is my second time purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tight, coily curls (somewhere in the type 4 range).  Lately, I&#x27;ve been doing the &amp;#34;maximum hydration method&amp;#34; by pinkie cube to increase moisture and bring out my curls. This is one of the recommended conditioners. As part of the maximum hydration method, I dilute the conditioner down with water and use it as my cowash, deep conditioner, and leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it with a hair steamer and I&#x27;ve also used it with just a plastic cap to deep condition my hair.  Both deep conditioning methods leave my hair soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It does a wonderful job moisturizing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unscented. (I try to avoid products with a lot of fragrance.)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderfully thick if you want to use it undiluted, but it&#x27;s still very effective if you dilute it with water. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit expensive (although diluting it does help it last longer.)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so thick that it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get it out of the bottle without turning the bottle upside down and whacking it against my hand.</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair feeling moisturized and was perfect since it was unscented. I would repurchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love. I have tried many deep conditioners and this is by far one of my fav&#x27;s. Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is very soft and conditioned after using this product.  I like it.</li>
            <li> My go to conditioner for my 3B thick curly hair. I also use it as a leave in to soften my locks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while, and have not been disappointed. I typically apply to my 3c/4a-ish hair after washing, and it smells great. I will also sometimes apply during the week to my ends whenever I feel they need refreshing. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever actually used it as a deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem with this product is packaging. It&#x27;s so hard to get this out of the bottle! The consistency is very thick, so it is difficult to squeeze out when the product starts getting low. That&#x27;s frustrating to me. It would be much, MUCH better if available in a jar!</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair and I LOVE this deep conditioner! I use it once a week for an hour and my hair feels so great when I use it consistently. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Since I stopped using conditioners with silicone I breakout a lot less and my hair is softer, I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not anywhere in the item description but ALL Jessicurl products are 100% VEGAN! That means there are NO animal products or byproducts in any of the Jessicurl hair care line. They also do not test on animals. Being a C3 hair type and vegan myself, I couldn&#x27;t be one bit happier! And this deep conditioner ROCKSi</li>
