            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Both are very effective and much better smelling than this bubble gum / chemical</li>

            <li>that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>This shampoo was offered in the VINE program and i was thrilled to try it</li>
            <li>The aroma is pleasant to both him and me, which is especially nice considering how many scents I&#x27;m sensitive to.  </li>
            <li>It also excellent at keeping my dry, itchy scalp feeling great and not at all itchy.</li>
            <li>prefer unscented products however the light scent of this shampoo is pleasant in the shower and disappears as my hair</li>
            <li>As a result I am using more product in my hair to make it presentable for work or edgier on my own time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one has a pleasant scent and does rinse out completely and works great.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say it makes my hair soft, full of body and luxurious because the longest my hair gets is 3/4 of an inch at best before I hit it with the clippers.</li>
            <li>To both of us, the fragrance from this shampoo smells more like a very light peach scent versus any thing else.  </li>
            <li>What more do you need from a shampoo?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely, perfectly okay.</li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders scalp care has alleviated that problem for me quite well.</li>
            <li>I love it as do the rest of the adults in my home.</li>
            <li>It’s a trusted brand that has been around for many decades.</li>
            <li>and I’m pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>I can’t say that this is because of the shampoo’s chemistry or if it’s the conditioning effect, but the results are more than satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>I love the Head &amp; Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care shampoo.</li>
            <li>and  make sure I rinse all of the conditioner out,</li>
            <li>My favorite \\&quot;scent\\&quot; is their almond oil version.  </li>
            <li>In short: It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>I love the soothing feel and</li>
            <li>Might be okay to use once a month.</li>
            <li>My hair was standing up and had more life to it than I’m used to seeing.  </li>
            <li>husband, the carrier of chronic dandruff, is also pleased with the flake reduction after three uses.</li>
            <li>Excellent overall!</li>
            <li>And my scalp does feel better now than it has all winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Almost as important to me:  the smell is nice.  </li>
            <li>I’m very familiar with Procter and Gamble’s Head and Shoulders products.</li>
            <li>which has a nice, clean scent and no chemical</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that they&#x27;re doing these new versions because they don&#x27;t smell like head and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The aroma is pleasant and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I don’t see many flakes and, more significantly, my scalp doesn’t itch.</li>
            <li>This is a good shampoo in a large bottle.</li>
            <li>The product smells fresh and really nice.  </li>
            <li>But it cleans very well and is a good value.</li>
            <li>It flows easily but is not so watery that it spills through your fingers.</li>
            <li>It has a strong scent, but after awhile fades.  </li>
            <li>it helps with itchy scalp and flaking, and its fine to use if that is ALL</li>
            <li>I color my hair and this works fine with it.  </li>
            <li>Scent, texture, cleansing action, rinsability, and even packaging conspire to make this a pleasant product to use.</li>
            <li>One thing I would suggest is that hair should be rinsed a little longer to yield the best results.</li>
            <li>My shoulder length hair is clean and shiny and easy to manage, there are no visible dandruff flakes and the itching and need to scratch</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance that reminds me of menthol without the smokiness.</li>
            <li>Plus the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This Itchy Scalp Care version also softens with some frizziness, but is about on par there with the \\&quot;Smooth Silky\\&quot; variety.  </li>
            <li>The added Eucalyptus is quite enjoyable, and the conditioner added to the shampoo in the same container works as good as anything in our case.</li>
            <li>I will not name other brands that compete with Head &amp; Shoulders, but we have tried most of the most popular, and Head &amp; Shoulders is at the top of the list.</li>
            <li>It is a lot cheaper than other dandruff shampoos and works just as good, plus it leaves my hair smelling nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Right now, on Amazon, the 13 oz size is actually significantly cheaper per ounce than this size.</li>
            <li>This shampoo gets my hair clean.</li>
            <li>You do need to use it regularly for it to be most effective.</li>
            <li>They work great on dandruff and are the only products I have found that do work consistently on dandruff.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this shampoo more than I did..</li>
            <li>Leaves scalp feeling clean and fresh without any itchy redness.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>As it stands, I look forward to my scalp getting better and going back to a more moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>So, again, best for shorter hair, not good at all for longer</li>
            <li>That is where H&amp;S comes in--it will keep down the itch for a week or so and does a great job on my hair.  </li>
            <li>time and less products to use, makes me a happy camper.</li>
            <li>thank Amazon, like always, for delivering this fine product to our doorstep, and we are happy with the results after using it for several days, it almost can be used like a daily shampoo if required.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh, sporty scent of the eucalyptus fragrance.</li>
            <li>dandruff shampoo and conditioner is worth</li>
            <li>Also, compared to other dandruff shampoos for almost twice the price I still consider this a good value.</li>
            <li>Rotating between the two seems to be the right balance for me.</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s not 100%, but very close, and that his scalp hasn&#x27;t felt this good in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dandruff is something that a lot of good people must live with, and from way back Head &amp; Shoulders has always taken care of that problem in our home.</li>
            <li>The more you use it, the more you&#x27;ll notice less dandruff.</li>
            <li>My situation if more of the itchy scalp, than the dandruff problem, and this Head &amp; Shoulders have definitely addressed that condition, and I keep thinking that perhaps would be more appropriate to use when needed to solve the problem, and switch to a lighter shampoo other times.</li>
            <li>It really helps with the itchy scalp and leaves my head feeling cool.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair clean and lively</li>
            <li>It was over 50 years ago when I first used Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and I have been using it on and off since.</li>
            <li>Hair feels smooth, soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>The design of the bottle is such that some of the shampoo is going to drip along the top and sides.</li>
            <li>Our family has used Head and Shoulders shampoos of various types for many years.</li>
            <li>My first time to try any Head and Shoulders shampoo.  </li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried this before, then maybe the first time you try it get it from a store</li>
            <li>so you can smell first.  </li>
            <li>The first two days I used it, I wondered what the smell was.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t notice much difference with silkiness, but no dandruff here!</li>
            <li>This shampoo works pretty well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used Head and Shoulders over the years but this is the first time I have had a 2 in 1 product from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it on days when I just need a quick washing but don&#x27;t want to take the time for a full shampoo/conditioner treatment, and my hair is left feeling soft and smooth, and my scalp feels great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>their &amp;#34;Nourishing Formula,&amp;#34; this particular formula doesn&#x27;t strike me as being exceptional when compared to other H&amp;S products.  </li>
            <li>Much improved over the first generation of Head &amp; Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>2-1 usually means that the conditioner isn&#x27;t so great and you won&#x27;t have soft hair.</li>
            <li>both like not seeing dandruff in his eyebrows and have noticed a huge improvement in flakes overall.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gender neutral.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, smells fresh  </li>
            <li>It lathers up fast and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>The only difference between this and the Nourishing Formula is that this has a different kind of fragrance that is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance</li>
            <li>Thanks to Head &amp; Shoulders Itchy Scalp with Eucalyptus.</li>
            <li>H&amp;S Itchy Scalp Care works really well at controlling the flaking and itching my family sometimes experiences.</li>
            <li>Over time the hope is it&#x27;s helping to get to the point where it&#x27;s totally flake free.  </li>
            <li>Winter dryness has taken a toll on my scalp, but I also struggle with frizz, and really miss my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I use coal-tar based Denorex for a few days, as it is absolutely effective at dealing with dandruff.  </li>
            <li>a high and tight, however I have recently transitioned to shaved sides with more length on top.  </li>
            <li>but I smell only the familiar Head and Shoulders fragrance.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for several years, and it always helps my scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed my scalp being less itchy after using it, but it isn&#x27;t any more itchy either, so</li>
            <li>(what little I have left) feeling clean and more manageable than if I used a straight shampoo.</li>
            <li>Perhaps with the many varieties offered these days, it takes careful consideration and extra home work, to choose the right product for the type of hair needing the shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We used to live in Southern California for many years and eucalyptus trees are planted all over, especially along the freeways.</li>
            <li>B0015KS48O Head and Shoulders Smooth and Silky Dandruff Conditioner 23 Fluid Ounce]], which didn&#x27;t actually seem to de-frizz much, although it did soften my hair.  </li>
            <li>My husband is currently using this eucalyptus formulation for Itchy Scalp Care at times when he has that issue and has had success at controlling that</li>
            <li>Having the right ingredient to cure dandruffand itchy scalp gives it that extra value.</li>
            <li>I thought I’d give this new 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner specifically for itchy scalp a try</li>
            <li>This is another new formula of H&amp;S is offering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a must for most guys like me who are too lazy to reach for another bottle.</li>
            <li>I tried so many different shampoos with no success.</li>
            <li>By far, of the 5 H&amp;S shampoos I have tried, this is my least favorite -- the fragrance is like the old H&amp;S of the 80&#x27;s with that medicinal smell.  </li>
            <li>If you want to try something natural for dandruff, try Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree shampoo, or Nature&#x27;s Gate</li>
            <li>Eucalyptus one smells soft and fruity</li>
            <li>So far, he has not had itching problems while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think Head and Shoulders needs a higher powered Severe Dry Hair varietal in its product line.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, long hair and this made it very greasy after a few washings.  </li>
            <li>From using several brands over the years that claim to do the exact same thing, I can say the Head &amp; Shoulders remains the product we reach for when time to purchase is at hand.</li>
            <li>Normally, I use only shampoo.</li>
            <li>I USE THIS BECAUSE O T HELPS SO MUCH I USE with Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo because I have fine thin HAIR</li>
            <li>and since we live in the desert southwest where the humidity is always low, I experience an itchy scalp from time-to-time.  </li>
            <li>the before I used it, my scalp was less itchy too.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my scalp and hair smelling clean.&lt;br /&gt;It not as powerful as some shampoos like Denorex, but it works darn well IMO.</li>
            <li>However, it is pretty harsh on the hair itself and leaves it feeling less clean.  </li>
            <li>He does not have regular itchy scalp problems but does plan to use this shampoo when he needs a little more scalp control than provided by other varieties of Head and Shoulders dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to really have a whole lot to say about dandruff shampoo, but yup, there it is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The very first time I used it, it left my hair silky soft and that is something that is hard for me to achieve with just one product.  </li>
            <li>The added benefit is that I noticed when I use this product regularly, my hair becomes much thicker than when I use other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Head &amp; Shoulders for years but was curious about this new fragerance.</li>
            <li>I have really thick, long hair though and using this completely stripped my hair of all the natural oils and left it very tangled!  </li>
            <li>I have washed my hair several times with other shampoos and it still isn&#x27;t back to normal.  </li>
            <li>After first time using, once hair was dry I could see much less flakes.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the few products that I can use on my scalp without my head constantly itching or having large flaky build up.</li>
            <li>one wants to worry about those little white flakes appearing on your shoulders and back, so H&amp;S Itchy Scalp Care puts my mind at ease, as I know my flakes are under control from using this product.</li>

            <li> which has a nice, clean scent and no chemical</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that they&#x27;re doing these new versions because they don&#x27;t smell like head and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The aroma is pleasant and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I don’t see many flakes and, more significantly, my scalp doesn’t itch.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo in a large bottle.</li>
            <li> The product smells fresh and really nice.  </li>
            <li> But it cleans very well and is a good value.</li>
            <li> It flows easily but is not so watery that it spills through your fingers.</li>
            <li> It has a strong scent, but after awhile fades.  </li>
            <li> it helps with itchy scalp and flaking, and its fine to use if that is ALL</li>
            <li> I color my hair and this works fine with it.  </li>
            <li> Scent, texture, cleansing action, rinsability, and even packaging conspire to make this a pleasant product to use.</li>
            <li> One thing I would suggest is that hair should be rinsed a little longer to yield the best results.</li>
            <li> My shoulder length hair is clean and shiny and easy to manage, there are no visible dandruff flakes and the itching and need to scratch</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance that reminds me of menthol without the smokiness.</li>
            <li> Plus the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This Itchy Scalp Care version also softens with some frizziness, but is about on par there with the \\&quot;Smooth Silky\\&quot; variety.  </li>
            <li> The added Eucalyptus is quite enjoyable, and the conditioner added to the shampoo in the same container works as good as anything in our case.</li>
            <li> I will not name other brands that compete with Head &amp; Shoulders, but we have tried most of the most popular, and Head &amp; Shoulders is at the top of the list.</li>
            <li> It is a lot cheaper than other dandruff shampoos and works just as good, plus it leaves my hair smelling nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Right now, on Amazon, the 13 oz size is actually significantly cheaper per ounce than this size.</li>
            <li> This shampoo gets my hair clean.</li>
            <li> You do need to use it regularly for it to be most effective.</li>
            <li> They work great on dandruff and are the only products I have found that do work consistently on dandruff.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo more than I did..</li>
            <li> Leaves scalp feeling clean and fresh without any itchy redness.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> As it stands, I look forward to my scalp getting better and going back to a more moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> So, again, best for shorter hair, not good at all for longer</li>
            <li> That is where H&amp;S comes in--it will keep down the itch for a week or so and does a great job on my hair.  </li>
            <li> time and less products to use, makes me a happy camper.</li>
            <li> thank Amazon, like always, for delivering this fine product to our doorstep, and we are happy with the results after using it for several days, it almost can be used like a daily shampoo if required.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh, sporty scent of the eucalyptus fragrance.</li>
            <li> dandruff shampoo and conditioner is worth</li>
            <li> Also, compared to other dandruff shampoos for almost twice the price I still consider this a good value.</li>
            <li> Rotating between the two seems to be the right balance for me.</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s not 100%, but very close, and that his scalp hasn&#x27;t felt this good in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dandruff is something that a lot of good people must live with, and from way back Head &amp; Shoulders has always taken care of that problem in our home.</li>
            <li> The more you use it, the more you&#x27;ll notice less dandruff.</li>
            <li> My situation if more of the itchy scalp, than the dandruff problem, and this Head &amp; Shoulders have definitely addressed that condition, and I keep thinking that perhaps would be more appropriate to use when needed to solve the problem, and switch to a lighter shampoo other times.</li>
            <li> It really helps with the itchy scalp and leaves my head feeling cool.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair clean and lively</li>
            <li> It was over 50 years ago when I first used Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and I have been using it on and off since.</li>
            <li> Hair feels smooth, soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> The design of the bottle is such that some of the shampoo is going to drip along the top and sides.</li>
            <li> Our family has used Head and Shoulders shampoos of various types for many years.</li>
            <li> My first time to try any Head and Shoulders shampoo.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this before, then maybe the first time you try it get it from a store</li>
            <li> so you can smell first.  </li>
            <li> The first two days I used it, I wondered what the smell was.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t notice much difference with silkiness, but no dandruff here!</li>
            <li> This shampoo works pretty well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used Head and Shoulders over the years but this is the first time I have had a 2 in 1 product from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it on days when I just need a quick washing but don&#x27;t want to take the time for a full shampoo/conditioner treatment, and my hair is left feeling soft and smooth, and my scalp feels great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> their &amp;#34;Nourishing Formula,&amp;#34; this particular formula doesn&#x27;t strike me as being exceptional when compared to other H&amp;S products.  </li>
            <li> Much improved over the first generation of Head &amp; Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 2-1 usually means that the conditioner isn&#x27;t so great and you won&#x27;t have soft hair.</li>
            <li> both like not seeing dandruff in his eyebrows and have noticed a huge improvement in flakes overall.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gender neutral.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny, smells fresh  </li>
            <li> It lathers up fast and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> The only difference between this and the Nourishing Formula is that this has a different kind of fragrance that is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance</li>
            <li> Thanks to Head &amp; Shoulders Itchy Scalp with Eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> H&amp;S Itchy Scalp Care works really well at controlling the flaking and itching my family sometimes experiences.</li>
            <li> Over time the hope is it&#x27;s helping to get to the point where it&#x27;s totally flake free.  </li>
            <li> Winter dryness has taken a toll on my scalp, but I also struggle with frizz, and really miss my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I use coal-tar based Denorex for a few days, as it is absolutely effective at dealing with dandruff.  </li>
            <li> a high and tight, however I have recently transitioned to shaved sides with more length on top.  </li>
            <li> but I smell only the familiar Head and Shoulders fragrance.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several years, and it always helps my scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed my scalp being less itchy after using it, but it isn&#x27;t any more itchy either, so</li>
            <li> (what little I have left) feeling clean and more manageable than if I used a straight shampoo.</li>
            <li> Perhaps with the many varieties offered these days, it takes careful consideration and extra home work, to choose the right product for the type of hair needing the shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We used to live in Southern California for many years and eucalyptus trees are planted all over, especially along the freeways.</li>
            <li> B0015KS48O Head and Shoulders Smooth and Silky Dandruff Conditioner 23 Fluid Ounce]], which didn&#x27;t actually seem to de-frizz much, although it did soften my hair.  </li>
            <li> My husband is currently using this eucalyptus formulation for Itchy Scalp Care at times when he has that issue and has had success at controlling that</li>
            <li> Having the right ingredient to cure dandruffand itchy scalp gives it that extra value.</li>
            <li> I thought I’d give this new 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner specifically for itchy scalp a try</li>
            <li> This is another new formula of H&amp;S is offering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a must for most guys like me who are too lazy to reach for another bottle.</li>
            <li> I tried so many different shampoos with no success.</li>
            <li> By far, of the 5 H&amp;S shampoos I have tried, this is my least favorite -- the fragrance is like the old H&amp;S of the 80&#x27;s with that medicinal smell.  </li>
            <li> If you want to try something natural for dandruff, try Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree shampoo, or Nature&#x27;s Gate</li>
            <li> Eucalyptus one smells soft and fruity</li>
            <li> So far, he has not had itching problems while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think Head and Shoulders needs a higher powered Severe Dry Hair varietal in its product line.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, long hair and this made it very greasy after a few washings.  </li>
            <li> From using several brands over the years that claim to do the exact same thing, I can say the Head &amp; Shoulders remains the product we reach for when time to purchase is at hand.</li>
            <li> Normally, I use only shampoo.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS BECAUSE O T HELPS SO MUCH I USE with Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo because I have fine thin HAIR</li>
            <li> and since we live in the desert southwest where the humidity is always low, I experience an itchy scalp from time-to-time.  </li>
            <li> the before I used it, my scalp was less itchy too.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my scalp and hair smelling clean.&lt;br /&gt;It not as powerful as some shampoos like Denorex, but it works darn well IMO.</li>
            <li> However, it is pretty harsh on the hair itself and leaves it feeling less clean.  </li>
            <li> He does not have regular itchy scalp problems but does plan to use this shampoo when he needs a little more scalp control than provided by other varieties of Head and Shoulders dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to really have a whole lot to say about dandruff shampoo, but yup, there it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The very first time I used it, it left my hair silky soft and that is something that is hard for me to achieve with just one product.  </li>
            <li> The added benefit is that I noticed when I use this product regularly, my hair becomes much thicker than when I use other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Head &amp; Shoulders for years but was curious about this new fragerance.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, long hair though and using this completely stripped my hair of all the natural oils and left it very tangled!  </li>
            <li> I have washed my hair several times with other shampoos and it still isn&#x27;t back to normal.  </li>
            <li> After first time using, once hair was dry I could see much less flakes.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the few products that I can use on my scalp without my head constantly itching or having large flaky build up.</li>
            <li> one wants to worry about those little white flakes appearing on your shoulders and back, so H&amp;S Itchy Scalp Care puts my mind at ease, as I know my flakes are under control from using this product.</li>
            <li> I occasionally suffer from dry patches from wearing hats in my line of work.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overpowering, rather pleasing to us, and the hair once dried feels very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Little white flakes of dandruff can be so embarrassing, and despite trying a blend of tea tree oil in a regular shampoo, they wouldn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend this shampoo for those with dry scalp issues.</li>
            <li> B000GCXSHO Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care, Almond Oil,  </li>
            <li> I still think Head and Shoulder is the go to brand for quality on dry scalp and flake relief</li>
            <li> I get dry skin and scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have hair that tends to get dry.  </li>
            <li> With the dry winter, I needed something stronger -- Head &amp; Shoulders made a difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried [[ASIN:B000GCWPPA Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care Dandruff Shampoo for Unisex, 23.7 Ounce]], also [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> the H&amp;S shampoos have the same active ingredient - pyrithione zinc 1%.  </li>
            <li> Having the problem of itchy scalp is aggravating to say the least, and it seems to be recurring for us, meaning that goes and comes back with enough frequency that a proper medicated shampoo is required.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair</li>
            <li> Smells a little medicinal, but overall it seems to do the job without drying my kid&#x27;s hair out.</li>
            <li> The shampoos I have been using lately have been leaving a film on my hair and feeling like they are not rinsing out completely.</li>
            <li> A little of the shampoo goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Not much, I say!</li>
            <li> Extremely pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> In the past few weeks, I have tried and reviewed several Head &amp; Shoulders products and given them all favorable reviews -- until now.  </li>
            <li> After using for at least two weeks, the opinion regarding its effectiveness was above average.</li>
            <li> Cuts down on dandruff.</li>
            <li> So basically it comes down to your preference on fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy or smell &amp;#34;mediciny&amp;#34; like other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no dandruff snowfall on my shoulders even when I&#x27;m wearing black.</li>

            <li> However, my scalp was less itchy.  </li>
            <li> have noticed less flakes</li>
            <li> scent is a little odd.  </li>
            <li> It is eucalyptus, and so smells a little like leaves, rather than flowers or something like that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy to use.</li>
            <li> Conditioners tend to make my hair too fluffy.</li>
            <li> I didn’t notice any difference until I stepped out of the shower, dried myself off, and looked in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> This product is one of the few shampoo conditioner combinations that I haven&#x27;t had to use a conditioner after using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a a strong scent like a cough drop or muscle rub that I feared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you only smell the artificial fragrance, and it lingers long after you leave the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Head &amp; Shoulders in the past and like it.</li>
            <li> I usually wear</li>

            <li> I am in my late 60s</li>
            <li> So not a good 2 in 1 (shampoo and conditioner) for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> It also makes my hair look thinner, and turns my passable comb-over into a comb-over fail.  </li>

            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to people needing a dandruff shampoo…just don&#x27;t buy it for the fragrance as you will be disappointed.</li>

            <li> This shampoo gets my hair clean. I haven&#x27;t really noticed my scalp being less itchy after using it, but it isn&#x27;t any more itchy either, so that&#x27;s nice. The aroma is pleasant and the price is reasonable. What more do you need from a shampoo? Not much, I say!</li>
            <li> Smells a little medicinal, but overall it seems to do the job without drying my kid&#x27;s hair out. It&#x27;s hard to really have a whole lot to say about dandruff shampoo, but yup, there it is. It&#x27;s absolutely, perfectly okay.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders Itchy Scalp care Shampoo and conditioner has done a good job of soothing my scalp. I occasionally suffer from dry patches from wearing hats in my line of work. Head and Shoulders scalp care has alleviated that problem for me quite well. I can&#x27;t honestly say it makes my hair soft, full of body and luxurious because the longest my hair gets is 3/4 of an inch at best before I hit it with the clippers. One word of caution, do not get this shampoo in your eyes because it hurts like a moth... uh, it hurts a lot I will just say that. I do recommend this shampoo for those with dry scalp issues. It does work.</li>
            <li> It was over 50 years ago when I first used Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and I have been using it on and off since. I ran out of Head &amp; Shoulders and for the last couple of weeks I was using another shampoo and seemed to have the urge to scratch my head a lot. This shampoo was offered in the VINE program and i was thrilled to try it and it met every expectation. My shoulder length hair is clean and shiny and easy to manage, there are no visible dandruff flakes and the itching and need to scratch are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer unscented products however the light scent of this shampoo is pleasant in the shower and disappears as my hair dries-- a big &amp;#34;shout out&amp;#34; for Head &amp; Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care- I love it as do the rest of the adults in my home.</li>
            <li> 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner for Itchy Scalp Care Brand: Head &amp; Shoulders Manufacturer: Procter and Gamble Contents: 23.7 Fl Oz  I’m very familiar with Procter and Gamble’s Head and Shoulders products. It’s a trusted brand that has been around for many decades. Normally, I use only shampoo. Conditioners tend to make my hair too fluffy. I have very dry hair and since we live in the desert southwest where the humidity is always low, I experience an itchy scalp from time-to-time.  I thought I’d give this new 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner specifically for itchy scalp a try and I’m pleased with the result. I don’t see many flakes and, more significantly, my scalp doesn’t itch. I can’t say that this is because of the shampoo’s chemistry or if it’s the conditioning effect, but the results are more than satisfactory.  The label mentions eucalyptus but I smell only the familiar Head and Shoulders fragrance. It smells reassuringly like shampoo.  If you are a Head and Shoulders user, or even if you use another brand, I recommend trying this product. I like the results and I think you will as well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo more than I did.. it helps with itchy scalp and flaking, and its fine to use if that is ALL you want a shampoo to do.  I have really thick, long hair though and using this completely stripped my hair of all the natural oils and left it very tangled!  So not a good 2 in 1 (shampoo and conditioner) for my hair type.  This honestly would do best on shorter hair. My hair lacked shine, conditioning, and softness after using... all the things you want a really good hair care product to do for longer, thicker hair.  So, again, best for shorter hair, not good at all for longer.. will have to find a different one to get all the benefits I need.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care With Eucalyptus 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo And Conditioner does an excellent job of keeping my hair looking great. It also excellent at keeping my dry, itchy scalp feeling great and not at all itchy. There&#x27;s no dandruff snowfall on my shoulders even when I&#x27;m wearing black. I like the fresh, sporty scent of the eucalyptus fragrance. It&#x27;s not a a strong scent like a cough drop or muscle rub that I feared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent, not dandruff, no itchy scalp, and beautiful hair...what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Four reasons why I like this brand of Head and Shoulders:&lt;br /&gt;1. Extremely pleasing scent. It&#x27;s really gender neutral.&lt;br /&gt;2. Leaves scalp feeling clean and fresh without any itchy redness.&lt;br /&gt;3. 2-1 usually means that the conditioner isn&#x27;t so great and you won&#x27;t have soft hair. Not so with this product. Hair feels smooth, soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;4. Cuts down on dandruff. Technically, this should be #1 on the list. The more you use it, the more you&#x27;ll notice less dandruff.</li>
            <li> I love the Head &amp; Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care shampoo. The shampoos I have been using lately have been leaving a film on my hair and feeling like they are not rinsing out completely. Also they are leaving my scalp itchy. I have used Head &amp; Shoulders in the past and like it. This one has a pleasant scent and does rinse out completely and works great. Very pleased with this product. No Itchy scalp anymore. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I consider this shampoo to be one of several that I need to maintain an itch-free, flakeless scalp.  I use coal-tar based Denorex for a few days, as it is absolutely effective at dealing with dandruff.  However, it is pretty harsh on the hair itself and leaves it feeling less clean.  That is where H&amp;S comes in--it will keep down the itch for a week or so and does a great job on my hair.  Rotating between the two seems to be the right balance for me.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care with Eucalyptus is a great combination of products for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This very dry, cold winter has &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; me with a dry itchy scalp.  Regular shampoo does not help at all.  Dandruff shampoo is helpful but then, I have to use a conditioner and  make sure I rinse all of the conditioner out, or I have an even itchier scalp.  ( Am I a whiner ? Probably - ha!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Head &amp; Shoulders cleans and conditions my hair at one time.  The product smells fresh and really nice.  I thought the eucalyptus might smell medicinal but it doesn&#x27;t.  My hair is soft, shiny, smells fresh  and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo in a large bottle. It flows easily but is not so watery that it spills through your fingers. It has a light fragrance that reminds me of menthol without the smokiness. A little of the shampoo goes a long way.  It lathers up fast and cleans very well. It also makes my hair look thinner, and turns my passable comb-over into a comb-over fail.  The design of the bottle is such that some of the shampoo is going to drip along the top and sides. It&#x27;s a little messy to use. But it cleans very well and is a good value.</li>
            <li> In the past few weeks, I have tried and reviewed several Head &amp; Shoulders products and given them all favorable reviews -- until now.  My favorite \\&quot;scent\\&quot; is their almond oil version.  [[ASIN:B000GCXSHO Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care, Almond Oil,  Dandruff Shampoo 33.8 Fl Oz]] which has a nice, clean scent and no chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the H&amp;S shampoos have the same active ingredient - pyrithione zinc 1%.  So basically it comes down to your preference on fragrance.  By far, of the 5 H&amp;S shampoos I have tried, this is my least favorite -- the fragrance is like the old H&amp;S of the 80&#x27;s with that medicinal smell.  In fact, \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; comes on the ingredients list way before eucalyptus extract, and that shows... you only smell the artificial fragrance, and it lingers long after you leave the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, I would recommend their almond oil or tea tree scents, and give a pass to this one.  If you want to try something natural for dandruff, try Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree shampoo, or Nature&#x27;s Gate [[ASIN:B001E6P6MQ Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Calming Shampoo for Irritated, Flaky Scalp, 18-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]].  Both are very effective and much better smelling than this bubble gum / chemical combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using products made by Head &amp; Shoulders for over 30 years and have always loved them. They work great on dandruff and are the only products I have found that do work consistently on dandruff. The 2 in 1 product is great and leaves my hair (what little I have left) feeling clean and more manageable than if I used a straight shampoo. I could not, however, smell any of the supposed Eucalyptus that is in the shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but I can&#x27;t detect any Eucalyptus in it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend this to people needing a dandruff shampoo…just don&#x27;t buy it for the fragrance as you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Two members of the family have benefited from using Head &amp; Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care With Eucalyptus 2-1 Care Dandruff Shampoo And Conditioner 23.7 Fl Oz. Having the problem of itchy scalp is aggravating to say the least, and it seems to be recurring for us, meaning that goes and comes back with enough frequency that a proper medicated shampoo is required. After using for at least two weeks, the opinion regarding its effectiveness was above average. The added Eucalyptus is quite enjoyable, and the conditioner added to the shampoo in the same container works as good as anything in our case. One thing I would suggest is that hair should be rinsed a little longer to yield the best results. From using several brands over the years that claim to do the exact same thing, I can say the Head &amp; Shoulders remains the product we reach for when time to purchase is at hand. Dandruff is something that a lot of good people must live with, and from way back Head &amp; Shoulders has always taken care of that problem in our home. I will not name other brands that compete with Head &amp; Shoulders, but we have tried most of the most popular, and Head &amp; Shoulders is at the top of the list. Perhaps with the many varieties offered these days, it takes careful consideration and extra home work, to choose the right product for the type of hair needing the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;We thank Amazon, like always, for delivering this fine product to our doorstep, and we are happy with the results after using it for several days, it almost can be used like a daily shampoo if required. The smell is not overpowering, rather pleasing to us, and the hair once dried feels very soft and manageable. My situation if more of the itchy scalp, than the dandruff problem, and this Head &amp; Shoulders have definitely addressed that condition, and I keep thinking that perhaps would be more appropriate to use when needed to solve the problem, and switch to a lighter shampoo other times. Having the right ingredient to cure dandruffand itchy scalp gives it that extra value. 4.5 Stars.</li>
            <li> This is another new formula of H&amp;S is offering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like their &amp;#34;Nourishing Formula,&amp;#34; this particular formula doesn&#x27;t strike me as being exceptional when compared to other H&amp;S products.  The only difference between this and the Nourishing Formula is that this has a different kind of fragrance that is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance (extra)-- 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance-- 5 stars</li>
            <li> I have used H&amp;S for years. It is one of the few products that I can use on my scalp without my head constantly itching or having large flaky build up. The added benefit is that I noticed when I use this product regularly, my hair becomes much thicker than when I use other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Head &amp; Shoulders for years but was curious about this new fragerance. In short: It&#x27;s great! H&amp;S takes good care of my hair. Keeps it from being flaky without overdrying it. Plus the smell is fantastic. I especially like the fact that the conditioner is built in. This is a must for most guys like me who are too lazy to reach for another bottle. It&#x27;s an all-in-one solution. Good product. Good price. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of itchy scalp but I do have dandruff and shampoo with dandruff shampoo a couple times a week. I have been using head and shoulders and about the only think I don&#x27;t like is the medical smell. In fact I switched from TGel because my wife hated the TGel smell. I&#x27;m happy that they&#x27;re doing these new versions because they don&#x27;t smell like head and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;This Eucalyptus one smells soft and fruity (maybe fruity with baby powder in the background). It&#x27;s still a head and shoulders smell as in I wouldn&#x27;t confuse it with my wife&#x27;s Panteen or Herbal Essence. But it&#x27;s a lot nicer smell. It passed the wife test. Without telling her what she was smelling for, she said my hair smells nice!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from itchy scalp and hair loss from using permanent color hair dyes. I tried so many different shampoos with no success. I scratched my head constantly it was embarrassing. I finally gave this shampoo a shot and just after one use I felt some relief. My scalp was not itching.  I stopped scratching my scalp. I have bee  shampooing for a week now and I am cured.  Thanks to Head &amp; Shoulders Itchy Scalp with Eucalyptus. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> I still think Head and Shoulder is the go to brand for quality on dry scalp and flake relief (I&#x27;m an 80s baby and remember the commercials). It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy or smell &amp;#34;mediciny&amp;#34; like other shampoos.  Also, compared to other dandruff shampoos for almost twice the price I still consider this a good value.</li>
            <li> With the crazy weather we have here in Chicago I get dry skin and scalp.  Head &amp; Shoulders is the only brand that works for me to relive that itch.  I love the soothing feel and way it moisturizes my hair.  I color my hair and this works fine with it.  It is a lot cheaper than other dandruff shampoos and works just as good, plus it leaves my hair smelling nice.  I use this regularly and I get compliments all the time!</li>
            <li> Our family has used Head and Shoulders shampoos of various types for many years. My husband is currently using this eucalyptus formulation for Itchy Scalp Care at times when he has that issue and has had success at controlling that itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for that distinctive eucalyptus fragrance you will not find it in this shampoo. To both of us, the fragrance from this shampoo smells more like a very light peach scent versus any thing else.  We used to live in Southern California for many years and eucalyptus trees are planted all over, especially along the freeways. Both that variety and the eucalyptus you sometimes get in a flower arrangement smells nothing like this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the scent is not there, as with all H&amp;S products, this variety helps keep his dandruff under control.  He notices a slight tingling in his scalp after showering. He thought that that is the actual eucalyptus oils in the shampoo helping to control itching. So far, he has not had itching problems while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall he likes this product a lot. He does not have regular itchy scalp problems but does plan to use this shampoo when he needs a little more scalp control than provided by other varieties of Head and Shoulders dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS BECAUSE O T HELPS SO MUCH I USE with Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo because I have fine thin HAIR this works well together stops the itching and gives me volume.&lt;br /&gt;I wash with H&amp;S then Aussie. I am in my late 60s</li>
            <li> My first time to try any Head and Shoulders shampoo.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several years, and it always helps my scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li> I have fine, long hair and this made it very greasy after a few washings.  I look like a teenager that hasn&#x27;t learned proper hygiene yet!  I have washed my hair several times with other shampoos and it still isn&#x27;t back to normal.  However, my scalp was less itchy.  Might be okay to use once a month.</li>
            <li> I decided to try out the Head &amp; Shoulders itchy scalp care with eucalyptus 2-in-1 dandruff shampoo and conditioner even though I don’t have an itchy scalp.  I usually wear a high and tight, however I have recently transitioned to shaved sides with more length on top.  As a result I am using more product in my hair to make it presentable for work or edgier on my own time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Head &amp; Shoulders itchy scalp care with eucalyptus 2-in-1 dandruff shampoo and conditioner just like I would any shampoo.  I didn’t notice any difference until I stepped out of the shower, dried myself off, and looked in the mirror.  My hair was standing up and had more life to it than I’m used to seeing.  I’m guessing the shampoo did an excellent job of removing gels and residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re looking for a good 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner, Head &amp; Shoulders itchy scalp care with eucalyptus 2-in-1 dandruff shampoo and conditioner is worth considering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair clean and lively&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;None I could find</li>
            <li> I have hair that tends to get dry.  This product is one of the few shampoo conditioner combinations that I haven&#x27;t had to use a conditioner after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a little odd.  It is eucalyptus, and so smells a little like leaves, rather than flowers or something like that.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this before, then maybe the first time you try it get it from a store so you can smell first.  The first two days I used it, I wondered what the smell was.  It isn&#x27;t bad.  It&#x27;s just like leaves rather than flowers or fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, on Amazon, the 13 oz size is actually significantly cheaper per ounce than this size.</li>
            <li> H&amp;S Itchy Scalp Care works really well at controlling the flaking and itching my family sometimes experiences. I like this product because it&#x27;s a 2 in 1, so especially for the men, it is so convenient. I use it on days when I just need a quick washing but don&#x27;t want to take the time for a full shampoo/conditioner treatment, and my hair is left feeling soft and smooth, and my scalp feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one wants to worry about those little white flakes appearing on your shoulders and back, so H&amp;S Itchy Scalp Care puts my mind at ease, as I know my flakes are under control from using this product. The eucalyptus give the shampoo a nice zing that feels great on my scalp. You do need to use it regularly for it to be most effective.</li>
            <li> Scent, texture, cleansing action, rinsability, and even packaging conspire to make this a pleasant product to use. Much improved over the first generation of Head &amp; Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband, the carrier of chronic dandruff, is also pleased with the flake reduction after three uses. He says it&#x27;s not 100%, but very close, and that his scalp hasn&#x27;t felt this good in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both like not seeing dandruff in his eyebrows and have noticed a huge improvement in flakes overall.  The aroma is pleasant to both him and me, which is especially nice considering how many scents I&#x27;m sensitive to.  Excellent overall!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using H&amp;S for decades.  This version of the 2 in 1 feels refreshing and smells pleasant.  It really helps with the itchy scalp and leaves my head feeling cool.  It has a strong scent, but after awhile fades.  I have short spiky Asian hair so I don&#x27;t notice much difference with silkiness, but no dandruff here!</li>
            <li> Little white flakes of dandruff can be so embarrassing, and despite trying a blend of tea tree oil in a regular shampoo, they wouldn&#x27;t go away.  With the dry winter, I needed something stronger -- Head &amp; Shoulders made a difference.  After first time using, once hair was dry I could see much less flakes.  Over time the hope is it&#x27;s helping to get to the point where it&#x27;s totally flake free.  Scent is pleasant and refreshing to scalp, without feeling too medicinal.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works pretty well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed less flakes the before I used it, my scalp was less itchy too.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my scalp and hair smelling clean.&lt;br /&gt;It not as powerful as some shampoos like Denorex, but it works darn well IMO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several Head and Shoulders products in recent months.  Winter dryness has taken a toll on my scalp, but I also struggle with frizz, and really miss my [[ASIN:B005I0JWGK Renpure Originals Argan Oil Shampoo, 16 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] and [[ASIN:B005I0JWEM Renpure Originals Argan Oil Conditioner, 16 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] -- which unfortunately did nothing for dandruff or itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried [[ASIN:B000GCWPPA Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care Dandruff Shampoo for Unisex, 23.7 Ounce]], also [[ASIN:B0015KS48O Head and Shoulders Smooth and Silky Dandruff Conditioner 23 Fluid Ounce]], which didn&#x27;t actually seem to de-frizz much, although it did soften my hair.  This Itchy Scalp Care version also softens with some frizziness, but is about on par there with the \\&quot;Smooth Silky\\&quot; variety.  And my scalp does feel better now than it has all winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost as important to me:  the smell is nice.  I&#x27;ve considered T-Gel and similar, but have some concerns about coal tar in my product, and also recall not liking the scent.  Here, I get a scent profile that makes me think minty citrus with a bit of floral, although the \\&quot;mint\\&quot; here is actually the eucalyptus oil, which is thankfully not overpowering.  The shampoo smells edible, in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Head and Shoulders needs a higher powered Severe Dry Hair varietal in its product line.  As it stands, I look forward to my scalp getting better and going back to a more moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used Head and Shoulders over the years but this is the first time I have had a 2 in 1 product from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I used it, it left my hair silky soft and that is something that is hard for me to achieve with just one product.  It has the creamy texture of Head and Shoulders products and doesn’t have an overpowering scent but you know the scent of Eucalyptus is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less time and less products to use, makes me a happy camper.</li>
