            <li>It is a great product and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizing shampoo that smells good, too, for curly hair, but nothing beats Pureology!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>but I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>My hair has a lot of nice volume and plenty of curl.  </li>
            <li>This is probably one of the better shampoos that I have used for curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love).</li>
            <li>I have been a Ouidad fan for many years.  </li>
            <li>Glad I can still get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Shampoo works fine but very strong perfume scent.</li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo for the first time today and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Nice lather, great smell and hair feels more tame.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great on human hair as well as synthetic!</li>
            <li>but it is no longer available.</li>
            <li>settled on Wen products and they work much better with my dry hair and are much more cost effective for me.</li>
            <li>The only product I was satisfied with was the gel because it was rather light and not sticky.  </li>
            <li>And I can feel how much stronger and more vibrant</li>
            <li>my colored hair was bright orange after two weeks (washing every other day) with this product.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really helps control super curly hair by giving it some hydration.</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair that knots easily, but tends to be dry.</li>
            <li>As a result, I only wash my hair a couple time per week, though I use conditioner way more often.     </li>
            <li>Noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t create as much suds and my hair did not feel as dry or get oily more quickly.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve tried other shampoos and you&#x27;ve not been fully satisfied, give this one a go.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing spray was okay as well, but not really worth the price.</li>
            <li>As a dude, I&#x27;ve got some pretty intense curly hair which doesn&#x27;t react favorably to most shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, even some other &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; specific shampoos.&lt;br</li>
            <li>shampoo seems fine, but I can tell absolutely no difference between using it and using a cheaper &amp;#34;Moisturizing&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised that using just the Ouidad products would make such a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair, so I&#x27;m always trying out new styling / management</li>
            <li>Not sure if my curls are better controlled as a result of the shampoo</li>
            <li>Also, it makes my hair feel so soft after the shower.</li>
            <li>so it really lasts only a month.</li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of it natural oils.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizes my dry curly hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking for other sulfate free shampoos in other brands.</li>
            <li>So as far as the essential part of the product goes, it works for me.     </li>
            <li>if i&#x27;m not careful).</li>
            <li>When reading the ingredients for the shampoo you will see that it uses sulfates, no different than any store brand product and far more expensive.</li>
            <li>Yes this is a little more expensive but for anyone who is accustomed to spending money on quality products it will not make much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Yes this is a little more expensive but for anyone who is accustomed to spending money on quality products it will not make much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used a multitude of products for my aging, dry, curly, Italian hair.  </li>
            <li> so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If you are smell sensitive, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The other products just coat the hair with silicones, again, the same as drug store products.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my loose curls as well as my child&#x27;s very dry and kinky curl.  </li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds trying to find a product that will work on her hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have very tightly curled hair and have been searching for years for a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why you need all the other products; the heavy conditioner plus the leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but you only need a dab about the size of a quarter to shampoo a head of long hair.</li>
            <li> even tried switching to another shampoo for a little while, but quickly became frustrated and threw it away.</li>
            <li> I have short and very thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few shampoos I&#x27;ve found that work with my hair.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the bottle is very small</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not cheap) and you like sandlewood or have damaged olfactory senses, this isn&#x27;t a bad shampoo for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Expensive products, loaded with laurels and chemicals</li>
            <li> I realize some people like that smell, but to me it STINKS.</li>
            <li> &#x3D; bad choice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is the worst smelling shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, Horrible customer service!</li>

            <li> Best out there for curly hair!</li>
            <li> This shampoo really helps control super curly hair by giving it some hydration. It&#x27;s a little expensive, but you only need a dab about the size of a quarter to shampoo a head of long hair. A little goes a long way so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo as part of an Ouidad kit. I have fine curly hair that knots easily, but tends to be dry. As a result, I only wash my hair a couple time per week, though I use conditioner way more often.     This is probably one of the better shampoos that I have used for curly hair. It really doesn&#x27;t create as much suds and my hair did not feel as dry or get oily more quickly. So as far as the essential part of the product goes, it works for me.     The scent, however, is AWEFUL. It is the worst smelling shampoo I have ever used. I think it smells like sandlewood. I realize some people like that smell, but to me it STINKS. And it doesn&#x27;t go away. I washed my hair with the shampoo two days ago and I can STILL SMELL IT.     If you don&#x27;t mind paying for it (it&#x27;s not cheap) and you like sandlewood or have damaged olfactory senses, this isn&#x27;t a bad shampoo for curly hair. If you are smell sensitive, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizing shampoo that smells good, too, for curly hair, but nothing beats Pureology!</li>
            <li> just what my daughter wanted. Loved it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a lot of difference in my hair after using this product. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great on human hair as well as synthetic!</li>
            <li> Oh how my hair loves this shampoo! It has made my curls even curlier then before(which I love). Also, it makes my hair feel so soft after the shower.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  I saw an infomercial for Ouidad and since my daughter and I both have curly/wavy hair I tried it out.  After a month of exclusive use of all of their products (monthly deep conditioner, shampoo, conditioner,moisturizing spray and gel) I see NO difference in our hair.  When reading the ingredients for the shampoo you will see that it uses sulfates, no different than any store brand product and far more expensive. Not to mention the bottle is very small so it really lasts only a month. The only product I was satisfied with was the gel because it was rather light and not sticky.  The moisturizing spray was okay as well, but not really worth the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect for summer curls.</li>
            <li> I have short and very thick curly hair.  I tried this shampoo for the first time today and am very pleased with the results.  My hair has a lot of nice volume and plenty of curl.  It looks great.  I recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Works well with the conditioner and curling gel.  Received product promptly.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, Horrible customer service!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, so I&#x27;m always trying out new styling / management products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo seems fine, but I can tell absolutely no difference between using it and using a cheaper &amp;#34;Moisturizing&amp;#34; shampoo. I&#x27;ll keep looking for other sulfate free shampoos in other brands.</li>
            <li> I have very tightly curled hair and have been searching for years for a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. After using their curl control gel, I decided to take a chance on this shampoo and see if it made a difference in the way my hair acted.  I was so surprised that using just the Ouidad products would make such a significant difference.  I now use the shampoo, conditionier and Curl Control gel and have beautiful results every time.</li>
            <li> I have been a Ouidad fan for many years.  I use this on my loose curls as well as my child&#x27;s very dry and kinky curl.  Trust me I have spent hundreds trying to find a product that will work on her hair.  Yes this is a little more expensive but for anyone who is accustomed to spending money on quality products it will not make much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in conjunction with the conditioner, the 12 minute treatment, botanical boost, and climate control gel.  For my daughter she get&#x27;s the curl cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products work when used properly!</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously awesome. As a dude, I&#x27;ve got some pretty intense curly hair which doesn&#x27;t react favorably to most shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, even some other &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; specific shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my hair loves Ouidad. It feels like it heals and soothes my locks every time I use it. And I can feel how much stronger and more vibrant my hair is after using it for almost a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even tried switching to another shampoo for a little while, but quickly became frustrated and threw it away. Now I&#x27;m back to the one that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried other shampoos and you&#x27;ve not been fully satisfied, give this one a go. I doubt you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
            <li> This product is not as advertised at all.  As another reviewer pointed out, it is loaded with sulfates and no different from any drug store shampoo.  Personally, I&#x27;ve found that this shampoo actually has a drying effect on my hair.  That&#x27;s why you need all the other products; the heavy conditioner plus the leave-in conditioner. The other products just coat the hair with silicones, again, the same as drug store products.  I also found this product incredibly stripping- my colored hair was bright orange after two weeks (washing every other day) with this product.</li>
            <li> I have wavy curly blonde hair (lots of frizz if i&#x27;m not careful). This is one of the few shampoos I&#x27;ve found that work with my hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> Really moisturizes my dry curly hair</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my curls are better controlled as a result of the shampoo but I am very pleased. Nice lather, great smell and hair feels more tame. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Ouidad is a great product.  Curly hair people can sure benefit from this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have used a multitude of products for my aging, dry, curly, Italian hair.  I used ouidad for several months and did not notice a change in my hair.  Expensive products, loaded with laurels and chemicals &#x3D; bad choice.&lt;br /&gt;I settled on Wen products and they work much better with my dry hair and are much more cost effective for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It really moisturizes my hair and is just heavy enough for my lightweight hair</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of it natural oils.</li>
            <li> Ouidad is the best product that I have found for my curly hair.  I used to get it at Sephora&#x27;s but it is no longer available. Glad I can still get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this a lot prior to purchasing it from Amazon.  It is a great product and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Shampoo works fine but very strong perfume scent.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter and she loves this hair product!</li>
