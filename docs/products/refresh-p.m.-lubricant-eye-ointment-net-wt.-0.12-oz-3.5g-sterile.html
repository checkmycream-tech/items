    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Allergan&#x27;s Celluvisc are probably the best I have tried (though amazon does not sell them any longer).</li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>This problem required an ointment that could cover the front of the eye until my eye could begin functioning again, and PM worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Incredible!</li>
            <li>The consistency is perfect.</li>
            <li>Don&#x60;t expect perfect vision once applied (PM,who needs vision when sleeping?).Prefer drops over this product?</li>
            <li>In looking at competing products this one has the best ratio of ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I use a CPAP at night so the volume of pressure (wind) was affecting my eyes greatly.</li>
            <li>My optometrists noticed a great improvement in my eyes after using fish oil and this product.</li>
            <li>does what it is supposed to do, delivered on time, and a great price</li>
            <li>great product and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soothing to the eyes does a good job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x60;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Try putting a drop in your eye before bed and see what good it does.</li>
            <li>it might be a good product, but not for me..</li>
            <li>I have tried many things, even Restasis and nothing has worked as good as this..</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and does an excellent job of moisturizing my eyes all night.  </li>
            <li>Since i work in IT, i need some kind of vision to see my computer screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many gels for nighttime use, but this one is undoubtedly the best, really keeps my corneas in good shape</li>
            <li>I had to wash my face more than once and then use an eye make up remover cloth.  </li>
            <li>So, the Refresh gets tossed out and I just ordered some more Genteal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it at night and it reduces the need for as many eye drops during the day.</li>
            <li>I have used a couple of brands, I think they are comparable in texture and efficacy, maybe this gives more coverage</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Eye ointments are used mostly for overnight because it will cause blurry vision.</li>
            <li>My optometrist told me this that this will cause more irritation and inflammation.</li>
            <li>Anyway, love this product.</li>
            <li>I love reading these reviews.</li>
            <li>eyes feel sometimes better sometimes not.</li>
            <li>and I just printed off a coupon to purchase more.  </li>
            <li>And because I&#x27;m able to put into my eye easily it seems to stay better.</li>
            <li>For my severe dry eyes, this product works the best for me when used at night.</li>
            <li>I think it does an excellent job curbing this foreign body sensation in my eyes from my corneal abrasion, if you suffer from headaches and blurred vision from using the computer, watching TV, vid.</li>
            <li>easy way to apply is I add to Q-tip and then apply to my eyes...</li>
            <li>makes it easy to do...</li>
            <li>this is preservative free and that is recommended for transplants or lasik or sensitivities to preservatives.</li>
            <li>If you have severe dry eye or need an overnight ointment to keep the eye lubricated, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>This is great for post LASIK severe dry eye.</li>
            <li>Just before I go to sleep, I drop a bit into my eyes, &amp; when I wake up, my vision is nice and clear,</li>
            <li>The other good thing about it is that after you close your eyes, some will come out of your eyes and you can rub it on and around your eyelids/crow&#x27;s feet and makes your skin around your eyes feel so good and soft.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for them because I couldn&#x27;t sleep very well without them!</li>
            <li>I also bought GenTeal Severe Dry Eye Relief, Lubricant Eye Gel (from Amazon) which is basically the same thing although has no preservatives and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Proves how clueless some people are.</li>
            <li>It makes wearing my contacts the next day a lot more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Really, all the nighttime ointments are pretty much the same, but these tubes don&#x27;t get stuck before you get to the end, so they&#x27;re a good value.</li>
            <li>My eyes absolutely feel better and look a little better.</li>
            <li>So Much!</li>
            <li>This is an OTC product that my wife regularly uses and is pleased with it.</li>
            <li>No left over more grease.  </li>
            <li>The difficulty I have with the ointment is that I must first take the cap off, squeeze about 1/4 inch of the ointment out and then place it on the inside of my lower eyelid.  </li>
            <li>In order to see the process and know I&#x27;m in the right spot I have to get very close to the mirror.  </li>
            <li>Dr. advised me to use this product.. took long time to get so, I purchased from food store while waiting but, would order again as I love my Amazon and suppliers........</li>
            <li>Apply topically into the eyelid at hour of sleep, wink twice to evenly distribute the ointment over the cornea and conjunctiva, and  sweet dreams!</li>
            <li>My eyes feel dry mostly in the morning when I awaken so</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not going anywhere the next day -- that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>and if you are having a hard time with application then have a spouse or a loved one</li>
            <li>so I was very hopeful about this ointment.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, endorsed by the Mayo clinic and without irritating eye preservatives.</li>
            <li>I find this product to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li>He said to put drops during the day when needed and if they feel itchy, instead of rubbing, put some ice in a paper towel and rest it gently on your eyes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It makes reading the newspaper a real challenge.</li>
            <li>night i forgot to put it in, and in the am my vision was much sharper.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use too much you&#x27;ll wake up with goo all over your face.</li>
            <li>now using during the day and it keeping my eyes trouble free not easy to be oil free but worth it to have eye comfort...working better than drops so as always has give and takes....</li>
            <li>I find that I have to apply a hot wash cloth to my eyes in the morning to clear up my vision; I sometimes add Johnson and Johnson baby shampoo, a trick I learned when I had cataract surgery.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t continue to use it because the postage and packing is exorbitant from Sams and I can&#x27;t find anyone else who sells this particular version.</li>
            <li>games, reading books or anything that requires many constant hours of eye strain then you will benefit tremendously from the use of this product in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li>If you want to rub, then just gently squeeze near the inside of the eye, he said.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to use this product and see normally after.</li>
            <li>It is meant for nighttime use (who walks around with a glob of goo during the day and complains that the goo is deterring them from doing normal activities?)</li>
            <li>Not easy to use, like refresh liquigel better</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>You will not be able to read clearly for a few minutes after application.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my eye doc, this stuff provided hours of lubrication (mostly designed for keeping the eye moist overnight when you cannot be expected to repeatedly use eye drops) and prevented my eye from the possible damage that could come from drying out.</li>
            <li>I could not even open them without putting drops in my eyes first.  </li>
            <li>I have to agree with the last reviewer - this is an outstanding product, but it appears that, from other reviews, people are trying to use it in place of eyedrops.  </li>
            <li>no tears making up for the natural oils our eyes create!</li>
            <li>Only nightly eye ointment I&#x27;ve found that actually helps, yet my eyes are better the next day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to nicely squeeze the ointment onto the lower eyelid.</li>
            <li>If your eyes get dry during the day, this is not the right product for you -- eyedrops should be used.  </li>
            <li>I must be allergic or sensitive to one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>This does work, HOWEVER, it does not dissolve completely overnight.  </li>
            <li>Wish I could chop more than a buck off the ridiculous in-store price by getting it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product once for a severe case of dry eye, and it worked very well.     </li>
            <li>I ordered my shipment of two \\&quot;Refresh P.M. Lubricant Eye Ointment\\&quot; a couple days before I left my home in San Francisco and it arrived just a couple days after I got back at my new apartment near school!</li>
            <li>Tear drops provide limited lubrication and dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of problems with dry eyes because I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome which causes severe dry eye problems along with many other symptoms.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that it takes a couple of hours to clear from my eyes each morning.  </li>
            <li>This ointment is NOT a replacement for eyedrops for dry eyes - it is a very viscous ointment/gel which is to be used at night only, when you don&#x27;t need to see, and helps prevent damage to the cornea from dryness while you are sleeping.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it works very well, my prescriptions, dry out my eye, especially when I get sleepy!</li>

            <li> if you have had lasik, wear contacts, have chronic dry eyes or major irritation then the purpose of this ointment should be obvious.</li>
            <li> All this is is half and half vaseline and mineral oil...and they charge $10-12 for 3.5 grams of it, that&#x27;s little more than a tenth of an ounce.  </li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t a replacement for eyedrops -- it is typically an overnight ointment for cases where the eye is sensitive and/or at risk from one of several maladies.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this for my severe dry eye condition mixed with a side of anemia-which equals red irritated eyes.  </li>
            <li> A small squeeze and too much came out.</li>
            <li> I suffer from moderate dry eye</li>
            <li> lubricant is a bit difficult to put into the eye as it doesn&#x27;t dissolve very quickly, so sometimes it just fall onto the lower lid and not into the eyeball itself</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time, which was one of the brands recommended to me by my eye doctor.  </li>
            <li> I RECENTLY HAD AN EYE OPERATION AND THE LUBE PROVIDED EXPECTED RELIEF.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands, but they are just not the same</li>
            <li> In my case, it is because I could not fully close my eye due to a facial paralysis.  </li>
            <li> Other brands all have various flaws.</li>
            <li> I was taking accutane medication and woke up one morning with my eyes so dry my eyelids were stuck to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> My eyes were still sometimes a bit dry but never again had the nightmare of waking up with my eyes sealed shut.    </li>
            <li> Also remember to take fish oil for your dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for years as a nighttime eye lubricant for dry eye syndrome.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use a CPAP at night so the volume of pressure (wind) was affecting my eyes greatly. Optometrist recommended this brand and it works wonders! I no longer have irritated eyes and have to keep a kleenex close to my face all day as my eyes water! A miracle for me...I tried other brands, but they are just not the same</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time, which was one of the brands recommended to me by my eye doctor.  It&#x27;s soothing to the eyes does a good job.  I wish it were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> I was taking accutane medication and woke up one morning with my eyes so dry my eyelids were stuck to my eyes.  I could not even open them without putting drops in my eyes first.  It was extremely painful.  For the remainder of my treatment I used this every night and it was a life saver.  My eyes were still sometimes a bit dry but never again had the nightmare of waking up with my eyes sealed shut.    This stuff is very thick and is like putting vaseline on your eyes.  You will not be able to read clearly for a few minutes after application.  It is meant only for night use and for that it works well.    If this is too thick for you use this instead:  [...]    Also remember to take fish oil for your dry eyes.  My optometrists noticed a great improvement in my eyes after using fish oil and this product.</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to do, delivered on time, and a great price</li>
            <li> I suffer from moderate dry eye so I was very hopeful about this ointment. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t give my eyes any more comfort than regular drops. And to make matters worse, it made my eyelids swollen. I must be allergic or sensitive to one of the ingredients. I plan on sticking to drops instead of this ointment.</li>
            <li> All this is is half and half vaseline and mineral oil...and they charge $10-12 for 3.5 grams of it, that&#x27;s little more than a tenth of an ounce.  1 star because of the pricing.  This is why big corporation make record profits.  Ingredients: White Petrolatum (57.3%), Mineral Oil (42.5%), Lanolin Alcohols</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to this ointment, even though I use the Refresh drops.  Probably something to do with the ointment.  Others may have no problem at all.  It was not good for me.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, endorsed by the Mayo clinic and without irritating eye preservatives. I had been suffering from undiagnosed blepheritis for years until I found this product. I can&#x27;t continue to use it because the postage and packing is exorbitant from Sams and I can&#x27;t find anyone else who sells this particular version. It is disturbing when some distributors charge so much for p&amp;p when others charge one sixth of the price for the same type of product.</li>
            <li> I ordered my shipment of two \\&quot;Refresh P.M. Lubricant Eye Ointment\\&quot; a couple days before I left my home in San Francisco and it arrived just a couple days after I got back at my new apartment near school! I was so excited for them because I couldn&#x27;t sleep very well without them! Thank You So Much!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product for his prosthetic eye, which must be kept lubricated. He only has to use this product twice a day, verses several times a day, as with cheaper products (Walgreens brand is one example). I&#x27;ve used this product once for a severe case of dry eye, and it worked very well.     Don&#x27;t expect to use this product and see normally after. The consistency is very thick and will blur vision, unlike normal drops. If you&#x27;re just looking for drops for slightly irritated eyes, or for red eyes, this may not be what you want. If you have severe dry eye or need an overnight ointment to keep the eye lubricated, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is an OTC product that my wife regularly uses and is pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the last reviewer - this is an outstanding product, but it appears that, from other reviews, people are trying to use it in place of eyedrops.  This ointment is NOT a replacement for eyedrops for dry eyes - it is a very viscous ointment/gel which is to be used at night only, when you don&#x27;t need to see, and helps prevent damage to the cornea from dryness while you are sleeping.  In my case, it is because I could not fully close my eye due to a facial paralysis.  I can&#x27;t stress enough that THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR EYEDROPS.  If your eyes get dry during the day, this is not the right product for you -- eyedrops should be used.  Allergan&#x27;s Celluvisc are probably the best I have tried (though amazon does not sell them any longer).</li>
            <li> This does work, HOWEVER, it does not dissolve completely overnight.  If you&#x27;re not going anywhere the next day -- that&#x27;s fine.  But if you work and if you&#x27;re female and wear make up -- this is not the product for you.  I placed the gel in my eyes as directed at 10 pm...at 6:30 am, my face was a grease pit around my eyes...it even \\&quot;leaked\\&quot; into my hair, which was gross.  I had to wash my face more than once and then use an eye make up remover cloth.  After all that, I still feel \\&quot;jelly eyes\\&quot;...putting on eyeliner was not fun.  So, this is going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry eyes do to a fan in my bedroom (otherwise I&#x27;d die of heat exhaustion).  In the morning, my eyes tear like crazy and if often lasts all day long.  Very annoying.  It&#x27;s hard to believe that dry eye syndrome causes excessive tearing...but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what to do?  I also bought GenTeal Severe Dry Eye Relief, Lubricant Eye Gel (from Amazon) which is basically the same thing although has no preservatives and it works perfectly.  No left over more grease.  So, the Refresh gets tossed out and I just ordered some more Genteal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps  Aside from the grease thing, my eyes still did water a little after the Refresh PM product, but that could have been due to my having to rub it out of my eyes.  After using the Genteal, I had no problems with excessive tears after the first night using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.s  Unlike other reviewers, I do NOT use eye drops throughout the day.  It&#x27;s a hassle to do at work and I would never remember to do it.  My dry eye syndrome was really bad, but one treatment with Genteal helped me the entire day.  No tears.  I&#x27;ve been using it at least 3 times a week and have had no further problems.</li>
            <li> Excellent.Relieves eye irritation.</li>
            <li> For my severe dry eyes, this product works the best for me when used at night.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use, like refresh liquigel better</li>
            <li> purchase this product all the time - needless to say I am a satisfied customer</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t a replacement for eyedrops -- it is typically an overnight ointment for cases where the eye is sensitive and/or at risk from one of several maladies. In my case, Bell&#x27;s Palsy preventing my eye muscles from working to close, blink, or create tears. Tear drops provide limited lubrication and dry quickly. This problem required an ointment that could cover the front of the eye until my eye could begin functioning again, and PM worked perfectly. Recommended by my eye doc, this stuff provided hours of lubrication (mostly designed for keeping the eye moist overnight when you cannot be expected to repeatedly use eye drops) and prevented my eye from the possible damage that could come from drying out. Incredible!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years as a nighttime eye lubricant for dry eye syndrome. It&#x27;s the only product that works. Wish I could chop more than a buck off the ridiculous in-store price by getting it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> As advertised - would buy again.</li>
            <li> I find this product to be very helpful.  I use it at night and it reduces the need for as many eye drops during the day.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with dry eyes because I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome which causes severe dry eye problems along with many other symptoms. I have tried many things, even Restasis and nothing has worked as good as this..It is very thick, like an ointment and you just put a thin strip of it in your eyes...The other good thing about it is that after you close your eyes, some will come out of your eyes and you can rub it on and around your eyelids/crow&#x27;s feet and makes your skin around your eyes feel so good and soft. I recommend this to all my friends that have a need for dry eye remedies.  This is a must if you have issues with dry eyes!</li>
            <li> Not sure what the fuss is about? if you have had lasik, wear contacts, have chronic dry eyes or major irritation then the purpose of this ointment should be obvious. It is meant for nighttime use (who walks around with a glob of goo during the day and complains that the goo is deterring them from doing normal activities?).. I have used a couple of brands, I think they are comparable in texture and efficacy, maybe this gives more coverage but ultimately they are the same and if you are having a hard time with application then have a spouse or a loved one help you.. this is preservative free and that is recommended for transplants or lasik or sensitivities to preservatives. I think it does an excellent job curbing this foreign body sensation in my eyes from my corneal abrasion, if you suffer from headaches and blurred vision from using the computer, watching TV, vid. games, reading books or anything that requires many constant hours of eye strain then you will benefit tremendously from the use of this product in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> I have tried every eye ointment out there and finally tried this one and I love it. Eye ointments are used mostly for overnight because it will cause blurry vision. My eyes feel dry mostly in the morning when I awaken so I use eye ointment before bed. Refresh PM has the easiest applicator. It&#x27;s small enough to nicely squeeze the ointment onto the lower eyelid. The consistency is perfect. And because I&#x27;m able to put into my eye easily it seems to stay better. One of the things that cause my eyes to feel worse in the morning is when I would rub my eyes when I awaken. My optometrist told me this that this will cause more irritation and inflammation. If you want to rub, then just gently squeeze near the inside of the eye, he said. Since I&#x27;ve stopped rubbing my eyes, the irritation is much less. He said to put drops during the day when needed and if they feel itchy, instead of rubbing, put some ice in a paper towel and rest it gently on your eyes. That takes the itchiness away. Anyway, love this product. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Refresh PM is a viscous ophthalmic lubricant indicated for patients suffering from loss of tear production or minimal tear production. Apply topically into the eyelid at hour of sleep, wink twice to evenly distribute the ointment over the cornea and conjunctiva, and  sweet dreams!</li>
            <li> Until my Dr. recommended this, I had never heard  of an ointment for your eyes?? Its way easier to use than I had ever thought? Plus, it works very well, my prescriptions, dry out my eye, especially when I get sleepy! Just before I go to sleep, I drop a bit into my eyes, &amp; when I wake up, my vision is nice and clear, no tears making up for the natural oils our eyes create!</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a good product.I love reading these reviews.Proves how clueless some people are.YES,it&#x60;s an OINTMENT !!! Don&#x60;t expect perfect vision once applied (PM,who needs vision when sleeping?).Prefer drops over this product? Try putting a drop in your eye before bed and see what good it does.Anyone who truly needs this product wish&#x60;s it was less expensive.The one person complaining about the ingredients should just mix Vaseline and mineral oil together and see how that works.</li>
            <li> I like this every night for my dry eyes.  It makes wearing my contacts the next day a lot more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I RECENTLY HAD AN EYE OPERATION AND THE LUBE PROVIDED EXPECTED RELIEF. EVERYTHING I HAD HOPED FOR. HOPE I DO NOT NEED IT AGAIN, BUT WOULD ORDER THIS</li>
            <li> it might be a good product, but not for me..</li>
            <li> Not only do I use Refresh for my eyes at night but also use it at the corners of my eyes trying to reduce the crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> My eye doctor recommended this product for nighttime treatment of my severe dry eyes.  I put this ointment in each eye and cover both eyes with Eyeeco Tranquileyes mask.  It keeps my eyes moist through the night.  The only problem I have is that it takes a couple of hours to clear from my eyes each morning.  It makes reading the newspaper a real challenge.</li>
            <li> Only nightly eye ointment I&#x27;ve found that actually helps, yet my eyes are better the next day.  I would recommend it to everyone that needs a nightly ointment.  Other brands all have various flaws.</li>
            <li> great product and it works well for me...Dr. advised me to use this product.. took long time to get so, I purchased from food store while waiting but, would order again as I love my Amazon and suppliers........now using during the day and it keeping my eyes trouble free not easy to be oil free but worth it to have eye comfort...working better than drops so as always has give and takes....when heading out will use my drops of gel.....easy way to apply is I add to Q-tip and then apply to my eyes... makes it easy to do...</li>
            <li> lubricant is a bit difficult to put into the eye as it doesn&#x27;t dissolve very quickly, so sometimes it just fall onto the lower lid and not into the eyeball itself</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this product.  I need it because I have very dry eyes and should not sleep without applying this.  I have found that as the saying goes, &amp;#34;a little dab will do it&amp;#34;.  In looking at competing products this one has the best ratio of ingredients.  I find that I have to apply a hot wash cloth to my eyes in the morning to clear up my vision; I sometimes add Johnson and Johnson baby shampoo, a trick I learned when I had cataract surgery.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended Refresh drops for my dry eyes and they work well, so I thought I&#x27;d try the P.M. Ointment. I put it in last night and as another reviewer mentioned it was difficult to apply. A small squeeze and too much came out. It&#x27;s very thick and my vision was blurry. After a night&#x27;s sleep, my vision is still blurry. And my eyes feel dry and itchy. I&#x27;ll be tossing this and sticking with the drops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It helps prevent dry, itchy nights during all season of the year. I recommend it to anyone with allergies or dry eyes. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> After using a prescription eye lubricant for 7 weeks and following eyelid surgery, my doctor suggested this non-prescription eye ointment for the next two months in an effort to help my tearing eyes.  Thus far, one week into use, my eyes still tear, but less than previously.  Hopefully after a while, I&#x27;ll see some results as he said &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know what else to suggest to stop the tearing.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Really, all the nighttime ointments are pretty much the same, but these tubes don&#x27;t get stuck before you get to the end, so they&#x27;re a good value.</li>
            <li> it stings little in the eyes...It´s not really comfortable to sleep with...eyes feel sometimes better sometimes not. Its difficult to wash it out cause its oily</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this for my severe dry eye condition mixed with a side of anemia-which equals red irritated eyes.  I apply at night (little messy), however, it forces me to just close my eyes and relax after a long day at work.  Its a must for me and I just printed off a coupon to purchase more.  My eyes absolutely feel better and look a little better.</li>
            <li> After a consultation with the triage nurse at my ophthalmologist&#x27;s office she recommended that I use the ointment prior to bedtime.  It keeps my eyes moist upon waking up and opening my eyes.  It is very soothing and does an excellent job of moisturizing my eyes all night.  The difficulty I have with the ointment is that I must first take the cap off, squeeze about 1/4 inch of the ointment out and then place it on the inside of my lower eyelid.  In order to see the process and know I&#x27;m in the right spot I have to get very close to the mirror.  That is a tricky job for me.</li>
            <li> I use refresh pm before sleep and this product is a godsend for me.</li>
            <li> Once the lasik doc removed my contacts this was recommended. I hate it, during the following day, until the afternoon my vision is still blurry-namely because i have other eye drops i need to take. Since i work in IT, i need some kind of vision to see my computer screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night i forgot to put it in, and in the am my vision was much sharper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not wish this stuff on my worst enemy. Once the 2 week need for this stuff passes i am throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Does not live up to the reviews I have seen . I can&#x27;t tell any difference. Active ingredients are White petroleum and mineral oil which I really do not like putting in my eyes .Not to mention you can buy these products for like 59 cents as opposed to $12.00 .</li>
            <li> This is great for post LASIK severe dry eye. As the package says, this is for nighttime,  just before bed, use only. You just need a tiny dot in each eye. If you use too much you&#x27;ll wake up with goo all over your face. If you use the correct amount each night, this tube should easily last you for a year.</li>
            <li> I have tried many gels for nighttime use, but this one is undoubtedly the best, really keeps my corneas in good shape</li>
            <li> last thing i do before bed</li>
