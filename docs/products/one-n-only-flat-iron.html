            <li>- Chi works better</li>
            <li>The straightener is okay</li>
            <li>it works but the quality of the iron isn&#x27;t top quality.</li>

            <li>This is my first to you use this kind of straightener.  </li>
            <li>It gets my hair so smooth and silky and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Another Plus, when using argan  oil it leaves your hair silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I did not use the free oil they give you nor did I put any grease to help it straighten, this was 100% the straigtner.</li>
            <li>Great price for the only straightening iron my wife will even touch!</li>
            <li>This plastic straightener feels cheap in your hands, and I found that it still catches and pulls my hair as I straighten.</li>
            <li>the Argan heat keeps the irons nice and clean and heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a thinner flat iron to use for travel purposes and this one is great.</li>
            <li>I consistently use Moroccan Oil and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to use it</li>
            <li>The Sedu worked great however over time it started to loose its heating element</li>
            <li>This is by far the best flat iron I&#x27;ve  ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>It is used every day and has held up to a teenage daughter and her friends, good product would buy another one.</li>
            <li>I loved my \\&quot;new\\&quot; straight hair, but my straight iron was just not cutting the mustard.  </li>
            <li>Straightened out my thick curly hair so well, I was impressed!</li>
            <li>I have a Chi and this is way better contrary to the whole Chi hype.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and seems to straighten my hair better than the Chi.  </li>
            <li>This one takes more run throughs to get my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and with no problems.  </li>
            <li>Light weight, heats up quick and leaves my hair smooth and soft!!!</li>
            <li>Also, this iron gets pretty hot and my hair looks great for one day until moisture from outside</li>
            <li>If you ever drop this one be sure to just get a new one.</li>
            <li>omg this thing get HOT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to serve real of my friends and they love it just as much.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>It is a very easy iron to use and I like it except that the outside gets very hot.</li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>It really get&#x27;s my hair straight, board straight, and it&#x27;s shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>This is the first really nice flat iron I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast and gets the job</li>
            <li>Bought this product and a Solia Tourmaline Ceramic Ionic flat iron from Amazon at the same time because the reviews on both items were so mixed.and varied greatly.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully on non expensive cost.</li>
            <li>my first try on the Argan</li>
            <li>I really like this one!</li>
            <li>It does get pretty hot .</li>
            <li>I used the One and Only once and was satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>I used to keep my hot tools straightener to the max</li>
            <li>Only Aragn Heat Ceramic flat iron is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>better than a chi flat iron!</li>
            <li>but this one i keep at like 15/20, so I can definitely see this working on a more intense curl.</li>
            <li>My old iron and this one both have the same heat control device and both go up to 450 degrees, but this one is far superior.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased several high end irons and yet Babyliss does the job better.</li>
            <li>These plates do get very hot and it leaves your hair feeling soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>When I started using the Argan Heat blow dryer, I can get my hair silky and straight.  </li>
            <li>So, I went to the Salon and had the Keratin Process done on my hair and pulled my straight iron out of storage.  </li>
            <li>I literally did one swipe on a piece of hair and it was sooooooo straight .</li>
            <li>.. gets my hair straight and shiny..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really recommend this straightener.  </li>
            <li>It seems that my hair stays straight and not get frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I really like this straightening iron.</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast and makes ironing my hair a breeze.</li>
            <li>This is what I call a &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; iron smoothed straight.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it damages my hair nearly as much either.  </li>
            <li>The argan hasn&#x27;t really help with that at all but the straightener works well.</li>
            <li>Argan straighter is better than all the other brands I have</li>
            <li>wavy hair and this flat iron leaves my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li>This flat iron works so smoothly, I don&#x27;t have to get worried about my hair getting caught at all...</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get nearly as hot as my old straightener, so it took me forever to do my hair.</li>
            <li>and I live in VERY humid weather, so</li>
            <li>Only advice to any potential buyers, make sure you&#x27;ve got something to protect your hair from the severe heat this straightener puts off so it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different models over the years, but this one makes my hair look fabulous!</li>
            <li>The only con is that the area around the plates gets extremely hot, so I had to put on hot pad on my vanity because it was burning the surface</li>
            <li>Fast seamless process.</li>
            <li>Really works without pulling, unlike my old iron with teeth.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t get it board straight if you don&#x27;t have the Karatin Process, but it will be better than any other flat iron on the market.</li>
            <li>It is quick to heat up and quick to straighten - you don&#x27;t have to do multiple sweeps like other units.</li>
            <li>have tried a billion different straighteners and my go to has always been Hot Tools ceramic.</li>
            <li>I really so far knock on wood have only positive feedback for this site.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this straight iron.  </li>
            <li>I had the 1 1/2&amp;#34; one and used it on my hair when it was natural.</li>
            <li>So, if it straightens my hair (Afro-American natural)</li>
            <li>but I prefer my old solia over this hair straightener.</li>
            <li>My hair is colored and natural .</li>
            <li>but i only wear it straight.</li>
            <li>I’ve never been one of those girls who developed the skill to do hair well.  </li>
            <li>3 days later, 3 cycle classes, and my hair is still straight.</li>
            <li>Especially if you have intense ethnic hair like myself.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>It really cut down on the time it takes me to get ready in the morning!</li>
            <li>The plug in to the iron itself would come loose and not stay hot.  </li>
            <li>Heats up in a flash, makes my hair look silky smooth with little effort!</li>
            <li>this is a major plus!</li>
            <li>The 1-inch plates are enough to be able to comfortably iron my hair, and they are thin enough so that the flat iron can double as a curling iron!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this flat iron; I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months now.</li>
            <li>On the other hand the Solia Toumatine Ceramic 1/2 inch flat iron ran true to temp settings and handled well.</li>
            <li>I guess the price should indicate the quality, but the other reviews were so positive, I took a leap of faith on it.</li>
            <li>last long yay thanks</li>
            <li>I only had to run the iron over each section piece 1-2 times to achieve complete straightness.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long and naturally straight (not a whisper of curl at all), so I want a straightener for curling (curling iron curls will be flat within minutes in my hair).  </li>
            <li>I resumed using my old flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have very coarse and curvy/curly hair and, apparently, poofy.  </li>
            <li>Obviously that wasn&#x27;t going to help get my hair straighter, but at least my formerly clean hair didnt smell.</li>
            <li>As someone who only has slightly wavy hair, I don&#x27;t need to necessarily worry about a heavy duty iron, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it would work on extremely thick curly hair, but it looks great on mine.</li>
            <li>I originally started flat ironing my hair on the highest setting because I have thick &amp; coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Afro American with natural hair, I typically let my hair dry in twist making the shaft of my hair overall straight</li>

            <li> This is the first really nice flat iron I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast and gets the job</li>
            <li> Bought this product and a Solia Tourmaline Ceramic Ionic flat iron from Amazon at the same time because the reviews on both items were so mixed.and varied greatly.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully on non expensive cost.</li>
            <li> my first try on the Argan</li>
            <li> I really like this one!</li>
            <li> It does get pretty hot .</li>
            <li> I used the One and Only once and was satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> I used to keep my hot tools straightener to the max</li>
            <li> Only Aragn Heat Ceramic flat iron is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> better than a chi flat iron!</li>
            <li> but this one i keep at like 15/20, so I can definitely see this working on a more intense curl.</li>
            <li> My old iron and this one both have the same heat control device and both go up to 450 degrees, but this one is far superior.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased several high end irons and yet Babyliss does the job better.</li>
            <li> These plates do get very hot and it leaves your hair feeling soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> When I started using the Argan Heat blow dryer, I can get my hair silky and straight.  </li>
            <li> So, I went to the Salon and had the Keratin Process done on my hair and pulled my straight iron out of storage.  </li>
            <li> I literally did one swipe on a piece of hair and it was sooooooo straight .</li>
            <li> .. gets my hair straight and shiny..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really recommend this straightener.  </li>
            <li> It seems that my hair stays straight and not get frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I really like this straightening iron.</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast and makes ironing my hair a breeze.</li>
            <li> This is what I call a &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; iron smoothed straight.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it damages my hair nearly as much either.  </li>
            <li> The argan hasn&#x27;t really help with that at all but the straightener works well.</li>
            <li> Argan straighter is better than all the other brands I have</li>
            <li> wavy hair and this flat iron leaves my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li> This flat iron works so smoothly, I don&#x27;t have to get worried about my hair getting caught at all...</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get nearly as hot as my old straightener, so it took me forever to do my hair.</li>
            <li> and I live in VERY humid weather, so</li>
            <li> Only advice to any potential buyers, make sure you&#x27;ve got something to protect your hair from the severe heat this straightener puts off so it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different models over the years, but this one makes my hair look fabulous!</li>
            <li> The only con is that the area around the plates gets extremely hot, so I had to put on hot pad on my vanity because it was burning the surface</li>
            <li> Fast seamless process.</li>
            <li> Really works without pulling, unlike my old iron with teeth.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t get it board straight if you don&#x27;t have the Karatin Process, but it will be better than any other flat iron on the market.</li>
            <li> It is quick to heat up and quick to straighten - you don&#x27;t have to do multiple sweeps like other units.</li>
            <li> have tried a billion different straighteners and my go to has always been Hot Tools ceramic.</li>
            <li> I really so far knock on wood have only positive feedback for this site.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this straight iron.  </li>
            <li> I had the 1 1/2&amp;#34; one and used it on my hair when it was natural.</li>
            <li> So, if it straightens my hair (Afro-American natural)</li>
            <li> but I prefer my old solia over this hair straightener.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored and natural .</li>
            <li> but i only wear it straight.</li>
            <li> I’ve never been one of those girls who developed the skill to do hair well.  </li>
            <li> 3 days later, 3 cycle classes, and my hair is still straight.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have intense ethnic hair like myself.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> It really cut down on the time it takes me to get ready in the morning!</li>
            <li> The plug in to the iron itself would come loose and not stay hot.  </li>
            <li> Heats up in a flash, makes my hair look silky smooth with little effort!</li>
            <li> this is a major plus!</li>
            <li> The 1-inch plates are enough to be able to comfortably iron my hair, and they are thin enough so that the flat iron can double as a curling iron!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this flat iron; I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months now.</li>
            <li> On the other hand the Solia Toumatine Ceramic 1/2 inch flat iron ran true to temp settings and handled well.</li>
            <li> I guess the price should indicate the quality, but the other reviews were so positive, I took a leap of faith on it.</li>
            <li> last long yay thanks</li>
            <li> I only had to run the iron over each section piece 1-2 times to achieve complete straightness.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and naturally straight (not a whisper of curl at all), so I want a straightener for curling (curling iron curls will be flat within minutes in my hair).  </li>
            <li> I resumed using my old flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse and curvy/curly hair and, apparently, poofy.  </li>
            <li> Obviously that wasn&#x27;t going to help get my hair straighter, but at least my formerly clean hair didnt smell.</li>
            <li> As someone who only has slightly wavy hair, I don&#x27;t need to necessarily worry about a heavy duty iron, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it would work on extremely thick curly hair, but it looks great on mine.</li>
            <li> I originally started flat ironing my hair on the highest setting because I have thick &amp; coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Afro American with natural hair, I typically let my hair dry in twist making the shaft of my hair overall straight</li>
            <li> I have had several flat irons before and this was never a problem.</li>
            <li> I have owned several flat irons and this is by far my favorite, it is also quite a bit less expensive to buy on amazon than at the beauty supply store online.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I just received my flat iron yesterday</li>
            <li> All of my coworkers had switched their flat iron to this one.</li>
            <li> I received the flat iron in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with purchasing this flat iron.</li>
            <li> The curls I get with this straightener last all day long - and</li>
            <li> have a Chi flat iron</li>
            <li> I rely on blow drying and flat ironing when I want to wear my hair</li>
            <li> I am African American  &amp; my hair type is extremely thick/coarse/medium length.  </li>
            <li> I gave the flat iron a second chance, since I just spent $50 on it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it gets dried and frizzy-looking very easily.</li>
            <li> My old flat iron was broken that day and I needed a new one asap</li>
            <li> My hair stays styled for up to three days with minor touch-ups</li>
            <li> I have bought the CHI which was the most disappointing thing ive ever bought, not to mention it leaves your hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair with just one sweep over each section, on medium heat, and there is absolutely no frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, coarse, and goes through regular color treatments.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and thick.</li>
            <li> Not good on African American hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other people&#x27;s CHI&#x27;s in the past and never liked them because my hair tended to get caught and there wasn&#x27;t much &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; in the iron (if that makes sense).</li>
            <li> Some other brands you have to run it through your hair</li>
            <li> I usually pay my friend to simply flat iron my hair once a week.</li>
            <li> It would usually take me about an hour and a half to flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Not worth that prices.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The iron can burn the cord when you set it down ,which it did to me today</li>
            <li> I have used it twice and have to say I had to use it less to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> Heat settings are not true and burnt my hair.</li>
            <li> hair is long thick and curly.</li>
            <li> Not very satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> Not only was it a quarter of the price my Sedu was-it works just as well-if not better!!</li>
            <li> The plates are really narrow.</li>
            <li> For me this is jus a everyday iron to achieve you hair style just for the day .</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I do not relax or put any harsh chemicals on my hair.</li>
            <li> The Babyliss pro was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> If you have coarse, wavy hair and are frustrated with it&#x27;s unruliness, rest assured this is the flat iron for you.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine had an expensive CHI flat iron and I have used that one before.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is thick and shoulder-length with stubborn curls.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using a very expensive Sedu flat iron for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> However, there is a small space between the plates that can make it a bit difficult to grasp small amounts of hair.</li>
            <li> Still no good.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had all the expensive brands too and this works just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> I hate having to restart an iron after an hour.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is used every day and has held up to a teenage daughter and her friends, good product would buy another one.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron I&#x27;ve  ever purchased.  I have purchased several high end irons and yet Babyliss does the job better. Another Plus, when using argan  oil it leaves your hair silky and smooth.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener.  I&#x27;ve had an FHI and a Chi, and this beats them both.  When I started using the Argan Heat blow dryer, I can get my hair silky and straight.  My hair type is thick/wavy/kinda frizzy.  The blow dryer makes the straightener optional, but using both I get amazing results.  If you&#x27;re looking for a great straightener, give this one a try.  Get the blow dryer, too.  It really cut down on the time it takes me to get ready in the morning!</li>
            <li> I have very coarse and curvy/curly hair and, apparently, poofy.  It&#x27;s curly when it&#x27;s longer and curvy when it&#x27;s shorter.  My husband of 25 years recently told me he doesn&#x27;t like \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; hair.  So, I went to the Salon and had the Keratin Process done on my hair and pulled my straight iron out of storage.  I loved my \\&quot;new\\&quot; straight hair, but my straight iron was just not cutting the mustard.  My sister swears by the Chi, but after looking at the reviews, I decided to go with this one.  I really liked that Argan oil was infused in the ceramic plates.  I consistently use Moroccan Oil and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that to say that this straight iron is awesome!  My old iron and this one both have the same heat control device and both go up to 450 degrees, but this one is far superior.  It really get&#x27;s my hair straight, board straight, and it&#x27;s shiny and healthy looking.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this straight iron.  If you have coarse, wavy hair and are frustrated with it&#x27;s unruliness, rest assured this is the flat iron for you.  It won&#x27;t get it board straight if you don&#x27;t have the Karatin Process, but it will be better than any other flat iron on the market.</li>
            <li> Straightened out my thick curly hair so well, I was impressed!</li>
            <li> I love this iron. I had the 1 1/2&amp;#34; one and used it on my hair when it was natural. It did the job straightening my roots and ppl always thought i had a relaxer. The one thing I didn&#x27;t like was, I dropped it once and omg, it short circuited and singed my hair. My hair broke off in several spots. If you ever drop this one be sure to just get a new one. Not worth the risk. I saw where someone didn&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have auto shut-off but I actually like that it doesn&#x27;t turn itself off. I hate having to restart an iron after an hour.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this flat iron. Not good on African American hair</li>
            <li> I just received my flat iron yesterday and I was so excited to use it; I placed the order on Monday and recieved on a Wednesday. I have bought the CHI which was the most disappointing thing ive ever bought, not to mention it leaves your hair feeling dry. I am African American  &amp; my hair type is extremely thick/coarse/medium length.  I literally did one swipe on a piece of hair and it was sooooooo straight . I believe I had my settings on 25 which suprisingly is not the hottest. These plates do get very hot and it leaves your hair feeling soft &amp; silky. I did not use the free oil they give you nor did I put any grease to help it straighten, this was 100% the straigtner. I am more than satisifed that i can go on! You will not be dissappointed. .</li>
            <li> I am a hair dresser, and I found this wonderful flat iron by accident. My old flat iron was broken that day and I needed a new one asap so I stopped by at the nearest supply store and they didn&#x27;t have the one I used before. So I decided to looking for a good deal one which was this one, they had 20% off on that day. Since I used it on my clients&#x27; hair everyone fell in love with it and asked me where did I get it. All of my coworkers had switched their flat iron to this one. It&#x27;s amazing, makes hair shiny and smooth healthy look without pulling. And when you try to make curl, it came out so beautiful. I would suggest all hair dressers to use this for styling or even use for the Keratin Treatment. It works wonderfully on non expensive cost. This is the BEST one...Love it !</li>
            <li> Did not like how it heated up and the actual Argan Oil worked with my hair.  It has been returned.</li>
            <li> love this .. I own two and they are great .. gets my hair straight and shiny.. the Argan heat keeps the irons nice and clean and heats up fast.  It is better than any chi you can buy!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, coarse, and goes through regular color treatments. Needless to say, it gets dried and frizzy-looking very easily. This straightening iron helps my hair look healthy, smooth, and glossy for days at a time! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. It gets my hair so smooth and silky and is easy to use. The heat dial stays in place so you don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally changing the setting. I have faith it will last because it is a babybliss product. I have a Chi and this is way better contrary to the whole Chi hype.</li>
            <li> I received the flat iron in a timely manner. The plates are really narrow. I originally started flat ironing my hair on the highest setting because I have thick &amp; coarse hair. My hair had a burnt smell and it wasn&#x27;t straightening my hair enough.  I didn&#x27;t want burnt smelling hair, so I switched to 20, a lower setting. Obviously that wasn&#x27;t going to help get my hair straighter, but at least my formerly clean hair didnt smell. I gave the flat iron a second chance, since I just spent $50 on it. Still no good. I resumed using my old flat iron. Don&#x27;t bother with purchasing this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This straightening iron is one of the best ones i have had, leave hair looking beautiful. last long yay thanks</li>
            <li> This is waaayy better than the Chi I had been using.  Slides effortlessly over hair and straightens and smooths in just one pass.  I was going to buy another GHD (had that prior to the Chi) which was my all time favorite flatiron, but for the price, this one is a great purchase.  Very pleased.  My only suggestion would be to have it shut off automatically if left plugged in accidentally.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice and have to say I had to use it less to straighten my hair.  Some other brands you have to run it through your hair several times before you get the look you want.  This is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Afro American with natural hair, I typically let my hair dry in twist making the shaft of my hair overall straight and this works great.  My only issue is the burnt hair particles stuck to the ceramic plate.  Also, this iron gets pretty hot and my hair looks great for one day until moisture from outside makes my hair curl back up.  So, if it straightens my hair (Afro-American natural) It would probably work for the next person.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good straightening iron.  Have no complaints about it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my hair stylist recommended it and am I glad I listened to her.  This is, by far, the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.  My hair is long and naturally straight (not a whisper of curl at all), so I want a straightener for curling (curling iron curls will be flat within minutes in my hair).  The curls I get with this straightener last all day long - and it glides through all the way to the ends of my hair with ease.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Works great and straightens my thick hair perfectly.  Arrived quickly and with no problems.  Only advice to any potential buyers, make sure you&#x27;ve got something to protect your hair from the severe heat this straightener puts off so it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li> Great price for the only straightening iron my wife will even touch!</li>
            <li> Love it. Had to buy my daughter in law one too!</li>
            <li> I love this straightening iron! I&#x27;ve used several different models over the years, but this one makes my hair look fabulous! I have hair that is thick and shoulder-length with stubborn curls. This unit takes out those curls with no issues or fuss. It is quick to heat up and quick to straighten - you don&#x27;t have to do multiple sweeps like other units. It also leaves my hair glossy. I get so many compliments when I use it. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is my first to you use this kind of straightener.  I have always used a Chi.  I have had 2 Chis to break on me.  The plug in to the iron itself would come loose and not stay hot.  I really recommend this straightener.  It heats up fast and seems to straighten my hair better than the Chi.  It seems that my hair stays straight and not get frizzy.  This is well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using a very expensive Sedu flat iron for the past 5 years. The Sedu worked great however over time it started to loose its heating element so I was searching for a replacement. A friend of mine bought this one and raved about it-after trying hers I was sold! Not only was it a quarter of the price my Sedu was-it works just as well-if not better!!</li>
            <li> This straightener makes my hair look and feel healthy. I&#x27;ve recommended it to serve real of my friends and they love it just as much. Worth every penny</li>
            <li> better than a chi flat iron!</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast and gets the job done- goodbye humidity hair!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is awesome, I love it! Is the best I have used, leave your hair straight and shinny.</li>
            <li> I really so far knock on wood have only positive feedback for this site.&lt;br /&gt;This Argan straighter is better than all the other brands I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long thick and curly. Latin women have these issues. The humidity makes our hair so frizzzxyy&lt;br /&gt;I have a Chi flat iron $ 200 yea that&#x27;s what I paid. Not worth that prices.&lt;br /&gt;With my first try on the Argan it was amazing how smoother and shinier it got. It still took me for ever but that becuz all the hair I have. Very happy with this brand.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a thinner flat iron to use for travel purposes and this one is great. It works wonderful. I have frizzy, wavy hair and this flat iron leaves my hair silky smooth and I only need to go over each section one time. A friend of mine had an expensive CHI flat iron and I have used that one before. In my opinion this one works great and it was 80.00 cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great product according to my gf.....</li>
            <li> The plate was scratched - it works okay - Chi works better</li>
            <li> This is the first really nice flat iron I&#x27;ve had and I looked around substantially, including going to Ulta where I could touch and try all of them out on my hair. (They were off of course, but I just wanted the feel of them). This flat iron works so smoothly, I don&#x27;t have to get worried about my hair getting caught at all...I&#x27;ve tried other people&#x27;s CHI&#x27;s in the past and never liked them because my hair tended to get caught and there wasn&#x27;t much &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; in the iron (if that makes sense). I really like this one! As someone who only has slightly wavy hair, I don&#x27;t need to necessarily worry about a heavy duty iron, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it would work on extremely thick curly hair, but it looks great on mine. It straightens my hair with just one sweep over each section, on medium heat, and there is absolutely no frizz. I would highly recommend this flat iron; I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months now. The only con is that the area around the plates gets extremely hot, so I had to put on hot pad on my vanity because it was burning the surface lol.</li>
            <li> Heats up in a flash, makes my hair look silky smooth with little effort! I have owned several flat irons and this is by far my favorite, it is also quite a bit less expensive to buy on amazon than at the beauty supply store online. Love love love!!!</li>
            <li> The straightener is okay but I prefer my old solia over this hair straightener. This one takes more run throughs to get my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I really like this straightening iron. It heats up really fast and makes ironing my hair a breeze. However, there is a small space between the plates that can make it a bit difficult to grasp small amounts of hair. Other than that, it is a great! Leaves my hair feeling and looking silky (I have not yet tried the tiny bottle of Argan oil that comes with the iron). The 1-inch plates are enough to be able to comfortably iron my hair, and they are thin enough so that the flat iron can double as a curling iron! My hair stays styled for up to three days with minor touch-ups and I live in VERY humid weather, so this is a major plus! If you are looking for a good iron and are on a budget, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> I would give this a 2.5 product. My hair is colored and natural . My hair grows in waves and is thicker in the middle of my head. I had to turn the heat up from 20 to 25 to flatten it . It does get pretty hot . The iron can burn the cord when you set it down ,which it did to me today and I just received it. This is what I call a &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; iron smoothed straight. If you are looking for the BONE STR8 look than this is not the iron for you. For me this is jus a everyday iron to achieve you hair style just for the day . My hair will be back poofy by the end of the day .</li>
            <li> This plastic straightener feels cheap in your hands, and I found that it still catches and pulls my hair as I straighten. Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get nearly as hot as my old straightener, so it took me forever to do my hair. Not very satisfied at all. I guess the price should indicate the quality, but the other reviews were so positive, I took a leap of faith on it.</li>
            <li> it works but the quality of the iron isn&#x27;t top quality. i do not straighten my hair often so i decided to keep it. it is a fair price.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Light weight, heats up quick and leaves my hair smooth and soft!!!</li>
            <li> Fast seamless process. I used the One and Only once and was satisfied with the results.  I would recommend it to friends</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron and the price is wonderful. I&#x27;ve had all the expensive brands too and this works just as well if not better. I don&#x27;t think it damages my hair nearly as much either.  I would recommend this to anyone and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> omg this thing get HOT! I have curly italian hair but i only wear it straight. have tried a billion different straighteners and my go to has always been Hot Tools ceramic. My straightener is a 1.5 inch model but i recent cut my hair from belly button length to shoulder length so i wanted to get a 1 inch for better mobility - thus my purchase. I chose this model because my hair has been unbearably staticy this year. The argan hasn&#x27;t really help with that at all but the straightener works well. I used to keep my hot tools straightener to the max but this one i keep at like 15/20, so I can definitely see this working on a more intense curl. My hair has a nice smoothness to it afterwards.</li>
            <li> Works great! Though in humidity my hair still unstraightens.</li>
            <li> I’ve never been one of those girls who developed the skill to do hair well.  It would usually take me about an hour and a half to flat iron my hair. I usually pay my friend to simply flat iron my hair once a week. I am Africa American. My hair is naturally curly and thick. I do not relax or put any harsh chemicals on my hair. I rely on blow drying and flat ironing when I want to wear my hair straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Babyliss Pro One Only Aragn Heat Ceramic flat iron is amazing! I took me 30 minutes to straighten my hair. I only had to run the iron over each section piece 1-2 times to achieve complete straightness.  I love product. 3 days later, 3 cycle classes, and my hair is still straight.</li>
            <li> It is a very easy iron to use and I like it except that the outside gets very hot. I have had several flat irons before and this was never a problem.</li>
            <li> Not a good product. Heat settings are not true and burnt my hair. Bought this product and a Solia Tourmaline Ceramic Ionic flat iron from Amazon at the same time because the reviews on both items were so mixed.and varied greatly. Now I know.The Babyliss pro was a waste of money. On the other hand the Solia Toumatine Ceramic 1/2 inch flat iron ran true to temp settings and handled well.</li>
            <li> The kind of straightner that can easily change your life!!!! Especially if you have intense ethnic hair like myself. Great price too. Wow.</li>
            <li> Really works without pulling, unlike my old iron with teeth.  Adjustable settings to protect your hair and the swivel cord makes handling easy.  The price is right too.</li>
