            <li> It is the only spray that holds my hair and seems to increase volume and not go flat.</li>
            <li> Love it,,, holds all day,,,been using for a long time,,,,, but too expensive</li>
            <li> I have used Nick Chavez hairspray for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Although the product does create more \\&quot;volume\\&quot; (a trick of the eye as my hair is still very thin!)</li>
            <li> I used Shaper Plus for over 20 years but was forced to find a new hairspray ever since they changed their formula.  </li>
            <li> I returned it a few days later, spending 7 or  8 dollars postage and have not yet received a refund.</li>
            <li> I do like the Amazon Body-building spray and the Volumizer spray, though, so don&#x27;t bypass other Nick Chavez products.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair \\&quot;chunkier\\&quot; and I find that it attracts dust and my hair feels oilier and dirty quickly.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not sooo terrible that this happens with this spray, but I don&#x27;t want to have to wash it daily as that can create more oil on the scalp and/or strip the hair of oil, so will probably not reorder.  </li>
            <li> I was super disappointed on this hair spray.  </li>
            <li> Holds hair without being stiff and adds volume.</li>
            <li> It holds your hair and it doesn&#x27;t  feel stiff.</li>
            <li> Used it for years but has gotten too expensive so will be using a different product.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and yet Nick Chavez Volumizing Hair spray did not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> My hair is vey thin</li>
            <li> Through the years I have tired almost everything.  </li>

            <li> Amazon had the best price.  For many years I used cheaper products but thought I would try something new.  It last a long time and holds great without being sticky.  I have curly hair that frizzes when wet and most hair sprays go on wet.  This product holds all day, I don&#x27;t have to spend so much time doing my hair.</li>
            <li> Used it for years but has gotten too expensive so will be using a different product.</li>
            <li> Nick Chavez volumizing Extra Hold Hairspray is the only hairspray that holds my hair and doesn&#x27;t feel gummy.  Even in humid climate and in windy weather.  My hair is good to go and you can put a brush through it at the end of the day.  This truly is a wonderful product, especially for those of us that travel.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray!  My hair is thin and yet Nick Chavez Volumizing Hair spray did not weigh my hair down.  It gave my hair volume and was easy to style after using short bursts of spray...brushed out easily at end of day. I am definitely a believer in Nick&#x27;s products now...and I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I have used Nick Chavez hairspray for a long time.  Switched once and never again.  Adds volume without stickinss.  Love it</li>
            <li> I just love Nick Chavez products! They do exactly what they promise to do! My fine and limp hair responds beautifully to Nick Chavez!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hairspray. It helps add volume to hair and the hold is great and not to sticky.</li>
            <li> My hair is vey thin so I use nick Chalvez&#x27;s volumizing  hairspray to give me more volume really would recommend it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have been using it for years now and the hold is superb.  It does not damage my hair either, and maintains the hold all day and into the night as well, basically it holds it until I redo!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Best Hairspray! Holds hair without being stiff and adds volume. Love it,</li>
            <li> This product is just...meh.  I&#x27;ve used it (lasts forever! Never seems to run out!) and I don&#x27;t notice anything great about the product. I do like the Amazon Body-building spray and the Volumizer spray, though, so don&#x27;t bypass other Nick Chavez products.</li>
            <li> I like to use this product in the damper weather for that extra hold. I am a Nick Chavez fan!!!</li>
            <li> I was super disappointed on this hair spray.  It had been used and was 3/4 full.  Wanted to love it but not a hit with me.</li>
            <li> it is the best hair spray ever.  Cannot do my hair without it.  It keeps my hair in shape all day.  Hope nick chavez never stops making it.  My hair is very fine and it is the only hairspray that works with my hair. I never want to run out of it.</li>
            <li> Very good service and products.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Have used it several time before.</li>
            <li> great hairspray however a little pricey</li>
            <li> it is a necessary staple for a great hair style.  The spray holds a hairstyle for a nice long while.  It does not seem to build up like others do.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this brand&lt;br /&gt;Its all she will use now.&lt;br /&gt;She first bought the product from QVC but they no longer carry his products.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the best hairspray ever.  Through the years I have tired almost everything.  I came upon this and decided to try it and I have used nothing else since.</li>
            <li> Although the product does create more \\&quot;volume\\&quot; (a trick of the eye as my hair is still very thin!) it leaves my hair \\&quot;chunkier\\&quot; and I find that it attracts dust and my hair feels oilier and dirty quickly.

I use another Nick Chavez product and have never found anything better (Flocker) for control and styling, so this product was just not formulated right for ME...may be excellent for someone else.</li>
            <li> I order over and over again and agoain.  Holds your hair even in the fine mist of rain! Just try this you&#x27;ll love it also.</li>
            <li> It truly adds volume, giving my hair a lift.  I use it before using the curling iron to set the curl and for styling.  Be sure to comb through just after spraying to avoid tangles.</li>
            <li> Love it, you can run your hands through your hair after you use it. It&#x27;s not tacky, it&#x27;s a girls gotta have</li>
            <li> I STARTED USING THIS HAIRSPRAY BECAUSE WHEN I WORE CONTACTS, IT WOULDN&#x27;T FOG THEM UP.  SINCE, I HAVE LASIK AND I AM STILL USING IT.  LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> Great holding hairspray.  Build volume in fine hair. I always buy a can and a spare.  Nick has the best products</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this hair spray.  I thought I would try it after using Abba but didn&#x27;t like it at all.  I don&#x27;t like the spray can.  I went back to the Abba Pure Finish.</li>
            <li> Love this product - wish we could get it in Canada</li>
            <li> The best hairspray in the world! Holds so well,yet brushes out easily.his products are awesome.I have super fine hair and this is the only spray I would ever use.</li>
            <li> I did not find this hairspray any better than a cheap brand..  It did not volumize my hair, left it sticky and later flatter than ever.  I returned it a few days later, spending 7 or  8 dollars postage and have not yet received a refund.</li>
            <li> Love it,,, holds all day,,,been using for a long time,,,,, but too expensive</li>
            <li> This spray works best for my hair type. It is the only spray that holds my hair and seems to increase volume and not go flat.</li>
            <li> This is great hairspray!!  It has lots of hold without the feel of helmet head and can be brushed out if necessary.  I have been searching for a replacement for Sebastian Shaper Plus and I have finally found it.  I used Shaper Plus for over 20 years but was forced to find a new hairspray ever since they changed their formula.  Nick Chavez hairspray is just as good, if not better.  I will be staying with this product and hope they do not change their formula too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years.  love it.  It helps to add body and volume and brushes out quite easily.  It should be used maybe 8 to ten inches from hair.  For me a really good product.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray that I have ever used.  It holds your hair and it doesn&#x27;t  feel stiff. It also came sooner that they said it would.  Try it, you will like it.</li>
