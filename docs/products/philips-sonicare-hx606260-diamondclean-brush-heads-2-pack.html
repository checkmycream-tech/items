            <li>It works great.</li>

            <li>These work great, tho</li>
            <li>We have had 3 Sonicares over the years and are extremely pleased with thier products but these brushes are wonderful.</li>

            <li>Good</li>
            <li>It seems these brushes are good and get to where they need to be.</li>
            <li>After using this toothbrush for about a year now, my dentist has told me that my gums look really good and to keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare products are truly exceptional performers.  </li>
            <li>So glad that I bought here!  </li>
            <li>Fit is perfect, clean is perfect and price is right!</li>
            <li>We both agree the results, when they work, are appreciated and wonderful.  </li>
            <li>They do a good job cleaning and are easy on my teeth.</li>
            <li>As for these brushes themselves, the diamondclean type are indeed better than the kind that come with the brush.</li>
            <li>It does clean exceptionally well and rinses out nicely.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I love my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and the Sonicare is quieter, has a better battery life, cleans my teeth better, is lighter, and just works better.    </li>
            <li>OK, whatever.</li>
            <li>Comparing it to a manual brush, of course it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these if you need a replacement, nothing more.</li>
            <li>This brush does a better job getting all the foods out that tend to get into the folds inside molars tops.</li>
            <li>Better gums?</li>
            <li>I have been using these for over a month now and love them.</li>
            <li>I always buy a minimum of four or more brush heads at a time, so Iam all set.  </li>
            <li>I love the Diamondclean toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These latest heads are the newest from Sonicare, and are supposed to clean/whiten better.  </li>
            <li>I guess it just seems more efficient, since you&#x27;re covering more territory.</li>
            <li>Is this system significantly better than a manual toothbrush?</li>
            <li>It feels like the bristles are getting between my teeth better.  </li>
            <li>However, that said, the product is a good one and well worth the buy.</li>
            <li>what more do you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>The pockets between my teeth are getting better and my gums are not bleeding anymore.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Philips revolutionized brushing teeth with the original toothbrush, but in my opinion, while these Diamondclean heads are good, they aren&#x27;t revolutionary like the original Sonicare was.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean.  </li>
            <li>A good first impression doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also welcome any new toothbrush product from Philips as they have mastered the dental science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are definitely the best brush heads that are currently available.</li>
            <li>Your smile and your teeth are very important, and impact your life in more ways than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The replacement Brush Heads are paramount to keeping a clean and healthy mouth, gumbs and teeth.</li>
            <li>It makes sense to me that the diamond-shaped bristles would clean better, but my experience doesn&#x27;t justify any additional expense for these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>The Diamond Clean are much more smoother on your gums and your teeth feel more clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>Let me preface this review by saying that I have used Sonicare toothbrushes ever since the very first generation, probably more than 12-years ago.  </li>
            <li>These replacement heads fit with a snap on the FlexCare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The brush is MUCH better than the Pro Results, it has more bristles and is much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>latest product in their family promises whiter teeth, better gums and overall better dental health.</li>
            <li>originally had the Pro Results brushes since I didn&#x27;t have the DiamondClean handle, but I decided to try these brush heads since they&#x27;re compatiable with the handle that I have.</li>
            <li>I saw that I received the original heads</li>
            <li>Teeth feel dentist clean after a brush</li>
            <li>They feel as clean as they do after going to the dentist.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel remarkably clean.</li>
            <li>They clean your teeth,</li>
            <li>So, if the price is right, these are fine.  </li>
            <li>do think your smile is one of those things that most people notice first.</li>
            <li>These seem to be more gentle.</li>
            <li>I love the SoniCare Electric toothbrush very well</li>
            <li>and theyre good deep cleaning bristles</li>
            <li>The Diamondclean version seems to be more marketing than actually being better for your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Of course you have to expect advice and the wear indicators to signal a fairly quick replacement time.</li>
            <li>These are the best (and most expensive) of the sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These new diamondclean brush heads seem kind of ambitious to me.  </li>
            <li>Kids say the like the feel of it better comparing to more flat brushes we used before.</li>
            <li>I have used other toothbrushes but this by far is the best I have ever used</li>
            <li>exception comes in, however, in that the motor tends to never keep a charge for as long as the company claims; the brushes are good for about 1 month versus the recommended 3 months.  </li>
            <li>They feel like my teeth are very clean after using - I will stick with these until Sonicare comes up with something new for me to try!</li>
            <li>getting in-between teeth, but Sonicare makes top quality products, so I trust that their new design is an improvement.</li>
            <li>Phillips is a huge multi-national corporation and usually makes great products.  </li>
            <li>Work as expected and at a great price, love the sonicare however so expensive, so amazon is a great resource for getting these</li>
            <li>I even think it&#x27;s better than the old Oral-B electric toothbrush I was using for 20 years.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because I honestly don&#x27;t see the difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly I don&#x27;t wait to see if the bristles fade, I just change it out to a new brush head when I feel it needs to be replaced, which might be in three months, maybe in alittle less time, but I would replace your brush head in a maximum of three months, just to make sure that your brush head is doing a good job of cleaning your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These brushes do clean even better than their regular brushes.  </li>
            <li>They fit my old Flexwhite handle, which means I didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new brush, so that&#x27;s nice for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think I&#x27;m on my fifth or sixth one right now.</li>
            <li>Surely the vast research resources of Philips worked to get this right</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, I think Sonicare units, overall, do a FAR superior job than a manual toothbrush, even with daily flossing, but you&#x27;re clearly better off with belt and suspenders ...</li>
            <li>These are the latest design, so new that they didn&#x27;t come with the new HealthyWhite Sonicare</li>
            <li>All are pretty heft</li>
            <li>This time, I&#x27;m using the standard size head, and I think I like it better.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure they help to keep my teeth from getting any dingier, which is saying something, because I like my coffee and my red wine.</li>
            <li>after the first brush.  </li>
            <li>There have been studies shown that the sonic style brush does a much better cleaning job than regular brushes.</li>
            <li>My gums were sore for the first week.</li>
            <li>Just to re-iterate, though, I&#x27;m completely thrilled with the Sonicare brush itself, and would not hesitate to recommend it over any other electric or manual brush.</li>
            <li>If you are not using a sonicare toothbrush than you are behind the times my good buddy!</li>
            <li>It pretty much sounds like marketing gobbledygook to me.</li>
            <li>Certainly would benefit the consumer... but not the seller.</li>
            <li>You will experience greater cleanliness through this revolutionary toothbrush that combines new whiting technology and save money by ordering this through Amazon (only $23 vs. $29 in Bed Bath and Beyond).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sounds gross and it is, but bristles that are too rough will tend to more easily cause blood.</li>
            <li>These new-model brush replacements head fit every current Sonicare unit and work very well.</li>
            <li>DiamondClean standard brush heads do fit DiamondClean, Flexcare+,</li>
            <li>I will give them that much.  </li>
            <li>However, I think it ought to be a crime to charge this much money for 2 replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned about this, but it ended up not irritating my gums at all, so I kept using them.  </li>
            <li>a toothbrush is how much blood I get from brushing.</li>
            <li>I was probably expecting too much from these replacement heads, since they did not overwhelm me.  </li>
            <li>If you own a SoniCare toothbrush for which these are intended, then you have few choices of where to buy them.</li>
            <li>They fit the base of the toothbrush I have perfectly</li>
            <li>I can tell you that after I brush, it feels like my teeth have been sandblasted, and I mean that in a good way.</li>
            <li>AFTER THREE WEEKS OF USE: After using one of these brushes for about three weeks I wanted to update the review above to note that these brushes, which at first felt like they did a better job (cleaner) than regular Sonicare heads, seemed to wear out much, much faster.</li>
            <li>So, what is the benefit of this particularly brush head?  </li>
            <li>I definitely did notice a big difference when using it versus a manual toothbrush, which I had used for most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used several different types of the brush heads with my Sonicare FlexCare, and I really love the way these feel.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for two reasons.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have to asume that they came un-used an clean, but they were in a ziplock plastic which was strange.</li>
            <li>This brush head is exactly the same size AND shape as a regular Sonicare brushhead (note this one fits the newer Sonicare models - which is most models sold in the last 5 years).  </li>
            <li>My most recent check on Amazon.com has these brush heads going for nearly twice the cost of the regular.  </li>
            <li>only quibble is that I&#x27;m not convinced they do a better job than any brand new Soniccare replacement head does in its first few uses.</li>
            <li>guess it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to buy these new brush heads and see if you do notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was maybe because I was paying closer attention to the new brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using one of these new Diamondclean bush heads for about a month now.  </li>
            <li>You can see and feel the difference in the way this new toothbrush cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special enough to stop me from buying my regular compact brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using them a while and see how they wear, over time brushes can actually get more stringent as they wear down, others have noted it here too.</li>
            <li>The diamond shape is better because the tip gets into tight spots around gums while the wide middle catches the full length of each tooth on each pass.</li>
            <li>Clearly, Philips is of the mindset that if a consumer is willing to pay big bucks for a toothbrush, then paying way too much for replacement heads will not be given a second thought.  </li>
            <li>If you are currently using the Pro Results, this is certainly a step up.</li>
            <li>In general I highly recommend a Sonicare brush however.</li>
            <li>Also that it removes 100% more plaque in hard to reach places than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical at first that I would actually be able to sell any difference in these and the older brush heads.</li>
            <li>I have been using Sonicare for nearly 3 years now</li>
            <li>Why even bother with the old ones after all this.  </li>
            <li>They actually feel better and the results are something you can see within a few days.  </li>
            <li>The product is already so good that it&#x27;s really hard to tell the slight difference, if any, these new design heads make.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through all of the multiple generations (including the sanitizer), replacing my brush when it was time to get a new one (i.e. when they started to smell!).  </li>
            <li>I guess I have slightly better control of where my brushing effort is centered, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any serious improvements in my gums or teeth.  </li>
            <li>They are  smaller, flatter, and denser than the old brush heads and the bristle colors will fade when it&#x27;s time for a new head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one just feels a bit awkward in my mouth, and it seems to be wearing out more quickly.  </li>
            <li>I also use the gum care mode on my electric toothbrush, so to say these new standard diamondclean brush heads whiten your teeth in one week, and improve your gums in two weeks</li>
            <li>The first one I used (smaller size) only lasted two months - not three - but there may be a difference with the standard size.</li>
            <li>In my humble opinion, this Diamondclean \\&quot;improvement\\&quot; is likely a vertical-marketing technique to justify charging more for the replacement brushheads, lining Philips&#x27; deep pockets even further.  </li>
            <li>Also note that Sonicare do make a compact brushhead, which is easier to use for smaller mouths, particularly at the back of the mouth.  </li>
            <li>The remaining issue is how long will they last and how much do they cost.</li>
            <li>I got my Sonicare brush last year from Sams Club and was surprised by how well it worked (an improvement to the Sonicare brush</li>
            <li>They also look a bit sleeker compared to the old style and feel \\&quot;larger\\&quot; in the mouth, although they are not actually physically larger.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While these brush heads did their job, I didn&#x27;t see any actual difference between them and the old ones, so I would recommend whichever is cheapest.  </li>
            <li>would definitely puchase these new brush heads, if they came in a multipack, like their standard brush heads do.  </li>
            <li>When you compare it to their other heads, not so much.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve got no complaints at all, other than if you really give up flossing while using these heads</li>
            <li>While I usually get 2-3 months of use out of standard Sonicare brush head, the Diamond Clean seemed to break down much faster and required replacing in just one month.</li>
            <li>One other positive thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that when I use a new brush, my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel sore like it has when I&#x27;ve replaced my previous brand of toothbrush.</li>
            <li>While they seemed a little stiffer at first than the regular FlexCare replacement heads, now the Diamondclean brush head is really no different to me.  </li>
            <li>we haven&#x27;t tried other heads with our new brush.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These replacement heads fit with a snap on the FlexCare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The brush is MUCH better than the Pro Results, it has more bristles and is much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> latest product in their family promises whiter teeth, better gums and overall better dental health.</li>
            <li> originally had the Pro Results brushes since I didn&#x27;t have the DiamondClean handle, but I decided to try these brush heads since they&#x27;re compatiable with the handle that I have.</li>
            <li> I saw that I received the original heads</li>
            <li> Teeth feel dentist clean after a brush</li>
            <li> They feel as clean as they do after going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel remarkably clean.</li>
            <li> They clean your teeth,</li>
            <li> So, if the price is right, these are fine.  </li>
            <li> do think your smile is one of those things that most people notice first.</li>
            <li> These seem to be more gentle.</li>
            <li> I love the SoniCare Electric toothbrush very well</li>
            <li> and theyre good deep cleaning bristles</li>
            <li> The Diamondclean version seems to be more marketing than actually being better for your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Of course you have to expect advice and the wear indicators to signal a fairly quick replacement time.</li>
            <li> These are the best (and most expensive) of the sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These new diamondclean brush heads seem kind of ambitious to me.  </li>
            <li> Kids say the like the feel of it better comparing to more flat brushes we used before.</li>
            <li> I have used other toothbrushes but this by far is the best I have ever used</li>
            <li> exception comes in, however, in that the motor tends to never keep a charge for as long as the company claims; the brushes are good for about 1 month versus the recommended 3 months.  </li>
            <li> They feel like my teeth are very clean after using - I will stick with these until Sonicare comes up with something new for me to try!</li>
            <li> getting in-between teeth, but Sonicare makes top quality products, so I trust that their new design is an improvement.</li>
            <li> Phillips is a huge multi-national corporation and usually makes great products.  </li>
            <li> Work as expected and at a great price, love the sonicare however so expensive, so amazon is a great resource for getting these</li>
            <li> I even think it&#x27;s better than the old Oral-B electric toothbrush I was using for 20 years.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I honestly don&#x27;t see the difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly I don&#x27;t wait to see if the bristles fade, I just change it out to a new brush head when I feel it needs to be replaced, which might be in three months, maybe in alittle less time, but I would replace your brush head in a maximum of three months, just to make sure that your brush head is doing a good job of cleaning your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These brushes do clean even better than their regular brushes.  </li>
            <li> They fit my old Flexwhite handle, which means I didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new brush, so that&#x27;s nice for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;m on my fifth or sixth one right now.</li>
            <li> Surely the vast research resources of Philips worked to get this right</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, I think Sonicare units, overall, do a FAR superior job than a manual toothbrush, even with daily flossing, but you&#x27;re clearly better off with belt and suspenders ...</li>
            <li> These are the latest design, so new that they didn&#x27;t come with the new HealthyWhite Sonicare</li>
            <li> All are pretty heft</li>
            <li> This time, I&#x27;m using the standard size head, and I think I like it better.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure they help to keep my teeth from getting any dingier, which is saying something, because I like my coffee and my red wine.</li>
            <li> after the first brush.  </li>
            <li> There have been studies shown that the sonic style brush does a much better cleaning job than regular brushes.</li>
            <li> My gums were sore for the first week.</li>
            <li> Just to re-iterate, though, I&#x27;m completely thrilled with the Sonicare brush itself, and would not hesitate to recommend it over any other electric or manual brush.</li>
            <li> If you are not using a sonicare toothbrush than you are behind the times my good buddy!</li>
            <li> It pretty much sounds like marketing gobbledygook to me.</li>
            <li> Certainly would benefit the consumer... but not the seller.</li>
            <li> You will experience greater cleanliness through this revolutionary toothbrush that combines new whiting technology and save money by ordering this through Amazon (only $23 vs. $29 in Bed Bath and Beyond).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sounds gross and it is, but bristles that are too rough will tend to more easily cause blood.</li>
            <li> These new-model brush replacements head fit every current Sonicare unit and work very well.</li>
            <li> DiamondClean standard brush heads do fit DiamondClean, Flexcare+,</li>
            <li> I will give them that much.  </li>
            <li> However, I think it ought to be a crime to charge this much money for 2 replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned about this, but it ended up not irritating my gums at all, so I kept using them.  </li>
            <li> a toothbrush is how much blood I get from brushing.</li>
            <li> I was probably expecting too much from these replacement heads, since they did not overwhelm me.  </li>
            <li> If you own a SoniCare toothbrush for which these are intended, then you have few choices of where to buy them.</li>
            <li> They fit the base of the toothbrush I have perfectly</li>
            <li> I can tell you that after I brush, it feels like my teeth have been sandblasted, and I mean that in a good way.</li>
            <li> AFTER THREE WEEKS OF USE: After using one of these brushes for about three weeks I wanted to update the review above to note that these brushes, which at first felt like they did a better job (cleaner) than regular Sonicare heads, seemed to wear out much, much faster.</li>
            <li> So, what is the benefit of this particularly brush head?  </li>
            <li> I definitely did notice a big difference when using it versus a manual toothbrush, which I had used for most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used several different types of the brush heads with my Sonicare FlexCare, and I really love the way these feel.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for two reasons.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have to asume that they came un-used an clean, but they were in a ziplock plastic which was strange.</li>
            <li> This brush head is exactly the same size AND shape as a regular Sonicare brushhead (note this one fits the newer Sonicare models - which is most models sold in the last 5 years).  </li>
            <li> My most recent check on Amazon.com has these brush heads going for nearly twice the cost of the regular.  </li>
            <li> only quibble is that I&#x27;m not convinced they do a better job than any brand new Soniccare replacement head does in its first few uses.</li>
            <li> guess it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to buy these new brush heads and see if you do notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was maybe because I was paying closer attention to the new brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of these new Diamondclean bush heads for about a month now.  </li>
            <li> You can see and feel the difference in the way this new toothbrush cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special enough to stop me from buying my regular compact brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using them a while and see how they wear, over time brushes can actually get more stringent as they wear down, others have noted it here too.</li>
            <li> The diamond shape is better because the tip gets into tight spots around gums while the wide middle catches the full length of each tooth on each pass.</li>
            <li> Clearly, Philips is of the mindset that if a consumer is willing to pay big bucks for a toothbrush, then paying way too much for replacement heads will not be given a second thought.  </li>
            <li> If you are currently using the Pro Results, this is certainly a step up.</li>
            <li> In general I highly recommend a Sonicare brush however.</li>
            <li> Also that it removes 100% more plaque in hard to reach places than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first that I would actually be able to sell any difference in these and the older brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for nearly 3 years now</li>
            <li> Why even bother with the old ones after all this.  </li>
            <li> They actually feel better and the results are something you can see within a few days.  </li>
            <li> The product is already so good that it&#x27;s really hard to tell the slight difference, if any, these new design heads make.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through all of the multiple generations (including the sanitizer), replacing my brush when it was time to get a new one (i.e. when they started to smell!).  </li>
            <li> I guess I have slightly better control of where my brushing effort is centered, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any serious improvements in my gums or teeth.  </li>
            <li> They are  smaller, flatter, and denser than the old brush heads and the bristle colors will fade when it&#x27;s time for a new head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one just feels a bit awkward in my mouth, and it seems to be wearing out more quickly.  </li>
            <li> I also use the gum care mode on my electric toothbrush, so to say these new standard diamondclean brush heads whiten your teeth in one week, and improve your gums in two weeks</li>
            <li> The first one I used (smaller size) only lasted two months - not three - but there may be a difference with the standard size.</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion, this Diamondclean \\&quot;improvement\\&quot; is likely a vertical-marketing technique to justify charging more for the replacement brushheads, lining Philips&#x27; deep pockets even further.  </li>
            <li> Also note that Sonicare do make a compact brushhead, which is easier to use for smaller mouths, particularly at the back of the mouth.  </li>
            <li> The remaining issue is how long will they last and how much do they cost.</li>
            <li> I got my Sonicare brush last year from Sams Club and was surprised by how well it worked (an improvement to the Sonicare brush</li>
            <li> They also look a bit sleeker compared to the old style and feel \\&quot;larger\\&quot; in the mouth, although they are not actually physically larger.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While these brush heads did their job, I didn&#x27;t see any actual difference between them and the old ones, so I would recommend whichever is cheapest.  </li>
            <li> would definitely puchase these new brush heads, if they came in a multipack, like their standard brush heads do.  </li>
            <li> When you compare it to their other heads, not so much.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve got no complaints at all, other than if you really give up flossing while using these heads</li>
            <li> While I usually get 2-3 months of use out of standard Sonicare brush head, the Diamond Clean seemed to break down much faster and required replacing in just one month.</li>
            <li> One other positive thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that when I use a new brush, my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel sore like it has when I&#x27;ve replaced my previous brand of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> While they seemed a little stiffer at first than the regular FlexCare replacement heads, now the Diamondclean brush head is really no different to me.  </li>
            <li> we haven&#x27;t tried other heads with our new brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that the bristles on these Diamondclean toothbrush heads don&#x27;t break down like the others do, so I&#x27;m not suddenly using a stiffer, harsher toothbrush head when I insert a new one.  </li>
            <li> For me, they don&#x27;t seem to last all that long</li>
            <li> I did not observe dramatic improvement in terms of how clean my teeth feel after the brush though</li>
            <li> In fact, I recently stopped using my Diamondclean toothbrush and started using a much cheaper Oral B electric toothbrush, as I found that it works acceptably well, and I could buy replacement heads in a warehouse club for around $6 per head--about half the price of the Philips Diamondclean heads, which are not available in the warehouse clubs.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m an adult male, I still usually use the compact brushhead.    </li>
            <li> Though I assume it won&#x27;t be long before those heads are phased out and these become the standard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, they seem to be an improvement over the standard brushes that came with my unit but only slightly.</li>
            <li> diamondclean brush heads are green in the middle, with blue on each side of the brush head, surrounded by white, while the regular brush heads are green with blue on each side of the brush head, which tells you when to replace the brush head when the bristles fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re a regular Crest Strip (or other brand) user, you&#x27;re not going to throw those away in favor of these brush</li>
            <li> I have been using this head for a few weeks now, and I will go back to purchasing the prior version of the heads.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are unduly expensive, and I certainly hope the price will come down in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it&#x27;s even a little harder to get to the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> This brush appears to have firmer bristles in a green diamond in the middle of the brush.  </li>
            <li> I recently started using the Philips Sonicare Diamondclean toothbrush, and a sample toothbrush head came with it, so I have already been using one of these for a few months now.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush not much to say.  </li>
            <li> bought two in 2012, for health reasons, and we are totally not happy, mainly because I have replaced the July purchase, twice, and the December purchase once.</li>
            <li> The color-changing \\&quot;change indicating\\&quot; bristles can go about and extra 2-3 weeks past losing color before the bristles start to flay out.</li>
            <li> have always felt that Sonicare is one step ahead of other companies that manufacture electric</li>
            <li> Dissapointed that the colored ID rings used and supplied with other Sonicare heads are absent with the DiamondClean Models</li>
            <li> why don&#x27;t they just make it all one size, probably the AAA and eliminate the other.</li>
            <li> Just wish it had a way to distinguish one head from the other, like the ones that come with a colored ring.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that I could ever go back.</li>
            <li> Aren&#x27;t irritating, yet stiff enough to actually do something.</li>
            <li> Oral-B did the same thing every now and again, coming out with a brush with bristles of different bendability, or weird pieces of plastic that scrape tartar off your teeth, etc, etc.  </li>
            <li> The original brushes have a curious little plastic spacer/gasket that clips onto the base, but these eliminate that.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review in a little while to comment on longevity and if I see any differences in a month or so.    </li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that this felt a little stiffer upon brushing.  </li>
            <li> I had trouble finding these replacement brushes in the store</li>
            <li> These are very expensive but the difference between the level below is very apparent.</li>
            <li> I just want to say that I had actually ordered the compact head brushes, so I was a little disappointed</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Let me start by saying I love my Sonicare toothbrush.  I used Oral-B/Braun electric toothbrushes for 15 years prior to this and the Sonicare is quieter, has a better battery life, cleans my teeth better, is lighter, and just works better.    This brush head is exactly the same size AND shape as a regular Sonicare brushhead (note this one fits the newer Sonicare models - which is most models sold in the last 5 years).  Also note that Sonicare do make a compact brushhead, which is easier to use for smaller mouths, particularly at the back of the mouth.  Even though I&#x27;m an adult male, I still usually use the compact brushhead.    So, what is the benefit of this particularly brush head?  I don&#x27;t know.  Oral-B did the same thing every now and again, coming out with a brush with bristles of different bendability, or weird pieces of plastic that scrape tartar off your teeth, etc, etc.  This brush appears to have firmer bristles in a green diamond in the middle of the brush.  It doesn&#x27;t feel that different from a regular brush head.  I guess I have slightly better control of where my brushing effort is centered, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any serious improvements in my gums or teeth.  I&#x27;ll update this review in a little while to comment on longevity and if I see any differences in a month or so.    I have noticed that it&#x27;s even a little harder to get to the back of my mouth.  So, if the price is right, these are fine.  I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special enough to stop me from buying my regular compact brush heads.  Just to re-iterate, though, I&#x27;m completely thrilled with the Sonicare brush itself, and would not hesitate to recommend it over any other electric or manual brush.</li>
            <li> Sonicare makes a lot of claims regarding the Diamondclean Standard Brush Heads, that they will whiten teeth in just one week. Also that it removes 100% more plaque in hard to reach places than a manual toothbrush. OK, whatever. It pretty much sounds like marketing gobbledygook to me. Basically, these are replacement heads for your sonic care. Yes, they seem to be an improvement over the standard brushes that came with my unit but only slightly. The contour of the brush seems about the same. Comparing it to a manual brush, of course it&#x27;s much better. When you compare it to their other heads, not so much. I would recommend these if you need a replacement, nothing more.</li>
            <li> This brush does a better job getting all the foods out that tend to get into the folds inside molars tops. Kids say the like the feel of it better comparing to more flat brushes we used before. It is also easier on the gums.</li>
            <li> We are longtime Sonicare users and have found that their brush unit and replacement heads have continued to improve in the decade or so we&#x27;ve been fans. These new-model brush replacements head fit every current Sonicare unit and work very well. Teeth feel dentist clean after a brush and I&#x27;ve got no complaints at all, other than if you really give up flossing while using these heads, you&#x27;ll probably regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only quibble is that I&#x27;m not convinced they do a better job than any brand new Soniccare replacement head does in its first few uses. The product is already so good that it&#x27;s really hard to tell the slight difference, if any, these new design heads make. Whiter teeth? Better gums? No flossing required? All are pretty heft claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I think Sonicare units, overall, do a FAR superior job than a manual toothbrush, even with daily flossing, but you&#x27;re clearly better off with belt and suspenders ... You do still need to floss and if you&#x27;re a regular Crest Strip (or other brand) user, you&#x27;re not going to throw those away in favor of these brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my overall impression is, couldn&#x27;t hurt, but isn&#x27;t really necessarily a big step up from the standard brush heads either ... Though I assume it won&#x27;t be long before those heads are phased out and these become the standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE AFTER THREE WEEKS OF USE: After using one of these brushes for about three weeks I wanted to update the review above to note that these brushes, which at first felt like they did a better job (cleaner) than regular Sonicare heads, seemed to wear out much, much faster. While I usually get 2-3 months of use out of standard Sonicare brush head, the Diamond Clean seemed to break down much faster and required replacing in just one month. Given the cost this means I can&#x27;t recommend this style of brush head, though I&#x27;m still a big Sonicare fan.</li>
            <li> I have been using this head for a few weeks now, and I will go back to purchasing the prior version of the heads.  This one just feels a bit awkward in my mouth, and it seems to be wearing out more quickly.  The Diamondclean version seems to be more marketing than actually being better for your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for over a month now and love them. They do a good job cleaning and are easy on my teeth. I did not observe dramatic improvement in terms of how clean my teeth feel after the brush though (I was using the regular Flexcare brush heads).</li>
            <li> I got my Sonicare brush last year from Sams Club and was surprised by how well it worked (an improvement to the Sonicare brush I had around 2006.) Brush for a minute and your teeth get the plaque-free, sqeaky-clean feel. As for these brushes themselves, the diamondclean type are indeed better than the kind that come with the brush. The diamond shape is better because the tip gets into tight spots around gums while the wide middle catches the full length of each tooth on each pass. The color-changing \\&quot;change indicating\\&quot; bristles can go about and extra 2-3 weeks past losing color before the bristles start to flay out.</li>
            <li> Having been a Philips Sonicare user for several years, I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.  I definitely did notice a big difference when using it versus a manual toothbrush, which I had used for most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always buy the standard brush heads for my Sonicare electric toothbrush.  I had tried the compact brush heads, but they didn&#x27;t see to work as well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always felt that Sonicare is one step ahead of other companies that manufacture electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These new diamondclean brush heads seem kind of ambitious to me.  I already use whitening toothpaste, and have for years.  I also use the gum care mode on my electric toothbrush, so to say these new standard diamondclean brush heads whiten your teeth in one week, and improve your gums in two weeks, I wouldn&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the diamondclean brush heads, or if it&#x27;s because of already using whitening toothpaste, and using the gum care mode on my electric toothbrush .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to buy these new brush heads and see if you do notice a difference.  They are alittle pricey considering there is only two diamondslean brush heads, tho each brush head is supposed to last for 3 months, so with these two brush heads you would be set for 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely puchase these new brush heads, if they came in a multipack, like their standard brush heads do.  I always buy a minimum of four or more brush heads at a time, so Iam all set.  It&#x27;s one of those things I would never want to run out of. Your smile and your teeth are very important, and impact your life in more ways than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think your smile is one of those things that most people notice first. A good first impression doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these diamondclean brush heads over the standard and compact brush heads just for the added benefits which doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diamondclean brush heads are green in the middle, with blue on each side of the brush head, surrounded by white, while the regular brush heads are green with blue on each side of the brush head, which tells you when to replace the brush head when the bristles fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly I don&#x27;t wait to see if the bristles fade, I just change it out to a new brush head when I feel it needs to be replaced, which might be in three months, maybe in alittle less time, but I would replace your brush head in a maximum of three months, just to make sure that your brush head is doing a good job of cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DiamondClean standard brush heads do fit DiamondClean, Flexcare+, Flexcare, HealthyWhite and EasyClean model Sonicare electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare products are truly exceptional performers.  I will give them that much.  I love the Diamondclean toothbrush.  However, I think it ought to be a crime to charge this much money for 2 replacement heads.  Clearly, Philips is of the mindset that if a consumer is willing to pay big bucks for a toothbrush, then paying way too much for replacement heads will not be given a second thought.  Well, I for one have given it second thought.  In fact, I recently stopped using my Diamondclean toothbrush and started using a much cheaper Oral B electric toothbrush, as I found that it works acceptably well, and I could buy replacement heads in a warehouse club for around $6 per head--about half the price of the Philips Diamondclean heads, which are not available in the warehouse clubs.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for nearly 3 years now and I love them. I also welcome any new toothbrush product from Philips as they have mastered the dental science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This latest product in their family promises whiter teeth, better gums and overall better dental health. I highly recommend this product for two reasons. You will experience greater cleanliness through this revolutionary toothbrush that combines new whiting technology and save money by ordering this through Amazon (only $23 vs. $29 in Bed Bath and Beyond).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No brainer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for several years now.  Although the replacement heads are expensive, I do get better looking teeth out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These latest heads are the newest from Sonicare, and are supposed to clean/whiten better.  They also look a bit sleeker compared to the old style and feel \\&quot;larger\\&quot; in the mouth, although they are not actually physically larger.  They fit my old Flexwhite handle, which means I didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new brush, so that&#x27;s nice for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these brush heads did their job, I didn&#x27;t see any actual difference between them and the old ones, so I would recommend whichever is cheapest.  In general I highly recommend a Sonicare brush however.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the Philips Sonicare Diamondclean toothbrush, and a sample toothbrush head came with it, so I have already been using one of these for a few months now. I initially used the smaller size head, because I have a smallish mouth. This time, I&#x27;m using the standard size head, and I think I like it better. I guess it just seems more efficient, since you&#x27;re covering more territory. I also like the way the contour of the brush works in my mouth.   I cannot compare this toothbrush head to any others in the Philips line, because this model is all I have used. I can tell you that after I brush, it feels like my teeth have been sandblasted, and I mean that in a good way. They feel as clean as they do after going to the dentist. One other positive thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that when I use a new brush, my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel sore like it has when I&#x27;ve replaced my previous brand of toothbrush. I&#x27;m guessing that the bristles on these Diamondclean toothbrush heads don&#x27;t break down like the others do, so I&#x27;m not suddenly using a stiffer, harsher toothbrush head when I insert a new one.  Will these toothbrush heads make my teeth whiter? Probably not, but I&#x27;m sure they help to keep my teeth from getting any dingier, which is saying something, because I like my coffee and my red wine. Will I give up flossing because I&#x27;m using this toothbrush? Absolutely not. It&#x27;s not a substitute for flossing. Is this system significantly better than a manual toothbrush? Without a doubt. I even think it&#x27;s better than the old Oral-B electric toothbrush I was using for 20 years. It feels like the bristles are getting between my teeth better.  These toothbrush heads are unduly expensive, and I certainly hope the price will come down in the near future. The first one I used (smaller size) only lasted two months - not three - but there may be a difference with the standard size. And let&#x27;s face it, two months is still awfully good. And if this Sonicare system is going to keep my teeth cleaner and therefore prevent dental problems (which I assume it will), I&#x27;ll pay! My teeth feel remarkably clean.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit with a snap on the FlexCare toothbrush.  They are  smaller, flatter, and denser than the old brush heads and the bristle colors will fade when it&#x27;s time for a new head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss the feel of the longer bristles  getting in-between teeth, but Sonicare makes top quality products, so I trust that their new design is an improvement.</li>
            <li> Why did I get started on these brushes... I can&#x27;t go back to the cheaper brushes now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally had the Pro Results brushes since I didn&#x27;t have the DiamondClean handle, but I decided to try these brush heads since they&#x27;re compatiable with the handle that I have. The brush is MUCH better than the Pro Results, it has more bristles and is much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is obviously the cost, one suggestion would be to look at the price for a 6 pack of these brush heads, I recently purchased one of those for about $58.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first that I would actually be able to sell any difference in these and the older brush heads. I noticed immediately that this felt a little stiffer upon brushing.  I was a bit concerned about this, but it ended up not irritating my gums at all, so I kept using them.  After completing brushing, I also noticed that my mouth and teeth felt cleaner...yes...after the first brush.  I thought this was maybe because I was paying closer attention to the new brush heads.  That said, after continued use my teeth feel cleaner and my gums seem to be in great shape.  I will use these brush heads going forward.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> One way I can tell how good/bad a toothbrush is how much blood I get from brushing. Sounds gross and it is, but bristles that are too rough will tend to more easily cause blood. These seem to be more gentle. I&#x27;ll keep using them a while and see how they wear, over time brushes can actually get more stringent as they wear down, others have noted it here too.</li>
            <li> Fit is perfect, clean is perfect and price is right! So glad that I bought here!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This were cheaper than even the store brands in our area and I didn&#x27;t have to drive anywhere to have them.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleaning.  Good durability.  Dissapointed that the colored ID rings used and supplied with other Sonicare heads are absent with the DiamondClean Models</li>
            <li> If you own a SoniCare toothbrush for which these are intended, then you have few choices of where to buy them. For me, they don&#x27;t seem to last all that long but that&#x27;s just the way it goes. I love the SoniCare Electric toothbrush very well and I think I&#x27;m on my fifth or sixth one right now. These brush heads will last you 1-3 months depending on the pressure you apply in actual use.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Sonicare DiamondClean Brush Heads are a necessity. The Sonicare toothbrush is simply a lifesaver. I cannot exist without it. The replacement Brush Heads are paramount to keeping a clean and healthy mouth, gumbs and teeth.</li>
            <li> These brushes do clean even better than their regular brushes.  We have had 3 Sonicares over the years and are extremely pleased with thier products but these brushes are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Work as expected and at a great price, love the sonicare however so expensive, so amazon is a great resource for getting these</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I honestly don&#x27;t see the difference. It&#x27;s just the same brush with a different color and name.</li>
            <li> OEM replacement. Outside of the non-retail packaging, this is the same as you find in stores. Good value replacement.</li>
            <li> this a 2-pack of two brush heads for a total of 4 brush heads&lt;br /&gt;A Good deal.&lt;br /&gt;and they were OEM heads</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by saying that I have used Sonicare toothbrushes ever since the very first generation, probably more than 12-years ago.  I&#x27;ve gone through all of the multiple generations (including the sanitizer), replacing my brush when it was time to get a new one (i.e. when they started to smell!).  I was probably expecting too much from these replacement heads, since they did not overwhelm me.  I&#x27;ve been using one of these new Diamondclean bush heads for about a month now.  While they seemed a little stiffer at first than the regular FlexCare replacement heads, now the Diamondclean brush head is really no different to me.  My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel any cleaner than with the regular Flexcare brush heads.  It makes sense to me that the diamond-shaped bristles would clean better, but my experience doesn&#x27;t justify any additional expense for these brush heads.  My most recent check on Amazon.com has these brush heads going for nearly twice the cost of the regular.  In my humble opinion, this Diamondclean \\&quot;improvement\\&quot; is likely a vertical-marketing technique to justify charging more for the replacement brushheads, lining Philips&#x27; deep pockets even further.  Philips revolutionized brushing teeth with the original toothbrush, but in my opinion, while these Diamondclean heads are good, they aren&#x27;t revolutionary like the original Sonicare was.  I would not spend the money on these in the future, just like I wouldn&#x27;t buy their \\&quot;sanitizer\\&quot; again either.</li>
            <li> This brush head is very good. It does clean exceptionally well and rinses out nicely. The reason for 4 stars is that sonicare is designing specific brush heads for specific bases.... which I think is a rip off. It reminds me of the AA and AAA size batteries for various household items... is that really necessary? They&#x27;re so close in size why don&#x27;t they just make it all one size, probably the AAA and eliminate the other. Certainly would benefit the consumer... but not the seller. This type of marketing I feel is just for the company to make money. However, that said, the product is a good one and well worth the buy. There have been studies shown that the sonic style brush does a much better cleaning job than regular brushes. I do recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I just want to say that I had actually ordered the compact head brushes, so I was a little disappointed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when I saw that I received the original heads but I decided to keep them rather than to wait for another&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shipment.</li>
            <li> They clean your teeth, what more do you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess lower price would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also don&#x27;t go by the blue indicator thing, seems to give the impression to replace them sooner vs actual age they are.</li>
            <li> These are the latest design, so new that they didn&#x27;t come with the new HealthyWhite Sonicare I also just bought. Off with that brush and on went one of these. Why even bother with the old ones after all this.  The original brushes have a curious little plastic spacer/gasket that clips onto the base, but these eliminate that.   It seems these brushes are good and get to where they need to be. Aren&#x27;t irritating, yet stiff enough to actually do something. Surely the vast research resources of Philips worked to get this right and it seems they did.  The remaining issue is how long will they last and how much do they cost. Of course you have to expect advice and the wear indicators to signal a fairly quick replacement time. This will depend on how vigorously and often you use them. In any case, they are a bit pricey and so I took off a star for that.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrush heads. They fit the base of the toothbrush I have perfectly and theyre good deep cleaning bristles</li>
            <li> It works great. It&#x27;s a toothbrush not much to say.  I had trouble finding these replacement brushes in the store</li>
            <li> sonicare diamondclean brushheads are always good since the toothbruishes are the best on the market. If you are not using a sonicare toothbrush than you are behind the times my good buddy!</li>
            <li> Wish this came with the colored rings so  that you can delegate 1 brush per person.  The brush heads are great though.</li>
            <li> I have to asume that they came un-used an clean, but they were in a ziplock plastic which was strange.</li>
            <li> Phillips is a huge multi-national corporation and usually makes great products.  This toothbrush is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exception comes in, however, in that the motor tends to never keep a charge for as long as the company claims; the brushes are good for about 1 month versus the recommended 3 months.  The charge lasts from 4 to 7 days, and once in awhile, 10 days, not 2 to 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two in 2012, for health reasons, and we are totally not happy, mainly because I have replaced the July purchase, twice, and the December purchase once. We both agree the results, when they work, are appreciated and wonderful.  The price and shakey customer service are not justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several dental professionals swear they have had them for years.  I think maybe not the DiamondClean.</li>
            <li> After using this toothbrush for about a year now, my dentist has told me that my gums look really good and to keep up the good work. The pockets between my teeth are getting better and my gums are not bleeding anymore. I have used other toothbrushes but this by far is the best I have ever used and my gums are a testimony to that![[ASIN:B0052JN7XG Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> These Phillips Sonicare DiamondClean Brush Heads are the best that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have had several different electric brushes and also used several different brushes with the Sonicare system.  You can see and feel the difference in the way this new toothbrush cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li> These work great, tho we haven&#x27;t tried other heads with our new brush. Just wish it had a way to distinguish one head from the other, like the ones that come with a colored ring.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush. My gums were sore for the first week. Now I can&#x27;t imagine using a regular toothbrush. It&#x27;s been a great investment for my gums and teeth!</li>
            <li> These are very expensive but the difference between the level below is very apparent. My teeth feel very clean.  I am not sure that I could ever go back.</li>
            <li> best brush heads great price</li>
            <li> These are the best (and most expensive) of the sonicare brushes.  They actually feel better and the results are something you can see within a few days.  Once you try these, you will not go back to the standard sonicare refills.</li>
            <li> These are definitely the best brush heads that are currently available. If you are currently using the Pro Results, this is certainly a step up. The Diamond Clean are much more smoother on your gums and your teeth feel more clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> I have used several different types of the brush heads with my Sonicare FlexCare, and I really love the way these feel.  They feel like my teeth are very clean after using - I will stick with these until Sonicare comes up with something new for me to try!</li>
