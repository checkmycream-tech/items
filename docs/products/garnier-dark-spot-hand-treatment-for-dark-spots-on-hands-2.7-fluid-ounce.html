    <ol>
            <li>Great if you use it all the time!</li>
            <li>This hand cream is perfect and not greasy.</li>
            <li>It smells very pleasant, too.  </li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has a very strong scent!  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good&#x27;, or &#x27;smells</li>
            <li>/feels nice&#x27;, etc.</li>
            <li>I already have a hand cream with SPF that smells nice.</li>
            <li>I do like this lotion because it moisturizes and smooths my hands nicely</li>
            <li>Also the fragrance is nice &amp; not offensive in any way</li>
            <li>Feels good and love the SPF</li>
            <li>The smell is nice.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I actually love the smell.</li>
            <li>Kind of light &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; but feminine smelling.  </li>
            <li>an unscented version would also be lovely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been enjoying using this product.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something with SPF 15 that I could carry in my purse and put on right before I get my gel manicure, since the UV light can cause age spots.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product, as far as the extent to which it soothes and smooths.  </li>
            <li>Did not see any improvement in skin tone and my sun spots are still right there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Garnier products and have liked them as well.</li>
            <li>9/05/2013 Have bought this elsewhere for the actual (much lower) retail price &amp; have been using it maybe 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Also, it is clearly marked as a sunscreen, which I didn&#x27;t notice before buying--</li>
            <li>and I have spent alot more for less results.  </li>
            <li>This really does work, I was skeptical because used so many before.  </li>
            <li>They are no longer raised &amp; I also had dark spots like a large freckle on both of my forearms which are now completely gone.  </li>
            <li>However, the cream contains a broad spectrum SPF 30, which may prevent those dark spots in the first place.</li>
            <li>Things I love so far is that it has SPF 30 for daytime use and that it is thinner &amp; sinks in &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel thick or sticky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d keep using this just for the non thick, non sticky sun protection it gives me during the day as most higher SPF feel gross &amp; thick to me</li>
            <li>I am very impress with Garnier Dark spot treatment cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle of Garnier Dark Spot Hand Treatment and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in the appearance of my hands.  </li>

            <li> Keeping this review low because of unbelievable cost from this particular seller, but would currently give this lotion a 3 star review at the correct pricing, would give it 3.5 to 4 if the did an unscented version &amp; a nighttime version (prefer no SPF for evening) &amp; I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if I found out it lightened my age spots.</li>
            <li> I guess if you are really looking for something to lighten the dark spots on your hands, this will not do it, but I like the feel of it, and it protects my hands from the sun without being all goopy and messy.  </li>
            <li> (check reviews on other sites), but the retail cost for this product is about $7-8, so this company selling I for double</li>
            <li> Love this product, mad</li>
            <li> but it clashes with or covers over other scents I wear during the day, so</li>
            <li> I got this because I want to fade the dark spots on my hands.</li>
            <li> Dark spots on my lets seem lighter to me.</li>
            <li> It started working on the dark spots; in 3 weeks there was a noticable reduction in color.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight moisture and helps with dark spots on hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably keep using it for that reason, and hope that previous sun damage to my hands will improve over time.</li>
            <li> Because the directions say it takes two weeks to see any noticeable improvement in dark spots, I am not able to judge this at this point in time,</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove dark spots!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product has 4 stars?</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic improvement with a couple dark spots on my hand from scraping my hands on a hike.</li>
            <li> Having a hard time finding this product in the drug store.  </li>
            <li> The very bad dark spots are nearly gone and they were raised on one of my hands.  </li>
            <li> seems ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>

            <li> Great if you use it all the time!</li>
            <li> Did not see any improvement in skin tone and my sun spots are still right there.  I&#x27;m not sure why this product has 4 stars? This had my hopes up. When I actually read these reviews, they basically say things like &#x27;didn&#x27;t see any change but it has SPF so that&#x27;s good&#x27;, or &#x27;smells/feels nice&#x27;, etc. I got this because I want to fade the dark spots on my hands. I already have a hand cream with SPF that smells nice.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a spot remover not a sunscreen. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 1 1/2 years and I love it.  The very bad dark spots are nearly gone and they were raised on one of my hands.  They are no longer raised &amp; I also had dark spots like a large freckle on both of my forearms which are now completely gone.  Having a hard time finding this product in the drug store.  I bought it when I last saw it.  I like the smell and the tube lasts for quite a while.  I put it on every morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 4 weeks. I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic improvement with a couple dark spots on my hand from scraping my hands on a hike. They&#x27;re still there.  I do like this lotion because it moisturizes and smooths my hands nicely and I actually love the smell. Kind of light &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; but feminine smelling.  I will continue to use it but keep looking for something to fade these marks on my hands.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product, as far as the extent to which it soothes and smooths.  It smells very pleasant, too.  Because the directions say it takes two weeks to see any noticeable improvement in dark spots, I am not able to judge this at this point in time,</li>
            <li> I am hoping it works - too soon to tell yet.  Dark spots on my lets seem lighter to me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this &amp; haven&#x27;t tried it yet (check reviews on other sites), but the retail cost for this product is about $7-8, so this company selling I for double seems ridiculous. I am planning on trying this product out though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;updated 9/05/2013 Have bought this elsewhere for the actual (much lower) retail price &amp; have been using it maybe 2 weeks. Things I love so far is that it has SPF 30 for daytime use and that it is thinner &amp; sinks in &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel thick or sticky. Can&#x27;t tell yet if it&#x27;s helping my &#x27;age&#x27; spots, I think I need to use it longer. I am supposed to use it twice a day per instructions but never put it on later because I forget but I also don&#x27;t think about putting sunscreen on after I&#x27;ve already come home for the day. I wish Garnier would make a nighttime version without SPF &amp; then I would leave it on my headboard &amp; remember to put it on every night as well. Also the fragrance is nice &amp; not offensive in any way but it clashes with or covers over other scents I wear during the day, so an unscented version would also be lovely. I&#x27;d keep using this just for the non thick, non sticky sun protection it gives me during the day as most higher SPF feel gross &amp; thick to me &amp; this one does not. Keeping this review low because of unbelievable cost from this particular seller, but would currently give this lotion a 3 star review at the correct pricing, would give it 3.5 to 4 if the did an unscented version &amp; a nighttime version (prefer no SPF for evening) &amp; I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if I found out it lightened my age spots. Will update if it does.</li>
            <li> This really does work, I was skeptical because used so many before.  Great price and I have spent alot more for less results.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying using this product.  I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the softness of my hands.  I&#x27;ve used other Garnier products and have liked them as well.</li>
            <li> I guess if you are really looking for something to lighten the dark spots on your hands, this will not do it, but I like the feel of it, and it protects my hands from the sun without being all goopy and messy.  After running out of the tube I bought at a local store, I specifically sought it out on Amazon because I could not find it again.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a very strong scent!  It started to give me a headache after wearing it for about 30 min. Also, it is clearly marked as a sunscreen, which I didn&#x27;t notice before buying--if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It started working on the dark spots; in 3 weeks there was a noticable reduction in color.  I will keep using this.</li>
            <li> Feels good and love the SPF</li>
            <li> Love this product, mad it&#x27;s discontinued. Lightweight moisture and helps with dark spots on hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of Garnier Dark Spot Hand Treatment and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in the appearance of my hands.  However, the cream contains a broad spectrum SPF 30, which may prevent those dark spots in the first place. I&#x27;ll probably keep using it for that reason, and hope that previous sun damage to my hands will improve over time.</li>
            <li> I wanted something with SPF 15 that I could carry in my purse and put on right before I get my gel manicure, since the UV light can cause age spots.  This hand cream is perfect and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I am very impress with Garnier Dark spot treatment cream.  I will continue to purchased it.  Betsy Doty</li>
            <li> I think this has lessened some of my age spots, but I still have some. I keep this in my car and put it on daily. The smell is nice.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove dark spots!!</li>
