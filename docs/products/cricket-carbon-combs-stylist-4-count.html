            <li>Very strong and durable combs for any stylist to use.</li>
            <li>Been using these combs for a few months now and they are great, durable and of excellent quality.</li>
            <li>So easy to part any kind of hair/ sections</li>
            <li>addition, they do not cause static and they are very light.</li>
            <li>:) I would recommend buying them</li>
            <li>I love this set of combs.</li>
            <li>and I love the feel of them.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I thought that red Krest ones are the best until I tried this set.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone looking for heat resistant, static resistant combs.  </li>
            <li>Love love love them.</li>
            <li>Works really well, great for making super-neat parts.</li>
            <li>This 4 peice set was a great way to direct and set my hair do.</li>
            <li>Got these for home haircuts, soooo much better than cheap combs...</li>
            <li>The product feels a bit cheap, but for the price so far so good.</li>
            <li>Excellent if you want no static on your hair.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m unsure if they comb my hair any better than a $1 comb from the dollar store ;)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get a full 5 stars because on some combs, the molding that combines both sides into one shape is not flush and therefore has a raised ridge of material along the interior spine.  </li>
            <li>Will order more very soon.</li>
            <li>nice comb set ,  but comparable to most other sets.</li>
            <li>Have fun.</li>
            <li>I have been doing hair for 17 years and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I bought these combs because I tend to have a lot of static in my hair recently.  </li>
            <li>They are very high quality and give me a easy quick side part even though I am a total rookie.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth teeth and grooves, no rough plastic edges to snag hair.</li>
            <li>:) I actually bought them based on other reviews - I haven&#x27;t noticed significant decrease of static or anything, but I do like having all of the different tooth sizes on hand.</li>
            <li>Very high quality combs.  </li>
            <li>I really like these combs.</li>
            <li>They seem very well made.</li>
            <li>And with four combs, you&#x27;re really getting a bargain</li>
            <li>they are very durable combs</li>
            <li>Very resistent material</li>
            <li>Otherwise, these combs are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Compared to the other combs that I have in the house, mostly from the Dollar Store, these are very well made.</li>
            <li>My first professional stylist comb.</li>
            <li>The one comb that I have left out of the four is still great, the only reason I don&#x27;t have the other 3 is because I lost them.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t settle for less and see no reason to pay more.</li>
            <li>looks perfect with no effort even on the most horrible mannequins.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Not only do these eliminate that problem, I recently used one of them while applying color to my hair, and I was able to part and comb my dye saturated hair, whereas my old plastic comb would just cause tangles.</li>
            <li>They are much higher quality than the standard plastic combs you find almost anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought a new hairdryer that suggested using a carbon comb to finish styling.</li>
            <li>New for me to require a comb to prepare my hair daily.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t melt when used with heat, they&#x27;re heavy duty awesome for detangling, cutting, sectioning,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally a brush user</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and it is colored.</li>

            <li> I have fine, thin hair and it is colored.</li>
            <li> I love these combs, not only for me, but when I cut my moms hair, the static from the cold made it difficult to cut my moms hair with just regular combs.</li>
            <li> Works well with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use these to cut my hair to, mines easier then my moms, mines a blunt cut on long hair, her&#x27;s is very very short.</li>

            <li> do wish amazon stocked and sold the individual combs, I have no use for the strange one with the small head/skinny handle (technical term)</li>
            <li> always use a comb on my hair when it is wet, but didn&#x27;t realize that my combs were tearing my hair.</li>
            <li> so I bought some other combs</li>
            <li> but I like the other 3</li>
            <li> They slight though hair without pulling.</li>
            <li> The four pack is alot less expensive than buying the combs individually.  </li>
            <li> but they have served me well these past few months.</li>
            <li> but they were too small.  </li>
            <li> No more drugstore combs for</li>
            <li> No static.</li>
            <li> so I went with them and they haven&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I like this set. I use different combs to cut my childrens / husbands hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this article.</li>
            <li> they came fast shipping they work real good</li>
            <li> I love this set of combs. They seem very well made.</li>
            <li> Purchased these as a gift for my stylist daughter. They are perfect for her needs.</li>
            <li> Carbon Combs are wonderful.  You never get that fly away, electrified hair that makes us look like Albert Einstein (one of my heros).  The four pack is alot less expensive than buying the combs individually.  I will never buy a plastic comb again.</li>
            <li> Great quality and price.</li>
            <li> nice comb set ,  but comparable to most other sets.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a new hairdryer that suggested using a carbon comb to finish styling. I found these and am very happy with them. Compared to the other combs that I have in the house, mostly from the Dollar Store, these are very well made.</li>
            <li> I love Cricket products already, and these combs are awesome. They don&#x27;t melt when used with heat, they&#x27;re heavy duty awesome for detangling, cutting, sectioning,</li>
            <li> I have bought cheaper combs sets, which broke on my daughters clients hair, but these have not. She loves them.</li>
            <li> Very nice combs. Excellent if you want no static on your hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize switching to carbon would make such a difference</li>
            <li> These combs are awesome! They are light weight, and are great as you do cuts</li>
            <li> New for me to require a comb to prepare my hair daily. This 4 peice set was a great way to direct and set my hair do. Works great with the Imperial Hair product. The product feels a bit cheap, but for the price so far so good.</li>
            <li> too bulky but it does its jobs</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have loved these combs more! My stylist friend left the rat tail comb at my house for a few months and wanted it back. I mourned its loss but ordered this set. These combs keep my wavy hair from looking like a bird&#x27;s nest. I am static free and happy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,fast delivery</li>
            <li> Enjoying my order and happy about it. Can&#x27;t wait to add to the collection. Get a set for yourself. Have fun.</li>
            <li> Excellent i just love these combs perfect part every time highly recommend&lt;br /&gt; you are as good as your tools ...yes theses are great combs</li>
            <li> Very high quality combs.  These were just used on me and I love the feel of them.  They are much higher quality than the standard plastic combs you find almost anywhere else.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a guy who recently decided to start styling my hair.  I needed supplies so I bought some other combs but they were too small.  After doing some research and browsing Amazon for a while I settled on these and I am glad I did.  They are very high quality and give me a easy quick side part even though I am a total rookie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish amazon stocked and sold the individual combs, I have no use for the strange one with the small head/skinny handle (technical term) so I gave it to my GF but I like the other 3 so I kept those for myself.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re combs! :) I actually bought them based on other reviews - I haven&#x27;t noticed significant decrease of static or anything, but I do like having all of the different tooth sizes on hand. I&#x27;m generally a brush user but I now use these daily. They seem very good quality but I&#x27;m unsure if they comb my hair any better than a $1 comb from the dollar store ;)</li>

Not only do these eliminate that problem, I recently used one of them while applying color to my hair, and I was able to part and comb my dye saturated hair, whereas my old plastic comb would just cause tangles.

            <li> excellent product as I was so happy to use them they are very durable combs</li>
            <li> Got these for home haircuts, soooo much better than cheap combs... nice on the scalp. She likes them too because they are more sturdy and are great for Toddler&#x27;s hair too without causing a fuss.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetology student and I tried before lots of combs. I thought that red Krest ones are the best until I tried this set. So easy to part any kind of hair/ sections looks perfect with no effort even on the most horrible mannequins. On real people is just a pleasure to use them: no pulling hair and perfect sections. LOVE THEM! Thank you Cricket!</li>
            <li> I have been doing hair for 17 years and these are by far my favorite. I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Very resistent material</li>
            <li> Been using these combs for a few months now and they are great, durable and of excellent quality. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> These are quality combs.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for heat resistant, static resistant combs.  They are flexible, yet very strong.  I think they are going to last a very long time and if they do not, I will do an update.  UPDATE: 03/16/15  The one comb that I have left out of the four is still great, the only reason I don&#x27;t have the other 3 is because I lost them.  These are great combs, as I have ordered another set!!  BUY Them!</li>
            <li> I ordered these on the recommendation of my hair stylist. I have fine, thin hair and it is colored. I seem to get breakage even though I use good products.&lt;br /&gt;I always use a comb on my hair when it is wet, but didn&#x27;t realize that my combs were tearing my hair. These just glide through tangles and knots.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, they do not cause static and they are very light. I just ordered another package for travel and my purse. No more drugstore combs for me.&lt;br /&gt;Buy them!</li>
            <li> Feels solid. Smooth teeth and grooves, no rough plastic edges to snag hair. No static. Tames cowlicks. Holds hair well, even as I reposition it or switch hands to cut. This set is a stylist must-have. I wouldn&#x27;t settle for less and see no reason to pay more.</li>
            <li> Good selection of combs and value priced.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get a full 5 stars because on some combs, the molding that combines both sides into one shape is not flush and therefore has a raised ridge of material along the interior spine.
