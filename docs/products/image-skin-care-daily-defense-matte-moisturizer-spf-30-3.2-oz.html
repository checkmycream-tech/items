            <li>It is great for our hot summers in Florida when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing any makeup, and it&#x27;s great to wear to the pool and beach.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is BY FAR the BEST moisturizer I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best skin care line I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to volunteer to get my first lactic peel.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to support my friend, so I said, sure why not.</li>
            <li>and my body was trying to compensate for the lack of moisture with more oil.</li>
            <li>Since I assumed oily skin would forever be mine, I didn&#x27;t think that I could change moisturizes and have better skin because of it.</li>
            <li>This moisterizer works well with mineral power foundations over the top also.  </li>

            <li>I love that it has SPF 30</li>
            <li>if i dust a layer of powder on top.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely perfect for the dry Arizona weather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still better than most products I&#x27;ve tried--still doesn&#x27;t sting or make my eyes water--but I&#x27;m not as thrilled with the new version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the shipping was very quick.  </li>
            <li>i just don&#x27;t like the strong smell it has.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products in the past but this product works the best for me.</li>
            <li>It goes on super smooth and light!</li>
            <li>and my skin stays smooth and not oily all day.  </li>
            <li>Free facials?</li>
            <li>so it looks like a light foundation) with some bronzer</li>
            <li>It is oil free and will not clog pores or break you out...</li>
            <li>but this is no longer available.</li>
            <li>Fantastic moisturizer if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li>No negatives--no smell, no eyes watering--and plenty of positive, most importantly</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t keep my face as oil-free all day as the original formula.</li>
            <li>and I tend to have to clean it out of my brows.</li>
            <li>good for sun protection also, definitely recommended</li>
            <li>and it really stops the shininess most makeup has.</li>
            <li>you, i have super oily skin and even with this product, my skin is shiny within hours.  </li>
            <li>I am loyal to this product for my skin has tolerated it for years.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product and nothing else compares to it as I have tried many other products.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>+ is a lot to spend on a moisturizer but to me it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>Why they messed with a good thing is unknown.</li>
            <li>using this product for a very long time with great results .&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it highly to anyone with oily skin.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve had very oily skin my whole life!!!  </li>
            <li>For years I searched for  the right day cream with SFP.  </li>
            <li>And though it feels kind of tacky/mask-like for the first while, I actually like that</li>
            <li>After a couple of days  my skin broke out with acne (otherwise very much under control) again and again  </li>
            <li>Pretty greasy for a matte moisturizer</li>
            <li>I never thought I would be able to wear SPF daily b/c of my oily skin, but now I can.</li>
            <li>is the only day cream I am able to use day after day without any problems.</li>
            <li>This is a must have in florida~&lt;br /&gt;i love it and will definitely order again and again and again~&lt;br /&gt;thanks~</li>
            <li>BTW, I inadvertantly bought the Daily Defense HYDRATING (vs Matte) version on Amazon last time and it&#x27;s not as good for me--</li>
            <li>It works great, clean feeling, a little dry at first.</li>
            <li>It smelled great, the consistancy was not too watery nor too creamy, you only need a little as you really have to rub it in.</li>
            <li>With that said, this is the only moisturizer i know that keeps my skin hydrated, shine-free and breakout free with SPF of 30.  </li>
            <li>avoid applying too much under makeup as the product is very sticky and will smear like glue.</li>
            <li>I am very oily and really like the matte</li>
            <li>that when I wear this stuff my face doesn&#x27;t shine much if at all.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and had to always use oil blotting sheets.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the item was removed &amp; I didn&#x27;t waste time ordering it.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid for the small tube and the rave reviews above, I was expecting something great.</li>
            <li>It also smelled nice, not the usual sunscreen</li>
            <li>I tried so many different products and all I can say is that I can&#x27;t go back to just any moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Although it feels a little sticky at first, that goes away shortly and leaves you with a nice matt non-greasy finish.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>So after trying 2 other oily skin versions (one drugstore variety, one from a dermatologist) and not being particularly thrilled with either one another friend gave me the end of a tube of Image Daily Defense Matte that she&#x27;d gotten at a spa</li>
            <li>leaves a matte finish, it doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me, but good enough (ie 4 hrs or so)</li>
            <li>Background: 28 years old, Hispanic, olive skin tone (think Jessica Alba), normal to oily skin.     </li>
            <li>My old moisturizers were a JOKE!</li>
            <li>some such--it just felt gross to rub in a cream on my fresh clean face and it usually made my eyes water.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin and has been under the care of a dermatologist since early adult because of acne.</li>
            <li>Not only does it reduce the oily look on my skin, my face has stop producing as much oil as before because this product is so hydrating.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really rate the item because it was out of stock even though it is listed twice in the same category.  </li>
            <li>Not for someone with sensitive or combination skin.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this and was pleasantly surprised how well this stuff controls oil.</li>
            <li>My skin is oil, sensitive and acne prone.  </li>
            <li>&quot; It seems much creamier and doesn&#x27;t dry \\&quot;sticky/tight/</li>
            <li>The peel was great and afterward the instructor encouraged me to purchase a moisturizer with an SPF of at least 30 (because really bad things can happen to your fresh new skin if you don&#x27;t protect it).</li>
            <li>it dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast (as dramatic) as many other physical sunscreen products.  </li>
            <li>some of the other reviewers have mentioned, I&#x27;ve always had very oily skin on my face-</li>
            <li>It is the only lotion/sunscreen that I&#x27;ve ever used that works as an incredible base for make-up</li>
            <li>It does feel a little sticky at first, but just wait awhile before applying your makeup.</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much for toning down redness.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this product, my skin is much clearer and less oily.</li>
            <li>And the strong smell is completely unnecessary.</li>

            <li> The formula seemed to have changed a bit from what i remembered.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin as matte as it used to.  With that said, this is the only moisturizer i know that keeps my skin hydrated, shine-free and breakout free with SPF of 30.  Mind you, i have super oily skin and even with this product, my skin is shiny within hours.  I&#x27;ve tried many products in the past but this product works the best for me.</li>
            <li> Very good for calming redness and reducing the appearance of oily skin..&lt;br /&gt;Very good for sun protection also, definitely recommended</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!!!  It is the only lotion/sunscreen that I&#x27;ve ever used that works as an incredible base for make-up and my skin stays smooth and not oily all day.  And I&#x27;ve had very oily skin my whole life!!!  Also, the shipping was very quick.  Very happy to find this product on Amazon...</li>
            <li> Background: 28 years old, Hispanic, olive skin tone (think Jessica Alba), normal to oily skin.     My friend, who was recently training to receive her master&#x27;s esthetician license, needed dummies to perform facials on while she was in Skincare School. Free facials? That&#x27;s a no brainer. I was happy to volunteer to get my first lactic peel. The peel was great and afterward the instructor encouraged me to purchase a moisturizer with an SPF of at least 30 (because really bad things can happen to your fresh new skin if you don&#x27;t protect it). I was running low on Neutrogena anyway and I wanted to support my friend, so I said, sure why not. The school is a distributor of Image products, so I decided to buy the Image Daily Defense Tinted Moisturizer SPF 30. HA! I was so blown away! This moisturizer is BY FAR the BEST moisturizer I have ever used!!! Not only does it reduce the oily look on my skin, my face has stop producing as much oil as before because this product is so hydrating. I didn&#x27;t realize how horrible my old moisturizer was until I started using this one. My old moisturizers were a JOKE! I used to moisturize, then add foundation and the rest of my make up and by noon you could ski down my face. My face was so oily because the moisturizer I was using wasn&#x27;t working and my body was trying to compensate for the lack of moisture with more oil. Since I assumed oily skin would forever be mine, I didn&#x27;t think that I could change moisturizes and have better skin because of it. I&#x27;m happy that I did. $30+ is a lot to spend on a moisturizer but to me it is completely worth it. I use the tinted moisturizer (it dries matte so it looks like a light foundation) with some bronzer and I&#x27;m good to go! I&#x27;m very pleased with Image&#x27;s product and I&#x27;ll be staying with them for a long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really rate the item because it was out of stock even though it is listed twice in the same category.  It would be nice if the item was removed &amp; I didn&#x27;t waste time ordering it.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin care line I&#x27;ve found so far.  It is absolutely perfect for the dry Arizona weather.</li>
            <li> Pretty greasy for a matte moisturizer</li>
            <li> avoid applying too much under makeup as the product is very sticky and will smear like glue. It needs time to dry and absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that I use on myself as well as my daughter and son.  It is an amazing product and nothing else compares to it as I have tried many other products.  It is a must have for a daily moisturizer and also for the summer as a sunscreen.  My face and my kids&#x27; faces never burn in the summertime on extremely sunny days.  I am very oily and really like the matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  It is oil free and will not clog pores or break you out...</li>
            <li> I have oily/ combo skin which doesn&#x27;t help when being outside sweating in the summer! I saw Image had a moisturizing MATTE sun block and thought perfect! Well...it&#x27;s definitely NOT matte. It smelled great, the consistancy was not too watery nor too creamy, you only need a little as you really have to rub it in. The SPF was perfect for the beach, I kept reapplying throughout the day and no sun burn. Sadly, I will not be purchasing another bottle once I run out...I need a product that&#x27;s truly matte!</li>
            <li> Image does a great job with protecting your skin and giving your skin a nice matte finish.  This moisterizer works well with mineral power foundations over the top also.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I guess I started using this at the wrong time in the year. My skin was very dry from acne medications and it was the middle of the winter. This gave me NO moisture, I did not see any improvement in my skin tone. My acne marks were taking forever to heal. Applying my foundation was difficult because my skin was so dry yet sticky from the lotion. And the strong smell is completely unnecessary. Not for someone with sensitive or combination skin. Maybe this would work for oily skin in the summer. For the price I paid for the small tube and the rave reviews above, I was expecting something great. This did NOT deliver.</li>
            <li> This product has changed to the SPF 32, 3.2 oz.  It&#x27;s not the same because this one went on smoother and I miss that but this is no longer available.</li>
            <li> Update 10/11/2013: alas, they&#x27;ve changed the formula for this product. Used to be 18% zinc oxide but now it&#x27;s 9% zinc oxide and 7.5% \\&quot;octinoxate.\\&quot; It seems much creamier and doesn&#x27;t dry \\&quot;sticky/tight/matte\\&quot; like I liked/mention below. Also doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much for toning down redness. And it doesn&#x27;t keep my face as oil-free all day as the original formula. It&#x27;s still better than most products I&#x27;ve tried--still doesn&#x27;t sting or make my eyes water--but I&#x27;m not as thrilled with the new version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, I&#x27;ve always had very oily skin on my face-I use powder paper regularly during the day to press off the shine. Because of that I&#x27;ve never used a moisterizer and only wore sunscreen if I were on a beach vacation or some such--it just felt gross to rub in a cream on my fresh clean face and it usually made my eyes water. But now that I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s I made a resolution to try to wear sunscreen every day in 2012 (a friend talked me into it). So after trying 2 other oily skin versions (one drugstore variety, one from a dermatologist) and not being particularly thrilled with either one another friend gave me the end of a tube of Image Daily Defense Matte that she&#x27;d gotten at a spa and I credit this product for being able to keep my resolution (6+ months and counting)! No negatives--no smell, no eyes watering--and plenty of positive, most importantly that when I wear this stuff my face doesn&#x27;t shine much if at all. And though it feels kind of tacky/mask-like for the first while, I actually like that (makes my skin feel tighter) and it helps to hold the loose powder I brush on as makeup. I also feel like it tones down redness and smooths overall skintone. FYI, it is a zinc-based sunscreen, so it looks quite white until you rub it in and I tend to have to clean it out of my brows. BTW, I inadvertantly bought the Daily Defense HYDRATING (vs Matte) version on Amazon last time and it&#x27;s not as good for me--if you&#x27;re looking for the Matte one for oily skin, make sure you watch which one you order.</li>
            <li> Fantastic moisturizer if you have oily skin. I use this on days I will be inside all day because that&#x27;s when I notice the oiliness of my skin. It works great, clean feeling, a little dry at first. On days I am outside or active I use the universal moisturizer. Great products with sunscreen in it to protect my skin from the sun!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and had to always use oil blotting sheets. After I started using this product I no longer have to blot throughout the day! I never thought I would be able to wear SPF daily b/c of my oily skin, but now I can. It does feel a little sticky at first, but just wait awhile before applying your makeup. Love it!!</li>
            <li> IT Makes my makeup stay all day long. I love the matte finish it provides and it really stops the shininess most makeup has.</li>
            <li> Use to be a great product. Now it separates and turns sticky leaving white specks on your face. Why they messed with a good thing is unknown. Save your money---don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, but have purchased it from local retailers until now. Product should need to be squeezed from the tube, creating a thick cream. The tube I received through Amazon is faulty in that the product runs out of the tube -it is that thin.  Date shows it isn&#x27;t old, so have they watered it down? I&#x27;ll never buy this type of product online again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Although it feels a little sticky at first, that goes away shortly and leaves you with a nice matt non-greasy finish. I don&#x27;t feel the need to wear makeup at all when I&#x27;m out doing errands. It is great for our hot summers in Florida when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing any makeup, and it&#x27;s great to wear to the pool and beach. The sun protection is great! I can&#x27;t recommend this enough!</li>
            <li> I am loyal to this product for my skin has tolerated it for years. I have a sensitive skin and has been under the care of a dermatologist since early adult because of acne. This is the only moisturizer I can use that does not make me break out. I am happy this was recommended by my aesthetician.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer/sunscreen gives me the protection I need, without giving my face the greasiness of a thousand pizzas.  Doomed to pizza-face since my teenage years, I always have a hard time finding a sunscreen.  This is the best I&#x27;ve found yet.  My face is still oily, there&#x27;s no way around that, but it&#x27;s much better.  It may not be a miracle worker, but it helps a lot.</li>
            <li> For years I searched for  the right day cream with SFP.  I tried from cheaper brands to very expensive brands a huge variety of different day creams with SFP 15 to 50. Nothing worked. After a couple of days  my skin broke out with acne (otherwise very much under control) again and again  Finally, I found and tried Image Daily Defense Matte.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only day cream I am able to use day after day without any problems. If you have acne prone skin this cream is the way to go</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, does not clog pores or over oil my face, good for aging skin, this is a great buy and a good company to buy from!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have oily skin and I wear this moisturizer under my make-up and it keeps the shine down.  I love that it has SPF 30 and it smells great.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs an oil control moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a must have in florida~&lt;br /&gt;i love it and will definitely order again and again and again~&lt;br /&gt;thanks~</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this and was pleasantly surprised how well this stuff controls oil. I have very oily skin and 8 hours after applying this, I STILL didn&#x27;t need an oil blotter sheet as I usually do. It also smelled nice, not the usual sunscreen smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m not sure how reliable it is to buy this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face dry &amp; protected from sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;Been using this product for a very long time with great results .&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it highly to anyone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> it dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast (as dramatic) as many other physical sunscreen products.  leaves a matte finish, it doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me, but good enough (ie 4 hrs or so) if i dust a layer of powder on top.  i just don&#x27;t like the strong smell it has.  but then i am use to tea tree oil smell and other stuff, so it&#x27;s bearable for me.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It goes on super smooth and light! Feels great under make up AND I can wear my makeup ALL DAY without having to reapply powder or blot the oil from my face! It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I have ever tried, hands-down!!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite moisturizer. My skin is oil, sensitive and acne prone.  Since I started using this product, my skin is much clearer and less oily. I give this product an A++. I tried so many different products and all I can say is that I can&#x27;t go back to just any moisturizer. It also smells great too.</li>
