    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>these have been the best.</li>
            <li>These are perfect.</li>
            <li>FINALLY good quality combs!!!</li>
            <li>These are a good flexible plastic that stays in your hair &amp; doesn&#x27;t break!!</li>
            <li>Was real happy with these.</li>
            <li>The combs I loved and couldn&#x27;t find anymore were brown, not so rigid, and the teeth were closer together, so perfect!  </li>
            <li>and I have missed them greatly.  </li>
            <li>Great for my longish hair.</li>
            <li>Great.  </li>
            <li>The combs do hold together very nicely though.  </li>
            <li>These are great quality and look good.  </li>
            <li>Good quality dont snap teeth after wearing.</li>
            <li>These combs are wonderful and the company gives FANTASTIC customer service.</li>
            <li>Good hair combs.  </li>
            <li>I will get more!</li>
            <li>I love these combs!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying this great product!</li>
            <li>I have a lot of very curly hair, and needed a comb pair that would hold it all, and this comb pair works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Love these combs.  </li>
            <li>So glad I could find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They fit together nice and snug</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>and I hadn&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere until someone suggested Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love these big hair combs as they are perfect for my wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked in many stores, but they no longer seemed to exist.</li>
            <li>It would be better for someone with thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>But, the closest I could find after many years of searching.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering a couple more sets to have around.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re pretty good.</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed.......were sent out right away &amp; packaged great......</li>
            <li>If your in the market for the type of hair combs that hold your hair well, I would strongly suggest this one.</li>
            <li>France Luxe makes a nice product- a bit pricey but the combs are good, and feel nice as they slide across your scalp and hold your hair firmly in place.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair</li>
            <li>Also had to smooth out the gates with a box knife then jeweler&#x27;s cloth.  </li>
            <li>The size is great even for above the should length hair.</li>
            <li>Even though they are a bit pricy, these combs are just right and this vendor was great--I have ordered more pairs.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m comfortable, and I still think they look cool.</li>
            <li>They are the best I found in the past year.  </li>
            <li>They are good, solid, separate clips that fit together and don&#x27;t slide out.</li>
            <li>Good, solid clips.</li>
            <li>the result is a full, curly cascading ponytail.</li>
            <li>Plus, if you order three or more items from them (even from here on Amazon), they always throw in a nice little free gift.</li>
            <li>Worked real good on extra long hair.</li>
            <li>I had to file the ends and smooth the edges with jeweler&#x27;s cloth, fine and extra fine.</li>
            <li>These particular combs grip each other as well as my good ones do!</li>
            <li>Well worth paying for the shipping.</li>
            <li>They were worth the money and the time to break them in.</li>
            <li>I have very thin fine hair, so I was worried, but it works great!!!</li>
            <li>They sit on my head just right.</li>
            <li>These combs remind me a bit of the banana clips that were popular back when I was in high school in the &#x27;80&#x27;s, but I really like the fun, full look that they  give to my ponytail!  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The ones I had before locked together the first try and stayed in all day.  </li>
            <li>These work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>The teeth were a bit sharp, but I filed them down and now they are perfect.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think any combs would really hold my hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care if I look like I&#x27;m straight out of a Duran Duran video.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;tines&amp;#34; are very bendy</li>
            <li>and they do end up slipping a bit on me, but I need to experiment with them more.  </li>
            <li>They were more expensive but WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li>I would like to find more in other colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used interlocking combs for years now, &amp; I was down to my last good pair.</li>
            <li>They are still snagging my hair a little so will work on them some more with the cloth.</li>
            <li>I wish they were a little more flexible</li>
            <li>Either they didn&#x27;t mesh together well, wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair, were brittle and many just plain broke.  </li>
            <li>These are fairly small and aren&#x27;t meant for large full heads of hair.</li>
            <li>I curl my hair, put it back with the combs, and hit it lightly with hairspray to keep it from slipping out--</li>
            <li>These combs are very flimsy and will likely bend and eventually break.</li>
            <li>; don&#x27;t know that I could afford to replace them; this was a definite splurge for me), but they keep my thick, very fine hair off my neck and out of my face.</li>
            <li>I have been looking high &amp; low for these combs.......</li>
            <li>thinking they were of similar quality especially at this high price point.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly full head of hair made up of a lot of extremely thin but very curly hair.</li>
            <li>The combs were very sharp when I first got them.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay in place or hold a whole head of my hair as does other products.</li>
            <li>An added benefit to this hairstyle is that you don&#x27;t have a part, so roots don&#x27;t really show if you are due for coloring.</li>
            <li>I expected larger combs with much thicker plastic.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love these combs.  They stopped selling this style in the stores maybe 15 years ago and I have missed them greatly.  So glad I could find them on Amazon.  I have thick wavy hair and these are large in size.  They fit together nice and snug (don&#x27;t fall apart).</li>
            <li> I have long, heavy hair and was looking to do a faux hawk of sorts... I didn&#x27;t think any combs would really hold my hair but these do the trick! I don&#x27;t even need to use bobby pins to help them stay in place. Great product! Well worth paying for the shipping. ;)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in place or hold a whole head of my hair as does other products.</li>
            <li> I bought these at the same time I also purchased cheaper ones.....these last and last.  I will get more! Thanks for carrying this great product!</li>
            <li> These combs locked very tightly which makes all the difference in the world!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried lots of other combs these have been the best.</li>
            <li> I love these silly combs.  I admit I am an 80&#x27;s girl.  I have thick curly hair and these combs are the only things that can pull back all of my hair without giving me a headache.  I don&#x27;t care if I look like I&#x27;m straight out of a Duran Duran video.  I like it, I&#x27;m comfortable, and I still think they look cool.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of these combs in the 80s and I could throw them in without any fiddling every time.  I have no complaints about the quality of the plastic they are made from, which seems fine, but I have a hard time getting them to lock into each other in a way that doesn&#x27;t fall out either immediately or within a couple of hours.  The ones I had before locked together the first try and stayed in all day.  My hair is thick and curly...</li>
            <li> Sometimes France Luxe will put videos on how to use their products online. I scoured the internet and found nothing. I think this product is a flop. The teeth do not catch on each other, they do not effectively hold any hair. Big waste.</li>
            <li> Finally found combs that are flexable!  I had to file the ends and smooth the edges with jeweler&#x27;s cloth, fine and extra fine. Also had to smooth out the gates with a box knife then jeweler&#x27;s cloth.  The combs were very sharp when I first got them. They are still snagging my hair a little so will work on them some more with the cloth. The size is great even for above the should length hair. They sit on my head just right. They were worth the money and the time to break them in.</li>
            <li> I had two pairs of interlocking combs that lasted me 5 years of regular usage before breaking. I sought out two pairs of these combs thinking they were of similar quality especially at this high price point. I expected larger combs with much thicker plastic. These are fairly small and aren&#x27;t meant for large full heads of hair. These combs are very flimsy and will likely bend and eventually break. I have a fairly full head of hair made up of a lot of extremely thin but very curly hair. I could not get these to stay closed. They went back!</li>
            <li> I love these combs! I have thick hair, so a regular banana clip won&#x27;t work for me. These are perfect.</li>
            <li> FINALLY good quality combs!!! Love them.  Had a pair like these for&lt;br /&gt;Almost 15 years! Good quality dont snap teeth after wearing.</li>
            <li> These are great quality and look good.  Great for my longish hair.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but w what I ordered.</li>
            <li> These combs are wonderful and the company gives FANTASTIC customer service. The &amp;#34;tines&amp;#34; are very bendy and I do worry about them breaking (they&#x27;re not cheap; don&#x27;t know that I could afford to replace them; this was a definite splurge for me), but they keep my thick, very fine hair off my neck and out of my face. A godsend in the tropics. These do what other combs can&#x27;t seem to (namely, stay in my hair). Were I a woman of means, I&#x27;d have ten pair.</li>
            <li> Good, solid clips. Big - but that is what works well. These two combs are not connected like the cheapies you can buy now. They are good, solid, separate clips that fit together and don&#x27;t slide out.</li>
            <li> I have been looking high &amp; low for these combs.......exactly what I needed.......were sent out right away &amp; packaged great......</li>
            <li> Great.  They are the best I found in the past year.  I have thick hair and a lot of the interlocking combs don&#x27;t hold but these do!!!!</li>
            <li> Good hair combs.  If you&#x27;re looking for those hair combs from the 80s, these are probably as close as you&#x27;re going to get.  I have thick, long hair and I purchase several other brands of these type of  hair combs and they just didn&#x27;t work.  Either they didn&#x27;t mesh together well, wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair, were brittle and many just plain broke.  These work pretty well.  I wish they were a little more flexible but they&#x27;re pretty good.</li>
            <li> I used to wear my hair back in combs like these back in the 80&#x27;s.  Over the years they all got lost or broken and I hadn&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere until someone suggested Amazon.  I love these big hair combs as they are perfect for my wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used interlocking combs for years now, &amp; I was down to my last good pair. I do have another pair, but they are rather slippery do not grip each other well (not all interlocking combs are alike!). I&#x27;ve looked in many stores, but they no longer seemed to exist. Finally, I tried Amazon. These particular combs grip each other as well as my good ones do! The teeth were a bit sharp, but I filed them down and now they are perfect. I have fairly thin, wavy hair that tends to slip out of barrettes. I curl my hair, put it back with the combs, and hit it lightly with hairspray to keep it from slipping out--the result is a full, curly cascading ponytail. They do not pull or make my scalp hurt like a ponytail does, either. An added benefit to this hairstyle is that you don&#x27;t have a part, so roots don&#x27;t really show if you are due for coloring. Even though they are a bit pricy, these combs are just right and this vendor was great--I have ordered more pairs.</li>
            <li> Very close to what I was looking for, but a bit too long and slightly too wide for my hair and head shape..  It would be better for someone with thicker hair.  The combs do hold together very nicely though.  The combs I loved and couldn&#x27;t find anymore were brown, not so rigid, and the teeth were closer together, so perfect!  Wish I still had them!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very curly hair, and needed a comb pair that would hold it all, and this comb pair works perfectly.  I would like to find more in other colors.</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair, so I was worried, but it works great!!! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I bought both colors! The last banana clips I bought lasted 2 times wearing them before they started loosing teeth! These are a good flexible plastic that stays in your hair &amp; doesn&#x27;t break!! They were more expensive but WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li> The teeths are very sharp ..Waste of money.</li>
            <li> France Luxe makes a nice product- a bit pricey but the combs are good, and feel nice as they slide across your scalp and hold your hair firmly in place.Thank you.</li>
            <li> Was real happy with these. Worked real good on extra long hair. Achieved the style we were going for with these combs.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this product a four star and not five is because it&#x27;s not 100% the item I used to have years ago. But, the closest I could find after many years of searching. If your in the market for the type of hair combs that hold your hair well, I would strongly suggest this one. I will be ordering a couple more sets to have around.</li>
            <li> These combs remind me a bit of the banana clips that were popular back when I was in high school in the &#x27;80&#x27;s, but I really like the fun, full look that they  give to my ponytail!  I have fine, wavy hair and they do end up slipping a bit on me, but I need to experiment with them more.  I think that adding some hair spray, as some other reviewers have recommended, will help them stay in place better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;France Luxe always makes high-quality items, and these are no exception.  Plus, if you order three or more items from them (even from here on Amazon), they always throw in a nice little free gift.</li>
            <li> it need hook on the end to hold the hair in I have think  hair</li>
