            <li>your hair smells&amp;#34; kind of comments.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome leave-in conditioner for detangling and I like that is more of a thicker creamy consistency instead of just a regular spray.  </li>
            <li>Work so much better then</li>
            <li>A fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>And I love the smell.</li>
            <li>…I get a lot of &amp;#34;I love the way</li>
            <li>I tried directly spraying into hair, but it wasn&#x27;t so great, so I just put it in with my hands.</li>
            <li>As my hair is uber-short, I cannot vouch for the detangling claims, but my comb does move easily through my hair and does not tug at all.</li>
            <li>Works fabulously as a detangler and leaves my hair silky.</li>

            <li>A quality product that moisturizes the hair with no ugly residue.  </li>
            <li>Read my full review at beautyapocalypse.com</li>
            <li>The seller also has free and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The climate here is dry, and even in humidity my hair does not frizz, but it does get static-y here and my hair gets really fly away-ish and this product certainly controls that.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my hair look soft and touchable without deflating the style, and adds a shiny, healthy gloss.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product and it makes my hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that will detangle my curly hair and leave it soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s white-ish and very creamy, but you spray it on.</li>
            <li>I am a definite fan of this product and will be ordering more in the future.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It keeps the hair from getting really tangled, but also gives my hair volume and keeps it soft.</li>
            <li>It also claims to provide long lasting frizz and static control.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products…..which invariably left my hair really dry/brittle feeling and/or really stiff as it dried.</li>
            <li>Best detangled ever but very expensive from my salon - found it on Amazon for less than half the price.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff. My hair is finally growing after a period of not going for about 5 years. My hair would break off before growing.  Wont be without it. Thanks</li>
            <li> A quality product that moisturizes the hair with no ugly residue.  It also lasts a long time.  Highly recommended.</li>

            <li> My hair dresser turned me on to this product.  Work so much better then the drug store versions.  Two to three pumps for my long hair is enough. Not as heavy as regular conditioner.  Awesome awesome product!</li>
            <li> smells so great , leaves my hair feeling nice and silky</li>
            <li> This works amazing on my long hair and I love the smell. I will buy this over and over again!</li>
            <li> This is so awesome for my 3A hair after a wash. This looks and feels like a lotion for skin. It&#x27;s white-ish and very creamy, but you spray it on. I spritz on a bunch (~4 sprays) of it in my palms to rub into very wet sectioned hair (I usually have quarter sections). It reduces frizz dramatically without a greasy or dreaded &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; on curly hair. I tried directly spraying into hair, but it wasn&#x27;t so great, so I just put it in with my hands.I use what seems like a ton in my hair all the time, and I&#x27;ve only made a dent in the bottle. I use it as a styler, a leave-in, and detangler. A fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, leaves your hair silky smooth and smells great! Will definately buy another bottle when I run out.</li>
            <li> Works fabulously as a detangler and leaves my hair silky.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I&#x27;ve used it for a couple years now and can&#x27;t get enough of it. It&#x27;s the only thing that will detangle my curly hair and leave it soft and smelling good. The seller also has free and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great smell and does wonders for my hair.  I am a definite fan of this product and will be ordering more in the future.  I have fairly frizzy hair so it&#x27;s a big deal for this to actually work for me.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great service</li>
            <li> Best detangled ever but very expensive from my salon - found it on Amazon for less than half the price.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product four times and have no intention of not keeping it in stock. It is great for curly hair to help with frizz and manageability.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and it makes my hair feel so soft.  I have purchased this multiple times.</li>
            <li> It manage my hair frizz and make the blow day easier and faster.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Detangles my hair and smells great!</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff according to my wife and daughter.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I have tried many different products…..which invariably left my hair really dry/brittle feeling and/or really stiff as it dried. This stuff doesn&#x27;t do that. It keeps the hair from getting really tangled, but also gives my hair volume and keeps it soft. And I love the smell. A lot. It&#x27;s kind of like incense………I get a lot of &amp;#34;I love the way your hair smells&amp;#34; kind of comments. I hope this is on the market for a very long time!</li>
