            <li>It makes MY lashes look incredible and it stays all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried using a great brush from another mascara.</li>
            <li>The brush is great.</li>
            <li>great stuff... works as stated.</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t have allergies this is a great product.</li>
            <li>All I need is one coat for gorgeous lashes.</li>
            <li>This is a good mascara and the brush helps keep the lashes separated and well coated.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara!</li>
            <li>you apply this in more than one coat, it actually is fairly volumizing.</li>
            <li>Maybe there are better ones for that purpose, but this is good for a drugstore brand.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>this is my favorite mascara</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure anyone can handle it by just picking them out.</li>
            <li>Love it love it</li>
            <li>love it love it</li>
            <li>love it love it .....,,, and one more time love it .</li>
            <li>shiny metal on the lid doesn&#x27;t get scratched and unsightly as easily as you may think.</li>
            <li>It does easily remove using Lancome&#x27;s Bi-Facil makeup remover and</li>
            <li>I have fine lashes so maybe this mascara is meant for someone with thicker lashes.</li>
            <li>Been a fan of this mascara for a while, truly a good mascara that is easy to remove with vitamin e oil (only oil that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes).</li>
            <li>Separates lashes well, but I didn&#x27;t find that it built volume or any significant length.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit that when I first got this, I wasn&#x27;t impressed and thought of it as just like any other drugstore waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s really cool looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is waterproof, really really waterproof, and mostly soap proof.</li>
            <li>I would order again from this seller any day as it was packaged well and the product seems fresh.</li>
            <li>This product and brush are remarkably similar at a nice savings.  </li>
            <li>so I was so happy to find more of it available online through Amazon, especially for such a low price.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try if you like mascara, it very reasonably priced, too.</li>
            <li>for lasting power, this is great and definitely does not come off in water, even if you try.</li>
            <li>In fact, when I wash my face, I rarely can get all of this off unless I use a real eye makeup remover.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>I got Revlon after reading reviews that it was just like They&#x27;re Real, which I use and was almost out of.</li>
            <li>It really lengthens your lashes.</li>
            <li>Clumped too readily, seemed to make lashes appear thicker, but shorter than I am used to.</li>
            <li>for how it works, well ... it doesn&#x27;t really.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the whole point.</li>
            <li>Since it also didn&#x27;t have a metallic top, and the mascara was pretty dry, I&#x27;m guessing I got an old product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is dry, like I said, but also doesn&#x27;t really do more than the old cake-with-a-brush mascara</li>
            <li>It looks pretty smooth and goes on with little hassle.</li>
            <li>Use a lash comb only when freshly applied.  </li>
            <li>This is not the only brand I have to stay away from but this is the first time I had a reaction to a Revlon product.</li>
            <li>Item and it&#x27;s packaging  does not seem to be a new, unopened product it looks worn and old.</li>
            <li>Very waterproof, only comes off with makeup remover in shower.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews I was really surprised that I didn&#x27;t like this mascara.  </li>
            <li>After sticking the brush in the tube numerous times, it still would not pick up much product.</li>
            <li>The color is also true to its name; this is the darkest black</li>
            <li>First of all, the wand, which is packaged separately from the tube, has white bristles and a larger diameter than what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed with this item it is the first time I have experienced anything like it.  </li>
            <li>After using MAX FACTOR 2000 for 12 years and not being able to find it in the US for less than $30.00 a pop, it was hard to find a replacement.</li>

            <li> But this is the happiest I&#x27;ve been after going through an endless array of different mascaras that never lived up to their claims.</li>
            <li> nice to have a less expensive avenue of purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d ordered brownish/black and got blackest black, but that&#x27;s not that big an issue.  </li>
            <li> Be careful when purchasing.</li>

            <li> First of all, I got the wrong color.  </li>

            <li> Still not very good.</li>
            <li> Lashes weren&#x27;t separated and felt very stiff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and gunky.  </li>
            <li> This order I received something that was thick and lumpy.</li>
            <li> bad enough to return, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse, I can&#x27;t get it off!  </li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I gave ever used.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I gave ever used. The brush does not take on much mascara which means hardly any goes on your lashes. I&#x27;ve even tried using a great brush from another mascara. Still not very good. Makes your lashes feel like dried out corn husks &amp; I use waterproof all the time so it&#x27;s not that. Awful.</li>
            <li> I use this often...nice to have a less expensive avenue of purchase!</li>
            <li> Very good. Very waterproof, only comes off with makeup remover in shower. The brush is great.</li>
            <li> Separates lashes well, but I didn&#x27;t find that it built volume or any significant length. Back to L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous for me!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite mascara so I was so happy to find more of it available online through Amazon, especially for such a low price.  I would order again from this seller any day as it was packaged well and the product seems fresh.</li>
            <li> great stuff... works as stated. fast delivery</li>
            <li> I got Revlon after reading reviews that it was just like They&#x27;re Real, which I use and was almost out of. This product and brush are remarkably similar at a nice savings.  All I need is one coat for gorgeous lashes. Love this mascara!</li>
            <li> Definetly wotth it makes yiur lashe so long</li>
            <li> Love this !!!! It is waterproof and looks amazing !!!!</li>
            <li> Do not buy the waterproof version!!!  I loved the regular version of this mascara but the waterproof is terrible!  It&#x27;s thick and gunky.  What&#x27;s worse, I can&#x27;t get it off!  I&#x27;ve used 4 different kinds of eye makeup remover and I&#x27;m practically ripping my eyelashes out to get this stuff off!  If I could give it zero stars I would....</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara and the brush helps keep the lashes separated and well coated. My problem was I was allergic to this. This is not the only brand I have to stay away from but this is the first time I had a reaction to a Revlon product. For those who don&#x27;t have allergies this is a great product. It really lengthens your lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that when I first got this, I wasn&#x27;t impressed and thought of it as just like any other drugstore waterproof mascara. However, it somehow grew on me after several uses.&lt;br /&gt;If you apply this in more than one coat, it actually is fairly volumizing. Maybe there are better ones for that purpose, but this is good for a drugstore brand.&lt;br /&gt;The shiny metal on the lid doesn&#x27;t get scratched and unsightly as easily as you may think. In my opinion, it&#x27;s really cool looking.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several other mascaras and a lot of them looked really thick and gross when I took the wand out of the tube. Not for this one. It looks pretty smooth and goes on with little hassle. The color is also true to its name; this is the darkest black I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;As for lasting power, this is great and definitely does not come off in water, even if you try. In fact, when I wash my face, I rarely can get all of this off unless I use a real eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;However, the one downside is that it does clump a little bit while you&#x27;re applying it. It&#x27;s nothing extreme and I&#x27;m sure anyone can handle it by just picking them out.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it love it love it love it .....,,, and one more time love it .</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I was really surprised that I didn&#x27;t like this mascara.  It was too think and gloppy. Lashes weren&#x27;t separated and felt very stiff.  I have fine lashes so maybe this mascara is meant for someone with thicker lashes.</li>
            <li> First of all, the wand, which is packaged separately from the tube, has white bristles and a larger diameter than what is shown in the picture. After sticking the brush in the tube numerous times, it still would not pick up much product. It&#x27;s as though the mascara won&#x27;t stick to the brush. What little I managed to get on the brush didn&#x27;t coat my lashes. Cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> Item and it&#x27;s packaging  does not seem to be a new, unopened product it looks worn and old. Very disappointed with this item it is the first time I have experienced anything like it.  Be careful when purchasing.</li>
            <li> Clumped too readily, seemed to make lashes appear thicker, but shorter than I am used to. I passed it on</li>
            <li> Been a fan of this mascara for a while, truly a good mascara that is easy to remove with vitamin e oil (only oil that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes). I use waterproof because I work 10 to 12 hours a day and get sweaty and I dont like the raccoon eye look.  This is the 4th one I&#x27;ve purchased! It makes MY lashes look incredible and it stays all day. After using MAX FACTOR 2000 for 12 years and not being able to find it in the US for less than $30.00 a pop, it was hard to find a replacement. But this is the happiest I&#x27;ve been after going through an endless array of different mascaras that never lived up to their claims. Worth a try if you like mascara, it very reasonably priced, too. I hope it stays around. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> First of all, I got the wrong color.  I&#x27;d ordered brownish/black and got blackest black, but that&#x27;s not that big an issue.  also, mine was packaged differently, with the wand already inside the cartridge.  Since it also didn&#x27;t have a metallic top, and the mascara was pretty dry, I&#x27;m guessing I got an old product.&lt;br /&gt;As for how it works, well ... it doesn&#x27;t really.  It is dry, like I said, but also doesn&#x27;t really do more than the old cake-with-a-brush mascara my mom used to use.&lt;br /&gt;Not bad enough to return, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> After using this product for over a year, it was disappointing to be sent old stock. This order I received something that was thick and lumpy. Unusable. Threw them both in the bin</li>
            <li> My experience with this WP mascara has been consistent over the past two years.  It is waterproof, really really waterproof, and mostly soap proof. that&#x27;s why I tried it.  I spend a lot of time in a pool and  working up a sweat and the mascara stays put.  Yes, it can clump- just remove the clumps from the brush  before you use it. Multiple applications can thicken the coat, but it does have a tendency to look too gloppy if you do.  Use a lash comb only when freshly applied.  Now I don&#x27;t have to have my blonde lashes dyed. And I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking like a raccoon. That&#x27;s the whole point. It&#x27;s the only mascara I use. It does easily remove using Lancome&#x27;s Bi-Facil makeup remover and also Dial body wash.</li>
