            <li>Really nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often have to switch bags; it&#x27;s just nice to have everything I need to take with me organized and in one place within whatever bag</li>
            <li>but I honestly don&#x27;t care because it does what I want</li>
            <li>It came fast and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>Nice bags, neat to just pull out and change purses.</li>
            <li>Works great  needed this to keep everything at an instant reach and organized,  This is wonderful.  </li>

            <li>coz the price was a deal, and now i have ordered 6 more coz every one in may family liked them</li>
            <li>I liked that it had handles, many others did not.  </li>
            <li>so I can find things easily -- these things help!</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>I ordered three more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Bulky with too many pockets for me</li>
            <li>I am also pleased to have gotten it in my favorite color.</li>
            <li>Its an okay quality</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy more for christmas presents</li>
            <li>I bought mine from another seller on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Love the color and the ease of taking this out of one purse to pop it into another.  </li>
            <li>but it has many more pockets which I like better.</li>
            <li>Love all the pockets and the two zippered compartments.</li>
            <li>Love them .</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more</li>
            <li>It will definitely fit and be used!  </li>
            <li>But the price was so affordable that I thought it&#x27;d be ok to try an order.  </li>
            <li>This item. :-)</li>
            <li>, just don&#x27;t know if i will be able to find things in the organizer when it is in my purse.</li>
            <li>I love the color as well.</li>
            <li>Lots of pockets :)</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>If I could learn to use it more, I think I would like it better.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I really love this organizer.  </li>
            <li>holds everything i need, and more.  </li>
            <li>it works for me, but then i dont carry much more on me on any given day.  </li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>Love it it is so.</li>
            <li>Just needs to be of better quality.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several purse inserts and this one is the best I have found.  </li>
            <li>It fit in my purse nicely and kept everything in it;&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li>When I received it, I immediately ordered two more.  </li>
            <li>I do like the handles but would love more rigid structure to it.</li>
            <li>so it expands the opening at the top and bottom</li>
            <li>I have tried so many \\&quot;bags\\&quot; in my beach bag</li>
            <li>absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>At first i wasn&#x27;t sure that they will be good and helpful</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>Everything has its own compartment and it is an awesome little organizer.</li>
            <li>Love the color, the contrast makes it easy to choose what you want.</li>
            <li>I can fit so many things in here that I&#x27;m able to use for school.</li>
            <li>Good product  works well for large purses, gives you a way to find stuff in your purse without dumping it out.</li>
            <li>This comestic bag is the perfect size for my large Miche bag, so handy, I finally can find everything that is in my purse.</li>
            <li>I cannot get the snaps on the sides to snap together but other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>The color makes things easy to find.</li>
            <li>Easily washable</li>
            <li>bag\\&quot;/\\&quot;beach bag\\&quot; that could be easily lifted out.</li>
            <li>but it has many pockets and the right sizes!</li>
            <li>I own and have gifted several of these handy organizers.  </li>
            <li>This is super helpful!  </li>
            <li>Very well made, I love it!</li>
            <li>These are cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>I use it in my purse and it really helps me keep everything tidy.</li>
            <li>I can fit a lot of things in this nifty organizer and because I&#x27;m a handbag freak</li>
            <li>Cheaply made</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t measure this bag before purchasing because I &amp;#34;eyed&amp;#34; it and thought it&#x27;d fit.  </li>
            <li>It will fit in my purse</li>
            <li>It has lots of pockets and expands to fit whatever purse/bag you need to use it in.</li>
            <li>It is light, so</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t ad a lot of weight to your bag, which is important for me.</li>
            <li>I bought the blue one and it works great for transferring items from purse to purse.</li>
            <li>Poorly made however great idea, could use more pockets zippers compartments, if you want a good one go to QVC</li>
            <li>I ordered one, not being so sure it would be something useful.  </li>
            <li>mesh pockets are 2 lightly padded \\&quot;parachute pockets, 3x3.5w&lt;</li>
            <li>cheaply made, didnt work for my purposes</li>
            <li>First time ever it is easy to change bags!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for any traveler since it is ideal to hold travel sized items and most, if not all, of the personal care necessities you would take on a trip.</li>
            <li>It is very useful</li>
            <li>When changing purses just remove with handles make it super easy.</li>
            <li>Super simple, great quality, and I recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li>Awesome organizer, since most purses have few compartments this is very helpful.</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait!</li>
            <li>specially moms who have kids like me</li>
            <li>I packed 2 of these full of things for hostess gifts for my SIL and MIL for doing my baby shower.</li>
            <li>This was much nicer than many others I&#x27;d seen.  </li>
            <li>Great bag to store diapers, wipes and other stuff for baby.</li>
            <li>This makes for the perfect organizer because I have a big bag I take outside</li>
            <li>Love it - still holding up after a year of use - highly recomend</li>
            <li>but I have used it for a week and already it got something on it twice and wiped clean - once right away,</li>
            <li>The price is ridiculously cheap and the product seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I like the color, makes it easy to find in a large purse.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient and easy to take it out in my bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It has nice smooth lines, it snaps to a smaller size if you need less space, as well as being able to be full size or even 1/2 size!!  </li>
            <li>I just love these, it holds all kinds of goodies, i can easily throw into a bigger bag and still not have to hunt to find it.</li>
            <li>Very nice exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these... quick and easy for trunk to, for wanting but not on you, meds, tablets, camera, etc...</li>
            <li>ITS WORTH</li>
            <li>Also extremely handy for travel if you don&#x27;t want to carry a big handbag along with luggage.</li>
            <li>Just tuck this in a carryon and you are golden.</li>
            <li>So worth it.</li>
            <li>what can you get for $3.50 that is worth even $3.50?  </li>
            <li>It was well made and worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Really useful for organizing my bag.  </li>
            <li>Convenient  for me to use put my cell phone and other stuff in there good.</li>
            <li>When they say shipping ETA is 25 days that&#x27;s about right.  </li>
            <li>But, I won&#x27;t complain, this is a great little organizer for the cost!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these--they are a bargain for the price (~ $3 plus free shipping).</li>
            <li>The different colors available make it easy to use this to organize your makeup collection.</li>
            <li>It is a little smaller than it looks in the picture, but it fits my purse perfectly!</li>
            <li>I had a purse that I  liked real well but didn&#x27;t have any dividers inside, just one big space.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Also has snaps on the sides to take it in some if the main pocket isn&#x27;t completely full.</li>
            <li>It holds everything I might need in my purse and because of the side snaps it is useful in large and medium purses.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for &amp; arrived very fast.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the light weight of this organizer and all of the extra pockets including the large zippered pockets on each side.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as advertised/pictured and the zippered compartments are padded --</li>
            <li>Bought it to organize my purse, but it&#x27;s pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still pretty roomy.  </li>
            <li>This one was cheap, and it&#x27;s held up to everything I&#x27;ve put it through so far.</li>
            <li>It was under $4.00 and is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I love taking different handbags to work based on my outfits, but I despise having to fish stuff out of the bottom of my bags.</li>
            <li>It makes an awesome carry along to run in the store real quick as it is big enough for a few diapers and a thing of wipes!</li>
            <li>Now I can reach in and pull out exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to organize my purse.</li>
            <li>I love all the extra side pockets and zip pockets inside.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m pretty risk-averse.)  </li>
            <li>it helps keep the items upright so that I can see them more immediately when I open my bag.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>I have several handbangs and this makes changing out my bag a breeze :)</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This bag organizer was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I waited a bit longer than I would have liked, but it was still just what I expected.</li>
            <li>This makes a big purse much more efficient and easier to find things in.  </li>
            <li>I love it thought it would be bigger</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>bag, and my purse, and one for every female in my whole family!!!!</li>
            <li>Also, I purchased the bright blue but had I thought about it, I should&#x27;ve bought black since if this fits the purse properly, the blue is like a bright light from the inside of my purse.  </li>
            <li>My mom also asked one, it has reasonable price , very particle !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps there is better quality out there or it may not last forever, but I bought the blue for $4.99 and free shipping, now I want one for my doctors appts.</li>
            <li>Also helps make it easy to switch bags, just take out the insert and put into the next bag.</li>
            <li>I have it for a large bag that I got for christmas</li>
            <li>it is large, lots of pockets.</li>
            <li>nICE LITTLE BAG ORGANIZER</li>
            <li>.this comes in so handy for alot of things even just putting those little gadgets</li>
            <li>I measured my purse, and it was still a little bigger than I wanted, but would be a great stand alone makeup bag for travelling.</li>
            <li>recently took it on a trip w me, and it really helped me keep things together in my huge tote bag/purse.  </li>
            <li>Really, how can you beat the price?  </li>
            <li>Really irritated with having to make a trip to the post office to wait in line to sign for this thing.  </li>
            <li>--I don&#x27;t use a purse much anymore--and never worried that it would rip or give out.    </li>
            <li>Very we&#x27;ll constructed.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt really matter because its always in my purse, so it doesn&#x27;t go through much anyway.</li>
            <li>but it took a whole year too.</li>
            <li>This was shipped SO FAST</li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend, she really likes it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to dig around as much anymore to find what I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li>Not made very well.  </li>
            <li>I received it on time, it was better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>the entire width and height of the organizer - each of the 2 padded zippered pockets will fit a kindle fire with an otterbox rubber case on it, with room to spare&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made, fits in a purse and organizes it very well.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to change my purse which I do so often.</li>
            <li>Have been using it fora  few weeks and appears to be holding up nicely.</li>
            <li>Simple yet very useful, and tasteful the day one has to take it out (as emergency diaper changing kit, for example).</li>
            <li>However,I wanted something that I could put my Kindle Fire, Phone, and many other items into in my \\&quot;backyard</li>
            <li>I also can hear my music playing while it is in the middle no zip part, which is great because my kindle fire often over heats and shuts down when it is playing music outside, and sitting right out in the sun.  </li>
            <li>The main inside area is very roomy.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>middle pocket also has snaps at the top and bottom, on the outside on each end</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This item is not exactly like what I thought it would be, but it is amazing all the same!!  </li>
            <li>This appears to be the exact same product, and yes, I had to wait about a week and a half, but for the $3.35 and free shipping, totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li>This is my second bag, I gave the first one to my sister who loves it!</li>
            <li>I have not tried any of the other \\&quot;exactly the same but more costly\\&quot; items like this</li>
            <li>This has all the right size pockets, viewable for things I need to see and not viewable for my allergy medicine which should not be exposed to light, super thin and lightweight - but padded and so expandable, if you max it out you could take everything you would ever need within the height and width of it.</li>
            <li>I still bring my normal diaper bag</li>
            <li>Smaller then I hoped otherwise it seems worth the 3something I paid</li>
            <li>I feel it is quite a nice little bag and ideal for taking a little of this and a little of that, like when flying on an airplane and/or needing to conserve space but still have a little of everything still right at your finger</li>
            <li>I put my new iPad Air 2 into the zippered compartment and carried it around by the gray carrying handles</li>
            <li>,therefore i had to get me new ones...</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish was that one or two of the pockets used an elastic for the top edging so that if I had a really small thing in that particular pocket, it would help keep the pocket closed better.  </li>
            <li>Since it is so thin and light, someone who wants all that little stuff organized or just wants their electronics separated from other stuff without having to use a separate bag for each, this will work great and add no weight and no unnecessary bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was bigger and better made than expected.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a gift and was very surprised at the quality when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>It has small handles, top zippered compartments, side mesh compartments and plenty of pocket spaces.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I was initially disappointed with this bag because it was not usable for what I got it for, I am happy with my purchase because I now have a grab and go bag to keep on hand for the baby!</li>
            <li>They took a long time to come but worth the wait .</li>
            <li>It usually ends up turned sideways in my purse, but it does hold things better than  just having them floating around.  </li>
            <li>the little stuff that is easily visible,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the second time, I noticed it hours later and it wiped clean.</li>
            <li>Actually I love the concept to this bag, it is perfect for my couponing, but it is so poorly made, within the first day it started to fall apart:(</li>
            <li>It is large enough to hold a book or an 8&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>ITS BY FAR</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for ~1 month and no issues so far.  </li>
            <li>and It showed up like a week early</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the quality for the price.</li>
            <li>of the zippers had a tendency to stick, but a bar of soap fixed that.</li>
            <li>I really am more organized, at least my purse is.</li>
            <li>plastic zipper and does not stand up to frequent use.</li>
            <li>i recommend them for women who are to busy and don&#x27;t have time to change purses every time .....</li>
            <li>This is also the case if I cover the kindle with a towel or if it is in my beach bag - however, I need my towel for towel purposes and if the kindle is in my big bag, I cannot hear it, so this serves me much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be perfect, except that the mesh pockets broke in a day and the big outside seams (where the grey fabric meets the blue) are poorly sewn.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, really helps organize my tote-style bags that have little or no organization built in.</li>
            <li>it works good for my coupons and keep them organized it just does not exhibit or button in the middle that is not very handy if it gets dropped other than that it works for the purpose I intended it for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a nurse and have so many small items and larger to keep contained .</li>
            <li>Before, stuff was in little zipper pouches and although that looked super organized in my purse, it was tough to have to pull the right pouch out, have a free hand to open it without spilling it, and then dig in the pouch to get what I need.  </li>
            <li>this will be a nice little organizer, not sure if i want to use it in my purse or not.  </li>
            <li>Love the multiple pockets, but it does not stand upright in the purse, so it&#x27;s hard to put things back in.  </li>
            <li>You truly cannot beat the price and it does not feel like or perform like it is a poor quality item, its fabulous!</li>
            <li>I was pretty let down.</li>
            <li>2 large zipped pockets and one big center pocket.</li>
            <li>And really, for less than $5?  </li>

            <li> Really nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often have to switch bags; it&#x27;s just nice to have everything I need to take with me organized and in one place within whatever bag</li>
            <li> but I honestly don&#x27;t care because it does what I want</li>

            <li> coz the price was a deal, and now i have ordered 6 more coz every one in may family liked them</li>
            <li> I liked that it had handles, many others did not.  </li>
            <li> so I can find things easily -- these things help!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> I ordered three more.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Bulky with too many pockets for me</li>
            <li> I am also pleased to have gotten it in my favorite color.</li>
            <li> Its an okay quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy more for christmas presents</li>
            <li> I bought mine from another seller on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Love the color and the ease of taking this out of one purse to pop it into another.  </li>
            <li> but it has many more pockets which I like better.</li>
            <li> Love all the pockets and the two zippered compartments.</li>
            <li> Love them .</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more</li>

            <li> But the price was so affordable that I thought it&#x27;d be ok to try an order.  </li>
            <li> This item. :-)</li>
            <li> , just don&#x27;t know if i will be able to find things in the organizer when it is in my purse.</li>
            <li> I love the color as well.</li>
            <li> Lots of pockets :)</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> If I could learn to use it more, I think I would like it better.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I really love this organizer.  </li>
            <li> holds everything i need, and more.  </li>
            <li> it works for me, but then i dont carry much more on me on any given day.  </li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> Love it it is so.</li>
            <li> Just needs to be of better quality.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several purse inserts and this one is the best I have found.  </li>
            <li> It fit in my purse nicely and kept everything in it;&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li> When I received it, I immediately ordered two more.  </li>
            <li> I do like the handles but would love more rigid structure to it.</li>
            <li> so it expands the opening at the top and bottom</li>
            <li> I have tried so many \\&quot;bags\\&quot; in my beach bag</li>
            <li> absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> At first i wasn&#x27;t sure that they will be good and helpful</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> Everything has its own compartment and it is an awesome little organizer.</li>
            <li> Love the color, the contrast makes it easy to choose what you want.</li>
            <li> I can fit so many things in here that I&#x27;m able to use for school.</li>
            <li> Good product  works well for large purses, gives you a way to find stuff in your purse without dumping it out.</li>
            <li> This comestic bag is the perfect size for my large Miche bag, so handy, I finally can find everything that is in my purse.</li>
            <li> I cannot get the snaps on the sides to snap together but other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> The color makes things easy to find.</li>
            <li> Easily washable</li>
            <li> bag\\&quot;/\\&quot;beach bag\\&quot; that could be easily lifted out.</li>
            <li> but it has many pockets and the right sizes!</li>
            <li> I own and have gifted several of these handy organizers.  </li>
            <li> This is super helpful!  </li>
            <li> Very well made, I love it!</li>
            <li> These are cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> I use it in my purse and it really helps me keep everything tidy.</li>
            <li> I can fit a lot of things in this nifty organizer and because I&#x27;m a handbag freak</li>
            <li> Cheaply made</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t measure this bag before purchasing because I &amp;#34;eyed&amp;#34; it and thought it&#x27;d fit.  </li>
            <li> It will fit in my purse</li>
            <li> It has lots of pockets and expands to fit whatever purse/bag you need to use it in.</li>
            <li> It is light, so</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t ad a lot of weight to your bag, which is important for me.</li>
            <li> I bought the blue one and it works great for transferring items from purse to purse.</li>
            <li> Poorly made however great idea, could use more pockets zippers compartments, if you want a good one go to QVC</li>
            <li> I ordered one, not being so sure it would be something useful.  </li>
            <li> mesh pockets are 2 lightly padded \\&quot;parachute pockets, 3x3.5w&lt;</li>
            <li> cheaply made, didnt work for my purposes</li>
            <li> First time ever it is easy to change bags!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for any traveler since it is ideal to hold travel sized items and most, if not all, of the personal care necessities you would take on a trip.</li>
            <li> It is very useful</li>
            <li> When changing purses just remove with handles make it super easy.</li>
            <li> Super simple, great quality, and I recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Awesome organizer, since most purses have few compartments this is very helpful.</li>
            <li> but it was worth the wait!</li>
            <li> specially moms who have kids like me</li>
            <li> I packed 2 of these full of things for hostess gifts for my SIL and MIL for doing my baby shower.</li>
            <li> This was much nicer than many others I&#x27;d seen.  </li>
            <li> Great bag to store diapers, wipes and other stuff for baby.</li>
            <li> This makes for the perfect organizer because I have a big bag I take outside</li>
            <li> Love it - still holding up after a year of use - highly recomend</li>
            <li> but I have used it for a week and already it got something on it twice and wiped clean - once right away,</li>
            <li> The price is ridiculously cheap and the product seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I like the color, makes it easy to find in a large purse.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient and easy to take it out in my bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It has nice smooth lines, it snaps to a smaller size if you need less space, as well as being able to be full size or even 1/2 size!!  </li>
            <li> I just love these, it holds all kinds of goodies, i can easily throw into a bigger bag and still not have to hunt to find it.</li>
            <li> Very nice exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these... quick and easy for trunk to, for wanting but not on you, meds, tablets, camera, etc...</li>
            <li> ITS WORTH</li>
            <li> Also extremely handy for travel if you don&#x27;t want to carry a big handbag along with luggage.</li>
            <li> Just tuck this in a carryon and you are golden.</li>
            <li> So worth it.</li>
            <li> what can you get for $3.50 that is worth even $3.50?  </li>
            <li> It was well made and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Really useful for organizing my bag.  </li>
            <li> Convenient  for me to use put my cell phone and other stuff in there good.</li>
            <li> When they say shipping ETA is 25 days that&#x27;s about right.  </li>
            <li> But, I won&#x27;t complain, this is a great little organizer for the cost!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these--they are a bargain for the price (~ $3 plus free shipping).</li>
            <li> The different colors available make it easy to use this to organize your makeup collection.</li>
            <li> It is a little smaller than it looks in the picture, but it fits my purse perfectly!</li>
            <li> I had a purse that I  liked real well but didn&#x27;t have any dividers inside, just one big space.</li>
            <li> and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Also has snaps on the sides to take it in some if the main pocket isn&#x27;t completely full.</li>
            <li> It holds everything I might need in my purse and because of the side snaps it is useful in large and medium purses.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for &amp; arrived very fast.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the light weight of this organizer and all of the extra pockets including the large zippered pockets on each side.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly as advertised/pictured and the zippered compartments are padded --</li>
            <li> Bought it to organize my purse, but it&#x27;s pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still pretty roomy.  </li>
            <li> This one was cheap, and it&#x27;s held up to everything I&#x27;ve put it through so far.</li>
            <li> It was under $4.00 and is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I love taking different handbags to work based on my outfits, but I despise having to fish stuff out of the bottom of my bags.</li>
            <li> It makes an awesome carry along to run in the store real quick as it is big enough for a few diapers and a thing of wipes!</li>
            <li> Now I can reach in and pull out exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to organize my purse.</li>
            <li> I love all the extra side pockets and zip pockets inside.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m pretty risk-averse.)  </li>
            <li> it helps keep the items upright so that I can see them more immediately when I open my bag.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> I have several handbangs and this makes changing out my bag a breeze :)</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This bag organizer was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I waited a bit longer than I would have liked, but it was still just what I expected.</li>
            <li> This makes a big purse much more efficient and easier to find things in.  </li>
            <li> I love it thought it would be bigger</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> bag, and my purse, and one for every female in my whole family!!!!</li>
            <li> Also, I purchased the bright blue but had I thought about it, I should&#x27;ve bought black since if this fits the purse properly, the blue is like a bright light from the inside of my purse.  </li>
            <li> My mom also asked one, it has reasonable price , very particle !</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps there is better quality out there or it may not last forever, but I bought the blue for $4.99 and free shipping, now I want one for my doctors appts.</li>
            <li> Also helps make it easy to switch bags, just take out the insert and put into the next bag.</li>
            <li> I have it for a large bag that I got for christmas</li>
            <li> it is large, lots of pockets.</li>
            <li> nICE LITTLE BAG ORGANIZER</li>
            <li> .this comes in so handy for alot of things even just putting those little gadgets</li>
            <li> I measured my purse, and it was still a little bigger than I wanted, but would be a great stand alone makeup bag for travelling.</li>
            <li> recently took it on a trip w me, and it really helped me keep things together in my huge tote bag/purse.  </li>
            <li> Really, how can you beat the price?  </li>
            <li> Really irritated with having to make a trip to the post office to wait in line to sign for this thing.  </li>
            <li> --I don&#x27;t use a purse much anymore--and never worried that it would rip or give out.    </li>
            <li> Very we&#x27;ll constructed.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt really matter because its always in my purse, so it doesn&#x27;t go through much anyway.</li>
            <li> but it took a whole year too.</li>
            <li> This was shipped SO FAST</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend, she really likes it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to dig around as much anymore to find what I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li> Not made very well.  </li>
            <li> I received it on time, it was better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> the entire width and height of the organizer - each of the 2 padded zippered pockets will fit a kindle fire with an otterbox rubber case on it, with room to spare&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, fits in a purse and organizes it very well.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to change my purse which I do so often.</li>
            <li> Have been using it fora  few weeks and appears to be holding up nicely.</li>
            <li> Simple yet very useful, and tasteful the day one has to take it out (as emergency diaper changing kit, for example).</li>
            <li> However,I wanted something that I could put my Kindle Fire, Phone, and many other items into in my \\&quot;backyard</li>
            <li> I also can hear my music playing while it is in the middle no zip part, which is great because my kindle fire often over heats and shuts down when it is playing music outside, and sitting right out in the sun.  </li>
            <li> The main inside area is very roomy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> middle pocket also has snaps at the top and bottom, on the outside on each end</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This item is not exactly like what I thought it would be, but it is amazing all the same!!  </li>
            <li> This appears to be the exact same product, and yes, I had to wait about a week and a half, but for the $3.35 and free shipping, totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This is my second bag, I gave the first one to my sister who loves it!</li>
            <li> I have not tried any of the other \\&quot;exactly the same but more costly\\&quot; items like this</li>
            <li> This has all the right size pockets, viewable for things I need to see and not viewable for my allergy medicine which should not be exposed to light, super thin and lightweight - but padded and so expandable, if you max it out you could take everything you would ever need within the height and width of it.</li>
            <li> I still bring my normal diaper bag</li>
            <li> Smaller then I hoped otherwise it seems worth the 3something I paid</li>
            <li> I feel it is quite a nice little bag and ideal for taking a little of this and a little of that, like when flying on an airplane and/or needing to conserve space but still have a little of everything still right at your finger</li>
            <li> I put my new iPad Air 2 into the zippered compartment and carried it around by the gray carrying handles</li>
            <li> ,therefore i had to get me new ones...</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was that one or two of the pockets used an elastic for the top edging so that if I had a really small thing in that particular pocket, it would help keep the pocket closed better.  </li>
            <li> Since it is so thin and light, someone who wants all that little stuff organized or just wants their electronics separated from other stuff without having to use a separate bag for each, this will work great and add no weight and no unnecessary bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was bigger and better made than expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift and was very surprised at the quality when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> It has small handles, top zippered compartments, side mesh compartments and plenty of pocket spaces.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I was initially disappointed with this bag because it was not usable for what I got it for, I am happy with my purchase because I now have a grab and go bag to keep on hand for the baby!</li>
            <li> They took a long time to come but worth the wait .</li>
            <li> It usually ends up turned sideways in my purse, but it does hold things better than  just having them floating around.  </li>
            <li> the little stuff that is easily visible,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the second time, I noticed it hours later and it wiped clean.</li>
            <li> Actually I love the concept to this bag, it is perfect for my couponing, but it is so poorly made, within the first day it started to fall apart:(</li>
            <li> It is large enough to hold a book or an 8&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> ITS BY FAR</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for ~1 month and no issues so far.  </li>
            <li> and It showed up like a week early</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> of the zippers had a tendency to stick, but a bar of soap fixed that.</li>
            <li> I really am more organized, at least my purse is.</li>
            <li> plastic zipper and does not stand up to frequent use.</li>
            <li> i recommend them for women who are to busy and don&#x27;t have time to change purses every time .....</li>
            <li> This is also the case if I cover the kindle with a towel or if it is in my beach bag - however, I need my towel for towel purposes and if the kindle is in my big bag, I cannot hear it, so this serves me much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be perfect, except that the mesh pockets broke in a day and the big outside seams (where the grey fabric meets the blue) are poorly sewn.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, really helps organize my tote-style bags that have little or no organization built in.</li>
            <li> it works good for my coupons and keep them organized it just does not exhibit or button in the middle that is not very handy if it gets dropped other than that it works for the purpose I intended it for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse and have so many small items and larger to keep contained .</li>
            <li> Before, stuff was in little zipper pouches and although that looked super organized in my purse, it was tough to have to pull the right pouch out, have a free hand to open it without spilling it, and then dig in the pouch to get what I need.  </li>
            <li> this will be a nice little organizer, not sure if i want to use it in my purse or not.  </li>
            <li> Love the multiple pockets, but it does not stand upright in the purse, so it&#x27;s hard to put things back in.  </li>
            <li> You truly cannot beat the price and it does not feel like or perform like it is a poor quality item, its fabulous!</li>
            <li> I was pretty let down.</li>
            <li> 2 large zipped pockets and one big center pocket.</li>
            <li> And really, for less than $5?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handy, and adjusts to the size of my purse, but a plastic snap was broken when I got it and the mesh pockets are already coming unstitched after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> outside net pockets are small, but that is to help keep things secure, but it is not to say that they are too small to be used for things like make up, cell phone, snacks, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so minus 1 star for that and the super slow shipping from China.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to use one of the ones I got to make a travel toiletry bag for my small children; that way they will have a ready packed bag with tooth brush, tooth paste, dental floss, etc., etc.,</li>
            <li> I typically carry a small purse though and with this you need a slightly bigger purse than what would typically hold the items that fit in the organizer</li>
            <li> The shipping takes a little while but Amazon does let you know before you complete your purchase.</li>
            <li> As an OCD type person, this is what I had been wanting for a long time.  </li>
            <li> smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Received earlier than expected, product received as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Sipping took a long time.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> such that r just laying around ur house with no real place to put them but know one day youll use this stuff</li>
            <li> Unsnapped - it opens the middle pocket to around 2 inches wide without hampering the 2 padded pockets on the&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> With this item (which is extremely roomy given its size) everything that I carry on a daily basis can be tucked in and just lifted out when switching bags.</li>
            <li> color was a big plus, and it arrived before it was due.</li>
            <li> but I am amazed that it fits everything I would put in my beach bag, except maybe a hat, towel and other bigger things.  </li>
            <li> but these are very, very minor findings to me.  </li>
            <li> I have five babies just in case one wears out this one I used from last year and a half and</li>
            <li> It is just slightly too big.  </li>
            <li> After contemplating what to do with this little bag, I finally figured it out!</li>
            <li> I bought a purse that is just a little bigger than this organizer.  </li>
            <li> This little organizer has several pockets so that I can neatly have a place for each thing or category of things and</li>
            <li> I just wish it could be a little bigger 😊</li>
            <li> , it has soooo many options, you just can NOT go wrong with this little bag!!  </li>
            <li> the cute thing about it is i can just take it out and place it in any bad of my choice</li>
            <li> I purchased a blue and a green one.</li>
            <li> Blue: received this 3 weeks ahead of schedule well-packaged from \\&quot;SMARTSHOPONLINE\\&quot;     Green:</li>
            <li> This bag arrived faster then expected.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have pink</li>
            <li> Not much use for a bag this size.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and a lot smaller than the seller specified.</li>
            <li> not the quality I expected.  </li>
            <li> Holds tons of stuff &amp; came 2 weeks before expected.</li>
            <li> I can put a few books in the middle space so they don&#x27;t get crunched.</li>
            <li> I cannot explain why it needed to be parachute material because really, it never goes to the beach, just the yard</li>
            <li> Even it came a few days later than my expected.</li>
            <li> My supplies are different sizes, some sharp, some messy.</li>
            <li> extremely well made.</li>
            <li> Other places sell for upwards of $20.</li>
            <li> So NO MORE big bulky diaper bag to go get groceries!</li>
            <li> A button snapped off the day I got it, without me doing anything other than look at it.</li>
            <li> I use one for toiletries and the other for electronics.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This will also work well for other family members who \\&quot;travel light\\&quot; but want organization without additional bulk.</li>
            <li> Black or a dark color would have been a little less obvious.  </li>
            <li> It is softer than the previous one I had</li>
            <li> I wanted something made with water proof outside material, a little protection (I have an otterbox on the kindle, so it did not need excessive padding), lightweight, lots of pockets with visible and non-visible items, small pockets for lip screen or nail file, hair clips etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ends the mess in my summer straw handbags.  </li>
            <li> but if I am stopping to run in a store I just bring this little bag in with me, it leaves me ample room to get all my groceries or whatever else</li>
            <li> Lots of pockets for organizing all the little things.</li>
            <li> This is a grest little insert for a purse</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has everything needed to organize all the little stuff that gets lost in a beach bag,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep this little bag in my car with a few diapers and a pack of wipes, a pen or two and a paci, when I go out</li>
            <li> The construction could be improved -- a couple threads were hanging a little longer than they probably should have and the inside of one of the zippered pouches is missing some fabric over one bottom corner --</li>
            <li> Waste of money-</li>
            <li> If you have never had a purse organizer you don&#x27;t know what you are missing.</li>
            <li> I have a few briefcast/laptop type bags/purses</li>
            <li> but my little things are never handy</li>
            <li> I use mine to hold cosmetics, toiletries, and small electronic accessories.  </li>
            <li> no more rummaging through the purse to find what I need.</li>
            <li> No the compartments on the sides are too small.</li>
            <li> Holds loads of stuff and no more running off the road looking for lip-balm in my purse.....</li>
            <li> and sometimes I end up stuffing them in my camera bag in the beach bag, the problem is, it is not safe for my camera to have a bunch of stuff rubbing against it, the lens, the view screen, etc.</li>
            <li> size was to small and it was flimsy.</li>
            <li> 4 mesh pockets - basically the 2 mesh pockets from the front side with a stitch down the middle of each, cutting them in half&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> but they all end being a bunch of stuff in a mess in a bag, in my bag if you know what I mean!  </li>
            <li> It is ridiculous, I don&#x27;t usually put those things in all at once</li>
            <li> Allow at least one month for shipping.</li>
            <li> I wonder if someone out there have any idea where I can get one at least 35cm?</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s well designed but badly manufactured.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get of course, quality poor, flimsy.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be of poor quality, etc.</li>
            <li> Just like all the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> Though it is not what I had intended, I have chosen to rate the product on what it is, NOT what I thought it was going to be like; that would truly be unfair to the product and/or</li>
            <li> I was just very disappointed that it was small!!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an organizer for a while now, but they are all either too expensive or just downright awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> extremely well made. I put mine in my tote for work to carry all of my condiments for my lunches and extra deodorant, medications and things I may need. Everything has its own compartment and it is an awesome little organizer. It was bigger and better made than expected. I ordered three more.</li>
            <li> I own and have gifted several of these handy organizers.  My aunt keeps her Kindle Fire and accessories in one.  I use mine to hold cosmetics, toiletries, and small electronic accessories.  It has small handles, top zippered compartments, side mesh compartments and plenty of pocket spaces. Best of all it easily wipes clean. I highly recommend this for any traveler since it is ideal to hold travel sized items and most, if not all, of the personal care necessities you would take on a trip. This handy organizer can be purchased in a variety of colors, but note that price may vary by color.</li>
            <li> Love it. I do wish there were support pieces in the side so it doesn&#x27;t slouch but it still works great.</li>
            <li> Handles tear after a short period of time</li>
            <li> Really, how can you beat the price?  It&#x27;s perfect for my purse and helps keep everything organized.  But it comes from overseas.  And it takes a while.  And God forbid you&#x27;re not home when the mailman comes by bc it has to be signed for.  Really irritated with having to make a trip to the post office to wait in line to sign for this thing.  When they say shipping ETA is 25 days that&#x27;s about right.  So, the product gets 5 stars.  The shipping would get zero starts if that were an option.</li>
            <li> Love it - still holding up after a year of use - highly recomend</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY SECOND PURCHASE OF THIS COSMETIC BAG, WHICH I STORE IN THE BATHROOM CABINET WITH MAKEUP THATS TOO BIG TO CARRY IN MY PURSE. I ALSO PUT THE POWDER BRUSHES IN IT. ITS BY FAR THE BEST COSMETIC BAG IVE EVER HAD. THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPARTMENTS, YET ITS SIMPLE DESIGN ALLOWS YOU TO FIND THINGS LIKE LINER AND LIPSTICK IN A SNAP. IT DID TAKE A WHILE TO GET HERE BUT CONSIDERING THE QUALITY ITS WORTH THE WAIT!</li>
            <li> As an OCD type person, this is what I had been wanting for a long time.  The price is ridiculously cheap and the product seems to work pretty well.  I&#x27;ve been using it for ~1 month and no issues so far.  I typically carry a small purse though and with this you need a slightly bigger purse than what would typically hold the items that fit in the organizer so minus 1 star for that and the super slow shipping from China.  Also, I purchased the bright blue but had I thought about it, I should&#x27;ve bought black since if this fits the purse properly, the blue is like a bright light from the inside of my purse.  Black or a dark color would have been a little less obvious.  For reference, shipping took about 3 weeks for me.</li>
            <li> I guess u get what u pay for. These are cheap for a reason. Came with a hole were the seam/stitching is at the bottom.  Waste of money-</li>
            <li> I change my purse at times and like that all these pockets keep everything organized. The color makes things easy to find.</li>
            <li> smaller than expected</li>
            <li> I purchased a blue and a green one. Amazon will only let you rate an item once.    It is exactly as advertised/pictured and the zippered compartments are padded -- bonus! It&#x27;s of good quality, well-made, and the correct size.     I put my new iPad Air 2 into the zippered compartment and carried it around by the gray carrying handles--I don&#x27;t use a purse much anymore--and never worried that it would rip or give out.    Blue: received this 3 weeks ahead of schedule well-packaged from \\&quot;SMARTSHOPONLINE\\&quot;     Green: received this 2 weeks ahead of schedule well-packaged from \\&quot;HAPPYSHOPPING2014\\&quot;    I think who you buy it from makes all the difference. I highly recommend these--they are a bargain for the price (~ $3 plus free shipping).</li>
            <li> Gives you extra pockets in your purse.. I love it! I would definitely recommend this!! You can&#x27;t beat the price! Good quality.</li>
            <li> I had a purse that I  liked real well but didn&#x27;t have any dividers inside, just one big space. This worked perfect. I like to separate things in my purse so I can find them easier. This worked .</li>
            <li> I got this to help organize the clutter in my handbag/diaper bag. You won&#x27;t find anything better for the price! I&#x27;ll keep buying these to keep me organized around the house too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift and was very surprised at the quality when it arrived.  I figured at the price it wouldn&#x27;t be much, but it is excellent!  Will be purchasing one for myself now as well!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit in my purse!</li>
            <li> Bought it to organize my purse, but it&#x27;s pretty flimsy. Doesn&#x27;t stand up well at all. It now is not in use at all.</li>
            <li> Very we&#x27;ll constructed. What a great bargain for the price. I have seen this organizer advertised at $19 and couldn&#x27;t believe it cost me well under $5. I bought 3 for stocking stuffers and for my self. If you have never had a purse organizer you don&#x27;t know what you are missing. Best purse insert that makes it so easy to find things in the bottom of your purse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handy, and adjusts to the size of my purse, but a plastic snap was broken when I got it and the mesh pockets are already coming unstitched after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price! Other places sell for upwards of $20. This appears to be the exact same product, and yes, I had to wait about a week and a half, but for the $3.35 and free shipping, totally worth the wait. Exactly as described, really helps organize my tote-style bags that have little or no organization built in. Also helps make it easy to switch bags, just take out the insert and put into the next bag.</li>
            <li> I use it in my purse and it really helps me keep everything tidy. Everything has a home now in my purse now!!</li>
            <li> Bulky with too many pockets for me so I gave it away.</li>
            <li> This bag arrived faster then expected. It works as a makeup bag or organizer. This bag is smaller then I anticipated but it&#x27;s still pretty roomy.  The different colors available make it easy to use this to organize your makeup collection.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the handbag organizer. It is made of quality material and is wonderful for quickly changing out handbags.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this product! I have been looking for an organizer for a while now, but they are all either too expensive or just downright awful. This one was cheap, and it&#x27;s held up to everything I&#x27;ve put it through so far. I am also pleased to have gotten it in my favorite color.</li>
            <li> It is very useful and I like it very much. Even it came a few days later than my expected.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It organizes EVERYTHING! Its an okay quality but it doesnt really matter because its always in my purse, so it doesn&#x27;t go through much anyway. I can fit a lot of things in this nifty organizer and because I&#x27;m a handbag freak, I change my purse on a daily basis and this makes my life easier! no more rummaging through the purse to find what I need. Everything is where I put it, and it looks AWESOME! I&#x27;m going to buy more for christmas presents</li>
            <li> I bought mine from another seller on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. It was under $4.00 and is exactly as pictured. I love taking different handbags to work based on my outfits, but I despise having to fish stuff out of the bottom of my bags. Problem solved! With this item (which is extremely roomy given its size) everything that I carry on a daily basis can be tucked in and just lifted out when switching bags. Also extremely handy for travel if you don&#x27;t want to carry a big handbag along with luggage. Just tuck this in a carryon and you are golden. Wonderful buy I am so happy that I got it.</li>
            <li> I have five babies just in case one wears out this one I used from last year and a half and the only thing that happened is the mesh pocket in the front ripped but it took a whole year too. It is lots of compartments in storage perfect for anything</li>
            <li> Good product  works well for large purses, gives you a way to find stuff in your purse without dumping it out.</li>
            <li> This is really handy to have.</li>
            <li> I can fit so many things in here that I&#x27;m able to use for school. Pencils, pens, markers, index cards, scissors, and everything I need. Lovely bag!</li>
            <li> It is a rectangle. Has one sided snaps on it but no way to actually fasten it into your handbag.</li>
            <li> Love the color and the ease of taking this out of one purse to pop it into another.  Great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> After purchased it for wife and sisters. My mom also asked one, it has reasonable price , very particle !</li>
            <li> It is softer than the previous one I had but it has many more pockets which I like better. This makes changing purses a snap</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get of course, quality poor, flimsy. You get what you pay for. Stuff kept falling out of it.</li>
            <li> No the compartments on the sides are too small.</li>
            <li> So, I will say when I got this product I was pretty let down. From the pictures I assumed that it would be big enough to hold my coupon binder, that was a mistake. I should have read through the reviews, and the sizes listed in the product information, and I didn&#x27;t that was my mistake. After contemplating what to do with this little bag, I finally figured it out! It makes an awesome carry along to run in the store real quick as it is big enough for a few diapers and a thing of wipes! So NO MORE big bulky diaper bag to go get groceries! I keep this little bag in my car with a few diapers and a pack of wipes, a pen or two and a paci, when I go out I still bring my normal diaper bag but if I am stopping to run in a store I just bring this little bag in with me, it leaves me ample room to get all my groceries or whatever else I may be getting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I was initially disappointed with this bag because it was not usable for what I got it for, I am happy with my purchase because I now have a grab and go bag to keep on hand for the baby!</li>
            <li> This is just about the best thing I have ever bought for myself.  I bought a purse that is just a little bigger than this organizer.  Now I can reach in and pull out exactly what I need.  Before, stuff was in little zipper pouches and although that looked super organized in my purse, it was tough to have to pull the right pouch out, have a free hand to open it without spilling it, and then dig in the pouch to get what I need.  This insert organizer is just grab-and-go.  Super simple, great quality, and I recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to organize my purse. Now I wont have to dig for things everything has a place with all of the pockets this insert has!!! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this tote! Fits perfect inside a purse. Holds a good amount of items and the Zippers work great too.</li>
            <li> great for the price, but nothing to attach it to a purse, so it falls out.</li>
            <li> Smaller then I hoped otherwise it seems worth the 3something I paid and It showed up like a week early</li>
            <li> Great for keeping my work items organized in my bag. I&#x27;m a nurse and have so many small items and larger to keep contained .</li>
            <li> it works good for my coupons and keep them organized it just does not exhibit or button in the middle that is not very handy if it gets dropped other than that it works for the purpose I intended it for</li>
            <li> Awesome organizer, since most purses have few compartments this is very helpful. When changing purses just remove with handles make it super easy. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Fits in my purse perfectly! Helps keep everything organized and I am no longer constantly searching for something in the bottom of the deep hole (my purse).</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the quality for the price. It holds everything I might need in my purse and because of the side snaps it is useful in large and medium purses. Really nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the last few bags I bought are on the big side with very roomy interiors. This allows me to organize my things in the pockets without them laying in the bottom of the bag. I don&#x27;t have to dig through my bag to find items. When I want to change bags, I just lift it out of one bag by the handles, and put it in another.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Love all the pockets and the two zippered compartments. First time ever it is easy to change bags!</li>
            <li> Great to keep purse organized....</li>
            <li> Ends the mess in my summer straw handbags.  Love the color, the contrast makes it easy to choose what you want.</li>
            <li> They took a long time to come but worth the wait . Love them . I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I am a cardmaker so I have lots of supplies that I carry from one location to another. My supplies are different sizes, some sharp, some messy. This bag is great for organizer those supplies in my tote bag and when I get to my destination, I pull the bag out and have all of my supplies in an organized manner. The bag stands up, too!</li>
            <li> I constantly switch out purses, depending on my outfit - you have to if you are into fashion like myself... I keep all my necessities packed and organized all the time! Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Very nice exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend of mine and she just loves it.  Great amount of pockets.  Also has snaps on the sides to take it in some if the main pocket isn&#x27;t completely full.</li>
            <li> This item is lightweight and holds what I need.</li>
            <li> Just like all the expensive ones. I measured my purse, and it was still a little bigger than I wanted, but would be a great stand alone makeup bag for travelling. Allow at least one month for shipping.</li>
            <li> This was shipped SO FAST I Could not believe it!  It&#x27;s not fancy, but it does the job, and I&#x27;m so happy to not be digging around in the bottom of an abyss for my purse items anymore.  And really, for less than $5?  Yes, Please!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend, she really likes it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very, very happy with this handbag organizer. I don&#x27;t often have to switch bags; it&#x27;s just nice to have everything I need to take with me organized and in one place within whatever bag I&#x27;m carrying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the zippers had a tendency to stick, but a bar of soap fixed that. (The zips are plastic, but for this price, what did you expect?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was a big plus, and it arrived before it was due.</li>
            <li> This makes switching purses a snap. It&#x27;s convenient and not too bulky. I love all the extra side pockets and zip pockets inside. The main inside area is very roomy.</li>
            <li> I can perfectly organize my purse with this. A button snapped off the day I got it, without me doing anything other than look at it. Cheaply made but I honestly don&#x27;t care because it does what I want and I didn&#x27;t pay much for it! :D</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t measure this bag before purchasing because I &amp;#34;eyed&amp;#34; it and thought it&#x27;d fit.  It is just slightly too big.  However, I see tons of potential with this bag and am choosing to keep it for when I buy my tote bag for the next season.  It will definitely fit and be used!  For the cost, the design works well.  I like that it has handles to make it easier to pull out of a bag and carry it to the next purse.  I am even envisioning using it in my car&#x27;s storage basket that I keep between the two front seats.  For the price, this is a no brainer to purchase simply to try it out.  The only thing I wish was that one or two of the pockets used an elastic for the top edging so that if I had a really small thing in that particular pocket, it would help keep the pocket closed better.  But, I won&#x27;t complain, this is a great little organizer for the cost!</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, I had my doubts.  But the price was so affordable that I thought it&#x27;d be ok to try an order.  (I&#x27;m pretty risk-averse.)  This little organizer has several pockets so that I can neatly have a place for each thing or category of things and it helps keep the items upright so that I can see them more immediately when I open my bag.  I don&#x27;t have to dig around as much anymore to find what I&#x27;m looking for.  The construction could be improved -- a couple threads were hanging a little longer than they probably should have and the inside of one of the zippered pouches is missing some fabric over one bottom corner -- but these are very, very minor findings to me.  I was looking for an organizer for my bag and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> loved it omyg it keeps my purse organize and the cute thing about it is i can just take it out and place it in any bad of my choice wonderful love it nd recommend it to anyone gift or for your self...</li>
            <li> Received earlier than expected, product received as shown in the picture. It&#x27;ll be great for separating items in my backpack and keeping things uncluttered.</li>
            <li> i got it to put in my coupon bag to hold my cell wallet etc and its great very cute lots of pockets would order more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a filing cabinet in your purse.  Great.</li>
            <li> I packed 2 of these full of things for hostess gifts for my SIL and MIL for doing my baby shower. They both still have them in every bag they carry.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  Not what I expected.  I will never use it.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is my second bag, I gave the first one to my sister who loves it! It does the job well. I would buy me another one if I needed one.</li>
            <li> Very handy and a great bargain!</li>
            <li> My husband ordered  this for me and I use it for my coupon holder.It is big enough for what you need plenty of room for.I have pink and I ordered a blue one..So worth it.I use my coupons a lot and I take this with me to the store..Amazon is awesome to buy products that the store does not have.</li>
            <li> I just love these, it holds all kinds of goodies, i can easily throw into a bigger bag and still not have to hunt to find it. I bought several of these in different colors... Highly recommend these... quick and easy for trunk to, for wanting but not on you, meds, tablets, camera, etc...</li>
            <li> I thought it would be of poor quality, etc. for the money.  To my surprise it is very nice.  Holds loads of stuff and no more running off the road looking for lip-balm in my purse.....what can you get for $3.50 that is worth even $3.50?  This item. :-)</li>
            <li> this will be a nice little organizer, not sure if i want to use it in my purse or not.  It will fit in my purse, just don&#x27;t know if i will be able to find things in the organizer when it is in my purse.</li>
            <li> Unorganized girls BFF</li>
            <li> This is awesome! I can organize almost any purse with this and not have to dig for things! The shipping takes a little while but Amazon does let you know before you complete your purchase. I am thinking about ordering one for the diaper bag.</li>
            <li> for the price, it is a good deal. Sipping took a long time.</li>
            <li> This is super helpful!  I have several handbangs and this makes changing out my bag a breeze :)</li>
            <li> i love the insert!!! I was just very disappointed that it was small!!! I have it for a large bag that I got for christmas I wonder if someone out there have any idea where I can get one at least 35cm? I am gonna keep this one because I love it! it holds my 10.1 inch tablet, with or without the case!&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. I really am more organized, at least my purse is. Have been using it fora  few weeks and appears to be holding up nicely.</li>
            <li> Will serve it&#x27;s purpose.  You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> The picture is misleading and makes it seem like the bag is bigger. Not much use for a bag this size.</li>
            <li> This is a handy organizer and I purchased it at a very good price. There were no issues with the delivery.</li>
            <li> It came fast and it was perfect. Now my purse will be organized.</li>
            <li> This organizer is the best one I have ever seen. It has lots of pockets and expands to fit whatever purse/bag you need to use it in. It snaps back into a smaller size when necessary as well. It is light, so it doesn&#x27;t ad a lot of weight to your bag, which is important for me. I love the color as well. It is large enough to hold a book or an 8&amp;#34; tablet. Great deal and great product.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, thank you</li>
            <li> This bag organizer was exactly what I wanted. I waited a bit longer than I would have liked, but it was still just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the light weight of this organizer and all of the extra pockets including the large zippered pockets on each side.  Great price!</li>
            <li> not same item as pictured. Waste of money and a lot smaller than the seller specified. Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> Very cute! Lots of pockets :)</li>
            <li> nICE LITTLE BAG ORGANIZER</li>
            <li> This comestic bag is the perfect size for my large Miche bag, so handy, I finally can find everything that is in my purse.</li>
            <li> Not made very well.  not the quality I expected.  Too costly to return.  plastic zipper and does not stand up to frequent use.</li>
            <li> I love it! Just what i wanted! Took a while to get here but it was worth the wait! Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to!  I have a few briefcast/laptop type bags/purses and though I like them, they sometimes lack all the nooks and crannies so I can find things easily -- these things help!</li>
            <li> I love this it has so many pockets and it fits in my purse perfectly.</li>
            <li> If I could learn to use it more, I think I would like it better. It was well made and worth the cost. It was a good color and had a good feel to it. It has plenty of pockets and zippers!</li>
            <li> It would be perfect, except that the mesh pockets broke in a day and the big outside seams (where the grey fabric meets the blue) are poorly sewn. It&#x27;s a shame, because it fits my purses well and keeps everything organized. Overall it&#x27;s well designed but badly manufactured.</li>
            <li> Nice bags, neat to just pull out and change purses.</li>
            <li> This item is not exactly like what I thought it would be, but it is amazing all the same!!  Though it is not what I had intended, I have chosen to rate the product on what it is, NOT what I thought it was going to be like; that would truly be unfair to the product and/or the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It has nice smooth lines, it snaps to a smaller size if you need less space, as well as being able to be full size or even 1/2 size!!  -The outside net pockets are small, but that is to help keep things secure, but it is not to say that they are too small to be used for things like make up, cell phone, snacks, etc.&lt;br /&gt;-Overall I feel it is quite a nice little bag and ideal for taking a little of this and a little of that, like when flying on an airplane and/or needing to conserve space but still have a little of everything still right at your finger tips!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to use one of the ones I got to make a travel toiletry bag for my small children; that way they will have a ready packed bag with tooth brush, tooth paste, dental floss, etc., etc., etc., just as I do; hopefully we will not get to our next destination without having the need to run out and buy something we have forgotten---&amp;#62; Hopefully :~}  !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this as a great product idea, it has soooo many options, you just can NOT go wrong with this little bag!!  For men or for women!!</li>
            <li> I love this!! I do wish the very top had a latch or closing but it has many pockets and the right sizes! Easily washable and I would love to have another one!!</li>
            <li> Works great  needed this to keep everything at an instant reach and organized,  This is wonderful.  Wasn&#x27;t cure if this would work for me or not but it&#x27;s brilliant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great I&#x27;ve had it for a year now and I love it I just wish it could be a little bigger 😊</li>
            <li> Excellent device for people that changes purses continuously, super handy, bought two one for me and one for my mom and we are happy!</li>
            <li> At first i wasn&#x27;t sure that they will be good and helpful but i got three of them coz the price was a deal, and now i have ordered 6 more coz every one in may family liked them and they took mine,therefore i had to get me new ones...i recommend them for women who are to busy and don&#x27;t have time to change purses every time .....specially moms who have kids like me</li>
            <li> I really love this organizer.  It has tons of pockets for different thing.  Now I don&#x27;t have to carry tons of different bags.  Its all in one.  I wish I got this earlier.</li>
            <li> holds everything i need, and more.  my ipad fits in this!  my Samsung Galaxy S4 even fits in the outside pocket!  recently took it on a trip w me, and it really helped me keep things together in my huge tote bag/purse.  held things on one place, did its job.  sure the zipper sticks, but i wouldnt call this thing useless bc of it.  i actually forgot i even stuffed some things in the zippered pocket!  it works for me, but then i dont carry much more on me on any given day.  worked for me when i traveled, so i&#x27;d say great buy.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I like the color, makes it easy to find in a large purse. Lots of pockets for organizing all the little things.</li>
            <li> Really useful for organizing my bag.  I bought extras for gifts and they have been well received.  Love love love</li>
            <li> Love it!  My purse is no longer a mess.&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for my daughter for her diaper bag.  Great product. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it it is so. Convenient  for me to use put my cell phone and other stuff in there good.</li>
            <li> Actually I love the concept to this bag, it is perfect for my couponing, but it is so poorly made, within the first day it started to fall apart:(</li>
            <li> Very handy organizer. I can organize my items and this has been &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; when I want to switch purses. All my friends want to know where I got such an item. So I spread the word - just love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute great for coupons.  Just needs to be of better quality.  Strings were apart from the outside pockets before I even unfolded it</li>
            <li> This is great. it is large, lots of pockets. 2 large zipped pockets and one big center pocket. the entire organizer is padded to add extra protection for items.</li>
            <li> I received it on time, it was better than I expected.  I saw it somewhere else and it was much more expensive..for the same thing!</li>
            <li> Purse insert,&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 2 of these inserts. I have been using mine for over a month. I really like it, makes changing purses really simple since everything is already organized together. Haven&#x27;t seen any wear and tear as of yet.  Price was good. I received my order within 2 weeks. Works for me.</li>
            <li> Holds tons of stuff &amp; came 2 weeks before expected.</li>
            <li> I received mine and it looks just as pictured, padded, all the pockets, great stitching. I bought the blue one and it works great for transferring items from purse to purse. Took awhile to ship but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s coming from Hong Kong. I cannot get the snaps on the sides to snap together but other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I have tried several purse inserts and this one is the best I have found.  It fit in my purse nicely and kept everything in it;&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li> Poorly made however great idea, could use more pockets zippers compartments, if you want a good one go to QVC</li>
            <li> I ordered one, not being so sure it would be something useful.  When I received it, I immediately ordered two more.  I use one for toiletries and the other for electronics.  An excellent value for the money.</li>
            <li> This makes a big purse much more efficient and easier to find things in.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is a little smaller than it looks in the picture, but it fits my purse perfectly! Its good quality, zippers have no issues, and the pockets come in handy. I like that I can put a few books in the middle space so they don&#x27;t get crunched.</li>
            <li> Simple yet very useful, and tasteful the day one has to take it out (as emergency diaper changing kit, for example).</li>
            <li> I like this purse organizer. It is very convenient and easy to take it out in my bag.</li>
            <li> Thought it was bigger.  But it&#x27;s good though, it does expand and love the compartments. Pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love it thought it would be bigger it helps alot</li>
            <li> Love the multiple pockets, but it does not stand upright in the purse, so it&#x27;s hard to put things back in.  It usually ends up turned sideways in my purse, but it does hold things better than  just having them floating around.  I do like the handles but would love more rigid structure to it.</li>
            <li> This is a grest little insert for a purse or I use it inside my diaper bag. .this comes in so handy for alot of things even just putting those little gadgets n such that r just laying around ur house with no real place to put them but know one day youll use this stuff so u don&#x27;t want to get rid of, those lil things?. .yup lol its perfect for that too ;-)</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for &amp; arrived very fast.  It&#x27;s exactly as described.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great bag to store diapers, wipes and other stuff for baby. I throw this in my purse or leave in the car..very handy to have.</li>
            <li> Works great as an insert in my purse. Fits well and keeps everything organized.</li>
            <li> Good product, really beautiful and useful. About the store they did a really good job, I strong recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this bag, I want more of them!  Its roomy and well made and the price is so good I will buy from this seller anytime.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any of the other \\&quot;exactly the same but more costly\\&quot; items like this so I cannot compare.  However,I wanted something that I could put my Kindle Fire, Phone, and many other items into in my \\&quot;backyard bag\\&quot;/\\&quot;beach bag\\&quot; that could be easily lifted out. I liked that it had handles, many others did not.  I wanted something made with water proof outside material, a little protection (I have an otterbox on the kindle, so it did not need excessive padding), lightweight, lots of pockets with visible and non-visible items, small pockets for lip screen or nail file, hair clips etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has everything needed to organize all the little stuff that gets lost in a beach bag,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;front side:  mesh pockets - 2 mesh 2h x3.5w pockets -stores the little stuff that is easily visible,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;behind mesh pockets are 2 lightly padded \\&quot;parachute pockets, 3x3.5w&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;padded zippered pocket the entire width and height of the organizer - each of the 2 padded zippered pockets will fit a kindle fire with an otterbox rubber case on it, with room to spare&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;middle pocket - has the 2 handles inside, does not zip, is not padded&lt;br /&gt;  middle pocket also has snaps at the top and bottom, on the outside on each end so it expands the opening at the top and bottom so you can put a book in there, it actually fits&lt;br /&gt;  2 paperbacks in the middle pocket when it is open, and still has room. Unsnapped - it opens the middle pocket to around 2 inches wide without hampering the 2 padded pockets on the&lt;br /&gt;  front and backside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd padded zippered pocket&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;backside:  2 padded pockets like the front side&lt;br /&gt;  4 mesh pockets - basically the 2 mesh pockets from the front side with a stitch down the middle of each, cutting them in half&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrives, it is a slim organizer with padding and handles but I am amazed that it fits everything I would put in my beach bag, except maybe a hat, towel and other bigger things.  This makes for the perfect organizer because I have a big bag I take outside but my little things are never handy and sometimes I end up stuffing them in my camera bag in the beach bag, the problem is, it is not safe for my camera to have a bunch of stuff rubbing against it, the lens, the view screen, etc. I have tried so many \\&quot;bags\\&quot; in my beach bag but they all end being a bunch of stuff in a mess in a bag, in my bag if you know what I mean!  This has all the right size pockets, viewable for things I need to see and not viewable for my allergy medicine which should not be exposed to light, super thin and lightweight - but padded and so expandable, if you max it out you could take everything you would ever need within the height and width of it. It holds my kindle fire, cell phone, house phone, folded headphones, rectangular kindle speaker, paperback book, 4 inch sunscreen, facial sunscreen tub, lipscreen, hairclips, post its, medicine, nail polish etc., pens, batteries, ipod nano, and still has space.  It is ridiculous, I don&#x27;t usually put those things in all at once but I tried everything I could think of at the same time and still had room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will also work well for other family members who \\&quot;travel light\\&quot; but want organization without additional bulk. Since it is so thin and light, someone who wants all that little stuff organized or just wants their electronics separated from other stuff without having to use a separate bag for each, this will work great and add no weight and no unnecessary bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it.  I cannot explain why it needed to be parachute material because really, it never goes to the beach, just the yard but I have used it for a week and already it got something on it twice and wiped clean - once right away, the second time, I noticed it hours later and it wiped clean. I also can hear my music playing while it is in the middle no zip part, which is great because my kindle fire often over heats and shuts down when it is playing music outside, and sitting right out in the sun.  IT does not over heat while in the bag on my chair, so the bag must be doing something to protect it from over heating.  This is also the case if I cover the kindle with a towel or if it is in my beach bag - however, I need my towel for towel purposes and if the kindle is in my big bag, I cannot hear it, so this serves me much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps there is better quality out there or it may not last forever, but I bought the blue for $4.99 and free shipping, now I want one for my doctors appts. bag, and my purse, and one for every female in my whole family!!!! You truly cannot beat the price and it does not feel like or perform like it is a poor quality item, its fabulous!</li>
            <li> Perfect handbag insert for everything I have, easy to slide in and out of your handbag.  Very well made, I love it!</li>
            <li> cheaply made, didnt work for my purposes</li>
            <li> awesome quality, 100% recommended&lt;br /&gt;good materials and good price</li>
            <li> size was to small and it was flimsy.</li>
            <li> This was much nicer than many others I&#x27;d seen.  It&#x27;s well made, fits in a purse and organizes it very well.</li>
            <li> The is so handy! It makes it so much easier to change my purse which I do so often.Love it</li>
