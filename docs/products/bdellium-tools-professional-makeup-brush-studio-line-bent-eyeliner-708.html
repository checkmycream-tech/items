            <li>Will definitely order more!!</li>
            <li>I love this brush because when putting my gel liner, I could see better how I am applying to my upper lash line.</li>
            <li>In spite of the unusual bent, this brush does apply the liner easily, close</li>
            <li>now I can make a perfect thin line without any problem.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 of them and when they get old I will order more.</li>
            <li>and thanks bdellium tools for making this beautiful little thing.</li>
            <li>The price was right, so I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>The handle is just right.  </li>
            <li>The handle is a little longer than I am used to but it is perfect for eyeliner; many brushes are too thick and therefore don&#x27;t offer the precision I like.</li>
            <li>I like this pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I love all of my bdellium tools brushes especially this one!  </li>
            <li>These brushes last a long time and the angle is perfect so you never loose site when applying.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I had such good luck with the bamboo version of this same brand.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, and will be going back for more.</li>
            <li>I use the 100% pure gel eyeliner and this combination is untouchable.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Holds its shape very well.</li>
            <li>the bent design makes it so much easier to do a cat eye on clients</li>
            <li>I have always struggled with getting a straight line with my eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It picks up the color really well and makes it so much easier to put my eyeliner on.</li>
            <li>Kind of firm.</li>
            <li>A lot more affordable than other brushes on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Considering this is cheaper than many other eyeliner brushes sold in Sephora &amp; Ulta</li>
            <li>After each use it is necessary to clean the bristles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to control whether I want a thin, defined line or a bold wing with the angled head.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just like the high end ones.</li>
            <li>The brush is very strong and precisely drawing narrow and sharp lines.</li>
            <li>I have used tons of brushes to apply eyeliner, but this does the job accurately and with little effort.</li>
            <li>And it is really easy to use, the brush is also very soft!&lt;br /&gt;Because the small brush head, it drys so fast that I can wash it everyday.</li>
            <li>I always have trouble making a thin perfect line with other brushes,  </li>
            <li>I will recommend this item to everyone who wants definite eye line for thier final touch on the make up.</li>
            <li>but at times it can be hard to make it glide smoothly for a winged look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the bristles became frayed very shortly after I started using it</li>
            <li>It places eyeliner on so easily and the line is thin..</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush solely with my Urban Decay cream eyeliner (Perversion). After each use it is necessary to clean the bristles. If there is any remaining residue it greatly impacts the efficiency for the next use.

            <li> GREAT BRUSH, NOT FLIMSY</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 5 star as it is the best eye makeup brush for eyelining that I have bought.  Also, the price is incredible;  Smashbox has the same brush for approx $20.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner brush! I have four in my kit!</li>
            <li> Very nice, fine brush. Easy to use &amp; the price is right!</li>
            <li> All I have to say is -- where have you been hiding all my life. And you are PERFECT. and thanks bdellium tools for making this beautiful little thing. Definitely recommend to anyone struggling with winged liner and needs a tiny brush -- HERE SHE IS! ðŸ˜œ</li>
            <li> Love it! Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This tool is great and makes a big difference in my gel liner application.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of cake eye liner and I have tried them all. Gel, Liquid and pencil. This brush lets me get as thin or thick as I want without those little bristles adding what you do not want as well as not to &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; so it doesn&#x27;t bleed. This is very important as I age. I do love this brush!</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner brush!</li>
            <li> I love all of my bdellium tools brushes especially this one!  the bent design makes it so much easier to do a cat eye on clients</li>
            <li> I love it, can&#x27;t complain ðŸ˜„</li>
            <li> I have used tons of brushes to apply eyeliner, but this does the job accurately and with little effort. I use the 100% pure gel eyeliner and this combination is untouchable.</li>
            <li> It draws beautiful eyeliner! And it is really easy to use, the brush is also very soft!&lt;br /&gt;Because the small brush head, it drys so fast that I can wash it everyday.</li>
            <li> I tried so Many eyeliner brushes... The expesive brands too but this little one does the job like wonder. Draw a small lÃ­ne. Easy grip. Grieta grieta great for beginners like me</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than I expected, which was a definite plus. The bristles are extremely soft, but very stiff, which makes it almost effortless when putting on my eyeliner now. It&#x27;s super easy to control whether I want a thin, defined line or a bold wing with the angled head. So glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> In spite of the unusual bent, this brush does apply the liner easily, close and I can control the line I am drawing.  Easy to clean up too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I had such good luck with the bamboo version of this same brand.  This one is even better.  These brushes last a long time and the angle is perfect so you never loose site when applying.  I will probably start replacing all my brushes with this brand as they wear out.</li>
            <li> The brush is very strong and precisely drawing narrow and sharp lines. I will recommend this item to everyone who wants definite eye line for thier final touch on the make up.</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account but I just wanted say I love this brush! I have always struggled with getting a straight line with my eyeliner. This brush is great! It picks up the color really well and makes it so much easier to put my eyeliner on. I ordered 2 of them and when they get old I will order more.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Works great for applying my eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the great brush</li>
            <li> Amazing brush for a great price.  it&#x27;s just like the high end ones. You need to get your hands on one of these.</li>
