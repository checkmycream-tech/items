            <li> If you want this product order early enough to get them in time.</li>
            <li> These are pretty but very long you may have to cut them a little to make the ends not stick out</li>
            <li> Gems catch the light and sparkle without looking &#x27;fake&#x27; or gaudy.</li>
            <li> And yes, the shipping time really is as long as they have stated.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so much bigger than expected.</li>
            <li> the size was bigger as I expected!</li>
            <li> It was not worth the trouble to send them back so, I ended up putting them in my church yard sale thinking that someone may use them for a craft project or something.</li>
            <li> One for my hair and the other for my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking that the would be the average size of a rhinestone pin.</li>
            <li> I practice putting one on my braided hair on every other link!</li>
            <li> Several were broken when they arrived, with the stone having popped out.</li>
            <li> i was afraid the big sized pins wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair, since it&#x27;s thinner, but they held well.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair they&#x27;d work well</li>
            <li> It is not very brilliant.</li>
            <li> I hope they even stay in my thin hair.</li>

            <li> pins are very big - they do not stay in hair unless you twist and bend them.</li>
            <li> They made the bridal party hair look wonderful..</li>
            <li> Very big rhinestones received a lot of compliments.  Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for the wedding!</li>
            <li> These are shiny, sparkly and gorgeous. Also big, about the size of a dime. i was afraid the big sized pins wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair, since it&#x27;s thinner, but they held well. Gems catch the light and sparkle without looking &#x27;fake&#x27; or gaudy.</li>
            <li> i got these hair pins for my bridesmaids and they are just what i was looking for im very happy</li>
            <li> The crystals are quite large--bigger than my pinkie finger and when I slid them into my hair you saw the side view (silver holder) more than the crystal.  I put them into my craft box.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Beautiful with French twist or any kind up-do requiring pins to hold. Durable, secure hold.</li>
            <li> I will be wearing these in my hair to my son&#x27;s wedding.  Does not look cheap or look too big in the hair.  Gives hair a pretty sparkle without appearing cheap.  Feels light in the hair while holding your style in place.  Great price for all you receive!</li>
            <li> Big and beautiful.... good price.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and perfect.</li>
            <li> Have not use them yet but we did a test run on everyone&#x27;s hair for the wedding. BEAUTIFUL I love them even for personal use for a special day</li>
            <li> Nice, not exactly what I was expecting. Bigger than I thought and with the gap between the pin it&#x27;s more to place in hair for decoration, won&#x27;t hold any hair in place.</li>
            <li> I loved it! the size was bigger as I expected! I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Several were broken when they arrived, with the stone having popped out.</li>
            <li> some of the rhinestones were already fallen off when I got them.  Didn&#x27;t get to use the rest of them because they came from China so, they came after my event that I wanted them for.  If you want this product order early enough to get them in time.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking that the would be the average size of a rhinestone pin. I intended to place them throughout my hair for an elegant updo. I never used them. It was not worth the trouble to send them back so, I ended up putting them in my church yard sale thinking that someone may use them for a craft project or something. They are literally about the size of my pinky fingernail. And yes, the shipping time really is as long as they have stated.</li>
            <li> They are really big in size which made my daughter happy.  Pins are to used for her graduation hair do and can&#x27;t wait till then.  i think the design is simple &amp; elegant.</li>
            <li> Is perfect for big braided hair or any hairdos! I practice putting one on my braided hair on every other link! It looks amazing! I love it!</li>
            <li> Wow! I ordered 2 packs of theses. One for my hair and the other for my daughters hair. They&#x27;re so much bigger than expected. I think one pack will be sufficient for my daughter&#x27;s hair and mines. Very good bargain.</li>
