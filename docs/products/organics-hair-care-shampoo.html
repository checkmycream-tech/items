            <li>It smells great, too!</li>
            <li>someone else say that it was the best ever.  </li>
            <li>Just perfect.  </li>
            <li>The best shampoo I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>the scent is great!  </li>
            <li>The best part is that it does not contain ingredients I avoid like sodium benzoate, tocopherols (vitamin E), wheat, or silicone chemicals.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has been wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It works great!</li>
            <li>Combined with the conditioner, it&#x27;s a perfect pair.  </li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>This shampoo lives up to its name, and impressed me.</li>
            <li>I found this shampoo on a website that lists the 10 best shampoos for oily hair.</li>
            <li>Great smell that lasts!</li>
            <li>it is fantastic!!!!</li>
            <li>It is a very good product.</li>
            <li>, it smells so good!)  </li>
            <li>It did a good job removing &amp;#34;ring around the collar&amp;#34; and cuffs!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!!!!! Great product for oily hair!!!</li>
            <li>i smelled like a syrupy cupcake and my hair went frizzy and fly away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell that great, the lemon &amp; tea tree tree have a medical-type odor to them, I found.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great because removes product build up from scalp.</li>
            <li>Smells great too.</li>
            <li>My hair is oily &amp; it has worked great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of lemon to begin with, so it probably might smell great to everyone else, but I always smell like I just washed my hair with dish soap.</li>
            <li>It worked great for 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Works great on my oily hair.</li>
            <li>Works great for me so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great shampoo that works great for oily hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells great.  </li>
            <li>This was a great find for me coming from using Matrix.</li>
            <li>And yes, the fragrance is great, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>My hair felt great and it wasn&#x27;t oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband not realizing \\&quot;for oily hair\\&quot; meant it would make his hair more oily!!</li>
            <li>The lemon version smells very nice.</li>
            <li>but once you get there its amazing!</li>
            <li>Smells great, good lather, and keeps my scalp from being itchy.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and feels so good!</li>
            <li>i guess you would think means its good for oily hair.</li>
            <li>and it worked fairly well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using another conditioner, the conditioner does not seem to be as good as the shampoo.</li>
            <li>cleans well and smells good.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells good</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it does a good job in preventing oily hair, as a matter of fact I find myself need twice the dose to remove the oil from my hair than the shampoo I used to have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product is made in the USA and is good for the environment and for you.  </li>
            <li>This shapoo really really good for oily hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is good, but it doesn&#x27;t have any scent that is close to lemon.</li>
            <li>It takes all the oil away and smells good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still a good product that makes its job.....</li>
            <li>I was hoping for good things and to help my oily hair.  </li>
            <li>Good shampoo.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Will clean the heck out of it and leave it smelling great!  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo to remove all the excess build up from hair products and it is great for oily hair too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This is a nice smelling good shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is a good shampoo that cleans well, the smell is nice</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled very good, it DOES smell like that lemony floor cleaner scent as you are washing your hair, but once it is rinsed out it leaves a nice, clean, non overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>Works great, huge difference in my hair already</li>
            <li>If you have oily hair, it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>If you truly have oily hair this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>The lemon smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still effective.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if it was stronger.  </li>
            <li>The results weren&#x27;t as immediate as I would&#x27;ve liked, but when are they ever?</li>
            <li>It smell nice, but it leaves NO SCENT after rinse off.</li>
            <li>My son has really oily hair and this shampoo is wonderful!!  </li>
            <li>I give this 5 stars because it does indeed do a great job getting my hair clean.</li>
            <li>The Lemon Tea Tree shampoo is by far the best I have ever had.</li>
            <li>far, a week in, I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo for oily hair so far.  </li>
            <li>Best Shampoo I have found so far.</li>
            <li>Clears my scalp and great for hot, humid climates.</li>
            <li>And if you do some research, you can find very cheap argan oil from soap-making supply stores online.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff much better than shampoos</li>
            <li>on top of that, hair got oilier even quicker.</li>
            <li>but my ends because they would flatten the scalp hair with too many oils.  </li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t love the sme.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I tried a shampoo/conditioner with an antibacterial agent but it felt like it made my hair more oily.  </li>
            <li>but my hair felt better after using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Desert Essence organics hair care shampoo for more than a month.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good deal and great for your hair and the environment at the same time.</li>
            <li>My head does not get itchy any more.</li>
            <li>Good product worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is a clarifying shampoo, hence, should be used once or twice a month as it strips healthy oils from hair</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and the lemon scent</li>
            <li>I have struggled all my life with oily hair and take 2 showers a day most days.  </li>
            <li>So I make a compromise and get something MOSTLY all-natural.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay the Josie Maran price, for sure.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t have any of the sulfates, parabens, or phthalates.</li>
            <li>like that it&#x27;s made out of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients too :)</li>
            <li>I love the lemon scent that it has.</li>
            <li>I got this for my daughter who is going thru puberty and her hair has become more oily.</li>
            <li>I was purchasing from Amazon for more than 5 years.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to go 3 days between hair washes, sometimes 4.</li>
            <li>This overall has been the best for her hair and our wallet.</li>
            <li>does, if anything, it just stripped it more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with these products from Desert Essence.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more of these.</li>
            <li>One more thing needs to mention is: the shampoo doesn&#x27;t create bubbles, or it can say small/low amount bubbles.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo 2-3 times I was in love with it.</li>
            <li>I m in love with this shampoo,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll update if it gets better.</li>
            <li>I bought the conditioner as well which isn&#x27;t wonderful after the shower as it does not have a lot of de-tangler, but my hair is incredibly healthy, has great volume, non-greasy for at least 2 days</li>
            <li>Very nice and a large tube at that.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it lathers like normal shampoo (it weirds me out when shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather).</li>
            <li>Many of the choices at the HFS don&#x27;t treat my hair well, too strong.  </li>
            <li>: very good lather, you only need a little.&lt;br /&gt;thats</li>
            <li>Since too many beauty products have too much scents around, no scent product is very special; However I also expect my hair will have a nice smell.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no residue, strong scent, or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>The smell of this shampoo at first was a nice lemony smell...</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li>This is great because it does not dry the scalp out and leave it flaky.</li>
            <li>I like the light lemon scent too...not too strong.  </li>
            <li>a huge plus is this has great ingredients that your scalp will be grateful for in the long run :)</li>
            <li>It has a nice, lemony scent and leaves nothing behind.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of buying the conditioner, I just rub in a dab of pure argan oil into my hair before blow-drying.</li>
            <li>This shampoo reminds me of how it made my hair feel though when I was using those things, it makes it feel kind of stripped and tough, the conditioner is great and makes it nice and manageable after using the shampoo.</li>
            <li>The lemon scent is fabulous too.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great in my opinion, the only thing is</li>
            <li>Cleans well and smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li>My hair is fluffy and beautiful!</li>
            <li>My hair feels really good every time after being washed with it: smooth, soft, fresh and no scalps at all!  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely thrilled that my hair feels like it used to earlier on (until about 6 months ago when it started becoming hopelessly oily and lifeless!).</li>
            <li>The shampoo is ok, it smells pretty nice and does a decent job on control my oily hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is bouncy and fresh!</li>
            <li>Product worked well, but did not use it for its original purpose.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a shampoo for oily hair for a long time and was so happy when I found this one.</li>
            <li>this shampoo does really clean up oil buildups.  </li>
            <li>and it never feels really clean.</li>
            <li>yet still had a nice fresh smell and lathered up really well.</li>
            <li>It takes away the oil pretty effectively, but I don&#x27;t really like the scent...</li>
            <li>first few days that I used this, it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>, it smells sorta nice, and its natural.</li>
            <li>He can shower at night and the next morning his hair still looks good.  </li>
            <li>My hair also tangles easily and is hard to brush out by the end of the day, even when I&#x27;m inactively sitting in ideal indoor conditions.</li>
            <li>This one kept my hair clean during the daytime (which is 12 hours or so), which is better than most shampoo, but didn&#x27;t make it clean enough for me to not have to wash it to go out at night.</li>
            <li>compared to the other shampoos out there , this shampoo is great.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and am so glad that I finally found a solution to the hair shampooing problem.  </li>
            <li>But now my hair seems to be getting oily quickly again.  </li>
            <li>I have super oily hair</li>
            <li>Although the price is better at Amazon, it is still a bit high in price.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lasts a surprising long time as well.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, my hair feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I heard on a forum that this was worth trying.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products &amp; so far this beats them all.  </li>
            <li>BUT...you don&#x27;t have to use as much product to get your hair clean and it does what it says.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several and for the price and quality, this is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>the only problem I have is that the shampoo gets used up quickly so you need more product.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for people with really oily hair (btw my hair is straight and fine), the only con is that it kinda makes your hair a little tangled but that doesn&#x27;t defeat the purpose.</li>
            <li>I have soft baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I think it would be good for people who have extra oil in their hair, but not extremely oily hair, like mine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bright and fluffy every time.  </li>
            <li>(I tried this to try to get a better smelling shampoo than the one I currently use)  </li>
            <li>While I am not sure this shampoo is the best for oily hair, it definitely helps and is affordable.   </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Was better off with a basic shampoo from the drugstore!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more liquid-y than a regular shampoo</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate, this stuff really does work!</li>
            <li>It smells great, it lasts a long time, and I can actually condition my hair now without looking like I&#x27;ve worked in a kitchen all day.</li>
            <li>My hair was the same as using The $2 bottle from suave which does much better job.</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily hair and this shampoo seems to be keeping it under control.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper then in the stores if you can even find it !</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t want to just get her a harsh clarifying shampoo because that wouldn&#x27;t be good for scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was previously using Güd shampoo from Bert&#x27;s Bees (which I still really love!), but it wasn&#x27;t taking care of my hair like I needed since I moved north.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo with warm water (not super hot because that can cause oily hair too)</li>
            <li>and it does a nice job cleaning it without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>Been looking for a shampoo to keep my hair oil free for a long time and most do not work much better than ordinary</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found most shampoos tend to weigh down my fine hair, but this one doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind so my hair feels light, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot more $ on.</li>
            <li>: leaves hair feeling very stripped when you rinse it out which</li>
            <li>My hair just feels so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>it is very concentrated and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li>Lathers up good,but its really drying.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo a lot.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I had really oily hair, but after a lot of research I found that one of the triggers for scalp acne is oily scalp and a build-up of bacteria.  </li>
            <li>The product smells very lemony</li>
            <li>have very oily hair and scalp and work in remodeling and construction.  </li>
            <li>really wakes you up if you shower in the morning.</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthier and cleaner for the whole day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really concentrated, so</li>
            <li>It really is quite embarrassing to be so oily at the end of my days.  </li>
            <li>I believe it really is working.  </li>
            <li>hair was VERY oily...</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair</li>
            <li>And I can&#x27;t believe the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It gently cleanses the scalp and hair, leaving the hairy shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo for oily hair and scalp!</li>
            <li>My daughter has very oily hair and this shampoo has helped to get it under control.</li>
            <li>Controls oily hair very well.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to make it look lifeless.</li>
            <li>I expected more from the product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for oily hair!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ve got to use so much</li>
            <li>But it does work very well.</li>
            <li>no matter how much I rinse.</li>
            <li>and more affordable than the other organic shampoos on that list.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to order this for a great price, but it was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li>For example, instead of waterlogged lotions full of preservatives and stearic acid (I dare you to look up where that comes from), I just use a bottle of shea or avocado oil, cold-pressed from the actual fruit.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>They weigh my hair down, build up the more you use it, and make it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be a nightmare on my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair (slightly oily, but aging).  </li>
            <li>by the next morning my hair was more like third day hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely spend an extra dollar or two on a better smelling one next time because it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This product arrived on time and I highly recommend it for those that have oily hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those who have oily hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why it got good reviews, it really has no good redeeming value.</li>
            <li>I am really like this product so far.</li>
            <li>This definitely did the trick, and is absolutely worth the $8 price tag.</li>
            <li>The good thing is it doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair after and the dry feeling goes away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I mean it smells nice, but it does not give the impression of being &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>all the grease cutting action, it&#x27;s still gentle and has a mild, pleasant scent that I can appreciate only because my kid&#x27;s hair is finally, actually, squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>It helps to clean oily scalp, but the hair will feel very dry if you do not use conditioner.</li>
            <li>The conditioner works just as good, but keep in mind that if you have thin hair you should only use a nickle size blob to smooth through your hair starting at the ends.</li>
            <li>I saw no difference with this shampoo compared to Suave or any other cheap shampoo.</li>
            <li>It smells like any other cheap shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is not the fault of my neighbor since there is nobody live in my floor.</li>
            <li>And the girls live upstairs are my friends.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, I can wash my hair every other day, and the second day, my hair is bouncy and full just like the first!  </li>
            <li>My daughter has pretty greasy hair, and this stuff is one of the only shampoos that keeps it &#x27;tamed&#x27;</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of other shampoos,  and most just don&#x27;t strip enough oil out of my hair and off my scalp.</li>
            <li>However, since using this shampoo, i was able to adjust it to every other day and eventually it somehow trained my hair to only needing a wash every 3 days!</li>
            <li>It is the first shampoo that actually keeps the oils at bay on day 2.</li>
            <li>This is the only one I have ever used that would actually keep my hair looking clean for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Smells great, does not leave my hair frizzy or flat, and this little tube of shampoo lasts longer than expected.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is light and offers a ton of coverage for just a little bit of product in your hand.</li>
            <li>(My 2 year old sniffed the bottle and asked if it was food</li>
            <li>So far I have not had any issues using this product and it defintely seems to eliminate some of the oily issues i have.</li>
            <li>It washes hair well and makes it shiny and soft, but does does not eliminate the problem of excess oil.</li>
            <li>It also made my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Using regular shampoos always made my head itchy and my hair very oily.</li>
            <li>my skincare products and cosmetics have ingredients I can pronounce and conceivably manufacture myself if I had the materials.</li>
            <li>It is soft and manageable and I can use it every day without a problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since a year ago, my hair suddenly became really oily.</li>
            <li>I wanted an all natural shampoo and conditioner, I was trying things on the internet I&#x27;ve read like using baking soda and lemon and cider vinegar..</li>
            <li>It did not leave my hair as soft and shiny as I prefer, so I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>I also mix it up with a regular shampoo because I don&#x27;t want to end up drying my scalp too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i used this for a few weeks just to be sure it wasnt hormone related or whatever.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t need to be left in long to do the trick and rinse with cool water.  </li>
            <li>I have med thick wavy hair, porous, that gets oily on top.  </li>
            <li>It will not lather very well if your hair has gotten to oil levels high enough to stage a war, but the second rinse will get you that glorious lather that everyone desires.</li>
            <li>For the price Amazon will have many re-orders on this shampoo( and it only takes a little bit!).</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised by the fact that it was a little runny, and squeezed hard because of the comments... ended up with a huge hand full.  </li>
            <li>but, you might need a dry shampoo if you have that much oil in your scalp!&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>do feel that it dries out my hair a bit too much and leaves it kinda &#x27;dry&#x27; as I&#x27;m finishing my shower.</li>
            <li>My mother has very oily scalp and before this shampoo she had to wash her hair every single day.</li>
            <li>As for the comments about it being too thick for the bottle, I must assume the thickness has been changed, it came out perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li>(so I can skip a day washing occasionally) and my scalp acne is nearly non-existent.  </li>
            <li>The lemon scent is barely there.  </li>
            <li>This never happened with my old shampoo and stopped immediately when I switched back.</li>
            <li>My body produces extra natural oils, so I purchased this item.  </li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>Not dry, not oily.  </li>
            <li>Hot water will only weigh your hair down when rinsing conditioner and defeat the purpose of these products.</li>
            <li>Now not so much, doesn&#x27;t lather up like a typical shampoo,</li>
            <li>Either way, my hair also began getting really, really flaky; I have dark brown hair, so flakes of any sort make me look like I have dandruff and can&#x27;t take care of my personal hygiene.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, it foams up very very well, so start with a small amount and work your way up.</li>

            <li> the scent is great!  </li>

            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell that great, the lemon &amp; tea tree tree have a medical-type odor to them, I found.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great because removes product build up from scalp.</li>
            <li> Smells great too.</li>
            <li> My hair is oily &amp; it has worked great.</li>

            <li> This stuff smells great.  </li>
            <li> This was a great find for me coming from using Matrix.</li>
            <li> And yes, the fragrance is great, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> My hair felt great and it wasn&#x27;t oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband not realizing \\&quot;for oily hair\\&quot; meant it would make his hair more oily!!</li>
            <li> The lemon version smells very nice.</li>
            <li> but once you get there its amazing!</li>
            <li> Smells great, good lather, and keeps my scalp from being itchy.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing and feels so good!</li>
            <li> i guess you would think means its good for oily hair.</li>
            <li> and it worked fairly well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using another conditioner, the conditioner does not seem to be as good as the shampoo.</li>
            <li> cleans well and smells good.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells good</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it does a good job in preventing oily hair, as a matter of fact I find myself need twice the dose to remove the oil from my hair than the shampoo I used to have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product is made in the USA and is good for the environment and for you.  </li>
            <li> This shapoo really really good for oily hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is good, but it doesn&#x27;t have any scent that is close to lemon.</li>
            <li> It takes all the oil away and smells good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still a good product that makes its job.....</li>
            <li> I was hoping for good things and to help my oily hair.  </li>
            <li> Good shampoo.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Will clean the heck out of it and leave it smelling great!  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo to remove all the excess build up from hair products and it is great for oily hair too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smelling good shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo that cleans well, the smell is nice</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled very good, it DOES smell like that lemony floor cleaner scent as you are washing your hair, but once it is rinsed out it leaves a nice, clean, non overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> Works great, huge difference in my hair already</li>
            <li> If you have oily hair, it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> If you truly have oily hair this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> The lemon smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still effective.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if it was stronger.  </li>
            <li> The results weren&#x27;t as immediate as I would&#x27;ve liked, but when are they ever?</li>
            <li> It smell nice, but it leaves NO SCENT after rinse off.</li>
            <li> My son has really oily hair and this shampoo is wonderful!!  </li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars because it does indeed do a great job getting my hair clean.</li>
            <li> The Lemon Tea Tree shampoo is by far the best I have ever had.</li>
            <li> far, a week in, I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for oily hair so far.  </li>
            <li> Best Shampoo I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Clears my scalp and great for hot, humid climates.</li>
            <li> And if you do some research, you can find very cheap argan oil from soap-making supply stores online.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff much better than shampoos</li>
            <li> on top of that, hair got oilier even quicker.</li>
            <li> but my ends because they would flatten the scalp hair with too many oils.  </li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t love the sme.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I tried a shampoo/conditioner with an antibacterial agent but it felt like it made my hair more oily.  </li>
            <li> but my hair felt better after using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Desert Essence organics hair care shampoo for more than a month.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal and great for your hair and the environment at the same time.</li>
            <li> My head does not get itchy any more.</li>
            <li> Good product worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a clarifying shampoo, hence, should be used once or twice a month as it strips healthy oils from hair</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and the lemon scent</li>
            <li> I have struggled all my life with oily hair and take 2 showers a day most days.  </li>
            <li> So I make a compromise and get something MOSTLY all-natural.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay the Josie Maran price, for sure.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t have any of the sulfates, parabens, or phthalates.</li>
            <li> like that it&#x27;s made out of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients too :)</li>
            <li> I love the lemon scent that it has.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who is going thru puberty and her hair has become more oily.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing from Amazon for more than 5 years.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to go 3 days between hair washes, sometimes 4.</li>
            <li> This overall has been the best for her hair and our wallet.</li>
            <li> does, if anything, it just stripped it more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these products from Desert Essence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> One more thing needs to mention is: the shampoo doesn&#x27;t create bubbles, or it can say small/low amount bubbles.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo 2-3 times I was in love with it.</li>
            <li> I m in love with this shampoo,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll update if it gets better.</li>
            <li> I bought the conditioner as well which isn&#x27;t wonderful after the shower as it does not have a lot of de-tangler, but my hair is incredibly healthy, has great volume, non-greasy for at least 2 days</li>
            <li> Very nice and a large tube at that.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it lathers like normal shampoo (it weirds me out when shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather).</li>
            <li> Many of the choices at the HFS don&#x27;t treat my hair well, too strong.  </li>
            <li> : very good lather, you only need a little.&lt;br /&gt;thats</li>
            <li> Since too many beauty products have too much scents around, no scent product is very special; However I also expect my hair will have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no residue, strong scent, or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> The smell of this shampoo at first was a nice lemony smell...</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li> This is great because it does not dry the scalp out and leave it flaky.</li>
            <li> I like the light lemon scent too...not too strong.  </li>
            <li> a huge plus is this has great ingredients that your scalp will be grateful for in the long run :)</li>
            <li> It has a nice, lemony scent and leaves nothing behind.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of buying the conditioner, I just rub in a dab of pure argan oil into my hair before blow-drying.</li>
            <li> This shampoo reminds me of how it made my hair feel though when I was using those things, it makes it feel kind of stripped and tough, the conditioner is great and makes it nice and manageable after using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> The lemon scent is fabulous too.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great in my opinion, the only thing is</li>
            <li> Cleans well and smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li> My hair is fluffy and beautiful!</li>
            <li> My hair feels really good every time after being washed with it: smooth, soft, fresh and no scalps at all!  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled that my hair feels like it used to earlier on (until about 6 months ago when it started becoming hopelessly oily and lifeless!).</li>
            <li> The shampoo is ok, it smells pretty nice and does a decent job on control my oily hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is bouncy and fresh!</li>
            <li> Product worked well, but did not use it for its original purpose.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo for oily hair for a long time and was so happy when I found this one.</li>
            <li> this shampoo does really clean up oil buildups.  </li>
            <li> and it never feels really clean.</li>
            <li> yet still had a nice fresh smell and lathered up really well.</li>
            <li> It takes away the oil pretty effectively, but I don&#x27;t really like the scent...</li>
            <li> first few days that I used this, it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> , it smells sorta nice, and its natural.</li>
            <li> He can shower at night and the next morning his hair still looks good.  </li>
            <li> My hair also tangles easily and is hard to brush out by the end of the day, even when I&#x27;m inactively sitting in ideal indoor conditions.</li>
            <li> This one kept my hair clean during the daytime (which is 12 hours or so), which is better than most shampoo, but didn&#x27;t make it clean enough for me to not have to wash it to go out at night.</li>
            <li> compared to the other shampoos out there , this shampoo is great.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and am so glad that I finally found a solution to the hair shampooing problem.  </li>
            <li> But now my hair seems to be getting oily quickly again.  </li>
            <li> I have super oily hair</li>
            <li> Although the price is better at Amazon, it is still a bit high in price.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lasts a surprising long time as well.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, my hair feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I heard on a forum that this was worth trying.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products &amp; so far this beats them all.  </li>
            <li> BUT...you don&#x27;t have to use as much product to get your hair clean and it does what it says.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several and for the price and quality, this is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> the only problem I have is that the shampoo gets used up quickly so you need more product.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for people with really oily hair (btw my hair is straight and fine), the only con is that it kinda makes your hair a little tangled but that doesn&#x27;t defeat the purpose.</li>
            <li> I have soft baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I think it would be good for people who have extra oil in their hair, but not extremely oily hair, like mine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bright and fluffy every time.  </li>
            <li> (I tried this to try to get a better smelling shampoo than the one I currently use)  </li>
            <li> While I am not sure this shampoo is the best for oily hair, it definitely helps and is affordable.   </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Was better off with a basic shampoo from the drugstore!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more liquid-y than a regular shampoo</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate, this stuff really does work!</li>
            <li> It smells great, it lasts a long time, and I can actually condition my hair now without looking like I&#x27;ve worked in a kitchen all day.</li>
            <li> My hair was the same as using The $2 bottle from suave which does much better job.</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily hair and this shampoo seems to be keeping it under control.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper then in the stores if you can even find it !</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t want to just get her a harsh clarifying shampoo because that wouldn&#x27;t be good for scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was previously using Güd shampoo from Bert&#x27;s Bees (which I still really love!), but it wasn&#x27;t taking care of my hair like I needed since I moved north.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo with warm water (not super hot because that can cause oily hair too)</li>
            <li> and it does a nice job cleaning it without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Been looking for a shampoo to keep my hair oil free for a long time and most do not work much better than ordinary</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found most shampoos tend to weigh down my fine hair, but this one doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind so my hair feels light, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot more $ on.</li>
            <li> : leaves hair feeling very stripped when you rinse it out which</li>
            <li> My hair just feels so much healthier.  </li>
            <li> it is very concentrated and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> Lathers up good,but its really drying.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo a lot.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I had really oily hair, but after a lot of research I found that one of the triggers for scalp acne is oily scalp and a build-up of bacteria.  </li>
            <li> The product smells very lemony</li>
            <li> have very oily hair and scalp and work in remodeling and construction.  </li>
            <li> really wakes you up if you shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthier and cleaner for the whole day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really concentrated, so</li>
            <li> It really is quite embarrassing to be so oily at the end of my days.  </li>
            <li> I believe it really is working.  </li>
            <li> hair was VERY oily...</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t believe the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It gently cleanses the scalp and hair, leaving the hairy shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo for oily hair and scalp!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very oily hair and this shampoo has helped to get it under control.</li>
            <li> Controls oily hair very well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to make it look lifeless.</li>
            <li> I expected more from the product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for oily hair!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve got to use so much</li>
            <li> But it does work very well.</li>
            <li> no matter how much I rinse.</li>
            <li> and more affordable than the other organic shampoos on that list.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to order this for a great price, but it was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> For example, instead of waterlogged lotions full of preservatives and stearic acid (I dare you to look up where that comes from), I just use a bottle of shea or avocado oil, cold-pressed from the actual fruit.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> They weigh my hair down, build up the more you use it, and make it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would be a nightmare on my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair (slightly oily, but aging).  </li>
            <li> by the next morning my hair was more like third day hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely spend an extra dollar or two on a better smelling one next time because it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and I highly recommend it for those that have oily hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for those who have oily hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it got good reviews, it really has no good redeeming value.</li>
            <li> I am really like this product so far.</li>
            <li> This definitely did the trick, and is absolutely worth the $8 price tag.</li>
            <li> The good thing is it doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair after and the dry feeling goes away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I mean it smells nice, but it does not give the impression of being &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> all the grease cutting action, it&#x27;s still gentle and has a mild, pleasant scent that I can appreciate only because my kid&#x27;s hair is finally, actually, squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> It helps to clean oily scalp, but the hair will feel very dry if you do not use conditioner.</li>
            <li> The conditioner works just as good, but keep in mind that if you have thin hair you should only use a nickle size blob to smooth through your hair starting at the ends.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference with this shampoo compared to Suave or any other cheap shampoo.</li>
            <li> It smells like any other cheap shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is not the fault of my neighbor since there is nobody live in my floor.</li>
            <li> And the girls live upstairs are my friends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, I can wash my hair every other day, and the second day, my hair is bouncy and full just like the first!  </li>
            <li> My daughter has pretty greasy hair, and this stuff is one of the only shampoos that keeps it &#x27;tamed&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of other shampoos,  and most just don&#x27;t strip enough oil out of my hair and off my scalp.</li>
            <li> However, since using this shampoo, i was able to adjust it to every other day and eventually it somehow trained my hair to only needing a wash every 3 days!</li>
            <li> It is the first shampoo that actually keeps the oils at bay on day 2.</li>
            <li> This is the only one I have ever used that would actually keep my hair looking clean for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Smells great, does not leave my hair frizzy or flat, and this little tube of shampoo lasts longer than expected.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is light and offers a ton of coverage for just a little bit of product in your hand.</li>
            <li> (My 2 year old sniffed the bottle and asked if it was food</li>
            <li> So far I have not had any issues using this product and it defintely seems to eliminate some of the oily issues i have.</li>
            <li> It washes hair well and makes it shiny and soft, but does does not eliminate the problem of excess oil.</li>
            <li> It also made my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Using regular shampoos always made my head itchy and my hair very oily.</li>
            <li> my skincare products and cosmetics have ingredients I can pronounce and conceivably manufacture myself if I had the materials.</li>
            <li> It is soft and manageable and I can use it every day without a problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since a year ago, my hair suddenly became really oily.</li>
            <li> I wanted an all natural shampoo and conditioner, I was trying things on the internet I&#x27;ve read like using baking soda and lemon and cider vinegar..</li>
            <li> It did not leave my hair as soft and shiny as I prefer, so I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> I also mix it up with a regular shampoo because I don&#x27;t want to end up drying my scalp too much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i used this for a few weeks just to be sure it wasnt hormone related or whatever.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t need to be left in long to do the trick and rinse with cool water.  </li>
            <li> I have med thick wavy hair, porous, that gets oily on top.  </li>
            <li> It will not lather very well if your hair has gotten to oil levels high enough to stage a war, but the second rinse will get you that glorious lather that everyone desires.</li>
            <li> For the price Amazon will have many re-orders on this shampoo( and it only takes a little bit!).</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised by the fact that it was a little runny, and squeezed hard because of the comments... ended up with a huge hand full.  </li>
            <li> but, you might need a dry shampoo if you have that much oil in your scalp!&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> do feel that it dries out my hair a bit too much and leaves it kinda &#x27;dry&#x27; as I&#x27;m finishing my shower.</li>
            <li> My mother has very oily scalp and before this shampoo she had to wash her hair every single day.</li>
            <li> As for the comments about it being too thick for the bottle, I must assume the thickness has been changed, it came out perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li> (so I can skip a day washing occasionally) and my scalp acne is nearly non-existent.  </li>
            <li> The lemon scent is barely there.  </li>
            <li> This never happened with my old shampoo and stopped immediately when I switched back.</li>
            <li> My body produces extra natural oils, so I purchased this item.  </li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> Not dry, not oily.  </li>
            <li> Hot water will only weigh your hair down when rinsing conditioner and defeat the purpose of these products.</li>
            <li> Now not so much, doesn&#x27;t lather up like a typical shampoo,</li>
            <li> Either way, my hair also began getting really, really flaky; I have dark brown hair, so flakes of any sort make me look like I have dandruff and can&#x27;t take care of my personal hygiene.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it foams up very very well, so start with a small amount and work your way up.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural shampoo without harsh chemicals and horrible perfumes, but as lovely as many of the natural shampoos smell, they all leave me looking like I didn&#x27;t wash my hair.</li>
            <li> It felt different on my scalp than traditional shampoo, but left my hair manageable, soft and it styled up and makes my hair still look manageable to wash every other day if I need to.</li>
            <li> The second day, my hair looked flat and greasy.  </li>
            <li> i normally wash my hair every day since it is so oily, or stretch it to every other day and use dry shampoo in between.</li>
            <li> My eldest, a bit past teen, still uses this when the hair is really getting oily, but it is otherwise too strong/stripping.  </li>
            <li> If you have normal hair, using it just a few times a week will help clarify your hair and get out any styling products you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> I would get dandruff and just had a very unpleasant time trying to find a good shampoo thats not extremely overpriced.</li>
            <li> Finally I found a shampoo for oily hair, instead of the ever-present \\&quot;for dry or frizzy hair,\\&quot; on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Finally a natural shampoo that does not weigh my hair down and make it look like I&#x27;ve washed my hair in Wesson oil!</li>
            <li> it leaves her hair shiny and soft and it takes the oil away plus even though it is only a small tube</li>
            <li> She has long hair</li>
            <li> I am a long time customer of this after seeing it for myself.</li>
            <li> If it has made a difference it&#x27;s only minimal.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> only it makes it EXTREMELY tangled...</li>
            <li> i try using only one or the other.</li>
            <li> Only an empty envelope teared in one side!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much other than regular shampoo</li>
            <li> but once it is dry it is not over-powering.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I have a patch of dry skin on my scalp and it does seem to help, not take it away</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and falling.</li>
            <li> Washed it at night, woke up to oily hair and had to use dry shampoo to take the grease away.</li>
            <li> except for making my hair so dry.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and oily hair, this shampoo makes it a little better without making my hair too dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> its tough to get through the in between days at first</li>
            <li> I no longer have to take a shower twice every single day.  </li>
            <li> , the all-natural shampoo options out there are limited to castile soap type formulations that leave my hair caked in residue, despite all the vinegar rinses in the world.</li>
            <li> i use to have to wash it every single freaking day.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, but unfortunately did not work for my extremely oily hair, it was like I hadn&#x27;t washed it at all.</li>
            <li> , I wash 3 times a week and a dry shampoo in between work outs does the trick!</li>
            <li> I usually have to wash my hair everyday but thanks to this product</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter if I cut it short or let it grow out, it&#x27;s oily half a day after I wash it.</li>
            <li> I find that if I store the bottle on it&#x27;s cap (as pictured), it often leaks and makes a big mess.</li>
            <li> but no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: does not clean as well as even regular dollar store shampoo.</li>
            <li> My scalp had been a little itchy, and if I scratched it, there was that moist white \\&quot;coating\\&quot; under my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it could be a little too drying -</li>
            <li> Worth the money and makes my thin hair look a little fuller.  </li>
            <li> My hair can make it at least two days without getting all oily and gross, and usually it&#x27;ll last three days without a wash.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair with absolutely no body.  </li>
            <li> I had never really thought about buying shampoo online, but I decided to when I saw this.</li>
            <li> However, it makes my hair rough, matted at the scalp, and itchy.</li>
            <li> and it is a miracle worker without being too harsh for daily washing.</li>
            <li> It is concentrated so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have also used it about 3 times now, every other day, and it does not build up to make your hair flatter and flatter.  </li>
            <li> My hair is just as oily as it was with other products.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands of shampoo</li>
            <li> The ingredients are truly organic without any of the sneaky sulfates or other carcinagens</li>
            <li> the other so called &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; shampoos try to fool you with.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair on night but at the following morning, my hair become oil again.</li>
            <li> This is the 1ST time my product lost in the transit due to the improper packaging.</li>
            <li> and I try to go every other day for washing it.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that seemed to get oily with some shampoos lately, no problems with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just finding out now that it&#x27;s not even organic (which it labels itself as) since it has harsh detergents (which might be why my hair feels so dry after using)</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it was hard to find other than online.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t notice that my hair gets any less oily than when I use any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly over shoulder length and this shampoo/conditioner lasts 2.5 months for me, used every other day.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time regarding shampooing my hair since the end of last year before I found this.  </li>
            <li> a VERY LITTLE goes a long way (like the Prell concentrated).  </li>
            <li> This is difficult bc my scalp gets very oily.</li>
            <li> Start lathering up at your roots and let the suds fall down to the rest of your hair and use your hands to get all of the hair too.</li>
            <li> Other conditioners were so heavy</li>
            <li> My hair is muchhhh less oily now.</li>
            <li> Supposed to help oily hair be less oily.</li>
            <li> Typically if I wash my hair in the evening I am a grease ball by morning, but not with this stuff.</li>
            <li> but after a day in a half i see no difference in using this product and lets say something like a Garnier shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is less oily and stays that way longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair less greasy compared to using my &amp;#34;old&#x27; shampoo.</li>
            <li> the shampoo was leaking  out from the bottle and caused a mess.</li>
            <li> [my hair is very long, thick, and fine...almost to my booty]</li>
            <li> I read that if ur scalp is not clean even that causes acne too.</li>
            <li> Unless you have oily hair, it might be a little too drying for every day use.</li>
            <li> Other shampoos have silicones in them to slick the hair shaft.  </li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot, just a little circle in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a little disappointed because I was looking for a shampoo that would keep my hair clean for 3/4 days</li>
            <li> this is just too harsh on my scalp.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t like shampooing everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have had scalp acne for a few years, since the birth of my son.  </li>
            <li> This was really waste of money.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how i managed to wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> The bottle cup not fit the opening, shampoo always flowing everywhere</li>
            <li> While not cheap, it is inexpensive for something that works this well on hair like hers.</li>
            <li> Ordered lemon and green apple.</li>
            <li> Tried it for a month my hair felt oily and limp, do not buy.</li>
            <li> I went with this because it was one of the few that was \\&quot;organic\\</li>
            <li> I had dandruff problems from few months.</li>
            <li> Other shampoos weren&#x27;t cleaning her hair well and it was leaving her hair dull and limp, and still looked oily.</li>
            <li> (I have a thick head of medium-fine hair, slightly wavy.)</li>
            <li> It does wonders for my formerly limp and lifeless hair!</li>
            <li> nothing works so i usually dont care what i use since i have basically given up on the problem, but i have to say this shampoo is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why; it could be the environment, the water here, or the change in lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle is quite small as it is</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t make it worse which a lot of other products will do.</li>
            <li> so thats another reason it sucks.</li>
            <li> the only way to fix it is putting the bottle upside down : (&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
            <li> envelope is just too thin and small.</li>
            <li> However, the bottle was not good.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is missing!!!</li>
            <li> This seemed to make my oil problem worse, by the end of the day</li>
            <li> I bought the yellow one and REALLY HATE</li>
            <li> , its poorly designed bottle really annoyed me.</li>
            <li> if i change my mind, ill change this review.</li>
            <li> Desert Essence is expensive.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it did not work for my hair.</li>
            <li> We have tried every expensive shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair fall out like crazy.</li>
            <li> Also, the itchy scalp just made me crazy.</li>
            <li> it doesnt matter, my hair is getting worse and worse, HORRIBLE product!</li>
            <li> Nearly impossible to brush it out after getting out of the shower, though.</li>
            <li> It does not smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> Made my scalp break out badly.</li>
            <li> Really badly.  </li>
            <li> Odor wasn&#x27;t bad, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because it worked so well at the beginning.</li>
            <li> I am filthy and grimy when i get home.  </li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is formulated without the worst offenders, and it works!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It does wonders for my formerly limp and lifeless hair! It has given my hair form, volume and bounce! It smells great, too!</li>
            <li> Works great, huge difference in my hair already</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found most shampoos tend to weigh down my fine hair, but this one doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind so my hair feels light, clean and fresh. The lemon scent is fabulous too. Unless you have oily hair, it might be a little too drying for every day use. If you have normal hair, using it just a few times a week will help clarify your hair and get out any styling products you&#x27;re using. I like this stuff much better than shampoos I&#x27;ve spent a lot more $ on. 5 star product!</li>
            <li> basically, i bought this shampoo (lemon one) thinking maybe if i wash in the morning i would not be greasy by the end of the day. i normally wash my hair every day since it is so oily, or stretch it to every other day and use dry shampoo in between. ive tried clarifying shampoos, volumizing shampoos, moisturizing shampoos, no shampoo, conditioner as shampoo, shampoo soaps, etc to fix the problem. nothing works so i usually dont care what i use since i have basically given up on the problem, but i have to say this shampoo is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros: very good lather, you only need a little.&lt;br /&gt;thats it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;neither pro nor con: leaves hair feeling very stripped when you rinse it out which i guess you would think means its good for oily hair. but no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: does not clean as well as even regular dollar store shampoo. on top of that, hair got oilier even quicker. and im talking waaay oilier. by the next morning my hair was more like third day hair. what a letdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used this for a few weeks just to be sure it wasnt hormone related or whatever. in fact im gonna continue to use this since im not wasteful, it smells sorta nice, and its natural. if i change my mind, ill change this review. for now, definitely would never recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: this gave me scalp pimples whenever i used it, and that is not a problem i have had to deal with before from a shampoo. i believe its possible this is just too harsh on my scalp. i tried not using it then going back to it, several times, and each time it broke out my scalp. so thats another reason it sucks.</li>
            <li> I have med thick wavy hair, porous, that gets oily on top.  The last 8 or so shampoo&#x27;s I have bought have been a disaster.  They weigh my hair down, build up the more you use it, and make it so I must wash my hair every day.  I bought the Lemon shampoo and conditioner as I read someone else say that it was the best ever.  Now, I can wash my hair every other day, and the second day, my hair is bouncy and full just like the first!  Other shampoos have silicones in them to slick the hair shaft.  The second day, my hair looked flat and greasy.  The conditioner also allows me to put it even on my scalp and not just the ends.  Other conditioners were so heavy I couldn&#x27;t put them anywhere but my ends because they would flatten the scalp hair with too many oils.  Also....the tea tree does your scalp wonders.  My scalp had been a little itchy, and if I scratched it, there was that moist white \\&quot;coating\\&quot; under my fingernails.  Just one shampoo with the Lemon shampoo and your scalp will feel \\&quot;normal\\&quot;, and if you scratch your head, there will be next to nothing under your nails.  My hair just feels so much healthier.  Not dry, not oily.  Just perfect.  I have also used it about 3 times now, every other day, and it does not build up to make your hair flatter and flatter.  It&#x27;s bright and fluffy every time.  Will stick with this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter&#x27;s oily hair.  She didn&#x27;t like shampooing everyday.  This shampoo reduced the necessity to twice a week.  Very nice and a large tube at that. It is concentrated so a little goes a long way. 2 shampoos are necessary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen no difference in my hair... only it makes it EXTREMELY tangled...and that&#x27;s with using the conditioner. My hair is just as oily as it was with other products. Nearly impossible to brush it out after getting out of the shower, though. [my hair is very long, thick, and fine...almost to my booty]</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I&#x27;ve found.  I react &amp; get headaches with mainstream hair care.  Many of the choices at the HFS don&#x27;t treat my hair well, too strong.  I have fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Does not help oily hair. I still have to wash my hair every day when using this shampoo and I don&#x27;t notice that my hair gets any less oily than when I use any other shampoo. Also, I don&#x27;t love the sme.</li>
            <li> My mother has very oily scalp and before this shampoo she had to wash her hair every single day. She tried all kinds of shampoo and nothing worked until I discovered this shampoo on amazon and bought it for her to see if it worked and  IT DID!!!!...now she washes her hair twice a week...it leaves her hair shiny and soft and it takes the oil away plus even though it is only a small tube it is very concentrated and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. She has long hair and I buy it once a month....it is fantastic!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo after struggling to find a shampoo that would get the oil out of my hair- and it worked fairly well. I think it would be good for people who have extra oil in their hair, but not extremely oily hair, like mine. This one kept my hair clean during the daytime (which is 12 hours or so), which is better than most shampoo, but didn&#x27;t make it clean enough for me to not have to wash it to go out at night. (I tried this to try to get a better smelling shampoo than the one I currently use)  I thought it smelled very good, it DOES smell like that lemony floor cleaner scent as you are washing your hair, but once it is rinsed out it leaves a nice, clean, non overpowering scent. (My 2 year old sniffed the bottle and asked if it was food, it smells so good!)  As for the comments about it being too thick for the bottle, I must assume the thickness has been changed, it came out perfectly fine for me. I was actually surprised by the fact that it was a little runny, and squeezed hard because of the comments... ended up with a huge hand full.  Also, it foams up very very well, so start with a small amount and work your way up.</li>
            <li> So far I have not had any issues using this product and it defintely seems to eliminate some of the oily issues i have. It does not smell bad at all. I would recommend using another conditioner, the conditioner does not seem to be as good as the shampoo. I am experimenting with different kinds.   While I am not sure this shampoo is the best for oily hair, it definitely helps and is affordable.   Only thing is that it was hard to find other than online.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!!!!! Great product for oily hair!!! love it</li>
            <li> compared to the other shampoos out there , this shampoo is great. cleans well and smells good. the only problem I have is that the shampoo gets used up quickly so you need more product. also don&#x27;t skip your conditioner for the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li> Lathers up good,but its really drying.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells good but I don&#x27;t think it does a good job in preventing oily hair, as a matter of fact I find myself need twice the dose to remove the oil from my hair than the shampoo I used to have. Also my hair gets oily quicker than before. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smelling good shampoo. It says that it is for oily hair. It washes hair well and makes it shiny and soft, but does does not eliminate the problem of excess oil. Hair still needs to be washed every day. I would buy it again if I did not have to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> My daughter has pretty greasy hair, and this stuff is one of the only shampoos that keeps it &#x27;tamed&#x27; so it doesn&#x27;t get greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after a day or two it keeps the greasy aspects well in check.. I am a long time customer of this after seeing it for myself.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair with absolutely no body.  Think I&#x27;ll save this for washing the dogs.  I&#x27;m not sure why it got good reviews, it really has no good redeeming value.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo a lot. It smells great and it lathers like normal shampoo (it weirds me out when shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather). This shampoo is great in my opinion, the only thing is I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s made a difference in the greasiness of my hair. If it has made a difference it&#x27;s only minimal. I&#x27;m still going to use it though.</li>
            <li> My favourite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is ok, it smells pretty nice and does a decent job on control my oily hair. However, the bottle was not good. the shampoo was leaking  out from the bottle and caused a mess.</li>
            <li> Lemon Tea Tree Shampoo:  I have had scalp acne for a few years, since the birth of my son.  I didn&#x27;t think I had really oily hair, but after a lot of research I found that one of the triggers for scalp acne is oily scalp and a build-up of bacteria.  I tried a shampoo/conditioner with an antibacterial agent but it felt like it made my hair more oily.  I heard on a forum that this was worth trying.    I am sold.  This is what I will always use.  I bought the conditioner as well which isn&#x27;t wonderful after the shower as it does not have a lot of de-tangler, but my hair is incredibly healthy, has great volume, non-greasy for at least 2 days (so I can skip a day washing occasionally) and my scalp acne is nearly non-existent.  The product smells very lemony but once it is dry it is not over-powering.  I will continue to buy these products!</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time regarding shampooing my hair since the end of last year before I found this.  I tried to be poo-free but my hair was sticky even it was washed every day.  I had to get back to using head-and-shoulders.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell of head-and-shoulders but my hair felt better after using it.  I tried other brands of shampoo but I started to have scalps.  I&#x27;ve been using this Desert Essence organics hair care shampoo for more than a month.  My hair feels really good every time after being washed with it: smooth, soft, fresh and no scalps at all!  And no chemicals because it&#x27;s organics!  I love this shampoo and am so glad that I finally found a solution to the hair shampooing problem.  Now I can stay away from chemicals in the regular shampoos.  I recommend it to all ladies who are looking for organics shampoo.  It&#x27;s a good deal and great for your hair and the environment at the same time.</li>
            <li> I only used it twice and I could already feel the difference. My hair is muchhhh less oily now. I usually have to wash my hair everyday but thanks to this product, I guess I can reduce the frequency of hairwashes per week now. This is perfect for people with really oily hair (btw my hair is straight and fine), the only con is that it kinda makes your hair a little tangled but that doesn&#x27;t defeat the purpose. I guess using the conditioner will help solve that problem. Overall I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoos.  i had settled on hurts bees for a while because they don&#x27;t have any synthetics or petroleum products, etc...but they went and changed their formula...i smelled like a syrupy cupcake and my hair went frizzy and fly away.&lt;br /&gt;ok. Desert Essence is expensive.  BUT...you don&#x27;t have to use as much product to get your hair clean and it does what it says.  Now, keep in mind that humans are all different and have different chemistry.  If this product doesn&#x27;t control your oil issues, use some thing else.  but, you might need a dry shampoo if you have that much oil in your scalp!&lt;br /&gt;i have very oily hair and scalp and work in remodeling and construction.  I am filthy and grimy when i get home.  never have an oil control issue with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product is made in the USA and is good for the environment and for you.  i think you might be hooked, if you like citrus, too.</li>
            <li> this shampoo does really clean up oil buildups.  the scent is great!  it does its job!  and it&#x27;s one of the cheaper brands out there.  would def add to my subscribe and save so I can get them continually with a discount.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did not help with oily hair. I saw no difference with this shampoo compared to Suave or any other cheap shampoo. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This product works. My hair was oily and smelly and this helped alot. It also made my hair soft. The smell of this shampoo at first was a nice lemony smell... Now not so much, doesn&#x27;t lather up like a typical shampoo, but it&#x27;s still effective.</li>
            <li> Made my scalp break out badly. Really badly.  Almost felt like a rash.  And this stuff burned.  Ouch.  Stay away.</li>
            <li> This shapoo really really good for oily hair. Using regular shampoos always made my head itchy and my hair very oily. After using this shampoo with warm water (not super hot because that can cause oily hair too) i have noticed a difference in my hair and I can definitely go atleast 2 days without having to wash it again. My head does not get itchy any more. The shampoo lasts a surprising long time as well. My hair is slightly over shoulder length and this shampoo/conditioner lasts 2.5 months for me, used every other day. Good product worth the price.</li>
            <li> Purchased this on recommendation from a blog that had a list of shampoos for oily hair. Supposed to help oily hair be less oily. That was not my experience. This seemed to make my oil problem worse, by the end of the day it looked like I never bothered to shower. Tried it for 2 weeks, never improved so it went back. Was better off with a basic shampoo from the drugstore! Plus- it doesn&#x27;t smell that great, the lemon &amp; tea tree tree have a medical-type odor to them, I found.</li>
            <li> This is a clarifying shampoo, hence, should be used once or twice a month as it strips healthy oils from hair but it&#x27;s great because removes product build up from scalp. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> I use this every day for about 1 year now. Have had no problems with drying out, build up, itching etc... nothing at all. My hair is oily &amp; it has worked great. I also use the conditioner about 1 time per week or when I feel my hair needs it (like after swimming etc...) I love this shampoo and the lemon scent really wakes you up if you shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> Finally I found a shampoo for oily hair, instead of the ever-present \\&quot;for dry or frizzy hair,\\&quot; on the bottle. And it works! My hair feels healthier and cleaner for the whole day. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair at all. It&#x27;s more liquid-y than a regular shampoo but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot, just a little circle in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Lemon Tea Tree-scented one because it was the cheapest one. God, it stunk. I&#x27;m not a fan of lemon to begin with, so it probably might smell great to everyone else, but I always smell like I just washed my hair with dish soap. I&#x27;ll definitely spend an extra dollar or two on a better smelling one next time because it&#x27;s worth it. Don&#x27;t hesitate, this stuff really does work!</li>
            <li> Smells great, does not leave my hair frizzy or flat, and this little tube of shampoo lasts longer than expected.  The best part is that it does not contain ingredients I avoid like sodium benzoate, tocopherols (vitamin E), wheat, or silicone chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for years to find a shampoo for my oily hair. The Lemon Tea Tree shampoo is by far the best I have ever had. It smells great, it lasts a long time, and I can actually condition my hair now without looking like I&#x27;ve worked in a kitchen all day.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE. This product made my hair fall out like crazy. I hate it. Will never buy again. DON&#x27;T BUY IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several and for the price and quality, this is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve tried.  I had to wash my hair daily and with this shampoo, I wash 3 times a week and a dry shampoo in between work outs does the trick!</li>
            <li> I wrote my review for this under the conditioner by mistake.  But same thing.  If you have oily hair, it&#x27;s amazing.  Will clean the heck out of it and leave it smelling great!  Remember &amp;#34;Love&#x27;s LEMON UP&amp;#34; shampoo from the 70&#x27;s.  Almost the same here.  It&#x27;s really concentrated, so a VERY LITTLE goes a long way (like the Prell concentrated).  One of these lasts me for months.</li>
            <li> This was really waste of money. My hair was the same as using The $2 bottle from suave which does much better job. The lid broke after couple use and start leaking.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep my oily hair not oily!  It worked great for 3 weeks.  But now my hair seems to be getting oily quickly again.  I just use this and another shampoo and trade off ever two weeks.</li>
            <li> If you truly have oily hair this stuff is amazing. I have used a lot of other shampoos,  and most just don&#x27;t strip enough oil out of my hair and off my scalp. This is the only one I have ever used that would actually keep my hair looking clean for 24 hours. Typically if I wash my hair in the evening I am a grease ball by morning, but not with this stuff. If you have the same problem, buy his shampoo. If not, skip it. You will end up with straw for hair.</li>
            <li> I have struggled all my life with oily hair and take 2 showers a day most days.  It really is quite embarrassing to be so oily at the end of my days.  This shampoo has been wonderful.  I no longer have to take a shower twice every single day.  I believe it really is working.  I like the light lemon scent too...not too strong.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an ingredient snob nowadays. I&#x27;d rather my skincare products and cosmetics have ingredients I can pronounce and conceivably manufacture myself if I had the materials. For example, instead of waterlogged lotions full of preservatives and stearic acid (I dare you to look up where that comes from), I just use a bottle of shea or avocado oil, cold-pressed from the actual fruit.&lt;br /&gt;However, the all-natural shampoo options out there are limited to castile soap type formulations that leave my hair caked in residue, despite all the vinegar rinses in the world. So I make a compromise and get something MOSTLY all-natural. This shampoo is formulated without the worst offenders, and it works!&lt;br /&gt;I have oily hair, so I lather, rinse, repeat. It has a nice, lemony scent and leaves nothing behind.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of buying the conditioner, I just rub in a dab of pure argan oil into my hair before blow-drying. I haven&#x27;t had a split end since I started this routine. And if you do some research, you can find very cheap argan oil from soap-making supply stores online. Don&#x27;t pay the Josie Maran price, for sure.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, but unfortunately did not work for my extremely oily hair, it was like I hadn&#x27;t washed it at all.</li>
            <li> Bought this to hopefully not have my hair feeling greasy after not washing my hair for a couple days. Works well initially but after a day in a half i see no difference in using this product and lets say something like a Garnier shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo to remove all the excess build up from hair products and it is great for oily hair too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was VERY oily...i use to have to wash it every single freaking day. However, since using this shampoo, i was able to adjust it to every other day and eventually it somehow trained my hair to only needing a wash every 3 days! its tough to get through the in between days at first but once you get there its amazing! i don&#x27;t know how i managed to wash my hair everyday before!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a huge plus is this has great ingredients that your scalp will be grateful for in the long run :)</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  I have very oily hair and it does a nice job cleaning it without weighing it down.  My only complaint/wish is that it came in a different container.  I find that if I store the bottle on it&#x27;s cap (as pictured), it often leaks and makes a big mess.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is good, but it doesn&#x27;t have any scent that is close to lemon. It smells like any other cheap shampoo.</li>
            <li> Works great on my oily hair. It is soft and manageable and I can use it every day without a problem. Love that it doesn&#x27;t have any of the sulfates, parabens, or phthalates.</li>
            <li> My all time fave shampoo. Clears my scalp and great for hot, humid climates. The ingredients are truly organic without any of the sneaky sulfates or other carcinagens the other so called &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; shampoos try to fool you with. It smells amazing and feels so good!</li>
            <li> I bought the yellow one and REALLY HATE IT.&lt;br /&gt;First, its poorly designed bottle really annoyed me. The bottle cup not fit the opening, shampoo always flowing everywhere massed up my bathtub... the only way to fix it is putting the bottle upside down : (&lt;br /&gt;Second, it totally could not control my oily hair. I usually wash my hair on night but at the following morning, my hair become oil again. Also, the itchy scalp just made me crazy.</li>
            <li> My eldest, a bit past teen, still uses this when the hair is really getting oily, but it is otherwise too strong/stripping.  I&#x27;m sure it would be a nightmare on my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair (slightly oily, but aging).  For my youngest, it&#x27;s a necessity.  There&#x27;s almost nothing else out there that de-gunks that hair.  I&#x27;m talking about hair that appears to be about three days post-shampoo even after multiple rinse/repeats.  I once found something at a salon that helped, but it cost about twice the asking for this product.  And it wasn&#x27;t organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the grease cutting action, it&#x27;s still gentle and has a mild, pleasant scent that I can appreciate only because my kid&#x27;s hair is finally, actually, squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Works great for me so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since a year ago, my hair suddenly became really oily. Doesn&#x27;t matter if I cut it short or let it grow out, it&#x27;s oily half a day after I wash it. As a guy, people just think that I use hair gel but I dislike the feeling. Been looking for a shampoo to keep my hair oil free for a long time and most do not work much better than ordinary shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does the trick. My hair is less oily and stays that way longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel that it dries out my hair a bit too much and leaves it kinda &#x27;dry&#x27; as I&#x27;m finishing my shower. The good thing is it doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair after and the dry feeling goes away in a few minutes. I&#x27;m thinking maybe use this on alternate days with a regular shampoo...I&#x27;ll see how how that works out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, a week in, I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li> I wanted an all natural shampoo and conditioner, I was trying things on the internet I&#x27;ve read like using baking soda and lemon and cider vinegar.. that stuff just isn&#x27;t for me! This shampoo reminds me of how it made my hair feel though when I was using those things, it makes it feel kind of stripped and tough, the conditioner is great and makes it nice and manageable after using the shampoo. I have a patch of dry skin on my scalp and it does seem to help, not take it away but it doesn&#x27;t make it worse which a lot of other products will do. I will continue to use!</li>
            <li> I have very thin and oily hair, this shampoo makes it a little better without making my hair too dry.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s made out of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients too :)</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and try to always use organic products, so I thought I would give this a whirl.  The lemon scent is barely there.  It would have been nice if it was stronger.  It did not leave my hair as soft and shiny as I prefer, so I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I am really like this product so far. I have used it about 5 times. My hair is sometimes oily by midday and I can&#x27;t stand that. I had never really thought about buying shampoo online, but I decided to when I saw this. I love the lemon scent that it has. you only need about a dime size dollap of the shampoo. Start lathering up at your roots and let the suds fall down to the rest of your hair and use your hands to get all of the hair too. It works great!</li>
            <li> I had oily hair, but now its stripping my hair of all its oil. My hair is dry and falling. i tried using shampoo and conditioner and washing 2x a week. i tried using the shampoo and conditioner at the same time. i try using only one or the other. it doesnt matter, my hair is getting worse and worse, HORRIBLE product!</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t believe the reasonable price. It is the first shampoo that actually keeps the oils at bay on day 2.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for oily hair so far.  Combined with the conditioner, it&#x27;s a perfect pair.  The lemon smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who is going thru puberty and her hair has become more oily. This is great because it does not dry the scalp out and leave it flaky. It gently cleanses the scalp and hair, leaving the hairy shiny and manageable. Other shampoos weren&#x27;t cleaning her hair well and it was leaving her hair dull and limp, and still looked oily. But I didn&#x27;t want to just get her a harsh clarifying shampoo because that wouldn&#x27;t be good for scalp. I highly recommend this shampoo for oily hair and scalp!</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give this a try after reading all the reviews. Sadly, it did not work for my hair. It was oily the next morning after shampooing with this at night.</li>
            <li> Reduces oilyness in hair without drying out. After months of use, however, my scalp is beginning to get oily 12-24 hours after use.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is missing!!! Only an empty envelope teared in one side! It is not the fault of the postman. Because it is cannot tell from the outside. It is not the fault of my neighbor since there is nobody live in my floor. And the girls live upstairs are my friends.&lt;br /&gt;The envelope is just too thin and small. Why did not you using the cardboard box like always? I was purchasing from Amazon for more than 5 years. And I was doing online purchase since I was teen. This is the 1ST time my product lost in the transit due to the improper packaging.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo that works great for oily hair.  I&#x27;ve tried many products &amp; so far this beats them all.  This product arrived on time and I highly recommend it for those that have oily hair.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to go 3 days between hair washes, sometimes 4. For some reason, since I moved to the Northeast last summer (I&#x27;m from the South), my hair has been getting oily within a day. I&#x27;m not sure why; it could be the environment, the water here, or the change in lifestyle. Either way, my hair also began getting really, really flaky; I have dark brown hair, so flakes of any sort make me look like I have dandruff and can&#x27;t take care of my personal hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was previously using Güd shampoo from Bert&#x27;s Bees (which I still really love!), but it wasn&#x27;t taking care of my hair like I needed since I moved north.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Lemon Tea Tree shampoo for about four weeks now and man, have I seen a difference. My hair can make it at least two days without getting all oily and gross, and usually it&#x27;ll last three days without a wash. The flakes are gone. My hair is softer and cleaner. The results weren&#x27;t as immediate as I would&#x27;ve liked, but when are they ever? This definitely did the trick, and is absolutely worth the $8 price tag.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very oily hair and this shampoo has helped to get it under control. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, my hair feels clean and soft. However, my hair falls out in clumps with every shower. My hair also tangles easily and is hard to brush out by the end of the day, even when I&#x27;m inactively sitting in ideal indoor conditions. (I have a thick head of medium-fine hair, slightly wavy.) This never happened with my old shampoo and stopped immediately when I switched back. I would recommend using this occasionally to strip out build up of hair product, but not for regular use.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I use. Smells great, good lather, and keeps my scalp from being itchy.  Controls oily hair very well.  Worth the money and makes my thin hair look a little fuller.  The conditioner works just as good, but keep in mind that if you have thin hair you should only use a nickle size blob to smooth through your hair starting at the ends. Doesn&#x27;t need to be left in long to do the trick and rinse with cool water.  Hot water will only weigh your hair down when rinsing conditioner and defeat the purpose of these products.</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo I have found so far. I have long hair and I try to go every other day for washing it. This is difficult bc my scalp gets very oily. I would get dandruff and just had a very unpleasant time trying to find a good shampoo thats not extremely overpriced. The medicated shampoos only give me sores on my scalp. This Lemon Tea Tree shampoo has been a life saver. It takes all the oil away and smells good. My hair is so soft. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> We have struggled for years with my daughter&#x27;s oily hair. She washed it every morning and when she got home from school it was already oily again. We have tried every expensive shampoo on the market. This overall has been the best for her hair and our wallet. While not cheap, it is inexpensive for something that works this well on hair like hers. She still has to wash her hair every day, but now we can go dinner in the evening without her having to rewash her hair. We even had family portraits done at 6:00 PM and she did not have to wash her hair before going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This photo is from our photo shoot with her hair having been washed at 6AM and the portrait being taken at 6PM!</li>
            <li> Had an allergic reaction to it, gave it to my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Ordered lemon and green apple. Got two lemons.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo that cleans well, the smell is nice but I&#x27;m a little disappointed because I was looking for a shampoo that would keep my hair clean for 3/4 days and it&#x27;s not the case with this product. I have to wash my hair every 2 days, the same result I got with chemical products. it&#x27;s still a good product that makes its job.....</li>
            <li> Finally a natural shampoo that does not weigh my hair down and make it look like I&#x27;ve washed my hair in Wesson oil! I have soft baby fine hair. It doesn&#x27;t take much to make it look lifeless. I have been looking for a natural shampoo without harsh chemicals and horrible perfumes, but as lovely as many of the natural shampoos smell, they all leave me looking like I didn&#x27;t wash my hair. Until this lemon tea tree shampoo! My hair is bouncy and fresh! There&#x27;s no residue, strong scent, or greasy feeling. My hair is fluffy and beautiful!</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. I have oily hair yet after using this shampoo, I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day now. Great!</li>
            <li> This Shampoo does nothing for your hair. Tried it for a month my hair felt oily and limp, do not buy.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a couple of times and I like it a lot. It takes away the oil pretty effectively, but I don&#x27;t really like the scent... I mean it smells nice, but it does not give the impression of being &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;... but that&#x27;s the only thing I find that I can complain. Overall it is a product that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for good things and to help my oily hair.  Didn&#x27;t do much other than regular shampoo does, if anything, it just stripped it more.  Odor wasn&#x27;t bad, though.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my oily hair. Washed it at night, woke up to oily hair and had to use dry shampoo to take the grease away. Bummer.</li>
            <li> I expected more from the product.  My body produces extra natural oils, so I purchased this item.  However, it makes my hair rough, matted at the scalp, and itchy.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great.  I have thin hair that seemed to get oily with some shampoos lately, no problems with this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband not realizing \\&quot;for oily hair\\&quot; meant it would make his hair more oily!! My daughter even tried it and it made her hair oily too.  I was so pleased to order this for a great price, but it was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these products from Desert Essence. I have super oily hair and it is a miracle worker without being too harsh for daily washing. The shampoo is light and offers a ton of coverage for just a little bit of product in your hand. Highly recommended for oily hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got an oily hair problem and this didn&#x27;t make a difference (might just be me?) except for making my hair so dry. Also, the bottle is quite small as it is and you&#x27;ve got to use so much just so it lathers... I&#x27;m just finding out now that it&#x27;s not even organic (which it labels itself as) since it has harsh detergents (which might be why my hair feels so dry after using)</li>
            <li> Product worked well, but did not use it for its original purpose. I used it by applying a bit to shirt collar and cuffs prior to laundering. It did a good job removing &amp;#34;ring around the collar&amp;#34; and cuffs! Will continue to use it for laundering.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lives up to its name, and impressed me. It is vegan (no hurting bunnies eyes!) yet still had a nice fresh smell and lathered up really well. It felt different on my scalp than traditional shampoo, but left my hair manageable, soft and it styled up and makes my hair still look manageable to wash every other day if I need to. This was a great find for me coming from using Matrix.</li>
            <li> I found this shampoo on a website that lists the 10 best shampoos for oily hair. I went with this because it was one of the few that was \\&quot;organic\\&quot; (almost!) and more affordable than the other organic shampoos on that list. I am absolutely thrilled that my hair feels like it used to earlier on (until about 6 months ago when it started becoming hopelessly oily and lifeless!). The only downside is that it could be a little too drying - so a conditioner is a must. I also mix it up with a regular shampoo because I don&#x27;t want to end up drying my scalp too much. I&#x27;ll be buying more of these. And yes, the fragrance is great, so that&#x27;s a plus. Clarification - by mix it up, I meant use this one a couple times a week and the regular one a couple times - I don&#x27;t actually mix up the two shampoos at the same time!</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily hair and this shampoo seems to be keeping it under control. I still have to use a conditioner for the ends of my hair but it has been helping with the oils at the roots. Much cheaper then in the stores if you can even find it !</li>
            <li> Good shampoo. Hair less greasy compared to using my &amp;#34;old&#x27; shampoo. Would purchase again. Good price.</li>
            <li> It helps to clean oily scalp, but the hair will feel very dry if you do not use conditioner. It smell nice, but it leaves NO SCENT after rinse off. Which can be pro or con. Since too many beauty products have too much scents around, no scent product is very special; However I also expect my hair will have a nice smell. So I will recommend to use another your favor conditioner after this shampoo. One more thing needs to mention is: the shampoo doesn&#x27;t create bubbles, or it can say small/low amount bubbles.</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars because it does indeed do a great job getting my hair clean. Although the price is better at Amazon, it is still a bit high in price. But it does work very well.</li>
            <li> Great smell that lasts! I have finally found a shampoo that takes care of my husband&#x27;s oily hair, he loves it! For the price Amazon will have many re-orders on this shampoo( and it only takes a little bit!).</li>
            <li> I had some skin acne rash on my face n was on lot of medications. I read that if ur scalp is not clean even that causes acne too. I had dandruff problems from few months. This shampoo was rated 5 for oily scalp with dandruff. After using this shampoo 2-3 times I was in love with it. My scalp doesn&#x27;t get oily soo soo. N even my dandruff was gone. But it definitely needs a conditioner too. I m in love with this shampoo, n even it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few days that I used this, it worked wonderfully. My hair felt great and it wasn&#x27;t oily at the end of the day. Now, it&#x27;s the complete opposite. It gets greasy in the middle of the day and it never feels really clean. Even after shampooing twice, it still feels like there&#x27;s stuff in there, no matter how much I rinse. I&#x27;ve never had that problem before. I&#x27;m disappointed because it worked so well at the beginning. I&#x27;m going to give the rest of the bottle a try and I&#x27;ll update if it gets better.</li>
            <li> My son has really oily hair and this shampoo is wonderful!!  He can shower at night and the next morning his hair still looks good.  I&#x27;ve tried several shampoos and this is the one!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a year now. Highly recommend for those who have oily hair. The lemon version smells very nice. It&#x27;s like Consuela is in the shower with me. It will not lather very well if your hair has gotten to oil levels high enough to stage a war, but the second rinse will get you that glorious lather that everyone desires.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo for oily hair for a long time and was so happy when I found this one. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
