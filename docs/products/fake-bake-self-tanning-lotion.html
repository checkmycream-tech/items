            <li>When people comment on my beautiful tan, they can&#x27;t believe it when I tell them it is &amp;#34;tan in a can.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>Also, this is a very potent formula and will stain your hands unless you plan on scrubbing for an hour after use, so you will definately want to use some disposable gloves!</li>
            <li>Great results.</li>
            <li>It does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never ever experienced this from a self tanner before, even the cheapies.</li>

            <li>everyone gave it really great reviews, so I wanted to write one myself since I had a good experience with this product.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use gloves and its best to use at night before bed.</li>
            <li>Works great, good color</li>
            <li>I have honestly tried everything!</li>
            <li>So I went to order more flawless and it wouldn&#x27;t arrive in time with my prime shipping</li>
            <li>go by my misfortune and shop at Altima&#x27;s the best store at Amazon:)</li>
            <li>I have many friends that are making purchases of this self tanner because it looks so great!</li>
            <li>It looks great, is easy to apply and leaves your skin feeling great!</li>
            <li>This one is the best and Amazon.com has by far the best price.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned redhead.</li>
            <li>this goes on great colours up really nice</li>
            <li>This product does a good job.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a good deal</li>
            <li>Good color, no chemically odor, &amp; doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Looks good when comes off.</li>
            <li>This is as good as getting a spray tan.  </li>
            <li>a good product that doesn&#x27;t cost $30 a bottle.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>Get a good scrub (I use a homemade sugar+olive oil scrub), and exfoliate every inch of skin you plan on applying this to.</li>
            <li>As good as a spray tan.</li>
            <li>Enjoy, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>a fair skinned person</li>
            <li>If you have patients &amp; can stand under a light &amp; put it on perfect it would be good</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this product, as I had heard awesome stuff about it.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and looks great.</li>
            <li>This gives me to most beautiful color without being orange.</li>
            <li>but after that shower the next day it blends perfectly and looks great!</li>
            <li>Swedish Beauty Botanicals has a great self tanner for the face and body, is cheap and smells great.</li>
            <li>i love the product and i feel it was a great price for what i got.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Good luck , happy safe self tanning</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many tanning products but since finding this one I have not used another one!!</li>
            <li>Great product worth the cost, time, and saves your skin!!</li>
            <li>Ok!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get better than this AT ALL!</li>
            <li>but it truly is my favorite sunless tanner and believe me, I have tried A LOT!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best.&amp;#34;  I ordered some and love it!</li>
            <li>I got more compliments from this product than from using the mystic tanning booths, or airbrush tan!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion!</li>
            <li>and I love it, but for some reason the lotion I received when applied looks Grayish/green!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>U love it!</li>
            <li>and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff a couple times a week and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>The results are amazing, but you won&#x27;t go from pasty to brown.  </li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>but I liked it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my skin orange but just a nice brown.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t slept with it overnight because I feel kind of grody while I&#x27;m wearing this, and I don&#x27;t want to stain my sheets.    </li>
            <li>So this is a really nice self tanner.</li>
            <li>Spray tans do not work nearly as nice as this product</li>
            <li>Use exfoliation gloves you can find at any drugstore, and don&#x27;t bother with scrubs (like the paste kind that come in a tube or tub), they just don&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice brown color.</li>
            <li>After you use this cream a couple of times, you will find your own tricks to make applying easier for you.</li>
            <li>It kind of looks splotchy.</li>
            <li>I love love love his stuff!!</li>
            <li>I mainly use it after showering and results are best after shaving.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and looks good too.</li>
            <li>Strong smell but good color in one application.</li>
            <li>But you would have a better chance of getting hit by a train to have it happen to you, i have read so many good testimonials about this product</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t streak and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to use.</li>
            <li>, I love the color I get from this and think it&#x27;s one of the best sunless tanning systems out there right now besides Famous Daves. :)</li>
            <li>works well and great price, fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>This product was perfect for removing the whitiness and leaving my legs perfectly natural looking.  </li>
            <li>But a coworker always has just a nice glow, nothing overpowering but just healthy looking, so I asked her</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best product so far.</li>
            <li>This is truly the best sunless tanning product I have used so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never given me anything but flawless, natural color.  </li>
            <li>This appears to be, by far, the best self tanner I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li>Your reviews made purchasing and using this product so easy and helpful!</li>
            <li>Nice golden tan that doesn&#x27;t streak or smell!!  </li>
            <li>I bought this after reading great reviews and my own mom having try and really like the product.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and produces a nice, bronzy even tan.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to several co-workers and all have had a wonderful experience with this product.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product--definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>I get more then one when I order.  </li>
            <li>what more could you ask?  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find a better price than here on Amazon either.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the place to purchase this as well. :)</li>
            <li>This is even better than a tan from the sun because it applies evenly</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite self tanner that I have been using for over 5 years.</li>
            <li>Love this self tanner.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks like many of the rows of products you would see at a salon or spa/salon/tanning place.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, its not permanent, and it gets much better after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too cute when wearing your flip flops.</li>
            <li>gives me a nice light brown tan with just one use.  </li>
            <li>I have tried MANY self tanners, and this is my favorite one for body.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is wonderful but once opened it doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>I have used this for about 12 yrs now and love the results.</li>
            <li>It smells much better than most</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a gradual tanner before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Every time after that, however, I was a bit more generous</li>
            <li>I stopped using it until my friend told me she just puts in on in the morning then puts her clothes and makeup on top of it.</li>
            <li>If you want to be tanner just re-apply, wait many hours or sleep on it, and shower again.</li>
            <li>This product transforms me into a light brown tan person!</li>
            <li>You will not find a better one on the market.</li>
            <li>ok so i just bought this product</li>
            <li>please i want more information until i put this on...</li>
            <li>so please anyone give me more information</li>
            <li>I would reccomed getting some of your own gloves however, because mine didn&#x27;t fit and one of them tore.</li>
            <li>Really bummed because I was happy with the color I got out of it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lotion is my favorite</li>
            <li>i wish i had ordered more .</li>
            <li>Once you get to the tan level you want, just make sure you apply every 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li>Ok so I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>However, be sure to use gloves...</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has a walnut-colored color guide.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many self tanning products over the years.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Softening lotion will help eliminate this.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Softening lotion will help eliminate this.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and Im glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love the gradual dissipation of this tanner.  </li>
            <li>Love Love love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a lot of time before you apply.</li>
            <li>You can try many products out there with aroma and without, with all sorts of ingredients .</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and all have given better results than this.</li>
            <li>jergens more orange.  </li>
            <li>Not orange and no terrible smell.</li>
            <li>I used this product with latex gloves and was pleased with the color.  </li>
            <li>If you do chose to purchase this product, which I don&#x27;t recommend, but if you must, they have separate products for hands and face that I may work better</li>
            <li>(I purchased more because I use it often).</li>
            <li>When used lightly every couple of days, I have a nice healthy tan WITHOUT the sun.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT addition to my summer wardrobe.</li>
            <li>Like it.. but can use a store bought product and get better results</li>
            <li>I am glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li>The product I received was runny, greenish in color and not even able to be used.</li>
            <li>I also bought the body polish and the after smoothie which I&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t have to have</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my favorite self tanner I have purchased.</li>
            <li>The color guard is wonderful, definitely recommend both tanners for beginners as well.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The next day when you shower it will wash off to a perfect even tan.</li>
            <li>There are better cheaper products out there.</li>
            <li>and I receive many compliments.</li>
            <li>of Luck,&lt;br /&gt;~ SkyLee :)</li>
            <li>I had tried everything from drugstore brands to $50/tube stuff from Sephora...and didn&#x27;t love any of them.</li>
            <li>Sure...</li>
            <li>I will def be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Enjoy! :)</li>
            <li>However, this product WILL darken you many MANY shades.  </li>
            <li>after jumping in the shower most all of the color washes off.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the store I ordered from.</li>
            <li>I have so many tricks I use when applying.</li>
            <li>I suggest trying anything for oneself before dismissing it but make sure you have no plans for a while (perhaps apply at night a couple hours before bed).</li>
            <li>I have used many self tanners and this one is strange.&lt;br /&gt;Dark</li>
            <li>so I have never tried layering it on so many times to achieve this effect.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>(reviews seemed okay).</li>
            <li>I prefer a naural tan, but this is second best.  </li>
            <li>So much better than baking in ther sun and ruining your skin.</li>
            <li>but I love the way it looks on my skin.</li>
            <li>Way better and cheaper then spray tans</li>
            <li>and she keeps wanting more so</li>
            <li>The next morning got up and showered and had a awesome tan.</li>
            <li>I love this tanning product.  </li>
            <li>I has an interesting coloring, it&#x27;s more bronze than anything else</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>best thing about this is the fact that it does last a while.</li>
            <li>be sure to wear gloves, it will stain your hands.</li>
            <li>Its ok.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead and have never ever been able to tan.</li>
            <li>I was glad</li>
            <li>I notice if I start to sweat it doesn&#x27;t create nearly as great of a tan in that particular area..     </li>
            <li>I have fair skin which rarely tans, my arms get a light brown from outdoor summer activities, but my stomach has not seen the light of day in years!</li>
            <li>Never before has there been a sunless product that I have loved so much!</li>
            <li>, it must be pretty good</li>
            <li>I read the reviews for this and decided to give it a shot- for the price, it is pretty dang good.</li>
            <li>IT when it&#x27;s FRESH!!</li>
            <li>Will always use as I don&#x27;t let my fair skin get too much sun anymore :-)</li>
            <li>The spray and this lotion are pretty much the same, flawless application, nice smell, wonderful natural tan that you can control depending on how many application you use.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to enjoy the bronzing color</li>
            <li>While this went on &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; after it&#x27;s rubbed in, it looks great and overnight it leaves a natural looking &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>If I had pink or no undertones, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have been very happy with the light tan this produced.</li>
            <li>I was also excited because I&#x27;d gotten it so cheap!</li>
            <li>I have used other products but this is by for the best.</li>
            <li>so you can see where it&#x27;s going--it washes off when you shower) but it dries evenly and creates a lovely dark medium tan that looks good on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>If you make a mistake, you can easily wash it off in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The colorant in the product makes it easy to see where it&#x27;s been applied.  </li>
            <li>i also received it very quickly too.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as easy to apply as others that I have used.</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to apply and looks even.  </li>
            <li>application was a bit tricky, but because there is color in the lotion, it&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;ve applied it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy, you don&#x27;t look orange, and it don&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and no streaks.  </li>
            <li>Its so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy with gloves</li>
            <li>Blends in easily.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to apply</li>
            <li>It spread easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because of the strong \\&quot;skunky\\&quot; odor it produces when it dries.</li>
            <li>and it is the best product that I have been able to find so far that leaves a natural looking tan!</li>
            <li>This product gives your skin a nice glow that is a pretty color.</li>
            <li>Make sure - MAKE CERTAIN - That you wear the gloves included, there is a reason why they are in there!!</li>
            <li>It even looks good freshly appiled--you could wear it before a night out if you thought you wouldn&#x27;t sweat too much!  </li>
            <li>So you know exactly if you miss a spot, plus, you have an instant and perfectly brown tan!!  </li>
            <li>But you can most likely ate not going to find a successful color.</li>
            <li>Put it on and it goes on really easily and smooth.</li>
            <li>My legs were fine</li>
            <li>I used it on my face and liked the color it gave; I have large pores and it didn&#x27;t make me look speckled or anything.  </li>
            <li>Lotion went on evenly and smoothly, and I loved the natural looking tan it gave.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re ok with all this hassle, then you do get a nice natural looking tan which lasts about 3 to 5 days.</li>
            <li>but i got a huge burning rash on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li>They are huge on my hands</li>
            <li>I guess cheapness and being available at the drugstore.   </li>
            <li>Following the directions and the tips in these reviews and this stuff should work great for you.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be left with a great bronzed sun-kissed tan.</li>
            <li>I have used almost every self-tanning product available.</li>
            <li>You will be VERY brown after application, but when you shower, it will wash off leaving the nice non-streaky tan.</li>
            <li>No annoying scent.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like how light the effect was.</li>
            <li>The color it gave me was fantastic and it CAN be built upon.</li>
            <li>This is where being a guy becomes important.</li>
            <li>I have since bought a tanning mit and a box of latex gloves that fit my hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to suck it up and spend the money for this tanner, because it&#x27;s WORTH</li>
            <li>I used to use Banana Boat&#x27;s Deep/Dark tanner, and even though it would give me a great color, it would still look blotchy at times, especially on the hands/feet.</li>
            <li>I cannot express how happy I am with this enough.</li>
            <li>but know that it is important to avoid the sun.</li>
            <li>I can put this on and have a great tan instantly.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth and won&#x27;t leave color on your palms.  </li>
            <li>Use gloves that fit your hands.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice real looking tan with just a couple applications.  </li>
            <li>but overall it works great and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks</li>
            <li>but if you have time to reshower the next morning good to go:)</li>
            <li>:) It will show up on your light colored clothes but washes right out.</li>
            <li>and I was really excited to get this because I had heard such great things about it</li>
            <li>It is very fast working which I love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather smell funny then ruin my skin from tanning beds or sunlight :)</li>
            <li>Make sure to exfoliate first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because this stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>but the long term color is great.</li>
            <li>, this is the only one I have purchased more than once because I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Instead what the makers of this product should have done is to add the mitten to the original and maybe design a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I have used tanning products before so This actually made me more weary on what kind I use.</li>
            <li>Over the last 11 years and trying professional and drugstore self-tanners, I have found the Biotherm SUNTAN Sunless Tanning Milk for Legs and Body works the best.  </li>
            <li>On a positive note, after using this tanner, I looked the most tan I have ever been (except when using a bronzing gel which washed off).</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and left me with a nice color, no streaking and the scent was fine as well.</li>
            <li>it also smells like crayons which is not horrible, but it does give you a very realistic tan.  </li>
            <li>And cheap;)!</li>
            <li>With this product I have a nice glow and a soft tan on my face and arms.  </li>
            <li>The color actually looks good with my hair</li>
            <li>It is keeping me out of the sun and a true time saver.</li>
            <li>this is the color that makes you look true brown and not organge.</li>
            <li>I love that it looks real.</li>
            <li>I am Irish with fair complected skin and I burn when I am in the sun or tanning beds, I try to avoid this like the plague</li>
            <li>the lotion is easier for me, but the spray gives a more intense color.</li>
            <li>However if you want a full blown tan in a bottle, this may be too conservative.  </li>
            <li>It has a real tan color and you can just add more if you want it darker.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice because you can rub it off before it sets in completely</li>
            <li>absolute favorite has been the sun labs.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>next morning I take a shower and the tan is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I just brush it down onto the tops of my hands and feet, and it blends beautifully.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is pretty easy to apply, just keep rubbing it in until it is even.</li>
            <li>It applied evenly and easily and I could see visible results after the first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to stop going to the tanning salon to save my skin; seen too many older sun wrinkled people.</li>
            <li>&amp; YES..I tried it twice to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a fluke even applying more the second go around.    </li>
            <li>It dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Fake bake is my favorite tanning product and this stuff works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different self tanning lotions and sprays and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Luckily it&#x27;s winter</li>
            <li>I love Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li>will more than likely buy more after I run out.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, not messy</li>
            <li>and that is the only stuff that works for me on my very light fair completed sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try, because like I said, I don&#x27;t want to live a life full of &#x27;what-ifs?&#x27;</li>
            <li>The lotion went on really great,  Did not take long to dry maybe 10 minutes at the most!</li>
            <li>the morning, shower, and go about your normal routine and enjoy your tan!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice being able to apply this before going to bed and not having to re-apply it in the morning like other lotions.    </li>
            <li>but I did use the gloves, because when you really see where it is, you end up rubbing it in more, and therefore getting a much more natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>It helps this tanner stay darker longer and the new formula for Jergens absorbs into the skin better and doesn&#x27;t have that peculiar smell.</li>
            <li>I found that a slightly damp makeup sponge makes a great applicator and helps spread it evenly.</li>
            <li>I got this item for almost half price from amazon and worked great.</li>
            <li>It looks like a real tan!!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>The product gives you a instant bronze color making it easy to apply but make sure you wear gloves.</li>
            <li>I have used a couple different self tanners (the cheapo ones and the more high end) and I was really excited to get this because I had heard such great things about it.</li>
            <li>If you take your time &amp; do it right, you will love the natural tan results!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair, and was only looking to remove the florescent blue-whiteness of my legs so that I could wear summer skirts and swimsuits without looking like I had \\&quot;naked legs\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>gives the best, most real looking, deep dark tan out there!</li>
            <li>I waited a few weeks after using to review this product, and I must say it is great.</li>
            <li>You get great color with this product and don&#x27;t have to apply it everyday.</li>
            <li>That said, on cleansed, exfoliated skin this product delivers a nice golden tan which lasts for a few days, more if you repeat the process.  </li>
            <li>The next day it is a nice tan on my legs, arms and face.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Gives the most natural color.</li>
            <li>Obviously I cant speak for anyone else but use caution with this or any kind of product</li>
            <li>It does take some time to apply, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>but the results are well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I had ordered indoor tanning lotions for tanning beds off Amazon before, and they were all fresh when shipped to me.</li>
            <li>It gives the fastest, most natural colour as well as lots of moisture.</li>
            <li>So, what works for me is making sure I have a coat or two of clear nail polish on my fingernails and toenails before I sunless tan.  </li>
            <li>So, what works for me is making sure I have a coat or two of clear nail polish on my fingernails and toenails before I sunless tan.  </li>
            <li>leaves you with a golden tan, NOT orange.</li>
            <li>and though I tan easily, I don&#x27;t want to end up being wrinkled and leathery when I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>This is actually fun</li>
            <li>This is the most natural looking tan I can get without the sun.</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>It is priced just right, you can&#x27;t find any other self tanner that works priced this cheap, which I love!</li>
            <li>I have found other products I like better, This one is ok, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep working with this product, though, as I think it is better than most of the other self-tanners out there.</li>
            <li>It dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you keep it in the refrigerator till ready to use if you order more than one bottle at a time or over a long period of time.</li>
            <li>Washes right out of everything.</li>
            <li>BTW, when I got some on my bathroom rug I threw it in the wash right away</li>
            <li>but it washes right out.</li>
            <li>This stuff will stain your hands even if you wash them right after application.</li>
            <li>If applied right, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li>and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Right after the shower, when your skin is towel-dried, get your rubber gloves on</li>
            <li>I took the time to do it right</li>
            <li>and they were right</li>
            <li>I have previously used Jergens and Nivea gradual tans and while they were ok, I have very light skin</li>
            <li>I did the patch test and waited over 24 hours to make sure there were no bad skin reactions, but after using it on my entire body it gave me a rash on my forearms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and had great results.</li>
            <li>What a great way to look tanned while avoiding the dangers of excessive sun-exposure.</li>
            <li>, I slept a full 8 hours and woke up ready for a shower.</li>
            <li>This product by them is not near as good as the fake bake flawless liquid pump spray,  now matter how much i exfoliated before using this, it would chunk around my ankles and knees.  </li>
            <li>I have olive skin, and this product is 100% capable of making me an Oompaloompa worthy.</li>
            <li>The clear nail polish doesn&#x27;t get stained by the tanner, and it effectively blocks the tanner from staining my natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li>The clear nail polish doesn&#x27;t get stained by the tanner, and it effectively blocks the tanner from staining my natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li>I see only these two missing from otherwise perfect product.</li>
            <li>I ordered this early last year (2013) and didn&#x27;t use it all because I&#x27;m fairly fair skinned</li>
            <li>It is a fast drying thing so you have to work quick,</li>
            <li>The color is pretty good, but I have to really work this in carefully</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the blonde hair, blue eyes, super fair skin type</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to put a little lotion on your feet and hands beforehand.</li>
            <li>The best part is, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, just ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li>I was a bit intimidated when I first put this on, as it looked like I had dumped Hershey&#x27;s syrup on my legs.</li>
            <li>) tan in a lotion that doesn&#x27;t make me look weird or streak is the best.</li>
            <li>This product gave me definite results-unlike many products where it&#x27;s a gradual color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I&#x27;m a guy, which is important because it directly relates to some points I&#x27;ll be making.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always for Bigger is Better.</li>
            <li>I like this better than a spray tan at a salon because I can control excessive color build up around my heels, toe nails and hands better in my well lit bathroom.  </li>
            <li>and I love the instant color.</li>
            <li>Also it smells at first</li>
            <li>so it would &#x27;soak in&#x27; or something, but it washed off in my first shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used almost all self tanners, since they first started coming out on the market over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>My mom and I have tried so many different self-tanning products you wouldn&#x27;t even believe it</li>
            <li>I have been using Fake Bake on my body for about 8 years and it is the best self tanner product.</li>
            <li>My first clue was when I opened the box and found a pare of gloves.</li>
            <li>My first time using it, I shaved and exfoliated, and used moisturizer on my knees, elbows, hands and feet.</li>
            <li>The odor bothered me at first, but I am getting used to it.  </li>
            <li>First self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll smell funny, it&#x27;ll get on your clothes, and you can&#x27;t avoid water during the day.  </li>
            <li>I use the Fake Bake flawless spray and my tan</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s the consistency of water....</li>
            <li>(brown to be exact)</li>
            <li>Fake bake is the perfect way to do that!</li>
            <li>Even my mom, who hates fake tans and thinks everything looks orange, was impressed and is even thinking about using it once herself.     </li>
            <li>Use gloves and use a cotton swab with lotion to blend the areas where you tanned and didn&#x27;t tan, such as at the bottom of your feet or the area where the palm and the top of your hand meet and in between your fingers and toes.</li>
            <li>then when i would apply the next time, it was flake off and chunk up some more, no where else on my body though.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the flawless spray from FAke BAke and decided to give the lotion and also the gel (darkest tan ) a try.</li>
            <li>His exact words were &amp;#34;honey</li>
            <li>suggest trying anything for oneself before dismissing it but make sure you have no plans for a while (perhaps  a couple of days and definitely apply at night before bed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is why I never leave it on for more than 3 hours, but that seems to be enough time.  </li>
            <li>but this definitely gives my paler skin a sun-kissed glow and is believable.  </li>
            <li>I really love this stuff but cant justify the price when I only used a couple times</li>
            <li>But it doesnt stay on after first shower.</li>
            <li>I kept it on for several more hours while I did chores, mid-day napped, lounged, etc.</li>
            <li>The only problem is it does wash off, but it is so much better than a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; tan.</li>
            <li>Granted, this also means it can rub off within the first couple hours</li>
            <li>really pretty tan.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and at first I wasn&#x27;t used to that.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake is the best self tanning lotion I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>It actually looked pretty good right after the application - but the color washed off the next day.  </li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced, it is natural looking, and it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Realistically it would be AMAZING if they could create a lotion that not only makes you tan but keeps you tan w/o reapplying and coming completely off at your pool party</li>
            <li>Natural coloring, a nice deep tan.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews before I purchased this and pretty much</li>
            <li>i tried other self tanners (more for price) but wasn&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li>Real color, no streaks, even through and through, and fast!</li>
            <li>thank you fake bake for developing a great sunless tanning products and also for the way you dont stink while trying to achieve a golden tan!  </li>
            <li>2 applications, roughly 2.5 hours each, took me from snow bunny white, to a warm light bronze.  </li>
            <li>You work with it at a pretty fast pace.</li>
            <li>When it goes on evenly it gives a nice dark color</li>
            <li>but it leaves no streaks behind and a beautiful color.</li>
            <li>-- nice dark color from just one application -- but</li>
            <li>buy from this particular seller again - will most likely purchase at a store where I know it&#x27;s fresh, new product.</li>
            <li>I do tan easily and have yellow undertones in my skin that make me look darker than others even when I&#x27;m not tanned.</li>
            <li>If it is streaking make sure you are completely dry of water and sweat..</li>
            <li>I recommend wearing it to bed (be sure it&#x27;s dry but any color will wash out of linens) and washing it off in the morning before you leave home.</li>
            <li>but once dry doesnt smell anymore unless you try to put lotion on top of it or sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>Perfect for an event that you want to be tan for - just shave, exfoliate, dry your skin off, and then apply this stuff and let it dry, then go to bed and shower the next day and viola!</li>
            <li>My face, arms and chest get sun easily because I kayak, but my legs are always white.</li>
            <li>Be sure to exfoliate, apply lotion to dry areas, and wear gloves.</li>
            <li>Very realistic looking tan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The dry time took Forrreverrrr and when I was finally able to go to bed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried st tropes and its almost just as nice but costs less .</li>
            <li>I have manly arms and thighs and a large chest and torso.</li>
            <li>This stuff like most sunless tanning formulas got on the top of my big toes and stained them dark orange.</li>
            <li>I put my clothes on after I&#x27;m done, but I will wear loose fitting</li>
            <li>I had previously used a more expensive mousse self-tanner that was very good, but for the money Fake Bake goes just as good a job!!</li>
            <li>For me, it worked the first time I put it on, didn&#x27;t have as strong of a smell as most self-tanners, and left a dark natural-looking tan.  </li>
            <li>No streaks, and by mixing some lotion with it to go over my knees and feet, they look pretty normal too.  </li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t do much beside that.</li>
            <li>But if you are olive or light-olive undertoned already, it probably won&#x27;t do much for you.</li>
            <li>I read many great reviews for Fake Bake Self-Tanner on different websites</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go spray tanning from time to time but found it very costly.</li>
            <li>With that said, be careful around you toes and toenails and be sure to get some exfoliating gloves to use beforehand.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well alongside tanning out in the sun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always been very light-skinned.  </li>
            <li>After using this lotion for 4 days in a row, I looked as if I had been to the tanning bed for a week straight.</li>
            <li>it really is foolproof.</li>
            <li>because i dunno when we goin to go to beach to get real tan because of the oil spill that happen in alabama by us.</li>
            <li>an di highly reccomend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>Much easier to manage than the gel.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the instructions carefully &amp; wash the applicator pad after using each time.</li>
            <li>and I really like the product.  </li>
            <li>otherwise it comes out very streaky.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Also before application put lotion on knees/ feet/elbows to prevent too much color in those areas.</li>
            <li>The color the next day is flawless and usually last a few days before I need to reapply.</li>
            <li>Just dont use too much.</li>
            <li>so I went on the hunt or a self tanner that really works.</li>
            <li>I work really fast</li>
            <li>and if you are looking for a nice tanner for your face and feet, have to say did not try the FAke BAke version, but Morrocon makes a self tanner with an amazing natural color(will leave a review for it as well</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t stress enough how important it is to prep yourself for these products, and give them time to develop.</li>
            <li>I will say that if you are looking for very drastic results, this may not be for you.  </li>
            <li>Remember, the color you&#x27;ll end up with is much lighter.</li>
            <li>Like so much that i have recommended it to every person I know.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really come off evenly.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really bother me now.</li>
            <li>It dries fast.  </li>
            <li>I noticed after the 2nd shower, everything looks a lot more natural.</li>
            <li>Fake bake is by far, the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is nice because you not only see where it goes, but you get instant brown color.</li>
            <li>If you want to look tan for a specific event, I would recommend using this 1-2 nights right before that event and don&#x27;t count on it lasting more than 4 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is by far the best, and this specific original formula of fake bake.</li>
            <li>I like to take showers early in the day and put a tanner on right afterward.</li>
            <li>There are other good products out there that don&#x27;t require this extra step.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other tanners like jergans and loreal and nothing is better then this stuff.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, it blends great into wrists and ankles and the color is awesome-no orange.</li>
            <li>I have used it many times and it has never failed to give me the dark bronze color I want!</li>
            <li>I have used it&#x27;s second edition which comes with gloves and a mitten, but it does not have the depth of the original.</li>
            <li>When I woke up, I couldn&#x27;t&#x27; smell the stale tan in a can smell which was surprising but neat!</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, I&#x27;m literally the EXACT and PRECISE same skin tone I was before using this product.</li>
            <li>I did notice that after getting a little natural sun and then putting this stuff on I got an awesome color that last for several days.</li>
            <li>If you think the cost is high on this product, consider how much you spend for 1 spray tan.</li>
            <li>I am very pale and this made my skin just a few shades darker and gave me a wonderful glow.  </li>
            <li>it gives a natural tan glow, not fake or orangey.</li>
            <li>My fiance literally didn&#x27;t want to be near me because it stunk so much!    </li>
            <li>I was surprised that there was no fragrance to the lotion even when I first applied it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a few different self tanners (the cheap ones and the more high end)</li>
            <li>The product dried quickly and the tan the next morning was a great loo; but unfortunately the tan rubbed off easily where ever clothing touched it and faded quickly.</li>
            <li>He thought it looked very good and natural, and all the times I&#x27;ve used the Fake Bake since then</li>
            <li>I used the same amount as other products I&#x27;ve used and the same amount as my mother did with this product, who got great color results.</li>
            <li>So most tanning lotions I use turn me an odd color.</li>
            <li>Luckily the stains wash out, but it is a bother, especially if you want a deeper tan and put the lotion on repeatedly over the course of a week.  </li>
            <li>Fake Bake is my favorite:)</li>
            <li>The color guide is super helpful, and I personally can put it on and wear it out without feeling like the color guide makes me orange.</li>
            <li>so I tried it once more a week later, and had the same reaction.     </li>
            <li>I only gave four stars because the tan than you get after immediately applying fades rather quickly.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it, it took a while because I didn&#x27;t want it to streak or miss any spots but the second time was much faster!</li>
            <li>This is the best product for my pale, hard to tan skin.  </li>
            <li>Works great for the first few months, but then the contents in the bottle start turning green and you have to throw it away</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make you look orange, but very natural!</li>
            <li>This product works really good way better than any lotion bronzer I have boughten from any store but the only thing it i feel like it doesn&#x27;t last very long it says it will last 5-7 days and for me it was only about 2-3 days</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly every self-tanner and Fake Bake is superior!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll apply 2 coats in the same night, by applying one coat all over starting at my ankles and then once I&#x27;ve finished doing my arms, I&#x27;ll go right back and apply more on my legs, working my way up again.  </li>
            <li>I love Fake Bake Original!</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t particularly care for Fake Bake&#x27;s scent, but he doesn&#x27;t mind because he knows I like to be tan, and he&#x27;s just happy I can be tan without the sun or tanning</li>
            <li>I used a little too much on one of my hands and ending up with 1 very dark hand - lol.    </li>
            <li>Product was wonderful, I was a HUGE tanning fanatic and after discovering a scary mole that did turn up to be malignant melanoma</li>
            <li>I have used fake bake spray and happy...</li>
            <li>me tell you, this Fake Bake lotion is great.  </li>
            <li>Great product doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li>and she says it really looks like a natural tan for her.</li>
            <li>and yes the lotion does stain but comes out with normal washing.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra $.</li>
            <li>You can also use it to accentuate features like pecs and abdominal muscles by applying lines of it around the outer rims of each feature -then wipe off after a few hours and you&#x27;ll notice your muscles appear to pop out more.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake gives me a more natural tan color and blends better around my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a sunless tanning community forum where this was mentioned as being foolproof, and I thought I&#x27;d try it as I always ended up with streaking on my legs with the airbrush solution I was using, and graduals didn&#x27;t give me enough color to be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular lotion becomes runnny and turns greenish in color when it becomes very old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to apply, but I prefer St. Tropez foam because it is quicker and easier and the bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll end up with a lovely pale ring around your mouth because the tanner was disturbed</li>
            <li>Results are even better when you have somewhat of a tan already, but still works well on pale skin.</li>
            <li>I love it and no longer have to worry about being a pale face and the fear of being in the sun anymore.</li>
            <li>It can be a pain but for me w/2 kids and a husband to take care of, getting 45 min to go to a salon for even a spray tan (at 20 bucks and only last 5-7 days and will come off just as easily</li>
            <li>The newest bottle is a lot thicker in consistency than previous ones and is a just a bit harder to apply, but it still does a good job.  </li>
            <li>I apply in the morning and use my blow dryer on cool to dry the cream on my skin.</li>
            <li>I look like a person that is willing to go outside when it&#x27;s hot, which I am not (due to my aversion to sweating and discomfort).</li>
            <li>It is very runny and has a different color than before, it doesn&#x27;t even leave the nice tan look that it has in the past.</li>
            <li>If you can, stay as close to naked as possible for the first hour or so to make sure you&#x27;re 100% dry.</li>
            <li>If you can live with the clean-up, this is the go-to tanning product for you.</li>
            <li>I used to live in the sun, and now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It always arrives when it&#x27;s supposed to and in new condition.</li>
            <li>but if I need a quick color I will use the airbrush because it goes on fairly dry and won&#x27;t get on my clothes.</li>
            <li>Clearly it&#x27;s worked for a number of people, but it&#x27;s also not worked for more than just a few.</li>
            <li>The application was smooth, the color genuine, and the mess was minimal.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I even applied it to my back the first time by myself and there was no streaking, though I would recommend having someone do it for you.     </li>
            <li>If  you do let it get too old, you start looking like the Wicked Witch of the West, but I normally use mine up before that happens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried what seems like every brand from cheap to expensive to professional spray tan and none I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>First found at the Southern&#x27;s Women Show in Richmond, VA in 2004...and been using ever since.  </li>
            <li>My color does continue to develop after I wash it off, and NOTHING gets on my crisp white towels, either.  </li>
            <li>I have bought several other products on a whim thinking they may work similarly or better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too dark or light.</li>
            <li>I simply take a shower and shave and use a loofah sponge, nothing intense by any means, normal shave/body wash..</li>
            <li>My friend introduced me to this as the greatest stuff, I hated it at first because I would do as the directions told me and put it on at night then shower in the morning.</li>
            <li>green color and strong</li>
            <li>so the first thing i gotta do is use gloves when applyin this lotion..and do the small stuff first then the large... and then after that you expeally have to put it on at night...</li>
            <li>but now I am pretty sure the product was old and outdated.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always skeptical about self tanning products because even when others rave that they are streak free and easy to apply, I always end up with orange lines up my legs and arms.</li>
            <li>Not a dramatic bronzing (I&#x27;d probably have to apply a second night for that), but</li>
            <li>I definitely will never be using a tanning bed, and certainly won&#x27;t be going the self-tan route again after this travesty.</li>
            <li>i also get dressed in loose shorts and a T right after..</li>
            <li>I am overall pleased with this stuff however I do wish the color was a little darker.</li>
            <li>I will then apply it one more night just to get a little extra color.</li>
            <li>I do find if I over work the product it starts to seem scary, but it&#x27;s always absolutely great the next day...</li>
            <li>Apply lotion to your palms after you&#x27;ve finished gradual tanning your hands, and rub your palms to your elbows to get a good bit of lotion there, and this will sound weird, but carefully apply lotion with a fingertip to the knuckle on your big toes.  </li>
            <li>It is very noticeable and when you wake up in the morning, your entire room reeks of it.</li>
            <li>I have used products like Jergens Natural Glow</li>
            <li>The loss of one star is because I need to purchase these bottles so frequently.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It was not a big deal when I lived in snow country, but now that I&#x27;m a California girl I really want to ditch the pantyhose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t use too much on one spot - especially with your hands and feet.</li>
            <li>wow..</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need to use much and with regular use, it lasted me almost a year!</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t care for the smell since I have to use this directly on my hands.</li>
            <li>and I have a natural tan in the morning.</li>
            <li>I tan well naturally</li>
            <li>The only drawback I really have is the smell.</li>
            <li>Work well &amp; leaves a natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>So you&#x27;re walking around all day being self conscious about it.</li>
            <li>I started getting scared of the whole skin cancer thing and started looking for different alternatives.  </li>
            <li>No orange tint at all, just a natural looking tan like you have been laying in the tanning bed for weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so natural looking.</li>
            <li>and it looked completely natural.</li>
            <li>It takes some effort to make it look natural.</li>
            <li>one or two applications will change your natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>As always, the original is the thing and there was no need to mess with perfection.</li>
            <li>It goes on evenly and produces a natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>When I took my clothes off, my clothes were stained and the color completely came off in the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing it was a old bottle</li>
            <li>I do not spread this onto my fingers, as my fingers never tanned naturally anyway.  </li>
            <li>It works to give a natural glow.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased two so far</li>
            <li>always told my color looks natural.</li>
            <li>and I bought this because you actually look tan &amp; real.</li>
            <li>I applied it directly as told, went to bed, woke up and washed it off in the shower, and it was completely gone.</li>
            <li>By &#x27;completely gone</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll just have to stick to tanning naturally.</li>
            <li>I had heard from someone personally that it was really good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s on, you have to wear long dark colored sweat pants to make sure it doesn&#x27;t rub off on your furniture or bedding.</li>
            <li>Love the product but the last place I ordered from the product was old and had a green tint when applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m have fair skin and Fake Bake</li>
            <li>It leaves behind a nice, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Although fake bake sells a lotion for your face, I used just a dab of the body lotion on my face and it gave me a gorgeous natural glow.     </li>
            <li>This product looks very real and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>However, make sure you apply babyoil or some type of oil to the dry areas (knees, under arms, heel, elbows) before applying so that it keeps them from getting too dark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it really helpful to use regular daily lotion all over every day after my morning shower, and I use a softening lotion in particular on my feet, knees, hands and elbows.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it really helpful to use regular daily lotion all over every day after my morning shower, and I use a softening lotion in particular on my feet, knees, hands and elbows.  </li>
            <li>and I look super dark.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several natural tans in the past, but do not want any more sun damage.  </li>
            <li>its easier to apply and makes no mess</li>
            <li>It does look gross and smells ok, but ALL fake tanners have that smell to them(this one has it too not bad at ALL though).</li>
            <li>I was discouraged the first night not seeing much of a change but decided that I like the gradual increase in tan rather than one big change that some other tanners offer.  </li>
            <li>This company makes this product with highly organic ingredients, so its shelf life is only 11 months.</li>
            <li>I love this product.im very pale but tan really easily not recently had skin cancer removed from my face</li>
            <li>Apparently the formula changed or this was old product.  </li>
            <li>After one application, I look like I&#x27;ve spent a day at the beach which is exactly what I wanted to achieve.</li>
            <li>Make sure your sheets are dark colored, like burgundy, dark brown, or plum colored.  </li>
            <li>St. Tropez foam with the pump top is much simpler to apply and easier to cover you than Fake Bake lotion.</li>
            <li>Messy messy nice color and stay power.</li>
            <li>Results are instant and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I have all of fake bakes products and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I do extensive research before ordering anything online, and I was pretty confident in my decision to buy Fake Bake...</li>
            <li>Based on other reviewers I didn&#x27;t really want to put this on before going to bed, so applied it in the morning after a shower and let it dry very thoroughly before getting completely dressed.</li>
            <li>Like the product, but the bottle was only half full.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little work - commitment...but is worth it.</li>
            <li>, sorry do not remember the exact name right now and can not toggle back and forth )that works great for fake and ankles</li>
            <li>Trust me, I have tried and tested them all, Fake and Bake is exceptional, and the ONLY one I will use....</li>
            <li>Within a week after I stopped using it, my skin was back to its original pale color.</li>
            <li>I have light skin and my skin is hard to tan.</li>
            <li>Many male models use body makeup for the same purpose (hardly anyone has a 6-pack that looks like you see in pictures/movies without makeup or photo editing).</li>
            <li>Fake and Bake is amazing</li>
            <li>I generally put it on in the day time.  </li>
            <li>I have only used two products this and another one from a direct website.</li>
            <li>I have vitiligo  spreading on my hands and even though it doesn&#x27;t cover it up completely it does darken the white skin pigment.</li>
            <li>This is the only product so far that is mocha and not carrot orange color.</li>
            <li>Very low odor and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t panic it will look dark at first.</li>
            <li>The smell, but it&#x27;s to be expected and I&#x27;ve smelt worse.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do really like the product.</li>
            <li>Not remotely orange at all.  </li>
            <li>You just have to apply evenly and carefully and be prepared that it will get on your clothes and anything around for the first several hours.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake is by far the fastest, most natural looking product out there.</li>
            <li>t be kind of weird</li>
            <li>The lotion smells very good compared to others, but the fake tint is very messy and gets on everything, not to mentioon it stays put in every crease of skin</li>
            <li>I am an avid sunless tanner user since I am a pasty pale, can not tan naturally person.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Fake Bake for making my fantasies come true!</li>
            <li>I live in Mexico so returning is a total pain, but now I know for the future.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mean I leave huge globs</li>
            <li>Fake bake is the most natural looking tan on the market!  </li>
            <li>apply slivers of it carefully where you need to darken the skin and let it sit on the skin without rubbing it in very much (just rub slightly around the edges to push the lines of the lotion to a smooth curved contour and let the lotion sit for awhile, up to a few hours before wiping it off).</li>
            <li>I used Fake Bake last year and was very satisfied because it is the only self-tanning lotion that does not turn me orange.  </li>
            <li>I love fake bake products however this was old and runny.</li>
            <li>this is when I checked an old bottle that I had left over from last summer to see if it should be pitched....</li>
            <li>but you want it to look good, and it can go really wrong if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li>I looked online and found the exact same product for half price.</li>
            <li>I apply this at night, because the color of this at first turns me into a very dark person.</li>
            <li>When you first apply the lotion, it is very dark.</li>
            <li>It was rich and dark brown in color which was nice because it didn&#x27;t have the typical orange hue of self tanners, but I found it difficult to fully rub in and especially evenly.</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion (which is VERY dark and quite powerful) to essentially make contour lines around my nose that will last for up to 3 days -just</li>
            <li>this stuff, I NEVER rub it in all the way, I generally have it all over my wrist and various body parts.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have funny chunks of tanner missing on my body</li>
            <li>Pretty real looking but still tough to use on feet &amp; hands.</li>
            <li>However, you don&#x27;t even get the instructions until AFTER you open the package, which recommends at least four other products that you should purchase for a better result.</li>
            <li>It was not the normal thick, rich consistency, and dark color I am used to.</li>
            <li>With Banana Boat, I would use half the bottle to apply one coat for the whole body.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used any lotions that don&#x27;t have a slight odor.</li>
            <li>Yes, there is a slight smell, but you can only notice it if you really stick your nose to your arm and smell.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the Fake Bake I previously used..  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind looking unnaturally dark to people who know me, as long as the new people I meet will think that it&#x27;s natural, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>The result is not orange at all, the smell isn&#x27;t even too bad and goes away with one good shower.</li>

            <li> Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Also, this is a very potent formula and will stain your hands unless you plan on scrubbing for an hour after use, so you will definately want to use some disposable gloves!</li>

            <li> It does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never ever experienced this from a self tanner before, even the cheapies.</li>

            <li> everyone gave it really great reviews, so I wanted to write one myself since I had a good experience with this product.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use gloves and its best to use at night before bed.</li>
            <li> Works great, good color</li>
            <li> I have honestly tried everything!</li>
            <li> So I went to order more flawless and it wouldn&#x27;t arrive in time with my prime shipping</li>
            <li> go by my misfortune and shop at Altima&#x27;s the best store at Amazon:)</li>
            <li> I have many friends that are making purchases of this self tanner because it looks so great!</li>
            <li> It looks great, is easy to apply and leaves your skin feeling great!</li>
            <li> This one is the best and Amazon.com has by far the best price.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned redhead.</li>
            <li> this goes on great colours up really nice</li>
            <li> This product does a good job.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a good deal</li>
            <li> Good color, no chemically odor, &amp; doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Looks good when comes off.</li>
            <li> This is as good as getting a spray tan.  </li>
            <li> a good product that doesn&#x27;t cost $30 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin</li>
            <li> Get a good scrub (I use a homemade sugar+olive oil scrub), and exfoliate every inch of skin you plan on applying this to.</li>
            <li> As good as a spray tan.</li>
            <li> Enjoy, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> a fair skinned person</li>
            <li> If you have patients &amp; can stand under a light &amp; put it on perfect it would be good</li>

            <li> Very easy to use and looks great.</li>
            <li> This gives me to most beautiful color without being orange.</li>
            <li> but after that shower the next day it blends perfectly and looks great!</li>
            <li> Swedish Beauty Botanicals has a great self tanner for the face and body, is cheap and smells great.</li>
            <li> i love the product and i feel it was a great price for what i got.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Good luck , happy safe self tanning</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many tanning products but since finding this one I have not used another one!!</li>
            <li> Great product worth the cost, time, and saves your skin!!</li>
            <li> Ok!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get better than this AT ALL!</li>
            <li> but it truly is my favorite sunless tanner and believe me, I have tried A LOT!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best.&amp;#34;  I ordered some and love it!</li>
            <li> I got more compliments from this product than from using the mystic tanning booths, or airbrush tan!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!</li>
            <li> and I love it, but for some reason the lotion I received when applied looks Grayish/green!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> U love it!</li>
            <li> and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff a couple times a week and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> The results are amazing, but you won&#x27;t go from pasty to brown.  </li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> but I liked it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin orange but just a nice brown.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t slept with it overnight because I feel kind of grody while I&#x27;m wearing this, and I don&#x27;t want to stain my sheets.    </li>
            <li> So this is a really nice self tanner.</li>
            <li> Spray tans do not work nearly as nice as this product</li>
            <li> Use exfoliation gloves you can find at any drugstore, and don&#x27;t bother with scrubs (like the paste kind that come in a tube or tub), they just don&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice brown color.</li>
            <li> After you use this cream a couple of times, you will find your own tricks to make applying easier for you.</li>
            <li> It kind of looks splotchy.</li>
            <li> I love love love his stuff!!</li>
            <li> I mainly use it after showering and results are best after shaving.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and looks good too.</li>
            <li> Strong smell but good color in one application.</li>
            <li> But you would have a better chance of getting hit by a train to have it happen to you, i have read so many good testimonials about this product</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t streak and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to use.</li>
            <li> , I love the color I get from this and think it&#x27;s one of the best sunless tanning systems out there right now besides Famous Daves. :)</li>
            <li> works well and great price, fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> This product was perfect for removing the whitiness and leaving my legs perfectly natural looking.  </li>
            <li> But a coworker always has just a nice glow, nothing overpowering but just healthy looking, so I asked her</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product so far.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best sunless tanning product I have used so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never given me anything but flawless, natural color.  </li>
            <li> This appears to be, by far, the best self tanner I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li> Your reviews made purchasing and using this product so easy and helpful!</li>
            <li> Nice golden tan that doesn&#x27;t streak or smell!!  </li>
            <li> I bought this after reading great reviews and my own mom having try and really like the product.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and produces a nice, bronzy even tan.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to several co-workers and all have had a wonderful experience with this product.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product--definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> I get more then one when I order.  </li>
            <li> what more could you ask?  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find a better price than here on Amazon either.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the place to purchase this as well. :)</li>
            <li> This is even better than a tan from the sun because it applies evenly</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite self tanner that I have been using for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> Love this self tanner.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks like many of the rows of products you would see at a salon or spa/salon/tanning place.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, its not permanent, and it gets much better after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too cute when wearing your flip flops.</li>
            <li> gives me a nice light brown tan with just one use.  </li>
            <li> I have tried MANY self tanners, and this is my favorite one for body.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful but once opened it doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 12 yrs now and love the results.</li>
            <li> It smells much better than most</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a gradual tanner before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Every time after that, however, I was a bit more generous</li>
            <li> I stopped using it until my friend told me she just puts in on in the morning then puts her clothes and makeup on top of it.</li>
            <li> If you want to be tanner just re-apply, wait many hours or sleep on it, and shower again.</li>
            <li> This product transforms me into a light brown tan person!</li>
            <li> You will not find a better one on the market.</li>
            <li> ok so i just bought this product</li>
            <li> please i want more information until i put this on...</li>
            <li> so please anyone give me more information</li>
            <li> I would reccomed getting some of your own gloves however, because mine didn&#x27;t fit and one of them tore.</li>
            <li> Really bummed because I was happy with the color I got out of it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lotion is my favorite</li>
            <li> i wish i had ordered more .</li>
            <li> Once you get to the tan level you want, just make sure you apply every 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> Ok so I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> However, be sure to use gloves...</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has a walnut-colored color guide.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanning products over the years.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Softening lotion will help eliminate this.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Softening lotion will help eliminate this.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> and Im glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love the gradual dissipation of this tanner.  </li>
            <li> Love Love love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a lot of time before you apply.</li>
            <li> You can try many products out there with aroma and without, with all sorts of ingredients .</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and all have given better results than this.</li>
            <li> jergens more orange.  </li>
            <li> Not orange and no terrible smell.</li>
            <li> I used this product with latex gloves and was pleased with the color.  </li>
            <li> If you do chose to purchase this product, which I don&#x27;t recommend, but if you must, they have separate products for hands and face that I may work better</li>
            <li> (I purchased more because I use it often).</li>
            <li> When used lightly every couple of days, I have a nice healthy tan WITHOUT the sun.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT addition to my summer wardrobe.</li>
            <li> Like it.. but can use a store bought product and get better results</li>
            <li> I am glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li> The product I received was runny, greenish in color and not even able to be used.</li>
            <li> I also bought the body polish and the after smoothie which I&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t have to have</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite self tanner I have purchased.</li>
            <li> The color guard is wonderful, definitely recommend both tanners for beginners as well.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The next day when you shower it will wash off to a perfect even tan.</li>
            <li> There are better cheaper products out there.</li>
            <li> and I receive many compliments.</li>
            <li> of Luck,&lt;br /&gt;~ SkyLee :)</li>
            <li> I had tried everything from drugstore brands to $50/tube stuff from Sephora...and didn&#x27;t love any of them.</li>
            <li> Sure...</li>
            <li> I will def be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Enjoy! :)</li>
            <li> However, this product WILL darken you many MANY shades.  </li>
            <li> after jumping in the shower most all of the color washes off.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the store I ordered from.</li>
            <li> I have so many tricks I use when applying.</li>
            <li> I suggest trying anything for oneself before dismissing it but make sure you have no plans for a while (perhaps apply at night a couple hours before bed).</li>
            <li> I have used many self tanners and this one is strange.&lt;br /&gt;Dark</li>
            <li> so I have never tried layering it on so many times to achieve this effect.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> (reviews seemed okay).</li>
            <li> I prefer a naural tan, but this is second best.  </li>
            <li> So much better than baking in ther sun and ruining your skin.</li>
            <li> but I love the way it looks on my skin.</li>
            <li> Way better and cheaper then spray tans</li>
            <li> and she keeps wanting more so</li>
            <li> The next morning got up and showered and had a awesome tan.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning product.  </li>
            <li> I has an interesting coloring, it&#x27;s more bronze than anything else</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> best thing about this is the fact that it does last a while.</li>
            <li> be sure to wear gloves, it will stain your hands.</li>
            <li> Its ok.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead and have never ever been able to tan.</li>
            <li> I was glad</li>
            <li> I notice if I start to sweat it doesn&#x27;t create nearly as great of a tan in that particular area..     </li>
            <li> I have fair skin which rarely tans, my arms get a light brown from outdoor summer activities, but my stomach has not seen the light of day in years!</li>
            <li> Never before has there been a sunless product that I have loved so much!</li>
            <li> , it must be pretty good</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this and decided to give it a shot- for the price, it is pretty dang good.</li>
            <li> IT when it&#x27;s FRESH!!</li>
            <li> Will always use as I don&#x27;t let my fair skin get too much sun anymore :-)</li>
            <li> The spray and this lotion are pretty much the same, flawless application, nice smell, wonderful natural tan that you can control depending on how many application you use.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to enjoy the bronzing color</li>
            <li> While this went on &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; after it&#x27;s rubbed in, it looks great and overnight it leaves a natural looking &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> If I had pink or no undertones, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have been very happy with the light tan this produced.</li>
            <li> I was also excited because I&#x27;d gotten it so cheap!</li>
            <li> I have used other products but this is by for the best.</li>
            <li> so you can see where it&#x27;s going--it washes off when you shower) but it dries evenly and creates a lovely dark medium tan that looks good on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> If you make a mistake, you can easily wash it off in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The colorant in the product makes it easy to see where it&#x27;s been applied.  </li>
            <li> i also received it very quickly too.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as easy to apply as others that I have used.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to apply and looks even.  </li>
            <li> application was a bit tricky, but because there is color in the lotion, it&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;ve applied it.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easy, you don&#x27;t look orange, and it don&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and no streaks.  </li>
            <li> Its so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy with gloves</li>
            <li> Blends in easily.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy to apply</li>
            <li> It spread easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because of the strong \\&quot;skunky\\&quot; odor it produces when it dries.</li>
            <li> and it is the best product that I have been able to find so far that leaves a natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> This product gives your skin a nice glow that is a pretty color.</li>
            <li> Make sure - MAKE CERTAIN - That you wear the gloves included, there is a reason why they are in there!!</li>
            <li> It even looks good freshly appiled--you could wear it before a night out if you thought you wouldn&#x27;t sweat too much!  </li>
            <li> So you know exactly if you miss a spot, plus, you have an instant and perfectly brown tan!!  </li>
            <li> But you can most likely ate not going to find a successful color.</li>
            <li> Put it on and it goes on really easily and smooth.</li>
            <li> My legs were fine</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and liked the color it gave; I have large pores and it didn&#x27;t make me look speckled or anything.  </li>
            <li> Lotion went on evenly and smoothly, and I loved the natural looking tan it gave.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re ok with all this hassle, then you do get a nice natural looking tan which lasts about 3 to 5 days.</li>
            <li> but i got a huge burning rash on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> They are huge on my hands</li>
            <li> I guess cheapness and being available at the drugstore.   </li>
            <li> Following the directions and the tips in these reviews and this stuff should work great for you.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be left with a great bronzed sun-kissed tan.</li>
            <li> I have used almost every self-tanning product available.</li>
            <li> You will be VERY brown after application, but when you shower, it will wash off leaving the nice non-streaky tan.</li>
            <li> No annoying scent.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like how light the effect was.</li>
            <li> The color it gave me was fantastic and it CAN be built upon.</li>
            <li> This is where being a guy becomes important.</li>
            <li> I have since bought a tanning mit and a box of latex gloves that fit my hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to suck it up and spend the money for this tanner, because it&#x27;s WORTH</li>
            <li> I used to use Banana Boat&#x27;s Deep/Dark tanner, and even though it would give me a great color, it would still look blotchy at times, especially on the hands/feet.</li>
            <li> I cannot express how happy I am with this enough.</li>
            <li> but know that it is important to avoid the sun.</li>
            <li> I can put this on and have a great tan instantly.</li>
            <li> It goes on really smooth and won&#x27;t leave color on your palms.  </li>
            <li> Use gloves that fit your hands.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice real looking tan with just a couple applications.  </li>
            <li> but overall it works great and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks</li>
            <li> but if you have time to reshower the next morning good to go:)</li>
            <li> :) It will show up on your light colored clothes but washes right out.</li>
            <li> and I was really excited to get this because I had heard such great things about it</li>
            <li> It is very fast working which I love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather smell funny then ruin my skin from tanning beds or sunlight :)</li>
            <li> Make sure to exfoliate first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did because this stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> but the long term color is great.</li>
            <li> , this is the only one I have purchased more than once because I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Instead what the makers of this product should have done is to add the mitten to the original and maybe design a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have used tanning products before so This actually made me more weary on what kind I use.</li>
            <li> Over the last 11 years and trying professional and drugstore self-tanners, I have found the Biotherm SUNTAN Sunless Tanning Milk for Legs and Body works the best.  </li>
            <li> On a positive note, after using this tanner, I looked the most tan I have ever been (except when using a bronzing gel which washed off).</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and left me with a nice color, no streaking and the scent was fine as well.</li>
            <li> it also smells like crayons which is not horrible, but it does give you a very realistic tan.  </li>
            <li> And cheap;)!</li>
            <li> With this product I have a nice glow and a soft tan on my face and arms.  </li>
            <li> The color actually looks good with my hair</li>
            <li> It is keeping me out of the sun and a true time saver.</li>
            <li> this is the color that makes you look true brown and not organge.</li>
            <li> I love that it looks real.</li>
            <li> I am Irish with fair complected skin and I burn when I am in the sun or tanning beds, I try to avoid this like the plague</li>
            <li> the lotion is easier for me, but the spray gives a more intense color.</li>
            <li> However if you want a full blown tan in a bottle, this may be too conservative.  </li>
            <li> It has a real tan color and you can just add more if you want it darker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice because you can rub it off before it sets in completely</li>
            <li> absolute favorite has been the sun labs.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> next morning I take a shower and the tan is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I just brush it down onto the tops of my hands and feet, and it blends beautifully.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is pretty easy to apply, just keep rubbing it in until it is even.</li>
            <li> It applied evenly and easily and I could see visible results after the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to stop going to the tanning salon to save my skin; seen too many older sun wrinkled people.</li>
            <li> &amp; YES..I tried it twice to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a fluke even applying more the second go around.    </li>
            <li> It dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Fake bake is my favorite tanning product and this stuff works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different self tanning lotions and sprays and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Luckily it&#x27;s winter</li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake Flawless.</li>
            <li> will more than likely buy more after I run out.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, not messy</li>
            <li> and that is the only stuff that works for me on my very light fair completed sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try, because like I said, I don&#x27;t want to live a life full of &#x27;what-ifs?&#x27;</li>
            <li> The lotion went on really great,  Did not take long to dry maybe 10 minutes at the most!</li>
            <li> the morning, shower, and go about your normal routine and enjoy your tan!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice being able to apply this before going to bed and not having to re-apply it in the morning like other lotions.    </li>
            <li> but I did use the gloves, because when you really see where it is, you end up rubbing it in more, and therefore getting a much more natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> It helps this tanner stay darker longer and the new formula for Jergens absorbs into the skin better and doesn&#x27;t have that peculiar smell.</li>
            <li> I found that a slightly damp makeup sponge makes a great applicator and helps spread it evenly.</li>
            <li> I got this item for almost half price from amazon and worked great.</li>
            <li> It looks like a real tan!!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> The product gives you a instant bronze color making it easy to apply but make sure you wear gloves.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple different self tanners (the cheapo ones and the more high end) and I was really excited to get this because I had heard such great things about it.</li>
            <li> If you take your time &amp; do it right, you will love the natural tan results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair, and was only looking to remove the florescent blue-whiteness of my legs so that I could wear summer skirts and swimsuits without looking like I had \\&quot;naked legs\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> gives the best, most real looking, deep dark tan out there!</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks after using to review this product, and I must say it is great.</li>
            <li> You get great color with this product and don&#x27;t have to apply it everyday.</li>
            <li> That said, on cleansed, exfoliated skin this product delivers a nice golden tan which lasts for a few days, more if you repeat the process.  </li>
            <li> The next day it is a nice tan on my legs, arms and face.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Gives the most natural color.</li>
            <li> Obviously I cant speak for anyone else but use caution with this or any kind of product</li>
            <li> It does take some time to apply, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> but the results are well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I had ordered indoor tanning lotions for tanning beds off Amazon before, and they were all fresh when shipped to me.</li>
            <li> It gives the fastest, most natural colour as well as lots of moisture.</li>
            <li> So, what works for me is making sure I have a coat or two of clear nail polish on my fingernails and toenails before I sunless tan.  </li>
            <li> So, what works for me is making sure I have a coat or two of clear nail polish on my fingernails and toenails before I sunless tan.  </li>
            <li> leaves you with a golden tan, NOT orange.</li>
            <li> and though I tan easily, I don&#x27;t want to end up being wrinkled and leathery when I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li> This is actually fun</li>
            <li> This is the most natural looking tan I can get without the sun.</li>
            <li> This one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> It is priced just right, you can&#x27;t find any other self tanner that works priced this cheap, which I love!</li>
            <li> I have found other products I like better, This one is ok, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep working with this product, though, as I think it is better than most of the other self-tanners out there.</li>
            <li> It dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you keep it in the refrigerator till ready to use if you order more than one bottle at a time or over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Washes right out of everything.</li>
            <li> BTW, when I got some on my bathroom rug I threw it in the wash right away</li>
            <li> but it washes right out.</li>
            <li> This stuff will stain your hands even if you wash them right after application.</li>
            <li> If applied right, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Right after the shower, when your skin is towel-dried, get your rubber gloves on</li>
            <li> I took the time to do it right</li>
            <li> and they were right</li>
            <li> I have previously used Jergens and Nivea gradual tans and while they were ok, I have very light skin</li>
            <li> I did the patch test and waited over 24 hours to make sure there were no bad skin reactions, but after using it on my entire body it gave me a rash on my forearms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and had great results.</li>
            <li> What a great way to look tanned while avoiding the dangers of excessive sun-exposure.</li>
            <li> , I slept a full 8 hours and woke up ready for a shower.</li>
            <li> This product by them is not near as good as the fake bake flawless liquid pump spray,  now matter how much i exfoliated before using this, it would chunk around my ankles and knees.  </li>
            <li> I have olive skin, and this product is 100% capable of making me an Oompaloompa worthy.</li>
            <li> The clear nail polish doesn&#x27;t get stained by the tanner, and it effectively blocks the tanner from staining my natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li> The clear nail polish doesn&#x27;t get stained by the tanner, and it effectively blocks the tanner from staining my natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li> I see only these two missing from otherwise perfect product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this early last year (2013) and didn&#x27;t use it all because I&#x27;m fairly fair skinned</li>
            <li> It is a fast drying thing so you have to work quick,</li>
            <li> The color is pretty good, but I have to really work this in carefully</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the blonde hair, blue eyes, super fair skin type</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea to put a little lotion on your feet and hands beforehand.</li>
            <li> The best part is, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, just ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li> I was a bit intimidated when I first put this on, as it looked like I had dumped Hershey&#x27;s syrup on my legs.</li>
            <li> ) tan in a lotion that doesn&#x27;t make me look weird or streak is the best.</li>
            <li> This product gave me definite results-unlike many products where it&#x27;s a gradual color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I&#x27;m a guy, which is important because it directly relates to some points I&#x27;ll be making.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always for Bigger is Better.</li>
            <li> I like this better than a spray tan at a salon because I can control excessive color build up around my heels, toe nails and hands better in my well lit bathroom.  </li>
            <li> and I love the instant color.</li>
            <li> Also it smells at first</li>
            <li> so it would &#x27;soak in&#x27; or something, but it washed off in my first shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost all self tanners, since they first started coming out on the market over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> My mom and I have tried so many different self-tanning products you wouldn&#x27;t even believe it</li>
            <li> I have been using Fake Bake on my body for about 8 years and it is the best self tanner product.</li>
            <li> My first clue was when I opened the box and found a pare of gloves.</li>
            <li> My first time using it, I shaved and exfoliated, and used moisturizer on my knees, elbows, hands and feet.</li>
            <li> The odor bothered me at first, but I am getting used to it.  </li>
            <li> First self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll smell funny, it&#x27;ll get on your clothes, and you can&#x27;t avoid water during the day.  </li>
            <li> I use the Fake Bake flawless spray and my tan</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s the consistency of water....</li>
            <li> (brown to be exact)</li>
            <li> Fake bake is the perfect way to do that!</li>
            <li> Even my mom, who hates fake tans and thinks everything looks orange, was impressed and is even thinking about using it once herself.     </li>
            <li> Use gloves and use a cotton swab with lotion to blend the areas where you tanned and didn&#x27;t tan, such as at the bottom of your feet or the area where the palm and the top of your hand meet and in between your fingers and toes.</li>
            <li> then when i would apply the next time, it was flake off and chunk up some more, no where else on my body though.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the flawless spray from FAke BAke and decided to give the lotion and also the gel (darkest tan ) a try.</li>
            <li> His exact words were &amp;#34;honey</li>
            <li> suggest trying anything for oneself before dismissing it but make sure you have no plans for a while (perhaps  a couple of days and definitely apply at night before bed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is why I never leave it on for more than 3 hours, but that seems to be enough time.  </li>
            <li> but this definitely gives my paler skin a sun-kissed glow and is believable.  </li>
            <li> I really love this stuff but cant justify the price when I only used a couple times</li>
            <li> But it doesnt stay on after first shower.</li>
            <li> I kept it on for several more hours while I did chores, mid-day napped, lounged, etc.</li>
            <li> The only problem is it does wash off, but it is so much better than a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; tan.</li>
            <li> Granted, this also means it can rub off within the first couple hours</li>
            <li> really pretty tan.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and at first I wasn&#x27;t used to that.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is the best self tanning lotion I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> It actually looked pretty good right after the application - but the color washed off the next day.  </li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced, it is natural looking, and it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Realistically it would be AMAZING if they could create a lotion that not only makes you tan but keeps you tan w/o reapplying and coming completely off at your pool party</li>
            <li> Natural coloring, a nice deep tan.  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before I purchased this and pretty much</li>
            <li> i tried other self tanners (more for price) but wasn&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li> Real color, no streaks, even through and through, and fast!</li>
            <li> thank you fake bake for developing a great sunless tanning products and also for the way you dont stink while trying to achieve a golden tan!  </li>
            <li> 2 applications, roughly 2.5 hours each, took me from snow bunny white, to a warm light bronze.  </li>
            <li> You work with it at a pretty fast pace.</li>
            <li> When it goes on evenly it gives a nice dark color</li>
            <li> but it leaves no streaks behind and a beautiful color.</li>
            <li> -- nice dark color from just one application -- but</li>
            <li> buy from this particular seller again - will most likely purchase at a store where I know it&#x27;s fresh, new product.</li>
            <li> I do tan easily and have yellow undertones in my skin that make me look darker than others even when I&#x27;m not tanned.</li>
            <li> If it is streaking make sure you are completely dry of water and sweat..</li>
            <li> I recommend wearing it to bed (be sure it&#x27;s dry but any color will wash out of linens) and washing it off in the morning before you leave home.</li>
            <li> but once dry doesnt smell anymore unless you try to put lotion on top of it or sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> Perfect for an event that you want to be tan for - just shave, exfoliate, dry your skin off, and then apply this stuff and let it dry, then go to bed and shower the next day and viola!</li>
            <li> My face, arms and chest get sun easily because I kayak, but my legs are always white.</li>
            <li> Be sure to exfoliate, apply lotion to dry areas, and wear gloves.</li>
            <li> Very realistic looking tan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dry time took Forrreverrrr and when I was finally able to go to bed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried st tropes and its almost just as nice but costs less .</li>
            <li> I have manly arms and thighs and a large chest and torso.</li>
            <li> This stuff like most sunless tanning formulas got on the top of my big toes and stained them dark orange.</li>
            <li> I put my clothes on after I&#x27;m done, but I will wear loose fitting</li>
            <li> I had previously used a more expensive mousse self-tanner that was very good, but for the money Fake Bake goes just as good a job!!</li>
            <li> For me, it worked the first time I put it on, didn&#x27;t have as strong of a smell as most self-tanners, and left a dark natural-looking tan.  </li>
            <li> No streaks, and by mixing some lotion with it to go over my knees and feet, they look pretty normal too.  </li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t do much beside that.</li>
            <li> But if you are olive or light-olive undertoned already, it probably won&#x27;t do much for you.</li>
            <li> I read many great reviews for Fake Bake Self-Tanner on different websites</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go spray tanning from time to time but found it very costly.</li>
            <li> With that said, be careful around you toes and toenails and be sure to get some exfoliating gloves to use beforehand.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well alongside tanning out in the sun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been very light-skinned.  </li>
            <li> After using this lotion for 4 days in a row, I looked as if I had been to the tanning bed for a week straight.</li>
            <li> it really is foolproof.</li>
            <li> because i dunno when we goin to go to beach to get real tan because of the oil spill that happen in alabama by us.</li>
            <li> an di highly reccomend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Much easier to manage than the gel.</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the instructions carefully &amp; wash the applicator pad after using each time.</li>
            <li> and I really like the product.  </li>
            <li> otherwise it comes out very streaky.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Also before application put lotion on knees/ feet/elbows to prevent too much color in those areas.</li>
            <li> The color the next day is flawless and usually last a few days before I need to reapply.</li>
            <li> Just dont use too much.</li>
            <li> so I went on the hunt or a self tanner that really works.</li>
            <li> I work really fast</li>
            <li> and if you are looking for a nice tanner for your face and feet, have to say did not try the FAke BAke version, but Morrocon makes a self tanner with an amazing natural color(will leave a review for it as well</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t stress enough how important it is to prep yourself for these products, and give them time to develop.</li>
            <li> I will say that if you are looking for very drastic results, this may not be for you.  </li>
            <li> Remember, the color you&#x27;ll end up with is much lighter.</li>
            <li> Like so much that i have recommended it to every person I know.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really come off evenly.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really bother me now.</li>
            <li> It dries fast.  </li>
            <li> I noticed after the 2nd shower, everything looks a lot more natural.</li>
            <li> Fake bake is by far, the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is nice because you not only see where it goes, but you get instant brown color.</li>
            <li> If you want to look tan for a specific event, I would recommend using this 1-2 nights right before that event and don&#x27;t count on it lasting more than 4 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is by far the best, and this specific original formula of fake bake.</li>
            <li> I like to take showers early in the day and put a tanner on right afterward.</li>
            <li> There are other good products out there that don&#x27;t require this extra step.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other tanners like jergans and loreal and nothing is better then this stuff.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it blends great into wrists and ankles and the color is awesome-no orange.</li>
            <li> I have used it many times and it has never failed to give me the dark bronze color I want!</li>
            <li> I have used it&#x27;s second edition which comes with gloves and a mitten, but it does not have the depth of the original.</li>
            <li> When I woke up, I couldn&#x27;t&#x27; smell the stale tan in a can smell which was surprising but neat!</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, I&#x27;m literally the EXACT and PRECISE same skin tone I was before using this product.</li>
            <li> I did notice that after getting a little natural sun and then putting this stuff on I got an awesome color that last for several days.</li>
            <li> If you think the cost is high on this product, consider how much you spend for 1 spray tan.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and this made my skin just a few shades darker and gave me a wonderful glow.  </li>
            <li> it gives a natural tan glow, not fake or orangey.</li>
            <li> My fiance literally didn&#x27;t want to be near me because it stunk so much!    </li>
            <li> I was surprised that there was no fragrance to the lotion even when I first applied it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a few different self tanners (the cheap ones and the more high end)</li>
            <li> The product dried quickly and the tan the next morning was a great loo; but unfortunately the tan rubbed off easily where ever clothing touched it and faded quickly.</li>
            <li> He thought it looked very good and natural, and all the times I&#x27;ve used the Fake Bake since then</li>
            <li> I used the same amount as other products I&#x27;ve used and the same amount as my mother did with this product, who got great color results.</li>
            <li> So most tanning lotions I use turn me an odd color.</li>
            <li> Luckily the stains wash out, but it is a bother, especially if you want a deeper tan and put the lotion on repeatedly over the course of a week.  </li>
            <li> Fake Bake is my favorite:)</li>
            <li> The color guide is super helpful, and I personally can put it on and wear it out without feeling like the color guide makes me orange.</li>
            <li> so I tried it once more a week later, and had the same reaction.     </li>
            <li> I only gave four stars because the tan than you get after immediately applying fades rather quickly.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it, it took a while because I didn&#x27;t want it to streak or miss any spots but the second time was much faster!</li>
            <li> This is the best product for my pale, hard to tan skin.  </li>
            <li> Works great for the first few months, but then the contents in the bottle start turning green and you have to throw it away</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you look orange, but very natural!</li>
            <li> This product works really good way better than any lotion bronzer I have boughten from any store but the only thing it i feel like it doesn&#x27;t last very long it says it will last 5-7 days and for me it was only about 2-3 days</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly every self-tanner and Fake Bake is superior!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll apply 2 coats in the same night, by applying one coat all over starting at my ankles and then once I&#x27;ve finished doing my arms, I&#x27;ll go right back and apply more on my legs, working my way up again.  </li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake Original!</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t particularly care for Fake Bake&#x27;s scent, but he doesn&#x27;t mind because he knows I like to be tan, and he&#x27;s just happy I can be tan without the sun or tanning</li>
            <li> I used a little too much on one of my hands and ending up with 1 very dark hand - lol.    </li>
            <li> Product was wonderful, I was a HUGE tanning fanatic and after discovering a scary mole that did turn up to be malignant melanoma</li>
            <li> I have used fake bake spray and happy...</li>
            <li> me tell you, this Fake Bake lotion is great.  </li>
            <li> Great product doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> and she says it really looks like a natural tan for her.</li>
            <li> and yes the lotion does stain but comes out with normal washing.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra $.</li>
            <li> You can also use it to accentuate features like pecs and abdominal muscles by applying lines of it around the outer rims of each feature -then wipe off after a few hours and you&#x27;ll notice your muscles appear to pop out more.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake gives me a more natural tan color and blends better around my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a sunless tanning community forum where this was mentioned as being foolproof, and I thought I&#x27;d try it as I always ended up with streaking on my legs with the airbrush solution I was using, and graduals didn&#x27;t give me enough color to be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular lotion becomes runnny and turns greenish in color when it becomes very old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to apply, but I prefer St. Tropez foam because it is quicker and easier and the bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll end up with a lovely pale ring around your mouth because the tanner was disturbed</li>
            <li> Results are even better when you have somewhat of a tan already, but still works well on pale skin.</li>
            <li> I love it and no longer have to worry about being a pale face and the fear of being in the sun anymore.</li>
            <li> It can be a pain but for me w/2 kids and a husband to take care of, getting 45 min to go to a salon for even a spray tan (at 20 bucks and only last 5-7 days and will come off just as easily</li>
            <li> The newest bottle is a lot thicker in consistency than previous ones and is a just a bit harder to apply, but it still does a good job.  </li>
            <li> I apply in the morning and use my blow dryer on cool to dry the cream on my skin.</li>
            <li> I look like a person that is willing to go outside when it&#x27;s hot, which I am not (due to my aversion to sweating and discomfort).</li>
            <li> It is very runny and has a different color than before, it doesn&#x27;t even leave the nice tan look that it has in the past.</li>
            <li> If you can, stay as close to naked as possible for the first hour or so to make sure you&#x27;re 100% dry.</li>
            <li> If you can live with the clean-up, this is the go-to tanning product for you.</li>
            <li> I used to live in the sun, and now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It always arrives when it&#x27;s supposed to and in new condition.</li>
            <li> but if I need a quick color I will use the airbrush because it goes on fairly dry and won&#x27;t get on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Clearly it&#x27;s worked for a number of people, but it&#x27;s also not worked for more than just a few.</li>
            <li> The application was smooth, the color genuine, and the mess was minimal.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I even applied it to my back the first time by myself and there was no streaking, though I would recommend having someone do it for you.     </li>
            <li> If  you do let it get too old, you start looking like the Wicked Witch of the West, but I normally use mine up before that happens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried what seems like every brand from cheap to expensive to professional spray tan and none I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> First found at the Southern&#x27;s Women Show in Richmond, VA in 2004...and been using ever since.  </li>
            <li> My color does continue to develop after I wash it off, and NOTHING gets on my crisp white towels, either.  </li>
            <li> I have bought several other products on a whim thinking they may work similarly or better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too dark or light.</li>
            <li> I simply take a shower and shave and use a loofah sponge, nothing intense by any means, normal shave/body wash..</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to this as the greatest stuff, I hated it at first because I would do as the directions told me and put it on at night then shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> green color and strong</li>
            <li> so the first thing i gotta do is use gloves when applyin this lotion..and do the small stuff first then the large... and then after that you expeally have to put it on at night...</li>
            <li> but now I am pretty sure the product was old and outdated.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about self tanning products because even when others rave that they are streak free and easy to apply, I always end up with orange lines up my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> Not a dramatic bronzing (I&#x27;d probably have to apply a second night for that), but</li>
            <li> I definitely will never be using a tanning bed, and certainly won&#x27;t be going the self-tan route again after this travesty.</li>
            <li> i also get dressed in loose shorts and a T right after..</li>
            <li> I am overall pleased with this stuff however I do wish the color was a little darker.</li>
            <li> I will then apply it one more night just to get a little extra color.</li>
            <li> I do find if I over work the product it starts to seem scary, but it&#x27;s always absolutely great the next day...</li>
            <li> Apply lotion to your palms after you&#x27;ve finished gradual tanning your hands, and rub your palms to your elbows to get a good bit of lotion there, and this will sound weird, but carefully apply lotion with a fingertip to the knuckle on your big toes.  </li>
            <li> It is very noticeable and when you wake up in the morning, your entire room reeks of it.</li>
            <li> I have used products like Jergens Natural Glow</li>
            <li> The loss of one star is because I need to purchase these bottles so frequently.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It was not a big deal when I lived in snow country, but now that I&#x27;m a California girl I really want to ditch the pantyhose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t use too much on one spot - especially with your hands and feet.</li>
            <li> wow..</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to use much and with regular use, it lasted me almost a year!</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t care for the smell since I have to use this directly on my hands.</li>
            <li> and I have a natural tan in the morning.</li>
            <li> I tan well naturally</li>
            <li> The only drawback I really have is the smell.</li>
            <li> Work well &amp; leaves a natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> So you&#x27;re walking around all day being self conscious about it.</li>
            <li> I started getting scared of the whole skin cancer thing and started looking for different alternatives.  </li>
            <li> No orange tint at all, just a natural looking tan like you have been laying in the tanning bed for weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so natural looking.</li>
            <li> and it looked completely natural.</li>
            <li> It takes some effort to make it look natural.</li>
            <li> one or two applications will change your natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> As always, the original is the thing and there was no need to mess with perfection.</li>
            <li> It goes on evenly and produces a natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> When I took my clothes off, my clothes were stained and the color completely came off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it was a old bottle</li>
            <li> I do not spread this onto my fingers, as my fingers never tanned naturally anyway.  </li>
            <li> It works to give a natural glow.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased two so far</li>
            <li> always told my color looks natural.</li>
            <li> and I bought this because you actually look tan &amp; real.</li>
            <li> I applied it directly as told, went to bed, woke up and washed it off in the shower, and it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> By &#x27;completely gone</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll just have to stick to tanning naturally.</li>
            <li> I had heard from someone personally that it was really good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s on, you have to wear long dark colored sweat pants to make sure it doesn&#x27;t rub off on your furniture or bedding.</li>
            <li> Love the product but the last place I ordered from the product was old and had a green tint when applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m have fair skin and Fake Bake</li>
            <li> It leaves behind a nice, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Although fake bake sells a lotion for your face, I used just a dab of the body lotion on my face and it gave me a gorgeous natural glow.     </li>
            <li> This product looks very real and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> However, make sure you apply babyoil or some type of oil to the dry areas (knees, under arms, heel, elbows) before applying so that it keeps them from getting too dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it really helpful to use regular daily lotion all over every day after my morning shower, and I use a softening lotion in particular on my feet, knees, hands and elbows.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it really helpful to use regular daily lotion all over every day after my morning shower, and I use a softening lotion in particular on my feet, knees, hands and elbows.  </li>
            <li> and I look super dark.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several natural tans in the past, but do not want any more sun damage.  </li>
            <li> its easier to apply and makes no mess</li>
            <li> It does look gross and smells ok, but ALL fake tanners have that smell to them(this one has it too not bad at ALL though).</li>
            <li> I was discouraged the first night not seeing much of a change but decided that I like the gradual increase in tan rather than one big change that some other tanners offer.  </li>
            <li> This company makes this product with highly organic ingredients, so its shelf life is only 11 months.</li>
            <li> I love this product.im very pale but tan really easily not recently had skin cancer removed from my face</li>
            <li> Apparently the formula changed or this was old product.  </li>
            <li> After one application, I look like I&#x27;ve spent a day at the beach which is exactly what I wanted to achieve.</li>
            <li> Make sure your sheets are dark colored, like burgundy, dark brown, or plum colored.  </li>
            <li> St. Tropez foam with the pump top is much simpler to apply and easier to cover you than Fake Bake lotion.</li>
            <li> Messy messy nice color and stay power.</li>
            <li> Results are instant and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I have all of fake bakes products and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I do extensive research before ordering anything online, and I was pretty confident in my decision to buy Fake Bake...</li>
            <li> Based on other reviewers I didn&#x27;t really want to put this on before going to bed, so applied it in the morning after a shower and let it dry very thoroughly before getting completely dressed.</li>
            <li> Like the product, but the bottle was only half full.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little work - commitment...but is worth it.</li>
            <li> , sorry do not remember the exact name right now and can not toggle back and forth )that works great for fake and ankles</li>
            <li> Trust me, I have tried and tested them all, Fake and Bake is exceptional, and the ONLY one I will use....</li>
            <li> Within a week after I stopped using it, my skin was back to its original pale color.</li>
            <li> I have light skin and my skin is hard to tan.</li>
            <li> Many male models use body makeup for the same purpose (hardly anyone has a 6-pack that looks like you see in pictures/movies without makeup or photo editing).</li>
            <li> Fake and Bake is amazing</li>
            <li> I generally put it on in the day time.  </li>
            <li> I have only used two products this and another one from a direct website.</li>
            <li> I have vitiligo  spreading on my hands and even though it doesn&#x27;t cover it up completely it does darken the white skin pigment.</li>
            <li> This is the only product so far that is mocha and not carrot orange color.</li>
            <li> Very low odor and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t panic it will look dark at first.</li>
            <li> The smell, but it&#x27;s to be expected and I&#x27;ve smelt worse.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do really like the product.</li>
            <li> Not remotely orange at all.  </li>
            <li> You just have to apply evenly and carefully and be prepared that it will get on your clothes and anything around for the first several hours.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake is by far the fastest, most natural looking product out there.</li>
            <li> t be kind of weird</li>
            <li> The lotion smells very good compared to others, but the fake tint is very messy and gets on everything, not to mentioon it stays put in every crease of skin</li>
            <li> I am an avid sunless tanner user since I am a pasty pale, can not tan naturally person.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Fake Bake for making my fantasies come true!</li>
            <li> I live in Mexico so returning is a total pain, but now I know for the future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean I leave huge globs</li>
            <li> Fake bake is the most natural looking tan on the market!  </li>
            <li> apply slivers of it carefully where you need to darken the skin and let it sit on the skin without rubbing it in very much (just rub slightly around the edges to push the lines of the lotion to a smooth curved contour and let the lotion sit for awhile, up to a few hours before wiping it off).</li>
            <li> I used Fake Bake last year and was very satisfied because it is the only self-tanning lotion that does not turn me orange.  </li>
            <li> I love fake bake products however this was old and runny.</li>
            <li> this is when I checked an old bottle that I had left over from last summer to see if it should be pitched....</li>
            <li> but you want it to look good, and it can go really wrong if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> I looked online and found the exact same product for half price.</li>
            <li> I apply this at night, because the color of this at first turns me into a very dark person.</li>
            <li> When you first apply the lotion, it is very dark.</li>
            <li> It was rich and dark brown in color which was nice because it didn&#x27;t have the typical orange hue of self tanners, but I found it difficult to fully rub in and especially evenly.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion (which is VERY dark and quite powerful) to essentially make contour lines around my nose that will last for up to 3 days -just</li>
            <li> this stuff, I NEVER rub it in all the way, I generally have it all over my wrist and various body parts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have funny chunks of tanner missing on my body</li>
            <li> Pretty real looking but still tough to use on feet &amp; hands.</li>
            <li> However, you don&#x27;t even get the instructions until AFTER you open the package, which recommends at least four other products that you should purchase for a better result.</li>
            <li> It was not the normal thick, rich consistency, and dark color I am used to.</li>
            <li> With Banana Boat, I would use half the bottle to apply one coat for the whole body.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used any lotions that don&#x27;t have a slight odor.</li>
            <li> Yes, there is a slight smell, but you can only notice it if you really stick your nose to your arm and smell.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Fake Bake I previously used..  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind looking unnaturally dark to people who know me, as long as the new people I meet will think that it&#x27;s natural, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> The result is not orange at all, the smell isn&#x27;t even too bad and goes away with one good shower.</li>
            <li> this stuff was messy and dark, it actually scared me where I had to call my husband in to help me apply it as quick as possible.</li>
            <li> A little really goes a long way</li>
            <li> But, after reading some of the reviews and all the helpful hints on how to apply fake bake, I must say that I am more than pleased with the purchase and will continue to buy fake bake for as long as they sell it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alarming at first because it&#x27;s very dark (don&#x27;t worry--</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several self-tanners, and I&#x27;ve only found ONE that worked on my skin, but long story...</li>
            <li> (I worried that the dark color guide would get in my pores, so I use clear airbrush solution on my face).  </li>
            <li> It gave me a small tint, so I don&#x27;t glow so much in the sun with my paleness (specifically my legs, which don&#x27;t see a lot of sun in the ever-wet state of WA).</li>
            <li> &amp; the lotion didn&#x27;t last 1/2 as long as the St. Tropez foam did.    </li>
            <li> When I come back from a tropical vacation people ask, \\&quot;Where&#x27;s your tan?\\&quot; No matter how long I stay out, I do not tan.</li>
            <li> and also i dont like to wear long shirts to bed ,only short sleaves shirts..and long sweat pants and socks..</li>
            <li> Barely to no smell.</li>
            <li> , it just doesnt last long at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used one that last as long as this one.&lt;br /&gt;The reason</li>
            <li> I get out and apply a regular lotion to dry spots (toes, ankles, knees, elbows, wrist and knuckles).</li>
            <li> I can reach my entire back, but am unable to rub it in super well in the middle-</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s necessary, but I&#x27;ve never had a single splotch in those areas.  </li>
            <li> I am a COMPLETE mess</li>
            <li> Rinsing it off after 4+ hours (per the directions) is a little unsettling, but it is true that afterward you still have a very natural color, not as dark as before the rinse, but very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> Was a little uneasy when I used it the first time because it is really dark but applied it let dry and went to bed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark dark dark chocolate brown right out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is not over rated, so many people say the same thing , you cannot go wrong with the application of this , nor the way it looks once its applied!</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes - after all, it really shouldn&#x27;t take much to get this raw chicken colored skin</li>
            <li> Color guide sucks because it looks so dark on skin but as long as you apply before bed and wash off in the morning it is all worth it.</li>
            <li> It makes you look like you sat on the beach all day long.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strange scent</li>
            <li> so self-tanners have always streaked on me or looked strange.  </li>
            <li> Watch out though because if you get wet or splashed it will come off and leave white spots.</li>
            <li> how long does this stay on you once you put the lotion on?</li>
            <li> this was a COMPLETE waste of money.</li>
            <li> If you decide to use this on your face, I suggest mixing a small amount with your normal face lotion.</li>
            <li> I found Fake-Bake on Amazon a few years ago when I swore-off tanning salons after my Dad developed skin cancer.</li>
            <li> I know what color my natural skin is when it&#x27;s tan, and this is dead on.  </li>
            <li> When i put the tinted lotion on my skin i was like &#x27;ahhhh hello long lost tan friend&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful when I read how everyone loved this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The only down to it is that the instant bronze gets all over your clothing.</li>
            <li> Looks natural on my pale skin and makes my legs look thinner.</li>
            <li> Also, some reviewers complained that it rinses right off down the drain, but that is just the color guide.  </li>
            <li> Self/sunless tanners like to soak into rough, thick, or dry skin and make those areas super dark.  </li>
            <li> Self/sunless tanners like to soak into rough, thick, or dry skin and make those areas super dark.  </li>
            <li> Its a pain for some to apply twice a week, but this product last as long as any other (including pro-spray tans)</li>
            <li> Although I am a heavy allergy-sufferer, I typically do not have problems with skin products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is black and makes your skin black when you first apply it, your pillows and sheets will be stained black</li>
            <li> I like to use it three nights in a row, then use other, lighter products for the next four nights.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it about once a week due to this inconvenience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fallen in love with Fake Bake self-tanner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless other sunless tanners without this ever happening.</li>
            <li> I love fake Bake!</li>
            <li> and I hope if any other red heads come along looking for a tanning solution,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my other self tanner</li>
            <li> I have tried other products over the years and always come back to this.</li>
            <li> This product works and creates a nice tan, however I prefer to use the Fake Bake spray instead, as this product can be hard to blend.</li>
            <li> I do not suggest wiping yourself dry in the morning</li>
            <li> Any of these self tanners dry my skin out and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li> Tan in the evening, giving yourself 30 minutes to dry before heading to bed.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry and the color indicator helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Shower, exfoliate, shave, completely dry off, put my hair up and apply with the gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then the dry time took FOREVER.</li>
            <li> I did the the proper prep work IE moisturize, moisturize, moisturize a few days prior...</li>
            <li> As far as fake tanners go - FAKE BAKE is still way better than spray tans!  </li>
            <li> I get compliments in my tan every single day</li>
            <li> I am going to do this for the next two nights to get the dark color I want, and then just do it once a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if something has changed or if I received old product.</li>
            <li> , I wanted to venture out since I have been using Banana Boat Summer Color Self-Tanning Lotion, Deep Dark Color,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers go into this in greater detail, so I won&#x27;t get too crazy with advice...</li>
            <li> It is also possible that it was exposed to extreme heat or cold prior to delivery; in which case, I paid full price for a faulty product.</li>
            <li> My favourite tan goes on well no streaking buy it every summer instant dark tan for any color of skin</li>
            <li> Then put on some loose clothing and hit the sack...</li>
            <li> Personally, I prefer the spray with the mitt of the same brand because it dries a little faster and in my opinion turns out darker, but I will continue to use the lotion with no complaints!</li>
            <li> There is no mess with the gloves and very little odor.</li>
            <li> The smell is not nearly as strong as other self tanners I&#x27;ve used, and it almost completely goes away once you wash off the guide color.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is very messy to apply (gloves provided), but I believe it gives a very realistic looking tan without the yellow/orange look (maybe because it includes some green pigment).  </li>
            <li> The first time I applied it, I was somewhat wary and didn&#x27;t put enough on.</li>
            <li> Then take a paper towel and rub the lotion off your palms and big toe knuckles, and wipe the lotion off your elbows (because of the color guide, it&#x27;ll look odd there, but it&#x27;ll be even in the morning).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale naturally.  </li>
            <li> - the only drawback is that it does go on dark, so be careful that you don&#x27;t touch something until it sinks into your skin.</li>
            <li> so it makes it easier to keep things even of back up if you happen to mess up.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake turned me into a very pretty color.</li>
            <li> , I am a little darker, considering how white I was.  </li>
            <li> If you applied it correctly using the little blue gloves included inside the box, you should be streak-free and even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended Fake Bake to me and after the first use, I am a dedicated user!</li>
            <li> I always try to find something a little cheaper BUT always come back to this.</li>
            <li> I have put several coats on hoping it would get a little darker and it never did.</li>
            <li> I received 2 different shipments as I returned the 1st, and both were green and ineffective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 and have spent a lot of time in the sun.</li>
            <li> &amp; I was SO bummed when after the careful application and wait time-</li>
            <li> I will make your sheets look like you wet</li>
            <li> but we&#x27;ll get to that in a sec...</li>
            <li> will it come off when you take a shower and get wet?  </li>
            <li> I use it for legs only all year round</li>
            <li> It stays too wet on my skin.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Fake Bake spray, but the post-spray bathroom cleanup was hardly worth it.</li>
            <li> Even spending days tanning outside or in beds, I remained pale.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t sunless tan, I am naturally so pale that I have a blue tint.  </li>
            <li> When i got out, i was pale again like I hadn&#x27;t put forth the effort to put on self tanner (we all know that to do it properly</li>
            <li> I wear a long sleeve black shirt/pants to bed and put a towel over the pillow - thorough wash in the morning.</li>
            <li> and when I used it daily it made me look like a copper mess!    </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of fake tanners may smell good at first, but the next day they smell awful.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going for a deep, dark tan just a little bit of color</li>
            <li> Like I couldn&#x27;t sit or put any clothes on for a while because I wanted it to dry (hate that sticky feeling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, after all of it, most of the color DID wash off, not just the color guide itself.</li>
            <li> During the summer months I sometimes use it every other day.    </li>
            <li> It is streaky, malodorous, and extremely over priced.  </li>
            <li> Not orange like alot of other tanners.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried almost all self tanners and won&#x27;t ever use any other product.</li>
            <li> Other then that smell</li>
            <li> Again, careful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a slacker with applying Fake Bake recently, but because my tan from spring break is finally fading away, I&#x27;m going to have to start using it again when I can&#x27;t go outside to tan.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> I will never buy any other sunless tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I can usually go 3-4 days between applications with this but only a day or two with the face spray.</li>
            <li> There is no way you could put this stuff on any time besides bedtime and then go out, because it would be extremely noticable.    </li>
            <li> The first time I used Fake Bake my husband noticed and exclaimed, \\&quot;You are TAN!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Only apply a small amount at a time, so you don&#x27;t end up with streaks.</li>
            <li> It has a color guard, so you can see where the product is going and DOESN&#x27;T streak which happens a lot with other self tanners.</li>
            <li> With other self-tanners I have used in the past this was never necessary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does seem to work without the orange color from other sunless tanners</li>
            <li> , I sure hope you don&#x27;t wake up disappointed and looking like a train wreck&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not turn orange like other self-tanners.  </li>
            <li> However this may just be due to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other, more expensive lotions/sprays and always come back to Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> You Must be very careful when applying and rub it in well.</li>
            <li> No more disgusting palms and beautiful even tan,</li>
            <li> So far out of my friends that have tried it the only ones that didn&#x27;t like it, used it wrong.</li>
            <li> Regarding any sunless tanner, whether it&#x27;s this Fake Bake or a non-tinted gradual tanner - my natural nails would get stained yellow from sunless tanners, even though I used lotion to wipe off the nails after I finished applying the tanner.  </li>
            <li> Regarding any sunless tanner, whether it&#x27;s this Fake Bake or a non-tinted gradual tanner - my natural nails would get stained yellow from sunless tanners, even though I used lotion to wipe off the nails after I finished applying the tanner.  </li>
            <li> Only fake tanner I have found that looks natural.</li>
            <li> I have red hair and VERY pale pinkish ginger skin</li>
            <li> I have used some fancy and expensive lotions in the past but they fade fairly quickly</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the gloves only last for a few applications before tearing - not good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used this was on vacation which is a little scary</li>
            <li> It was just too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> The bottle only gives about 3 uses and that&#x27;s if your conservative, at least for me.</li>
            <li> This gets dark.</li>
            <li> This will make me as dark as I can get.  </li>
            <li> As with both fake bake versions no matter how much I try it it goes on a bit to dark or if I mix with moisturizer to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I know that it is much safer to fake and bake with lotion....</li>
            <li> It does seem like you are losing all the color, in contrast to how dark you look off the bat.  </li>
            <li> It can get too dark otherwise.</li>
            <li> The tan looks even better when you have a slight base tan already.</li>
            <li> but I think it comes down to what your priority is..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the spray and hands down prefer the lotion -</li>
            <li> and I have my application routine down to 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all of the tint washed down the drain.</li>
            <li> The next morning, I washed off, and not a lick of the color (not even the green) had stayed on!!</li>
            <li> and i mean its a yellow tan and didnt go well on my body</li>
            <li> /&gt;BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN APPLYING ON YOUR FEET!</li>
            <li> My only disappointment was that the tan didn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> make sure to wear gloves because it is almost impossible to scrub off!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that if I keep the lotion on for about 4 hours, I will see a slight darkening.</li>
            <li> (I was not about to waste the money I had spent), and the color guide turned my body a mossy green tint.</li>
            <li> * Con: My hands and feet had a slight orange tint to them after the 1st shower.</li>
            <li> The color was odd also.</li>
            <li> It is also sold on Amazon for less 1/2 the price they sell at the tanning salons.</li>
            <li> i dont need this to mess up on my body, because i already tryed the tanning wipes and</li>
            <li> This stuff is a mess to put on.</li>
            <li> and when I did, it was dark green and liquidy.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other self-tanning products on the market, the Fake Bake line seems to look quite natural and not orange-ish at all.</li>
            <li> If you are pale as a ghost and haven&#x27;t had luck with other products, I think this might be for you!  </li>
            <li> It has a mild smell nothing bad,</li>
            <li> that sucks that after you wait it should be dry, and its not</li>
            <li> Alas, my legs stayed white but my palms (to which I applied a lot of lotion beforehand) turned DARK greenish/black.  </li>
            <li> The Fake Bake Self-Tanning Lotion gives a very natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> I shower, exfoliate, apply a little baby oil to areas like elbows, knees, ankles and toes, and use a moisturizer on my face, then apply this with gloves on.</li>
            <li> If they could find a way to extend the life of this fake tanner it could do away with tanning beds completely!</li>
            <li> Wish it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> Another plus is Fake Bake wears like a natural tan!</li>
            <li> I use this one as soon as i get out of shower with a little jergens lotion.</li>
            <li> I never sleep in this stuff, as it does seem like it would get on sheets, and it feels a little sticky after a couple hours.  </li>
            <li> But without the added color from the Sun.. I was a little underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> After two messy applications, I have very little colour as opposed to other sunless tanners I have tried.  </li>
            <li> You definitely need to wear the gloves they give you with this product, it stains your fingers and is very hard to get out.  </li>
            <li> My reason for purchasing Fake Bake was because of the positive reviews, and because it doesn&#x27;t have parabens (it still has propylene glycol though), but after using this it I can confidently declare that it is the worst I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Little messy on you hands</li>
            <li> It does go on very dark</li>
            <li> VERY sour smell.  </li>
            <li> The application was rather tedious but after feeling stupid at the beach (I live in charleston) for years and hating to show my legs in dresses, the application time was well worth it!</li>
            <li> It was GREEN.</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice, brown tan without giving you outrageously orange feet &amp; hands* (see note).</li>
            <li> I have researched it being green on the Internet</li>
            <li> and now my pores are green.</li>
            <li> The effect gradually fades over a few days (fades faster if you wash your face often).</li>
            <li> Maybe in filling or production it was not completely filled.  </li>
            <li> I blended Jergens natural glow with the Fake bake around my toes and ankles and around my wrists and hands.</li>
            <li> runs all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it turned green, and</li>
            <li> It was like green water.</li>
            <li> Just remember to buff lightly so not to steak.</li>
            <li> Must shower everyday or</li>
            <li> Turned green in bottle, tried it on one leg anyway</li>
            <li> and it turned green, washed it off and threw it away.</li>
            <li> I used it year round for years and when I moved overseas I couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried tons of self tan products and this one gets messy, sometimes turns you like green</li>
            <li> - What a waste of time and money...</li>
            <li> This gives the color time to develop, and you won&#x27;t have any uneven spots from clothing or sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> But you WILL be darker, and you can build your tan over a few days.  </li>
            <li> (the spray is messy).</li>
            <li> and it turned green.</li>
            <li> I feel this was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> it was green</li>
            <li> so my legs were green</li>
            <li> turns green on your skin and has a smell.</li>
            <li> I was recently looking into other self tanners (for my face) and came upon multiple reviews about self tanners that were very negative, so I decided to look up the rating for fake bake and realized that this product should have 5 stars.</li>
            <li> If you are pale, and want a nice bronze glow without shocking results-</li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need a VERY small amount (I learned this the hard way).</li>
            <li> Also, St. Tropez dries faster and rubs off on clothing less!</li>
            <li> &#x27; I don&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m one of those people who thought the color guide was what it would actually look like, I mean there was literally no tan on me whatsoever.</li>
            <li> and I go from pale to bronze over night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale</li>
            <li> No freckles, just pale skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff initially stinks to high heaven</li>
            <li> Pretty bad odor</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s so dark that if you don&#x27;t wear gloves your hands will be stained for at least a day.  </li>
            <li> If you want a self tanner that gives you a deep golden tan on application that doesn&#x27;t smell awful, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Using bare hands and washing them afterward has never worked for me, I&#x27;d still get crazy dark palms.  </li>
            <li> I mean GREEN in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Trashed it.</li>
            <li> Sorry Fake Bake...you really let me down.</li>
            <li> so when I ordered this is was afraid it would make me look orange due to my pink undertones but holy cow</li>
            <li> The main negative to this product is the inconvenient two step process involved in application.</li>
            <li> The products on the market usually leave you, sort of orangy.  </li>
            <li> I had melanoma this past year from tanning, so I am sticking to this.</li>
            <li> Applied Fake Bake last night.  </li>
            <li> , I simply do not worry about it and it has yet to leave any weird coloring.</li>
            <li> The gloves that were provided where too small for me from the start, but I decided to just push through the loss of circulation.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not possible with Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m an alien, but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for</li>
            <li> , the only thing is you might want to purchase the Fake Bake Skin Smoothie for elbows and knees</li>
            <li> The only places I don&#x27;t apply the Fake Bake are my hands and feet</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll be using this one again.</li>
            <li> I usually get 6 of these, they keep me tan all year.</li>
            <li> For All Skin Tones for the past year</li>
            <li> I bought this product in a local beauty store, but it was expensive.</li>
            <li> I am naturally pale and have a hard time tanning, so I use self tanners to get my glow.  </li>
            <li> and they wore off very uneven</li>
            <li> if you apply it before bed - VERY MESSY - you can&#x27;t wear clothes with it on and it takes hours to soak</li>
            <li> Worse than any other sunless tanner I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll apply the fake bake and apply a thick layer of regular lotion to elbows, knees and wrists before application.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin</li>
            <li> I am very pale and have used this product for years.  </li>
            <li> However I use it even in the winter when I am very pale.</li>
            <li> Thought maybe something would be wrong with this item because I usually order directly off the Fake Bake website.</li>
            <li> Hard to squeeze out of the bottle</li>
            <li> im a little confused</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER had a bad reaction to any topical/lotion products before, but this gave me little red bumps everywhere!    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not thrilled at that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never too late to stop UV tanning and start sunless tanning.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a sucker.</li>
            <li> After that...plan on doing nothing for at least 4-6 hours.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s at least a 20-30 minute process.</li>
            <li> , I find the ability to adjust the tone after the fact to be a plus rather than a negative.</li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake but was very disappointed when I received this.</li>
            <li> I like fake bake but its not worth the price.</li>
            <li> As is the case with any self tanner, if too much is used, you&#x27;re going to look like an orange person with a bad fake tan.</li>
            <li> I bumped up Fake Bake to 4 stars because though it&#x27;s inconvenient the tan came out even and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I used this in the past and has mad my body dark brown.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is that you MUST wear gloves when applying it.  </li>
            <li> I received my Fake Bake and the liquid is green.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had put it on before I researched it being green</li>
            <li> I have tried a few tanning solutions -- including spray on -- and they ALL leave tell-tale streaks or are a weird color.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the spray.</li>
            <li> when I drug it out, it was a weird slimy green color, stained every thing it touched, weird green.  </li>
            <li> However you would describe the smell, it is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not really sure where I went wrong?</li>
            <li> With Fake Bake, I just use a couple small drops on each body part, and it&#x27;s plenty of coverage.</li>
            <li> I also have a thick mattress pad because sunless tanner will work its way through a fitted sheet and stain your mattress if you don&#x27;t have a pad under your sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Wear gloves!  </li>
            <li> I have a very hard time maintaining a tan, so I decided to try and use this.</li>
            <li> I no longer glow in the dark from my startling fairness!</li>
            <li> When I say &amp;#34;prep&amp;#34; I mean exfoliate!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I learned this the hard way.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m completely addicted</li>
            <li> They either applied it poorly, didn&#x27;t exfoliate or applied it, showered it off and never thought to re-apply.</li>
            <li> That way you get a hint of color, rather than too much that will end up looking awful.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, which other self tanners that I have used do.</li>
            <li> Also, the color it gave me was very minimal and stunk SO BAD.</li>
            <li> I hate sunless tanners, not to say I haven&#x27;t tried every single one...</li>
            <li> This product was described as not having the bad smell of other self-tanners, but unfortunately it still has that smell.</li>
            <li> With Fake Bake the color visibly fills your pores on your face (which they warn you about on the pamphlet, but I tend to think they use that as a scare tactic to buy all their other products), and just looks bad on your hands (even with meticulous application).</li>
            <li> I have never experienced any streaking or weird color</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was some sort of knock off, but it was bad and Fake Bake is not cheap.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Fake Bake self tanner.  </li>
            <li> If I was to recommend a fake tanner-St.</li>
            <li> After hearing rave reviews, I decided to try Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> It goes on a weird brown; you won&#x27;t want to put this on before you go off to school or work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every fake tan out there, for like thirteen-ish bucks</li>
            <li> my Fake Bake arrived, I exfoliated like there was no tomorrow, then faithfully put on my gloves and massaged it onto my legs.  </li>
            <li> But with Fake Bake, I don&#x27;t have that worry-</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than the Fake Bake Face Spray.</li>
            <li> I like to mix it with suntan lotion if I&#x27;m going to be in the sun - and, if I&#x27;ve had a spray tan, Fake Bakle helps keep that tan longer as it fades away after awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything from drugstore graduals to airbrush solutions, and I hope they never stop making this Fake Bake lotion.  </li>
            <li> I will stick with fake bake from now on</li>
            <li> Fake Bake do</li>
            <li> A friend told me about fake bake</li>
            <li> I always worry about using the wrong lotion that may fade it quicker.</li>
            <li> Never get the &#x27;fake tan&#x27; look on elbows, knees, wrists, or ankles.  </li>
            <li> I have used fake bake for years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fake Bake for years and always get compliments on my tan</li>
            <li> Sometimes I apply the bronzer over the Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> I swear by Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> I called the makers of fake bake and told them what happened</li>
            <li> however this Fake Bake lotion would so i took a gamble</li>
            <li> I like Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> Now, if you&#x27;re considering Fake Bake yourself, by all means, go for it.</li>
            <li> this Fake Bake  will do the trick.</li>
            <li> just use Fake Bake &amp; follow up with some Satin Glow product.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the fake bake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there and Fake Bake</li>
            <li> hate being pale.</li>
            <li> (though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s nearly as bad as some of the other products out there), but once you get used to it, the smell isn&#x27;t so bad.    </li>
            <li> It stinks like all fake tanning lotion</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have any unpleasant fake tan odor at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just know that in doing this, you&#x27;re taking the risk of it not working out and being very disappointed and having wasted money.</li>
            <li> This one, however, broke me out in hives like crazy.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased self tanner before because I&#x27;m afraid of streaking and the orangey look.</li>
            <li> rules apply to all self-tanners, otherwise you&#x27;re setting yourself up for disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to scrub rigorously.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I use Fake Bake 12 months out of the year!</li>
            <li> Then I found Fake Bake!  </li>
            <li> , people not knowing it&#x27;s fake!  </li>
            <li> I bought this and had a really bad reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> this is not at all a bad deal.</li>
            <li> But, I cannot give 5 stars because it smells bad</li>
            <li> It was like it was expired or had gone bad.  </li>
            <li> The color seems to wash off as soon as you shower and it smells bad.</li>
            <li> and it smells bad.</li>
            <li> smell isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Not too bad though.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even think about doing an allergy test,and applied like directed, it literally felt like bee stings, I broke out in a rash, felt sick, and it didn&#x27;t wash off.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Fake Bake because supposedly celebrities use it, however I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this from a friend&#x27;s recommendation and I was not at all disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> However, when I got it and applied it, I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, when I got it and applied it, I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fake Bake for years!!</li>
            <li> I hate wearing makeup in the summer and do go to the gym.  </li>
            <li> I chalk this up to application technique and exfoliating, but it&#x27;s still annoying to &#x27;tan&#x27; and then look like Tony the tiger.    </li>
            <li> and I just hate sleeping in it.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It is a horrible product.  </li>
            <li> My feet looked horrible.  </li>
            <li> find a beach, smells terrible.</li>
            <li> smears awful.</li>
            <li> Once I got them on, I guess the straining of the latex with the friction from my leg hair caused both gloves to rip and my hands looked disgusting.</li>
            <li> However, I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find that when this lotion came to me, it was already EXPIRED!!</li>
            <li> and it was nasty..</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t awful</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Best self tan product! Easy to use. Great results. I have recommended this product to several co-workers and all have had a wonderful experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Good product. I&#x27;m tan.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product. I have tried all different kinds of self tanners and all are the same--orangy, smelly, streaky! I am very impressed with FakeBake. It is awesome! So easy to use and it looks amazing. My friend asked me if I had started going back to the tanning bed. This is such a great product--definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> The bottom line on the Fake Bake lotion is that it will eventually turn you believably tan, not orange.  The flip side to this is that you have to wear the lotion to bed overnight and will stain any bedding you come in contact with.  Luckily the stains wash out, but it is a bother, especially if you want a deeper tan and put the lotion on repeatedly over the course of a week.  That said, on cleansed, exfoliated skin this product delivers a nice golden tan which lasts for a few days, more if you repeat the process.  If you can live with the clean-up, this is the go-to tanning product for you.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many tanning products but since finding this one I have not used another one!! I get compliments in my tan every single day and I didn&#x27;t have to experience any sun damage to get it!!! BEST PRODUCT EVER!!</li>
            <li> Makes you look tan all over. Little messy on you hands but the outcome is a well rounded tan. Nice</li>
            <li> I received 2 different shipments as I returned the 1st, and both were green and ineffective.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  The products on the market usually leave you, sort of orangy.  Not this product.  It makes you look like you sat on the beach all day long.  If you make a mistake, you can easily wash it off in the shower.  I do recommend wearing gloves while putting this lotion on.  I hate wearing makeup in the summer and do go to the gym.  With this product I have a nice glow and a soft tan on my face and arms.  I generally put it on in the day time.  The next day it is a nice tan on my legs, arms and face.  Get this product.  I get more then one when I order.  During the summer months I sometimes use it every other day.    It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> No smell, no orangeness, no streaks and it lasts- what more could you ask?  I guess cheapness and being available at the drugstore.   I&#x27;m very fair, and was only looking to remove the florescent blue-whiteness of my legs so that I could wear summer skirts and swimsuits without looking like I had \\&quot;naked legs\\&quot;.  This product was perfect for removing the whitiness and leaving my legs perfectly natural looking.  Not a dramatic bronzing (I&#x27;d probably have to apply a second night for that), but no one would ever guess that I was using a tanning cream.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from a friend&#x27;s recommendation and I was not at all disappointed. I am very pale and this made my skin just a few shades darker and gave me a wonderful glow.  I wasn&#x27;t going for a deep, dark tan just a little bit of color so I didn&#x27;t use it as often as others but I liked it. Definitely put it on at night and yes the lotion does stain but comes out with normal washing. I like it because it only took a a couple applications to get the color of skin I desired. I would-will buy again and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years to help reduce the splotchy white patches of vitiligo on my hands and arms.  It does a great job.  The newest bottle is a lot thicker in consistency than previous ones and is a just a bit harder to apply, but it still does a good job.  The colorant in the product makes it easy to see where it&#x27;s been applied.  I found that a slightly damp makeup sponge makes a great applicator and helps spread it evenly.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Fake Bake self tanner.  It is a horrible product.  It is streaky, malodorous, and extremely over priced.  If you accidentally get it on anything, like clothing or the skin, it stains.  At $20, it is a total rip off.  I will never buy this product again and would give it 0 stars if it was possible.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner on the market for the price.  Doesn&#x27;t make my skin orange but just a nice brown.</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks after using to review this product, and I must say it is great. You get great color with this product and don&#x27;t have to apply it everyday. I use it once or twice a week and I go from pale to bronze over night. Following the directions and the tips in these reviews and this stuff should work great for you. I shower, exfoliate, apply a little baby oil to areas like elbows, knees, ankles and toes, and use a moisturizer on my face, then apply this with gloves on. You&#x27;ll be brown from the color guide. wake up in the morning and shower off the guide and you&#x27;ll be left with a great bronzed sun-kissed tan. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, just ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li> Still the best self tanner out there. I&#x27;m the blonde hair, blue eyes, super fair skin type and it helps me look like I&#x27;ve been living on a island! I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is by far the best, and this specific original formula of fake bake. Not orange at all and u can reapply each night till you get your desired deepness of color. I had melanoma this past year from tanning, so I am sticking to this. Can&#x27;t find a better price than here on Amazon either. Will rebuy over and over again!</li>
            <li> Ok! Applied Fake Bake last night.  The lotion went on really great,  Did not take long to dry maybe 10 minutes at the most! It does go on very dark so you can tell where you you applying it and if you miss a spot.  The application gloves came with the lotion, YES use the gloves.  Once I finished applying it to my body, i took the gloves off and used a cotton ball to apply around my hands and fingers,  I showered the this morning like the directions recommend and you do see the excess coming off in the shower, I am a little darker, considering how white I was.  I am going to do this for the next two nights to get the dark color I want, and then just do it once a week.  I read all the reviews before I purchased this and pretty much everyone gave it really great reviews, so I wanted to write one myself since I had a good experience with this product.  Amazon is the place to purchase this as well. :)</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have  used.  Not orange like alot of other tanners.  Worth the extra $.</li>
            <li> This is so smelly I almost gag putting it on.  &amp; it&#x27;s so dark that if you don&#x27;t wear gloves your hands will be stained for at least a day.  It was just too dark for me.  My feet looked horrible.  If you have patients &amp; can stand under a light &amp; put it on perfect it would be good I guess, but I don&#x27;t have the time.</li>
            <li> i love the product and i feel it was a great price for what i got.  i also received it very quickly too.</li>
            <li> Love! I have all of fake bakes products and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to stop going to the tanning salon to save my skin; seen too many older sun wrinkled people. I&#x27;m 38 and have spent a lot of time in the sun. This is even better than a tan from the sun because it applies evenly and you don&#x27;t have to spend days in the sun, turning over, etc. Doesn&#x27;t get better than this AT ALL! And I&#x27;ve tried almost all self tanners and won&#x27;t ever use any other product.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading great reviews and my own mom having try and really like the product. It does look gross and smells ok, but ALL fake tanners have that smell to them(this one has it too not bad at ALL though). Here&#x27;s what I didn&#x27;t like:    *It DID streak when my mom used it, but not with me(more on my &#x27;color&#x27; later). I chalk this up to application technique and exfoliating, but it&#x27;s still annoying to &#x27;tan&#x27; and then look like Tony the tiger.    *It isn&#x27;t as easy to apply as others that I have used. St. Tropez foam with the pump top is much simpler to apply and easier to cover you than Fake Bake lotion. Also, St. Tropez dries faster and rubs off on clothing less! &amp; the lotion didn&#x27;t last 1/2 as long as the St. Tropez foam did.    *The color was non-existent on me! FYI-I do tan easily and have yellow undertones in my skin that make me look darker than others even when I&#x27;m not tanned. &amp; I was SO bummed when after the careful application and wait time- I HAD NO RESULTS! I&#x27;ve never ever experienced this from a self tanner before, even the cheapies. I used the same amount as other products I&#x27;ve used and the same amount as my mother did with this product, who got great color results. So I&#x27;m not really sure where I went wrong? &amp; YES..I tried it twice to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a fluke even applying more the second go around.    So in short, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again because of the total lack of color alone. It&#x27;s not hard to apply, but I prefer St. Tropez foam because it is quicker and easier and the bottle lasts forever. If I was to recommend a fake tanner-St. Tropez would be it.</li>
            <li> I have used almost every self-tanning product available. This product looks very real and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  You Must be very careful when applying and rub it in well. It comes with gloves and if you don&#x27;t use them, your palms will be tan too! Fake Bake is my favorite:)</li>
            <li> Thought maybe something would be wrong with this item because I usually order directly off the Fake Bake website. I got this item for almost half price from amazon and worked great. This is definitely my favorite self tanner that I have been using for over 5 years. Gives the most natural color. Color guide sucks because it looks so dark on skin but as long as you apply before bed and wash off in the morning it is all worth it. Love this self tanner.</li>
            <li> I bought this and had a really bad reaction to it.  I didn&#x27;t even think about doing an allergy test,and applied like directed, it literally felt like bee stings, I broke out in a rash, felt sick, and it didn&#x27;t wash off. I have used tanning products before so This actually made me more weary on what kind I use. Obviously I cant speak for anyone else but use caution with this or any kind of product</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after quite a bit of research online and on Amazon. It arrived 2 days after I ordered it. I followed all the directions and was so pleased at the results!! The bottle looks like many of the rows of products you would see at a salon or spa/salon/tanning place. I have fair skin which rarely tans, my arms get a light brown from outdoor summer activities, but my stomach has not seen the light of day in years! The application was smooth, the color genuine, and the mess was minimal. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I was a bit intimidated when I first put this on, as it looked like I had dumped Hershey&#x27;s syrup on my legs. Quite a departure from the Jergens gradual tanner I&#x27;ve used in recent years. However, my fears were unfounded. I no longer glow in the dark from my startling fairness! I look like a person that is willing to go outside when it&#x27;s hot, which I am not (due to my aversion to sweating and discomfort).</li>
            <li> Product was wonderful, I was a HUGE tanning fanatic and after discovering a scary mole that did turn up to be malignant melanoma I knew I needed to stop! Fake and Bake is amazing there are pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s as with any sunless tanning lotion.. I have previously used Jergens and Nivea gradual tans and while they were ok, I have very light skin and they wore off very uneven and when I used it daily it made me look like a copper mess!    I simply take a shower and shave and use a loofah sponge, nothing intense by any means, normal shave/body wash.. I get out and apply a regular lotion to dry spots (toes, ankles, knees, elbows, wrist and knuckles). I put on some gloves and get to work I start w/a quarter size for the calf and sorta use what&#x27;s extra on the feet and knees and then work up from there.. I am a COMPLETE mess w/this stuff, I NEVER rub it in all the way, I generally have it all over my wrist and various body parts. I rub it in when/if I get to it. I don&#x27;t mean I leave huge globs, I simply do not worry about it and it has yet to leave any weird coloring. I do find if I over work the product it starts to seem scary, but it&#x27;s always absolutely great the next day... i also get dressed in loose shorts and a T right after.. Washes right out of everything. I do not suggest wiping yourself dry in the morning and I also don not use my loofah or exfoliating washes until the next week.. I do not spend extended amount of time in the shower or swim.     Realistically it would be AMAZING if they could create a lotion that not only makes you tan but keeps you tan w/o reapplying and coming completely off at your pool party but I think it comes down to what your priority is.. You can make the color darker by reapplying nightly.. and the color DOES stay for about 3-4 days after 2 days of applying. It can be a pain but for me w/2 kids and a husband to take care of, getting 45 min to go to a salon for even a spray tan (at 20 bucks and only last 5-7 days and will come off just as easily) tan in a lotion that doesn&#x27;t make me look weird or streak is the best. If it is streaking make sure you are completely dry of water and sweat.. I notice if I start to sweat it doesn&#x27;t create nearly as great of a tan in that particular area..     Great product worth the cost, time, and saves your skin!! What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> This is the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve found to date.  It looks like a real tan!!  No orange, and no streaks!!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it darkens my sun spots.  I used to live in the sun, and now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s I have some sun damage and sun spots.  This tans and darkens your skin, however it also darkens your sun spots.  With that being said, since your skin is darker, I guess it all evens out.  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other tanners like jergans and loreal and nothing is better then this stuff. I put it on for 2 nights in a row and my legs are a beautiful brown. It lasts about a week also. It does have a strange scent but it doesn&#x27;t matter to me. I&#x27;d rather smell funny then ruin my skin from tanning beds or sunlight :)&lt;br /&gt; I LOVEEE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> Wow!  I&#x27;m extremely pale so self-tanners have always streaked on me or looked strange.  I tested this Friday night on my legs and torso and I am impressed.  No streaks, and by mixing some lotion with it to go over my knees and feet, they look pretty normal too.  It does take some time to apply, but it is well worth it. If you are pale as a ghost and haven&#x27;t had luck with other products, I think this might be for you!  You will be VERY brown after application, but when you shower, it will wash off leaving the nice non-streaky tan.</li>
            <li> Using this sunless tanning lotion is NOT something I look forward to. It&#x27;s because of the strong \\&quot;skunky\\&quot; odor it produces when it dries. However you would describe the smell, it is not pleasant. It is very noticeable and when you wake up in the morning, your entire room reeks of it. Don&#x27;t worry, its not permanent, and it gets much better after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s my only con on this product. Other then that smell, I love the color I get from this and think it&#x27;s one of the best sunless tanning systems out there right now besides Famous Daves. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying, it&#x27;s going to go on brown. That&#x27;s the color guide. It freaks some people out. Cancel any plans you might have about leaving the house that night, because you will look quite funny.&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, shower, and go about your normal routine and enjoy your tan! If you applied it correctly using the little blue gloves included inside the box, you should be streak-free and even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN APPLYING ON YOUR FEET! This stuff like most sunless tanning formulas got on the top of my big toes and stained them dark orange. Ew! It lasts a while too, even after your tan has faded. Again, careful! Not too cute when wearing your flip flops.</li>
            <li> This product gave me definite results-unlike many products where it&#x27;s a gradual color. After one application, I look like I&#x27;ve spent a day at the beach which is exactly what I wanted to achieve. It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky which is great! It dries quickly. No annoying scent. You must wear gloves. Fairly easy to apply and looks even.  Great product!  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m part hispanic, part white, so I have \\&quot;golden\\&quot; (aka yellow) undertones to my skin. So Fake Bake didn&#x27;t give me much more color. It gave me a small tint, so I don&#x27;t glow so much in the sun with my paleness (specifically my legs, which don&#x27;t see a lot of sun in the ever-wet state of WA). But it didn&#x27;t do much beside that. If I had pink or no undertones, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have been very happy with the light tan this produced. But if you are olive or light-olive undertoned already, it probably won&#x27;t do much for you.</li>
            <li> save your money. find a beach, smells terrible. smears awful.</li>
            <li> Make sure to exfoliate first. Looks natural on my pale skin and makes my legs look thinner.</li>
            <li> I read many great reviews for Fake Bake Self-Tanner on different websites so I decided to give it a try (Amazon had the best price).  I&#x27;m glad I did because this stuff really works!  I&#x27;m have fair skin and Fake Bake gives me a nice light brown tan with just one use.  I found that my tan looks best if I apply it 2 days in a row.  The only bad thing about it is that you MUST wear gloves when applying it.  It WILL stain your hands.  Unfortunately I learned this the hard way.  BTW, when I got some on my bathroom rug I threw it in the wash right away and it didn&#x27;t stain at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I&#x27;m a guy, which is important because it directly relates to some points I&#x27;ll be making. Here we go.&lt;br /&gt;I hate being pale. I&#x27;d go spray tanning from time to time but found it very costly. I also don&#x27;t tan at all in the sun. I go from ghost to tomato in a day out in the sun. I have used products like Jergens Natural Glow but I didn&#x27;t like how light the effect was. I&#x27;m always for Bigger is Better. I don&#x27;t mind looking unnaturally dark to people who know me, as long as the new people I meet will think that it&#x27;s natural, if that makes sense. I also don&#x27;t mind the orange tint that several self tanners give. After hearing rave reviews, I decided to try Fake Bake. The color it gave me was fantastic and it CAN be built upon. I like to use it three nights in a row, then use other, lighter products for the next four nights. The bottle only gives about 3 uses and that&#x27;s if your conservative, at least for me. This is where being a guy becomes important. I am not a tiny, petite thing with a 6 inch waist. I have manly arms and thighs and a large chest and torso. It takes a lot of product to cover me up. I also have hairy legs. The gloves that were provided where too small for me from the start, but I decided to just push through the loss of circulation. While trying to get one glove on, it ripped and I needed to open the second bottle I bought for the extra glove. Once I got them on, I guess the straining of the latex with the friction from my leg hair caused both gloves to rip and my hands looked disgusting. I have since bought a tanning mit and a box of latex gloves that fit my hands. No more disgusting palms and beautiful even tan, IF you know how to rub it in. The loss of one star is because I need to purchase these bottles so frequently.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY self tanners, and this is my favorite one for body.  It is reasonably priced, it is natural looking, and it is easy to apply.  I apply it prior to going to bed for the evening.  If you want it darker you just apply again the next evening.  I have friends that use it on their face.  I have sensitive skin so I only use it for body.  GREAT product</li>
            <li> Lotion went on evenly and smoothly, and I loved the natural looking tan it gave.  My only disappointment was that the tan didn&#x27;t last long at all.  If they could find a way to extend the life of this fake tanner it could do away with tanning beds completely!</li>
            <li> This stuff is not over rated, so many people say the same thing , you cannot go wrong with the application of this , nor the way it looks once its applied!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and produces a nice, bronzy even tan.  I don&#x27;t like the smell but the results are well worth it.  I like this better than a spray tan at a salon because I can control excessive color build up around my heels, toe nails and hands better in my well lit bathroom.  With that said, be careful around you toes and toenails and be sure to get some exfoliating gloves to use beforehand.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful but once opened it doesn&#x27;t last and I&#x27;m not thrilled at that.  It should last longer than it does..</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 12 yrs now and love the results. It smells much better than most and I love the instant color. If you are bothered by the scent at all I recommend wearing it to bed (be sure it&#x27;s dry but any color will wash out of linens) and washing it off in the morning before you leave home. You won&#x27;t be able to enjoy the bronzing color but the long term color is great. It&#x27;s my summer must have!</li>
            <li> This stuff initially stinks to high heaven (though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s nearly as bad as some of the other products out there), but once you get used to it, the smell isn&#x27;t so bad.    I&#x27;ve never used a gradual tanner before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. The first time I applied it, I was somewhat wary and didn&#x27;t put enough on. The color guide is somewhat misleading and made my legs look darker than they actually were. Every time after that, however, I was a bit more generous and I began noticing results sooner rather than later.    This stuff works really well alongside tanning out in the sun. I&#x27;ve noticed that if I keep the lotion on for about 4 hours, I will see a slight darkening. I haven&#x27;t slept with it overnight because I feel kind of grody while I&#x27;m wearing this, and I don&#x27;t want to stain my sheets.    I&#x27;ve been a slacker with applying Fake Bake recently, but because my tan from spring break is finally fading away, I&#x27;m going to have to start using it again when I can&#x27;t go outside to tan. Introduced my mom to it, and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying another bottle soon.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this product, as I had heard awesome stuff about it. I was also excited because I&#x27;d gotten it so cheap! I had ordered indoor tanning lotions for tanning beds off Amazon before, and they were all fresh when shipped to me. However, I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find that when this lotion came to me, it was already EXPIRED!! It was GREEN. I slathered it on anyway (I was not about to waste the money I had spent), and the color guide turned my body a mossy green tint. The next morning, I washed off, and not a lick of the color (not even the green) had stayed on!! DO NOT RISK BUYING THIS ONLINE. This company makes this product with highly organic ingredients, so its shelf life is only 11 months. It&#x27;s better to suck it up and spend the money for this tanner, because it&#x27;s WORTH IT when it&#x27;s FRESH!!</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to this as the greatest stuff, I hated it at first because I would do as the directions told me and put it on at night then shower in the morning. The shower would remove my glorious tanned skin. I stopped using it until my friend told me she just puts in on in the morning then puts her clothes and makeup on top of it. I started doing that and I&#x27;m completely addicted, I just apply it with gloves every morning to my face, neck, upper chest, arms and legs if I&#x27;m wearing shorts. A little goes a long way, it blends great into wrists and ankles and the color is awesome-no orange. Watch out though because if you get wet or splashed it will come off and leave white spots. :) It will show up on your light colored clothes but washes right out. My white sheets are always red from it rubbing off at night but it washes right out. Also it smells at first but once dry doesnt smell anymore unless you try to put lotion on top of it or sweat a lot. These are just things I have learned from it but it truly is my favorite sunless tanner and believe me, I have tried A LOT!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I saw a girl with a great tan and asked her what she used, she said &amp;#34;fake bake! it&#x27;s the best.&amp;#34;  I ordered some and love it! It lasts from 3-5 days without any re-applying, so if I were to re-apply I could probably keep it going for awhile.  Perfect for an event that you want to be tan for - just shave, exfoliate, dry your skin off, and then apply this stuff and let it dry, then go to bed and shower the next day and viola! perfect tan! it always looks like it&#x27;s going t be kind of weird but after that shower the next day it blends perfectly and looks great! If you want to be tanner just re-apply, wait many hours or sleep on it, and shower again.</li>
            <li> I am a very very fair skinned person. No freckles, just pale skin. This product transforms me into a light brown tan person! The lotion is pretty easy to apply, just keep rubbing it in until it is even. The color guide is super helpful, and I personally can put it on and wear it out without feeling like the color guide makes me orange. Personally, I prefer the spray with the mitt of the same brand because it dries a little faster and in my opinion turns out darker, but I will continue to use the lotion with no complaints!</li>
            <li> So this is a really nice self tanner. As is the case with any self tanner, if too much is used, you&#x27;re going to look like an orange person with a bad fake tan. It goes on a weird brown; you won&#x27;t want to put this on before you go off to school or work. I put it on at night, and shower it off in the morning. I will make your sheets look like you wet the bed(there will be a giant orange blow where you slept) but that washes out. I have olive skin, and this product is 100% capable of making me an Oompaloompa worthy. Don&#x27;t believe the reviews that say it isn&#x27;t orange at all, because frankly, it is. The trick is applying below the orange threshold. I&#x27;ve tried every fake tan out there, for like thirteen-ish bucks this is not at all a bad deal.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned redhead. When I come back from a tropical vacation people ask, \\&quot;Where&#x27;s your tan?\\&quot; No matter how long I stay out, I do not tan. On a positive note, after using this tanner, I looked the most tan I have ever been (except when using a bronzing gel which washed off). The main negative to this product is the inconvenient two step process involved in application. I like to take showers early in the day and put a tanner on right afterward. Then head outside. I especially like to do this on vacation. That&#x27;s not possible with Fake Bake. The product is not invisible but leaves a brown streaky residue all over. You have to leave it on several hours or overnight then take another shower to wash it off before going outside. While it&#x27;s on, you have to wear long dark colored sweat pants to make sure it doesn&#x27;t rub off on your furniture or bedding. If you&#x27;re ok with all this hassle, then you do get a nice natural looking tan which lasts about 3 to 5 days. I&#x27;ve only been using it about once a week due to this inconvenience. There are other good products out there that don&#x27;t require this extra step. I have ordered Natures Gate Glow Lotion and will try that instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Tried Natures Gate Glow Lotion and it left streaks on my arms and legs plus looked orange on me. I bumped up Fake Bake to 4 stars because though it&#x27;s inconvenient the tan came out even and natural looking.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. If you want a self tanner that gives you a deep golden tan on application that doesn&#x27;t smell awful, this product is for you. This is the best self tanner I have ever tried. You will not find a better one on the market. If you think the cost is high on this product, consider how much you spend for 1 spray tan. Spray tans do not work nearly as nice as this product and you get several applications out of 1 bottle.</li>
            <li> This  stuff  is  great ,stop  wasting  your  money  on L&#x27;Or√©al</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m an alien, but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been very light-skinned.  Even spending days tanning outside or in beds, I remained pale. I even got a spray tan once before a vacation and waited about 30 hours (ick) so it would &#x27;soak in&#x27; or something, but it washed off in my first shower.  It was not a big deal when I lived in snow country, but now that I&#x27;m a California girl I really want to ditch the pantyhose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several self-tanners, and I&#x27;ve only found ONE that worked on my skin, but long story... it disappeared &amp; I couldn&#x27;t remember the name or find it - until today - but we&#x27;ll get to that in a sec...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Neutrogenia at the recommendation of a friend, but color didn&#x27;t show up at all.  I finally came onto Amazon and read bazillion reviews of self-tanners and found that this one seemed to be everyone&#x27;s favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my Fake Bake arrived, I exfoliated like there was no tomorrow, then faithfully put on my gloves and massaged it onto my legs.  I had such high hopes - after all, it really shouldn&#x27;t take much to get this raw chicken colored skin darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application was a bit tricky, but because there is color in the lotion, it&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;ve applied it.  It actually looked pretty good right after the application - but the color washed off the next day.  And every day after I applied it. I finally made the mistake of thinking that if it wasn&#x27;t putting any color onto my legs it wouldn&#x27;t dye my hands if I just went gloveless as I kept on trying  Alas, my legs stayed white but my palms (to which I applied a lot of lotion beforehand) turned DARK greenish/black.  So I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was convinced that I would have to keep buying pantyhose-- until today when I stumbled upon the ONLY tanner that worked on me 5 years ago.  It&#x27;s by Sun Laboratories.  For me, it worked the first time I put it on, didn&#x27;t have as strong of a smell as most self-tanners, and left a dark natural-looking tan.  It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than some, but if you have skin that is resistant to self-tanners, give it a try.  I just ordered some and can&#x27;t wait to be TAN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!than some, but if you have skin that is resistant to self-tanners, give it a try.  I just ordered some and can&#x27;t wait to be TAN!      Good luck!</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake Self-Tanning Lotion gives a very natural looking tan.  Rinsing it off after 4+ hours (per the directions) is a little unsettling, but it is true that afterward you still have a very natural color, not as dark as before the rinse, but very natural looking.  I will order and use the product again and again.  I had previously used a more expensive mousse self-tanner that was very good, but for the money Fake Bake goes just as good a job!!</li>
            <li> After using this lotion for 4 days in a row, I looked as if I had been to the tanning bed for a week straight. It gives you a nice, brown tan without giving you outrageously orange feet &amp; hands* (see note). I will continue to use this product - on my body &amp; face.    It&#x27;s a good idea to put a little lotion on your feet and hands beforehand. Also, don&#x27;t use too much on one spot - especially with your hands and feet. I used a little too much on one of my hands and ending up with 1 very dark hand - lol.    It&#x27;s nice being able to apply this before going to bed and not having to re-apply it in the morning like other lotions.    * Con: My hands and feet had a slight orange tint to them after the 1st shower. I noticed after the 2nd shower, everything looks a lot more natural.</li>
            <li> Fake bake is my favorite tanning product and this stuff works great!</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and this makes me orange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fallen in love with Fake Bake self-tanner! I&#x27;ve used almost all self tanners, since they first started coming out on the market over 10 years ago. Fake bake is by far, the best one I&#x27;ve used. I used to use Banana Boat&#x27;s Deep/Dark tanner, and even though it would give me a great color, it would still look blotchy at times, especially on the hands/feet. But with Fake Bake, I don&#x27;t have that worry- it really is foolproof. And the color is great- it gives a natural tan glow, not fake or orangey. The best part is, a little goes a long way. With Banana Boat, I would use half the bottle to apply one coat for the whole body. With Fake Bake, I just use a couple small drops on each body part, and it&#x27;s plenty of coverage. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER had a bad reaction to any topical/lotion products before, but this gave me little red bumps everywhere!    I tried it once, and a day later had a bumpy rash. I thought it could have been from something else so I tried it once more a week later, and had the same reaction.     Also, the color it gave me was very minimal and stunk SO BAD. Worse than any other sunless tanner I have tried. My fiance literally didn&#x27;t want to be near me because it stunk so much!    I&#x27;ve tried countless other sunless tanners without this ever happening. Be careful!</li>
            <li> ok so i just bought this product and i havnt used this yet,... i am tryin to use something different... so the first thing i gotta do is use gloves when applyin this lotion..and do the small stuff first then the large... and then after that you expeally have to put it on at night... and you gotta wait like 30 mins until u go to sleep? how can u put this on.. and wait 30 mins and go to bed? that sucks that after you wait it should be dry, and its not and then you go to bed and still gets every where wow.. how long does this stay on you once you put the lotion on? will it come off when you take a shower and get wet?  and also i dont like to wear long shirts to bed ,only short sleaves shirts..and long sweat pants and socks.. does that help? please i want more information until i put this on... im a little confused.. i dont need this to mess up on my body, because i already tryed the tanning wipes and omg they suc*k  ed    i put it on my body and i mean its a yellow tan and didnt go well on my body it messed up and it had lines all over my body and it was nasty.. i didnt like it.. because i dunno when we goin to go to beach to get real tan because of the oil spill that happen in alabama by us. so i dunno when we will go to beach.. spill is still going every where.     so please anyone give me more information please email me christinaklein25@hotmail.com</li>
            <li> I received my Fake Bake and the liquid is green. I have researched it being green on the Internet and it indicates it is expired. Unfortunately I had put it on before I researched it being green and now my pores are green.</li>
            <li> I love fake Bake! I will never buy any other sunless tanning lotion. It goes on easy, you don&#x27;t look orange, and it don&#x27;t streak. I would definitely recommend this for anyone! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> The product goes on with streaks. When you shower the next day your left with no color.All the color washes off.I Don&#x27;t understand whats all the hype about this product.</li>
            <li> My mom and I have tried so many different self-tanning products you wouldn&#x27;t even believe it, this is the only one I have purchased more than once because I absolutely love it! A little really goes a long way so you don&#x27;t need to use much and with regular use, it lasted me almost a year! The result is not orange at all, the smell isn&#x27;t even too bad and goes away with one good shower. I got more compliments from this product than from using the mystic tanning booths, or airbrush tan! I have never experienced any streaking or weird color, the only thing is you might want to purchase the Fake Bake Skin Smoothie for elbows and knees so it spreads evenly. Also, this is a very potent formula and will stain your hands unless you plan on scrubbing for an hour after use, so you will definately want to use some disposable gloves! All in all this product is great an di highly reccomend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have only used two products this and another one from a direct website. I have vitiligo  spreading on my hands and even though it doesn&#x27;t cover it up completely it does darken the white skin pigment. I just don&#x27;t care for the smell since I have to use this directly on my hands.</li>
            <li> This gets dark. 1 layer and you&#x27;ll look like Akon.</li>
            <li> Messy messy nice color and stay power. But it atains hands if you don&#x27;t wear gloves. It also rubs off on sheets and clothes. Probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I cannot express how happy I am with this enough. I have red hair and VERY pale pinkish ginger skin so when I ordered this is was afraid it would make me look orange due to my pink undertones but holy cow I was wrong. The color is perfect brown/bronze and there are no patchy spots even on my hands and feet! The application was rather tedious but after feeling stupid at the beach (I live in charleston) for years and hating to show my legs in dresses, the application time was well worth it! I would reccomed getting some of your own gloves however, because mine didn&#x27;t fit and one of them tore. Overall, this is my miracle product. The color actually looks good with my hair and I hope if any other red heads come along looking for a tanning solution, theyfind this helpful. :</li>
            <li> I use this stuff a couple times a week and it looks amazing. Unlike some of the other self-tanning products on the market, the Fake Bake line seems to look quite natural and not orange-ish at all. Lasts longer than the Fake Bake Face Spray. I can usually go 3-4 days between applications with this but only a day or two with the face spray.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of self-tanners.  This one is the best and Amazon.com has by far the best price.  I don&#x27;t care especially for the spray oil or even the moisturizer, but the body tanner is TERRIFIC.  It even looks good freshly appiled--you could wear it before a night out if you thought you wouldn&#x27;t sweat too much!  It&#x27;s alarming at first because it&#x27;s very dark (don&#x27;t worry--that&#x27;s just the color guide so you can see where it&#x27;s going--it washes off when you shower) but it dries evenly and creates a lovely dark medium tan that looks good on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Although I am a heavy allergy-sufferer, I typically do not have problems with skin products. This one, however, broke me out in hives like crazy. Really bummed because I was happy with the color I got out of it!&lt;br /&gt;So you may consider testing a skin patch before putting it all over your body, if you have an inclination to allergies.</li>
            <li> Pretty bad odor but I just use it overnight and I have a natural tan in the morning. Lasts 7-10 days.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fake Bake on my body for about 8 years and it is the best self tanner product. I was recently looking into other self tanners (for my face) and came upon multiple reviews about self tanners that were very negative, so I decided to look up the rating for fake bake and realized that this product should have 5 stars. I tan well naturally but know that it is important to avoid the sun. I get compliments ALL the time about my tan and always tell people about the product. So far out of my friends that have tried it the only ones that didn&#x27;t like it, used it wrong. They either applied it poorly, didn&#x27;t exfoliate or applied it, showered it off and never thought to re-apply. The lotion is my favorite but if I need a quick color I will use the airbrush because it goes on fairly dry and won&#x27;t get on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Worked quite well.  Will purchase when this runs out.</li>
            <li> This is great i tried other self tanners (more for price) but wasn&#x27;t worth it this goes on great colours up really nice i have very fair skin and after a couple of uses this makes me look like i just got back from the beach.</li>
            <li> This product gives your skin a nice glow that is a pretty color. Much easier to manage than the gel.</li>
            <li> very good product. i wish i had ordered more . the only problem is it definetely does get on clothing even if you wait to dress</li>
            <li> This product does a good job. Once you get to the tan level you want, just make sure you apply every 3 or 4 days. The only drawback I really have is the smell. I wish they could do something about that. My husband doesn&#x27;t like the smell at all but he likes the results!</li>
            <li> I love fake bake products however this was old and runny. The color was odd also. I thought it was a good deal but now I am pretty sure the product was old and outdated.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with self-tanners for the last 11 years.  I am naturally pale and have a hard time tanning, so I use self tanners to get my glow.  I decided to try Fake Bake because supposedly celebrities use it, however I was very disappointed.  After two messy applications, I have very little colour as opposed to other sunless tanners I have tried.  The lotion smells very good compared to others, but the fake tint is very messy and gets on everything, not to mentioon it stays put in every crease of skin and if you put it on ur face it sticks to every blemish and it gets all over your clothes.  There is no way you could put this stuff on any time besides bedtime and then go out, because it would be extremely noticable.    Over the last 11 years and trying professional and drugstore self-tanners, I have found the Biotherm SUNTAN Sunless Tanning Milk for Legs and Body works the best.  It gives the fastest, most natural colour as well as lots of moisture.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful when I read how everyone loved this stuff.  I&#x27;m very pale naturally.  While this went on &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; after it&#x27;s rubbed in, it looks great and overnight it leaves a natural looking &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Work well &amp; leaves a natural looking tan.  Be sure to follow the instructions carefully &amp; wash the applicator pad after using each time.</li>
            <li> Good color, no chemically odor, &amp; doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel greasy. I definitely recommend putting it on at night then rinsing the guide color of the next morning.</li>
            <li> My first clue was when I opened the box and found a pare of gloves. This stuff is a mess to put on. I don&#x27;t like wearing the gloves so I have to wash and wash my hands to get it off. I&#x27;m going back to my other self tanner</li>
            <li> Ok so I love this stuff. I stopped  tanning beds 3 years ago but I HAVE to have a tan in summer. This is all I use because it does what I need it to do. The tan I beautiful bronze color and I can get a tan overnight. But, I cannot give 5 stars because it smells bad, it goes away after 2-3 days and I just hate sleeping in it. But I do for the end results.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion (which is VERY dark and quite powerful) to essentially make contour lines around my nose that will last for up to 3 days -just apply slivers of it carefully where you need to darken the skin and let it sit on the skin without rubbing it in very much (just rub slightly around the edges to push the lines of the lotion to a smooth curved contour and let the lotion sit for awhile, up to a few hours before wiping it off). The effect gradually fades over a few days (fades faster if you wash your face often). You can also use it to accentuate features like pecs and abdominal muscles by applying lines of it around the outer rims of each feature -then wipe off after a few hours and you&#x27;ll notice your muscles appear to pop out more. Many male models use body makeup for the same purpose (hardly anyone has a 6-pack that looks like you see in pictures/movies without makeup or photo editing).</li>
            <li> Like the product, but the bottle was only half full.  The box was sealed..  Maybe in filling or production it was not completely filled.  I do like the product, but am concerned that if I order again, the same will happen.</li>
            <li> My wife, who is whiter than a sheet, looks tan. Thanks, Fake Bake for making my fantasies come true!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase and I really like the product.  However, be sure to use gloves...I like to mix it with suntan lotion if I&#x27;m going to be in the sun - and, if I&#x27;ve had a spray tan, Fake Bakle helps keep that tan longer as it fades away after awhile.</li>
            <li> The best self tanner I have every used. Easy to use and no streaks.  Last for about a week. Looks good when comes off.</li>
            <li> VERY sour smell.  It was like it was expired or had gone bad.  COULD not use.  I have used fake bake spray and happy...this was a COMPLETE waste of money. DO NOT RECCOMEND!</li>
            <li> As far as fake tanners go - FAKE BAKE is still way better than spray tans!  It takes a little work - commitment...but is worth it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this product for several years and loves it.  Very easy to use and looks great.</li>
            <li> If you take your time applying product works great.  Wish it lasted a little longer. Will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used loreal sunless tanner gel for years, and I thought that was the best product out there. I was wrong! Fake Bake gives me a more natural tan color and blends better around my hands and feet. I even used it on my face with no problems! My first time using it, I shaved and exfoliated, and used moisturizer on my knees, elbows, hands and feet. I blended Jergens natural glow with the Fake bake around my toes and ankles and around my wrists and hands. I did use the gloves that came with this product and my tan came out even with no streaks or lines. Very impressed!</li>
            <li> This is as good as getting a spray tan.  You just have to apply evenly and carefully and be prepared that it will get on your clothes and anything around for the first several hours. The odor bothered me at first, but I am getting used to it.  I am amazed how this works and how it stays with you for days.  Any of these self tanners dry my skin out and this one is no exception.  It is keeping me out of the sun and a true time saver.</li>
            <li> First self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. I have never purchased self tanner before because I&#x27;m afraid of streaking and the orangey look. But a coworker always has just a nice glow, nothing overpowering but just healthy looking, so I asked her and she suggested this one.  It was easy to apply and left me with a nice color, no streaking and the scent was fine as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My tans stays but however it does have a funky smell but it eventually goes away.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few tanning solutions -- including spray on -- and they ALL leave tell-tale streaks or are a weird color. Someone told me about FakeBake and I decided to give it a try. My face, arms and chest get sun easily because I kayak, but my legs are always white. I use it for legs only all year round and it never disappoints.</li>
            <li> I have tried every self-tanner that there is and this is the best!  I love the fact that it has a walnut-colored color guide.  So you know exactly if you miss a spot, plus, you have an instant and perfectly brown tan!!  No streaks!!  No orange, or funky colors!  You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The color is pretty good, but I have to really work this in carefully otherwise it comes out very streaky. I have found other products I like better, This one is ok, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> works well and great price, fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanning products over the years. Fake bake is the most natural looking tan on the market!  Another plus is Fake Bake wears like a natural tan! I use Fake Bake 12 months out of the year! Love it! Love it!! Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sunless tanning for well over 7 years.  When I don&#x27;t sunless tan, I am naturally so pale that I have a blue tint.  A CPR instructor once used me as an example of what someone would look like if they weren&#x27;t getting enough oxygen, and no, I&#x27;m not kidding you.  I&#x27;ve used everything from drugstore graduals to airbrush solutions, and I hope they never stop making this Fake Bake lotion.  There&#x27;s a sunless tanning community forum where this was mentioned as being foolproof, and I thought I&#x27;d try it as I always ended up with streaking on my legs with the airbrush solution I was using, and graduals didn&#x27;t give me enough color to be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, this Fake Bake lotion is great.  The first time I used this was on vacation which is a little scary but I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  The only places I don&#x27;t apply the Fake Bake are my hands and feet (I blend Dove med-dark Energy Glow there into my wrists and ankles) and my face (I worried that the dark color guide would get in my pores, so I use clear airbrush solution on my face).  I&#x27;ll apply 2 coats in the same night, by applying one coat all over starting at my ankles and then once I&#x27;ve finished doing my arms, I&#x27;ll go right back and apply more on my legs, working my way up again.  (Don&#x27;t worry if the color guide doesn&#x27;t blend in evenly at this point, it&#x27;ll come out even in the morning.)  This will make me as dark as I can get.  The first time I used Fake Bake my husband noticed and exclaimed, \\&quot;You are TAN!\\&quot;  He thought it looked very good and natural, and all the times I&#x27;ve used the Fake Bake since then, he still gives it a thumbs up.  I love it.  My husband doesn&#x27;t particularly care for Fake Bake&#x27;s scent, but he doesn&#x27;t mind because he knows I like to be tan, and he&#x27;s just happy I can be tan without the sun or tanning beds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some rules apply to all self-tanners, otherwise you&#x27;re setting yourself up for disappointment.  Here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You have to exfoliate before you tan.  Use exfoliation gloves you can find at any drugstore, and don&#x27;t bother with scrubs (like the paste kind that come in a tube or tub), they just don&#x27;t work as well.  Get exfoliation gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Tan in the evening, giving yourself 30 minutes to dry before heading to bed.  Tanning during the day simply does not work.  You&#x27;ll smell funny, it&#x27;ll get on your clothes, and you can&#x27;t avoid water during the day.  Let the tan develop while you sleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Make sure your sheets are dark colored, like burgundy, dark brown, or plum colored.  If you have white or cream colored sheets, forget about it, they will be brown in the morning.  I also have a thick mattress pad because sunless tanner will work its way through a fitted sheet and stain your mattress if you don&#x27;t have a pad under your sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Wear gloves!  You have to wear disposable gloves!  Using bare hands and washing them afterward has never worked for me, I&#x27;d still get crazy dark palms.  So, wear gloves until you&#x27;ve finished everywhere else, then tan your hands with a gradual tanner and blend into your wrists well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Apply lotion to your palms after you&#x27;ve finished gradual tanning your hands, and rub your palms to your elbows to get a good bit of lotion there, and this will sound weird, but carefully apply lotion with a fingertip to the knuckle on your big toes.  They grab tanner on me, so I apply lotion there too.  Then take a paper towel and rub the lotion off your palms and big toe knuckles, and wipe the lotion off your elbows (because of the color guide, it&#x27;ll look odd there, but it&#x27;ll be even in the morning).  Use the now-lotion-covered paper towel to wipe your fingernails and cuticles off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Avoid water until the morning.  Don&#x27;t brush your teeth after you&#x27;ve applied sunless tanner, you&#x27;ll end up with a lovely pale ring around your mouth because the tanner was disturbed there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!  It&#x27;s never too late to stop UV tanning and start sunless tanning.  Your skin will thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update August 2012*  2 helpful tips about self tanning in general:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Regarding any sunless tanner, whether it&#x27;s this Fake Bake or a non-tinted gradual tanner - my natural nails would get stained yellow from sunless tanners, even though I used lotion to wipe off the nails after I finished applying the tanner.  So, what works for me is making sure I have a coat or two of clear nail polish on my fingernails and toenails before I sunless tan.  The clear nail polish doesn&#x27;t get stained by the tanner, and it effectively blocks the tanner from staining my natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;2)  Self/sunless tanners like to soak into rough, thick, or dry skin and make those areas super dark.  I&#x27;ve found it really helpful to use regular daily lotion all over every day after my morning shower, and I use a softening lotion in particular on my feet, knees, hands and elbows.  The softening lotion I like is Gold Bond Ultimate Restoring Lotion with CoQ10... with this lotion, I no longer have areas that \\&quot;grab\\&quot; onto excess tanner anymore.  Woohoo!  Have you ever sunless tanned and gotten dirty-looking feet or hands?  Softening lotion will help eliminate this.  &#x3D;)ng.

            <li> I applied it 3 nights in a row to get the color I wanted.  I was discouraged the first night not seeing much of a change but decided that I like the gradual increase in tan rather than one big change that some other tanners offer.  I agree that after showering the tan fades.  The best of the color lasted about 3-4 days for me.  I used it on my face and liked the color it gave; I have large pores and it didn&#x27;t make me look speckled or anything.  If you want to look tan for a specific event, I would recommend using this 1-2 nights right before that event and don&#x27;t count on it lasting more than 4 days.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I decided to try it cuz it had great reviews and Im glad I did. It def. leaves you with a golden tan, NOT orange. And I&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of fake tanners may smell good at first, but the next day they smell awful. So you&#x27;re walking around all day being self conscious about it. Well, not with this one. Yes, there is a slight smell, but you can only notice it if you really stick your nose to your arm and smell. Haha. If you decide to use this on your face, I suggest mixing a small amount with your normal face lotion. That way you get a hint of color, rather than too much that will end up looking awful. And DEFINITELY use the gloves! This stuff will stain your hands even if you wash them right after application. Anyways, give it a try! You&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning since I was 14 (I&#x27;m 23 now).  I started getting scared of the whole skin cancer thing and started looking for different alternatives.  I wasn&#x27;t having the best of luck.  Then I found Fake Bake!  Nothing compares to this, my friends are hooked on this product as well.  I love the gradual dissipation of this tanner.  It doesn&#x27;t come off in chunks like the spray tan.  I don&#x27;t have funny chunks of tanner missing on my body and I look super dark.  I use this with the Jergens tanning lotion in medium/tan to get optimal results.  It helps this tanner stay darker longer and the new formula for Jergens absorbs into the skin better and doesn&#x27;t have that peculiar smell.</li>
            <li> Love Love love it.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite‚ù§Ô∏èüëç</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a lot of time before you apply. Be sure to exfoliate, apply lotion to dry areas, and wear gloves. Only apply a small amount at a time, so you don&#x27;t end up with streaks. If you take your time &amp; do it right, you will love the natural tan results!</li>
            <li> You can try many products out there with aroma and without, with all sorts of ingredients . But you can most likely ate not going to find a successful color. This is the only product so far that is mocha and not carrot orange color. Yes it&#x27;s takes a skill to apply . Please use gloves and than sponge the rest of your hands. It&#x27;s the best product so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fake Bake for years!! I use this lotion once a week and mid week I use the Fake Bake flawless spray and my tan looks wonderful all week.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for about 9 years. I love it. Its so easy to use. And the color is great. The color guide is a lifesaver for helping to avoid streaks. Use gloves unless you want cholocate brown colored palms. Also before application put lotion on knees/ feet/elbows to prevent too much color in those areas.</li>
            <li> I bought at a salon about a month ago and have tried to use it on four separate occasions now. No color at all. I have used Jergen&#x27;s lotions, spray airbrush tans (at salons), Mystic tans, etc. and all have given better results than this. I did like the buffer, which is why I gave it one star. However, you don&#x27;t even get the instructions until AFTER you open the package, which recommends at least four other products that you should purchase for a better result. I was home applying the product at that point!</li>
            <li> I use this one as soon as i get out of shower with a little jergens lotion. this is the color that makes you look true brown and not organge. jergens more orange.  I will stick with fake bake from now on</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time maintaining a tan, so I decided to try and use this. It applied evenly and easily and I could see visible results after the first use. I applied it three or four times in the days leading up to my birthday, but the only people who noticed were my two ex-boyfriends. Within a week after I stopped using it, my skin was back to its original pale color.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best sunless tanning product I have used so far. Results are instant and looks very natural. No orange tint at all, just a natural looking tan like you have been laying in the tanning bed for weeks. I only gave four stars because the tan than you get after immediately applying fades rather quickly. I mainly use it after showering and results are best after shaving. Results are even better when you have somewhat of a tan already, but still works well on pale skin. Melanoma is prevalent in my family, so this is the best alternative to sunbathing and tanning beds for me.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s the consistency of water.... runs all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it turned green, and I mean GREEN in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Trashed it.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! I&#x27;ve tried many different self tanning lotions and sprays and this is my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t streak and is very easy to apply. I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews saying it washed off. It DOES NOT wash off. What you see is the color guide washing off. It leaves behind a nice, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake Original! I have used it many times and it has never failed to give me the dark bronze color I want! It is very fast working which I love. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, which other self tanners that I have used do. It has a color guard, so you can see where the product is going and DOESN&#x27;T streak which happens a lot with other self tanners. It is priced just right, you can&#x27;t find any other self tanner that works priced this cheap, which I love! I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of self-tanners and gradual tan lotions.  A friend of mine recommended Fake Bake to me and after the first use, I am a dedicated user! The great thing about this product is that it has a color to it (brown to be exact) so that you can actually see where you have or haven&#x27;t applied the lotion! Which makes sense instead of a white lotion going on to already white skin.  I always use gloves when I apply the product and always wear pants/long sleeves to bed as it will rub off some. However, I&#x27;ve never had it stain clothes or sheets. The color the next day is flawless and usually last a few days before I need to reapply. Definitely a &#x27;must try&#x27; for the self-tanner enthusiast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and had great results. I&#x27;m not sure if something has changed or if I received old product. It is very runny and has a different color than before, it doesn&#x27;t even leave the nice tan look that it has in the past. Not sure I&#x27;ll be using this one again.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the results, there was no orange tint after. Definately would reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> Great looking tan - the only drawback is that it does go on dark, so be careful that you don&#x27;t touch something until it sinks into your skin. Very realistic looking tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I always try to find something a little cheaper BUT always come back to this. It&#x27;s so natural looking. Not orange and no terrible smell.</li>
            <li> I am an avid sunless tanner user since I am a pasty pale, can not tan naturally person.  I used this product with latex gloves and was pleased with the color.  It is a darker brown color so it does not look orange on my skin.  My only reason for not purchasing this again is that I tended to get acne when I used this.  Not only on my face but my shoulders and back as well.  I am acne prone per say, and this product caused flare ups for me.</li>
            <li> This product works and creates a nice tan, however I prefer to use the Fake Bake spray instead, as this product can be hard to blend.</li>
            <li> Does not turn orange - finally found a product that works</li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake but was very disappointed when I received this. It was not the normal thick, rich consistency, and dark color I am used to. It was like green water. The only time I have ever seen Fake Bake do this is when I checked an old bottle that I had left over from last summer to see if it should be pitched....</li>
            <li> smells bad/doesn&#x27;t last 1 day</li>
            <li> very good color. smell not so great but if you have time to reshower the next morning good to go:)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 years. It does not turn you orange. I have used other products but this is by for the best.</li>
            <li> I can put this on and have a great tan instantly. Just remember to buff lightly so not to steak.</li>
            <li> Works great, just like it promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about self tanning products because even when others rave that they are streak free and easy to apply, I always end up with orange lines up my legs and arms. But, after reading some of the reviews and all the helpful hints on how to apply fake bake, I must say that I am more than pleased with the purchase and will continue to buy fake bake for as long as they sell it! I&#x27;m italian so I have an olive skin tone and though I tan easily, I don&#x27;t want to end up being wrinkled and leathery when I&#x27;m older so I&#x27;ve been looking for alternatives so I can be tan but still protect my skin when I go outdoors. Fake bake is the perfect way to do that! It didn&#x27;t make me orange and it looked completely natural. Even my mom, who hates fake tans and thinks everything looks orange, was impressed and is even thinking about using it once herself.     However, make sure you apply babyoil or some type of oil to the dry areas (knees, under arms, heel, elbows) before applying so that it keeps them from getting too dark. Use gloves and use a cotton swab with lotion to blend the areas where you tanned and didn&#x27;t tan, such as at the bottom of your feet or the area where the palm and the top of your hand meet and in between your fingers and toes. The first time I applied it, it took a while because I didn&#x27;t want it to streak or miss any spots but the second time was much faster! I even applied it to my back the first time by myself and there was no streaking, though I would recommend having someone do it for you.     Although fake bake sells a lotion for your face, I used just a dab of the body lotion on my face and it gave me a gorgeous natural glow.     If applied right, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Pretty real looking but still tough to use on feet &amp; hands. It takes some effort to make it look natural. Must shower everyday or the build up will look like dirt. applying skin lotion to even out the &#x27;problem&#x27; areas like knuckles,elbows ankles ,knees. Cant reach the back without a &#x27;wand&#x27; so invest in one unless you got someone to help you. a good product that doesn&#x27;t cost $30 a bottle. Just dont use too much. one or two applications will change your natural skin tone. Anymore &amp; you risk looking &#x27;faked &amp; baked&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This product was described as not having the bad smell of other self-tanners, but unfortunately it still has that smell. I have never had the orange look from self-tanners, and this is definitely orange. I am embarrassed to go out in public today because of the obvious orange and the left over scent from using it last night, even after a thorough shower. Luckily it&#x27;s winter so I will wear a hat and gloves. I did the patch test and waited over 24 hours to make sure there were no bad skin reactions, but after using it on my entire body it gave me a rash on my forearms. If you do chose to purchase this product, which I don&#x27;t recommend, but if you must, they have separate products for hands and face that I may work better (I don&#x27;t have firsthand experience, but it&#x27;s a possibility). With other self-tanners I have used in the past this was never necessary. I could use the one product on all parts of my body. With Fake Bake the color visibly fills your pores on your face (which they warn you about on the pamphlet, but I tend to think they use that as a scare tactic to buy all their other products), and just looks bad on your hands (even with meticulous application). My reason for purchasing Fake Bake was because of the positive reviews, and because it doesn&#x27;t have parabens (it still has propylene glycol though), but after using this it I can confidently declare that it is the worst I have ever used. I&#x27;ve said my bit, so unless you&#x27;re playing a carrot in a school play, I&#x27;d stay away.</li>
            <li> I usually get 6 of these, they keep me tan all year. I keep in the refrigerator, they seem to last longer.</li>
            <li> Best results if you put it on at night after showering.  Goes on easy with gloves (I purchased more because I use it often). Very low odor and looks natural. Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pale and have used this product for years.  Yes, it is very messy to apply (gloves provided), but I believe it gives a very realistic looking tan without the yellow/orange look (maybe because it includes some green pigment).  Once opened, it will spoil after awhile.  I believe they recommend refrigeration for longer storage.  If  you do let it get too old, you start looking like the Wicked Witch of the West, but I normally use mine up before that happens.</li>
            <li> After always being leery of &amp;#34;turning orange&amp;#34;, a friend recommended this product.  When used lightly every couple of days, I have a nice healthy tan WITHOUT the sun.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT addition to my summer wardrobe.</li>
            <li> I have used another brand of self tanner for 3 years now and just recently changed. This is a great self tanner. No streaks! Make sure to use gloves and its best to use at night before bed. This gives the lotion time to set in. Will definetely be referring friends!!!!</li>
            <li> The product gives you a instant bronze color making it easy to apply but make sure you wear gloves. The only down to it is that the instant bronze gets all over your clothing. It has a mild smell nothing bad,</li>
            <li> Like it.. but can use a store bought product and get better results</li>
            <li> Turned green in bottle, tried it on one leg anyway and it turned green, washed it off and threw it away.</li>
            <li> This product deserves all the glowing reviews on this site. I have used it&#x27;s second edition which comes with gloves and a mitten, but it does not have the depth of the original. As always, the original is the thing and there was no need to mess with perfection. Instead what the makers of this product should have done is to add the mitten to the original and maybe design a spray bottle. I see only these two missing from otherwise perfect product. I am glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li> This particular lotion becomes runnny and turns greenish in color when it becomes very old. The product I received was runny, greenish in color and not even able to be used.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Fake Bake I previously used..  Apparently the formula changed or this was old product.  It didn&#x27;t smell right.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy from this particular seller again - will most likely purchase at a store where I know it&#x27;s fresh, new product.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!  I have fair skin and it is the best product that I have been able to find so far that leaves a natural looking tan! And it&#x27;s very easy to use!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.im very pale but tan really easily not recently had skin cancer removed from my face so I went on the hunt or a self tanner that really works. I&#x27;ve tried what seems like every brand from cheap to expensive to professional spray tan and none I was satisfied. A friend told me about fake bake and I just had to try it. I also bought the body polish and the after smoothie which I&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t have to have but I&#x27;m a sucker. Put it on and it goes on really easily and smooth. I work really fast so it doesn&#x27;t dry and the color indicator helps a lot. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting it on during the day and then doing house work or going out but I put it on at night then went to bed and showered in the morning. It smells until you rinse it off. I prefer the after shower smoothie BC I always worry about using the wrong lotion that may fade it quicker. I love that it looks real. My husband even asked me has I gotten in the bronzing tanning bed. I love it and no longer have to worry about being a pale face and the fear of being in the sun anymore. I totally put another bottle in my cart so I can order it as soon as I run out!</li>
            <li> I hate sunless tanners, not to say I haven&#x27;t tried every single one...because I probably did. This is actually fun and I cant screw this up lol. It almost doesn&#x27;t allow you to. Real color, no streaks, even through and through, and fast! Sticking with this!</li>
            <li> Perfect color! I have tried other products over the years and always come back to this.</li>
            <li> I have looked everywhere for this product.  I used it year round for years and when I moved overseas I couldn&#x27;t find it.  This is the best product for my pale, hard to tan skin.  It goes on evenly and produces a natural looking tan.  There is no mess with the gloves and very little odor. I put it on before bed and wake up in the morning with a tan!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite self tanner I have purchased. The color seems to wash off as soon as you shower and it smells bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly every self-tanner and Fake Bake is superior!  When people comment on my beautiful tan, they can&#x27;t believe it when I tell them it is &amp;#34;tan in a can.&amp;#34;  Buy it for my granddaughter as well.  What a great way to look tanned while avoiding the dangers of excessive sun-exposure.</li>
            <li> This product by them is not near as good as the fake bake flawless liquid pump spray,  now matter how much i exfoliated before using this, it would chunk around my ankles and knees.  then when i would apply the next time, it was flake off and chunk up some more, no where else on my body though.  it also smells like crayons which is not horrible, but it does give you a very realistic tan.  make sure to wear gloves because it is almost impossible to scrub off!  i would not recommend this product from the brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using the flawless spray from FAke BAke and decided to give the lotion and also the gel (darkest tan ) a try. The spray and this lotion are pretty much the same, flawless application, nice smell, wonderful natural tan that you can control depending on how many application you use. The color guard is wonderful, definitely recommend both tanners for beginners as well.&lt;br /&gt;Keep moisturizing the days after and if you are looking for a nice tanner for your face and feet, have to say did not try the FAke BAke version, but Morrocon makes a self tanner with an amazing natural color(will leave a review for it as well, sorry do not remember the exact name right now and can not toggle back and forth )that works great for fake and ankles and oh yeah your hands. As with both fake bake versions no matter how much I try it it goes on a bit to dark or if I mix with moisturizer to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck , happy safe self tanning</li>
            <li> You definitely need to wear the gloves they give you with this product, it stains your fingers and is very hard to get out.  This stuff is black and makes your skin black when you first apply it, your pillows and sheets will be stained black if you apply it before bed - VERY MESSY - you can&#x27;t wear clothes with it on and it takes hours to soak in.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to work without the orange color from other sunless tanners</li>
            <li> I love this product. I get compliments on my tan all of the time. Put the product on the night before. Don&#x27;t panic it will look dark at first. The next day when you shower it will wash off to a perfect even tan. I use nair hair removal lotion the get it off of my hands. The nair was an accidental find that works great. This lotion does not turn orange at all. The tan looks even better when you have a slight base tan already. However I use it even in the winter when I am very pale.</li>
            <li> Works great, good color</li>
            <li> I like fake bake but its not worth the price. Ive tried tons of self tan products and this one gets messy, sometimes turns you like green and it smells bad. When it goes on evenly it gives a nice dark color but once you shower it fades ALOT.  There are better cheaper products out there.</li>
            <li> I am Irish with fair complected skin and I burn when I am in the sun or tanning beds, I try to avoid this like the plague and I know that it is much safer to fake and bake with lotion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a few different self tanners (the cheap ones and the more high end) and I was really excited to get this because I had heard such great things about it and the price was right. However, when I got it and applied it, I was really disappointed. I did the the proper prep work IE moisturize, moisturize, moisturize a few days prior... Shower, exfoliate, shave, completely dry off, put my hair up and apply with the gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOLY HECK this stuff was messy and dark, it actually scared me where I had to call my husband in to help me apply it as quick as possible. His exact words were &amp;#34;honey this stuff is a nightmare, I sure hope you don&#x27;t wake up disappointed and looking like a train wreck&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dry time took Forrreverrrr and when I was finally able to go to bed, I slept a full 8 hours and woke up ready for a shower. When I took my clothes off, my clothes were stained and the color completely came off in the shower. - What a waste of time and money... No one has time for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I wanted to venture out since I have been using Banana Boat Summer Color Self-Tanning Lotion, Deep Dark Color, For All Skin Tones for the past year and that is the only stuff that works for me on my very light fair completed sensitive skin... it gives me a tan where I look like I am Brazilian vs. Irish and I receive many compliments. -- I guess shame on me for trying to fix what was not broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest trying anything for oneself before dismissing it but make sure you have no plans for a while (perhaps  a couple of days and definitely apply at night before bed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of Luck,&lt;br /&gt;~ SkyLee :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and I love it, but for some reason the lotion I received when applied looks Grayish/green! I&#x27;m guessing it was a old bottle, I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I found Fake-Bake on Amazon a few years ago when I swore-off tanning salons after my Dad developed skin cancer. I had tried everything from drugstore brands to $50/tube stuff from Sephora...and didn&#x27;t love any of them. Fake Bake is by far the fastest, most natural looking product out there. I&#x27;ve used the lotion, and the spray...the lotion is easier for me, but the spray gives a more intense color. It&#x27;s just...messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers go into this in greater detail, so I won&#x27;t get too crazy with advice...but I can&#x27;t stress enough how important it is to prep yourself for these products, and give them time to develop. When I say &amp;#34;prep&amp;#34; I mean exfoliate! Get a good scrub (I use a homemade sugar+olive oil scrub), and exfoliate every inch of skin you plan on applying this to. Don&#x27;t be afraid to scrub rigorously. Right after the shower, when your skin is towel-dried, get your rubber gloves on (don&#x27;t let this stuff touch anything you don&#x27;t want to turn brown) and rub an even coat into your skin just like regular lotion. If you&#x27;re doing the spray...use the applicator that comes with it. After that...plan on doing nothing for at least 4-6 hours. If you can, stay as close to naked as possible for the first hour or so to make sure you&#x27;re 100% dry. Then put on some loose clothing and hit the sack...overnight is best. This gives the color time to develop, and you won&#x27;t have any uneven spots from clothing or sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it work if you don&#x27;t do all that? Sure...but you want it to look good, and it can go really wrong if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Been wearing it for years and buy it faithfully!  Nice golden tan that doesn&#x27;t streak or smell!!  And cheap;)!</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the spray. It took several applications to get only a couple shades darker.</li>
            <li> I ordered this early last year (2013) and didn&#x27;t use it all because I&#x27;m fairly fair skinned and it didn&#x27;t take a lot.  This year (May) when I drug it out, it was a weird slimy green color, stained every thing it touched, weird green.  I guess I would recommend it if you plan on using it all immediately but don&#x27;t save it until the next year...it DEFINITELY has a shelf life.</li>
            <li> As good as a spray tan. It is easy to use and looks good too.</li>
            <li> Blends in easily. Gives a nice brown color. Barely to no smell. I will def be purchasing more. I&#x27;ve tried st tropes and its almost just as nice but costs less .</li>
            <li> Works great for the first few months, but then the contents in the bottle start turning green and you have to throw it away</li>
            <li> I used Fake Bake last year and was very satisfied because it is the only self-tanning lotion that does not turn me orange.  My daughter had recommended it to me.  We both use it.</li>
            <li> thank you fake bake for developing a great sunless tanning products and also for the way you dont stink while trying to achieve a golden tan!  dont ever change your formula!</li>
            <li> Never before has there been a sunless product that I have loved so much! Trust me, I have tried and tested them all, Fake and Bake is exceptional, and the ONLY one I will use.... BUT!! Make sure - MAKE CERTAIN - That you wear the gloves included, there is a reason why they are in there!! Enjoy! :)</li>
            <li> First found at the Southern&#x27;s Women Show in Richmond, VA in 2004...and been using ever since.  Does not turn orange like other self-tanners.  Let&#x27;s you tan &amp;#34;naturally&amp;#34;.  I use especially on my legs.  Gotten lots of compliments.  Been very happy with the product</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough about this lotion.  It&#x27;s never given me anything but flawless, natural color.  Very easy to use, not messy AT ALL.  Use the gloves.  I&#x27;ve had several natural tans in the past, but do not want any more sun damage.  I know what color my natural skin is when it&#x27;s tan, and this is dead on.  0 streaks.  I can reach my entire back, but am unable to rub it in super well in the middle- it makes no difference though, never streaks.  I do not spread this onto my fingers, as my fingers never tanned naturally anyway.  I just brush it down onto the tops of my hands and feet, and it blends beautifully.  Never get the &#x27;fake tan&#x27; look on elbows, knees, wrists, or ankles.  I do always rub some lotion on these spots before using this product- I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s necessary, but I&#x27;ve never had a single splotch in those areas.  Keep in mind when using this, that the initial color you get is just the color guide.  Some people remark that all your color washes off as soon as you shower, and I can see why they think that, but it is JUST the color guide.  When you put it on, you will be TAN immediately- this is not the color you will end up with!  However, this product WILL darken you many MANY shades.  It does seem like you are losing all the color, in contrast to how dark you look off the bat.  But you WILL be darker, and you can build your tan over a few days.  I also never wait the amount of time you&#x27;re supposed to.  I&#x27;ve waited between 2-3 hours each time I use this, and that is enough time for me to gain several shades.  2 applications, roughly 2.5 hours each, took me from snow bunny white, to a warm light bronze.  The smell is not nearly as strong as other self tanners I&#x27;ve used, and it almost completely goes away once you wash off the guide color.  Exfoliate well before using this, and stay moisturized while you use it.  I never sleep in this stuff, as it does seem like it would get on sheets, and it feels a little sticky after a couple hours.  This is why I never leave it on for more than 3 hours, but that seems to be enough time.  My color does continue to develop after I wash it off, and NOTHING gets on my crisp white towels, either.  Just wash off the guide thoroughly.  I will say that if you are looking for very drastic results, this may not be for you.  The results are amazing, but you won&#x27;t go from pasty to brown.  If you are pale, and want a nice bronze glow without shocking results- this is awesome.  However if you want a full blown tan in a bottle, this may be too conservative.  Anyway, great product.  Will continue to keep this in stock.</li>
            <li> I am overall pleased with this stuff however I do wish the color was a little darker. I put it on before bed and wake up looking like a bronze goddess... after jumping in the shower most all of the color washes off. I have put several coats on hoping it would get a little darker and it never did. However this may just be due to my skin tone. I have olive skin. I did notice that after getting a little natural sun and then putting this stuff on I got an awesome color that last for several days. But without the added color from the Sun.. I was a little underwhelmed. I will probably try a different brand so that I can have something to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I have used fake bake for years and I love it. Only fake tanner I have found that looks natural.</li>
            <li> I order this product through Amazon routinely (and like it) but I didn&#x27;t open one order for over 6 months and when I did, it was dark green and liquidy. Amazon would not let me return it. I advise you to not purchase this product unless you plan to use it immediately. It is also possible that it was exposed to extreme heat or cold prior to delivery; in which case, I paid full price for a faulty product.</li>
            <li> Love Fake Bake I have used it for years, it is the only self tanning lotion I have found that doesn&#x27;t turn your skin orange.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product. Best&lt;br /&gt; tanning product ever used.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the store I ordered from. Love the product but the last place I ordered from the product was old and had a green tint when applied. I&#x27;ve used Fake Bake for years and always get compliments on my tan, people not knowing it&#x27;s fake!  You have to make sure you keep it in the refrigerator till ready to use if you order more than one bottle at a time or over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> This appears to be, by far, the best self tanner I&#x27;ve tried!  I used to get airbrushed, but it was getting to be too costly.  This makes me look the same when I use it 2 nights in a row!  Natural coloring, a nice deep tan.  One thing:  WEAR GLOVES!  It goes on really smooth and won&#x27;t leave color on your palms.  When I didn&#x27;t use gloves, my palms were deep brown for days.  Enjoy, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> The best self tanner. I used this in the past and has mad my body dark brown. Layer it and the color deepens. I use my regular lotion like cocoa butter lotion over it so it can cover the scent. And the scent washes off after you take a shower after leaving it on for awhile. So this is the best tanner and gives a bronze color while tanning. Best time to do it is before bed though. Good Luck! If you have any questions just ask!</li>
            <li> Strong smell but good color in one application. I would buy this again and may try the face next time.</li>
            <li> I have been using tanning creams for 20 years. I have honestly tried everything! This is the most natural looking tan I can get without the sun. People comment all the time. I have so many tricks I use when applying. I do not apply before I go to bed. It stays too wet on my skin. I apply in the morning and use my blow dryer on cool to dry the cream on my skin. Use gloves that fit your hands. Sally&#x27;s Beauty sells gloves in sizes S M L. I mix the tanning cream with my facial mosterizer when I apply to my face. It can get too dark otherwise. I also use a bonzer from Mearle Norman. Sometimes I apply the bronzer over the Fake Bake. That is the tan you want at the beach! After you use this cream a couple of times, you will find your own tricks to make applying easier for you. You can not beat the price! I have paid 30 to 50 dollars on tanning products for years now, and this product honestly is the best. I also want to thank every person who wrote a review for this product. Your reviews made purchasing and using this product so easy and helpful!</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner. It looks great, is easy to apply and leaves your skin feeling great! Buy!</li>
            <li> I have used a couple different self tanners (the cheapo ones and the more high end) and I was really excited to get this because I had heard such great things about it. However, when I got it and applied it, I was really disappointed. I do the proper prep routine before application (exfoliation, shave, moisturize) and yet this just didn&#x27;t work for me. It was rich and dark brown in color which was nice because it didn&#x27;t have the typical orange hue of self tanners, but I found it difficult to fully rub in and especially evenly. Also, the gloves were not helpful. I took the time to do it right and then the dry time took FOREVER. Like I couldn&#x27;t sit or put any clothes on for a while because I wanted it to dry (hate that sticky feeling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, after all of it, most of the color DID wash off, not just the color guide itself. And it did so in patches. I suggest trying anything for oneself before dismissing it but make sure you have no plans for a while (perhaps apply at night a couple hours before bed).</li>
            <li> My daughter suggested this tanner and she was spot on. Great product doesn&#x27;t look fake. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used many self tanners and this one is strange.&lt;br /&gt;Dark green color and strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;I could not use it.</li>
            <li> It works to give a natural glow.  I am not into the \\&quot;fried\\&quot; look so I have never tried layering it on so many times to achieve this effect.  But, I do not tan via the sun but this definitely gives my paler skin a sun-kissed glow and is believable.  I apply ever 3 days or so (and I shave every day).  Also, some reviewers complained that it rinses right off down the drain, but that is just the color guide.  My skin definitely shows the effects after rinsing off the color guide.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love love love his stuff!! I have purchased two so far and it works great!! Worth the money! Results are almost instant!</li>
            <li> I swear by Fake Bake. I&#x27;ve tried the spray and hands down prefer the lotion - its easier to apply and makes no mess (the spray is messy). I&#x27;ve tried other, more expensive lotions/sprays and always come back to Fake Bake. My only complaint is that the gloves only last for a few applications before tearing - not good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain that they aren&#x27;t happy with the results. What works best for me is two applications a week to keep my color up. If you don&#x27;t look like the tan-mom after applying it, you&#x27;ve not used enough! Remember, the color you&#x27;ll end up with is much lighter. I pre-moisturize the areas I&#x27;ll apply the fake bake and apply a thick layer of regular lotion to elbows, knees and wrists before application. Look in the mirror during application so you can see where you&#x27;re putting it!  I wear a long sleeve black shirt/pants to bed and put a towel over the pillow - thorough wash in the morning. Its a pain for some to apply twice a week, but this product last as long as any other (including pro-spray tans) and I have my application routine down to 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always told my color looks natural. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff but cant justify the price when I only used a couple times and it turned green. I called the makers of fake bake and told them what happened they didn&#x27;t seem to care. Customer Service is lacking. Will not buy again. Swedish Beauty Botanicals has a great self tanner for the face and body, is cheap and smells great. It is also sold on Amazon for less 1/2 the price they sell at the tanning salons. I bought a tube that was 50.00 for 20.00  on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My favourite tan goes on well no streaking buy it every summer instant dark tan for any color of skin</li>
            <li> Best self-tanner ever!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. But it doesnt stay on after first shower. This stuff is great when you need a tan for a day.</li>
            <li> There was great reviews on this product so i decided to try it and they were right I love it it leaves u a great tan and it&#x27;s so easy to apply</li>
            <li> If you want to look tan for \\&quot;A NIGHT\\&quot; then get this... Im a fair skinned person and I bought this because you actually look tan &amp; real. No orangy look. It doesnt last past your first shower after putting it on so If you want to go out and look tan for the day or night i would suggest this.&lt;br /&gt;remember, it just doesnt last long at all.</li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake Flawless. Like so much that i have recommended it to every person I know. I have bought several other products on a whim thinking they may work similarly or better. But they haven&#x27;t. So I went to order more flawless and it wouldn&#x27;t arrive in time with my prime shipping however this Fake Bake lotion would so i took a gamble (reviews seemed okay). When i put the tinted lotion on my skin i was like &#x27;ahhhh hello long lost tan friend&#x27;. I was surprised that there was no fragrance to the lotion even when I first applied it. When I woke up, I couldn&#x27;t&#x27; smell the stale tan in a can smell which was surprising but neat! Since I didn&#x27;t have to work that day...I kept it on for several more hours while I did chores, mid-day napped, lounged, etc. Well when I finally took a shower (I kept the lotion on for about 18 hours) all of the tint washed down the drain. When i got out, i was pale again like I hadn&#x27;t put forth the effort to put on self tanner (we all know that to do it properly it&#x27;s at least a 20-30 minute process. I feel this was a waste of time and money. Sorry Fake Bake...you really let me down.</li>
            <li> I prefer a naural tan, but this is second best.  So much better than baking in ther sun and ruining your skin.</li>
            <li> Hard to squeeze out of the bottle but I love the way it looks on my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened  but the product arrived and it was green so my legs were green and it was like water to apply. It went all over my bathroom tiles and grout. I don&#x27;t know if this was some sort of knock off, but it was bad and Fake Bake is not cheap. Will not order from here again. I sent an email the minute I discovered the problem and there was no response. I live in Mexico so returning is a total pain, but now I know for the future.</li>
            <li> The best.  Way better and cheaper then spray tans</li>
            <li> I like Fake Bake. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years. It has a real tan color and you can just add more if you want it darker. The only problem is it does wash off, but it is so much better than a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; tan.</li>
            <li> I do extensive research before ordering anything online, and I was pretty confident in my decision to buy Fake Bake... However, it simply did not work at all. I applied it directly as told, went to bed, woke up and washed it off in the shower, and it was completely gone. By &#x27;completely gone&#x27; I don&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m one of those people who thought the color guide was what it would actually look like, I mean there was literally no tan on me whatsoever. As far as I can tell, I&#x27;m literally the EXACT and PRECISE same skin tone I was before using this product. All that time applying it and no result whatsoever. Now, if you&#x27;re considering Fake Bake yourself, by all means, go for it. I&#x27;m all for going after something if you truly want it, because it really is better to do something and have it fail than to not bother trying at all. Just know that in doing this, you&#x27;re taking the risk of it not working out and being very disappointed and having wasted money. Clearly it&#x27;s worked for a number of people, but it&#x27;s also not worked for more than just a few. I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try, because like I said, I don&#x27;t want to live a life full of &#x27;what-ifs?&#x27; Guess I&#x27;ll just have to stick to tanning naturally. I definitely will never be using a tanning bed, and certainly won&#x27;t be going the self-tan route again after this travesty.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter and she says it really looks like a natural tan for her. She is very fair skinned.</li>
            <li> Not everyone will experience this maybe 1% but i got a huge burning rash on my legs and arms. But you would have a better chance of getting hit by a train to have it happen to you, i have read so many good testimonials about this product&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t go by my misfortune and shop at Altima&#x27;s the best store at Amazon:)</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff for my wife all the time and she keeps wanting more so, it must be pretty good stuff.&lt;br /&gt; It always arrives when it&#x27;s supposed to and in new condition. It does smell like a chemical factory though.Other than that&lt;br /&gt;  if gals want to sport the beach bound motif this Fake Bake  will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Great tanner! Was a little uneasy when I used it the first time because it is really dark but applied it let dry and went to bed. The next morning got up and showered and had a awesome tan. Love it! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning product.  It gives a nice real looking tan with just a couple applications.  It&#x27;s also very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Second year using it. I get compliments all the time about my tan.&lt;br /&gt;I just use Fake Bake &amp; follow up with some Satin Glow product.</li>
            <li> I have used some fancy and expensive lotions in the past but they fade fairly quickly and I couldn&#x27;t justify spending that amount of money. I read the reviews for this and decided to give it a shot- for the price, it is pretty dang good. I has an interesting coloring, it&#x27;s more bronze than anything else but it layers on itself so you decide just how dark/ bronze you want to be. It&#x27;s also nice because you can rub it off before it sets in completely so it makes it easier to keep things even of back up if you happen to mess up. Granted, this also means it can rub off within the first couple hours, I find the ability to adjust the tone after the fact to be a plus rather than a negative.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It stinks like all fake tanning lotion but it leaves no streaks behind and a beautiful color. U love it!</li>
            <li> I have used several different sunless tanning lotions before.&lt;br /&gt;My absolute favorite has been the sun labs.&lt;br /&gt;BUT I decided to try the fake bake. I had heard from someone personally that it was really good.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a while now, meaning about a month or two lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I am white. Very white. So most tanning lotions I use turn me an odd color. Fake Bake turned me into a very pretty color. I apply this at night, because the color of this at first turns me into a very dark person. I almost look dirty.&lt;br /&gt; I use the gloves it comes with. They are huge on my hands but it&#x27;s ok. I make it work. You work with it at a pretty fast pace. It dries pretty quickly. I put my clothes on after I&#x27;m done, but I will wear loose fitting clothes.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t too bad. I haven&#x27;t really used any lotions that don&#x27;t have a slight odor. This one isn&#x27;t awful though.&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I take a shower and the tan is gorgeous. It&#x27;s not too dark or light. It&#x27;s perfect for my skin tone. I will then apply it one more night just to get a little extra color. After I shower I&#x27;m still a really pretty tan.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this is the fact that it does last a while. I haven&#x27;t used one that last as long as this one.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give it tree stars is bc it doesn&#x27;t really come off evenly.  It kind of looks splotchy. Not too bad though. It is a fast drying thing so you have to work quick, and at first I wasn&#x27;t used to that. It doesn&#x27;t really bother me now. The smell, but it&#x27;s to be expected and I&#x27;ve smelt worse.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do really like the product. The downfalls aren&#x27;t going to turn me against it.&lt;br /&gt;I will more than likely buy more after I run out.</li>
            <li> This product works really good way better than any lotion bronzer I have boughten from any store but the only thing it i feel like it doesn&#x27;t last very long it says it will last 5-7 days and for me it was only about 2-3 days but overall it works great and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks</li>
            <li> I have skin that tans well.. this works great. be sure to wear gloves, it will stain your hands. I have many friends that are making purchases of this self tanner because it looks so great!</li>
            <li> Its ok.  turns green on your skin and has a smell.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion on the market! I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there and Fake Bake gives the best, most real looking, deep dark tan out there! Will always use as I don&#x27;t let my fair skin get too much sun anymore :-)</li>
            <li> Best self Tanner on the market. I&#x27;m a redhead and have never ever been able to tan. This gives me to most beautiful color without being orange. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 20 years and absolutely love it!!! It doesn&#x27;t make you look orange, but very natural!</li>
            <li> Based on other reviewers I didn&#x27;t really want to put this on before going to bed, so applied it in the morning after a shower and let it dry very thoroughly before getting completely dressed. My legs were fine -- nice dark color from just one application -- but the color came off my feet when I wore flip-flops HOURS later. I&#x27;ll keep working with this product, though, as I think it is better than most of the other self-tanners out there.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in a local beauty store, but it was expensive. I looked online and found the exact same product for half price. Fake Bake is the best self tanning lotion I have ever tried. I have light skin and my skin is hard to tan. When you first apply the lotion, it is very dark. The blending will take place after showering.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Fake Bake spray, but the post-spray bathroom cleanup was hardly worth it. I thought I&#x27;d try the lotion instead. I was glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a VERY small amount (I learned this the hard way). It&#x27;s dark dark dark chocolate brown right out of the tube.  This is nice because you not only see where it goes, but you get instant brown color. Not remotely orange at all.  It spread easily but I did use the gloves, because when you really see where it is, you end up rubbing it in more, and therefore getting a much more natural looking tan.  It dries fast.  It didn&#x27;t have any unpleasant fake tan odor at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these products on my very Irish skin since back in the days of QT. I&#x27;ve tried tens of different products, maybe a hundred. This one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> The product dried quickly and the tan the next morning was a great loo; but unfortunately the tan rubbed off easily where ever clothing touched it and faded quickly.</li>
