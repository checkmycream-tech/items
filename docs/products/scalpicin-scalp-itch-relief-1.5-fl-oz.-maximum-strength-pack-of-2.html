            <li>i only use it about once a month!!..fast shipping...very satisfied!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard people recommend balms (same formula with chap-stick style applicator) for the scalp, and if it doesn&#x27;t bug you too much gel/cream might be just as good.</li>
            <li>I tried some &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products first, to no avail.</li>
            <li>also don&#x27;t really like the bottle itself.</li>

            <li>to deal with the problem for good after a few months of experimenting with various shampoos and other treatments.</li>
            <li>From the second day of any new style my scalp will itch de living daylights outta me!</li>
            <li>only problem is that it&#x27;s still a bit pricey, and depending on how you apply it this bottle might not last very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With regular application of Scalpicin, the sores on my head have shown considerable improvement</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying wide varitey of self grooming items</li>
            <li>Other times TOO MUCH of the stuff will spill out, and once its out</li>
            <li>what that means I have no idea, but as far as I can tell the only difference is that these products tend to be much more expensive.</li>

            <li> I have since purchased another bottle of this potion and my hairstyle is on week two and the itching is not a major issue anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a long nozzle to make reaching your scalp easier, but I still feel like a lot of it is getting in my hair instead of onto the scalp itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product regularly and I&#x27;m not really seeing a drastic change in relieving my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to relieve my dry and flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> I typically treat it with anti-dandruff shampoo bought over-the-counter, and while that relieves it for the night the itching is almost always back within a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is actually BURNS for a few seconds after application...</li>
            <li> Thank God my sister brought down a bottle of this miracle lotion</li>
            <li> I have severely itchy scalp but no dandruff due to thyroid issues, and this stuff calms my itchiness everytime!</li>
            <li> These products are usually touted as \\&quot;all natural\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> But in the mean time Scalpicin stopped me from scratching my skin off!</li>
            <li> It might not be as bad as clinically diagnosed eczema, but the itching is occasionally bad enough to keep me awake.</li>
            <li> I have bad dandruff and it itches a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed when applied on a bad, itchy, flakey day</li>
            <li> I have periods when I get sores on my scalp that are very painful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> With regular application of Scalpicin, the sores on my head have shown considerable improvement</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day, sometimes twice a day.  It fixes all of my scalp problems without causing any kind of oiliness.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to relieve my dry and flaky scalp. It does wonders with the itchy feeling that I so often feel. It eliminates me from having to scratch  and I love that!!</li>
            <li> Before I say anything, my experience with this and the cheaper non-extra strength liquid is almost the exact same. I&#x27;d go for the cheaper one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start with, this product DOES work. I have bad dandruff and it itches a lot. It might not be as bad as clinically diagnosed eczema, but the itching is occasionally bad enough to keep me awake. I typically treat it with anti-dandruff shampoo bought over-the-counter, and while that relieves it for the night the itching is almost always back within a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried alternative treatments like tea tree oil, aloe, tar, etc. These products are usually touted as \\&quot;all natural\\&quot;...what that means I have no idea, but as far as I can tell the only difference is that these products tend to be much more expensive. Tea tree oil works and feels good, but likewise I can never seem to find it cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter hydrocortisone...a sort of steroid if I am correct. It definitely works and can provide longer lasting relief. I&#x27;ve noticed when applied on a bad, itchy, flakey day is actually BURNS for a few seconds after application...but the relief lasts for a while. It&#x27;s quite satisfying and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that it&#x27;s still a bit pricey, and depending on how you apply it this bottle might not last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t really like the bottle itself. It&#x27;s got a long nozzle to make reaching your scalp easier, but I still feel like a lot of it is getting in my hair instead of onto the scalp itself. The hole at the end of the nozzle seems to get constantly plugged up (with what I&#x27;m guessing is skin...yuck) and I find myself clearing it every time I apply it to another spot. Other times TOO MUCH of the stuff will spill out, and once its out it just takes a while to rub it into the scalp with your fingers instead of getting it in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the relief it does provide, I&#x27;m thankful. I just wish it was cheaper. I&#x27;ve heard people recommend balms (same formula with chap-stick style applicator) for the scalp, and if it doesn&#x27;t bug you too much gel/cream might be just as good.</li>
            <li> great product, i have been using it for years... kills that itch in minutes.. i only use it about once a month!!..fast shipping...very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> On this journey of trying out new hairstyles my scalp has been battling with me from the get go. From the second day of any new style my scalp will itch de living daylights outta me! Thank God my sister brought down a bottle of this miracle lotion and I emptied it on my head lol.....I have since purchased another bottle of this potion and my hairstyle is on week two and the itching is not a major issue anymore.</li>
            <li> Scalpicin is the only immediate relief product that seems to work at all. I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;manage to deal with the problem for good after a few months of experimenting with various shampoos and other treatments. But in the mean time Scalpicin stopped me from scratching my skin off!</li>
            <li> Yeah, sure. Scalpicin works, for a while Then you need to reapply. And haven&#x27;t many ideas started with a head scratch?</li>
            <li> Best thing for an itchy scalp! Instant relief! I tried some &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products first, to no avail. Might as well have been water! But Scalpicin delivers! I will purchase again in the future! Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love it.  does the jobs</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband because he likes to use it.  However, the product that arrived was not in the orange and blue box as shown.  This is supposed to contain aloe unlike the product in the regular blue box.  Guess I will have to go to Walmart to get it.</li>
            <li> Help with my itchy scalp. On to my last bottle so I will need to buy another soon. Very good</li>
            <li> useful for my occasional itchy scalp.  Thanks Amazon for carrying wide varitey of self grooming items</li>
            <li> A great help for the problem!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  It is a lifeline!  I have severely itchy scalp but no dandruff due to thyroid issues, and this stuff calms my itchiness everytime!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  This is great for itchy scalps, like mine!!</li>
            <li> Works great. Stops the intense itch.</li>
            <li> This stops the itching, oily scalp with dandruff.  I use it daily when the scalp issue flares up, to get relief.  It is about the only thing that works for me.</li>
            <li> scalp issues? try it--you will be a much better person afterwards---happier for sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product regularly and I&#x27;m not really seeing a drastic change in relieving my itchy scalp. I will continue using - maybe it takes a while longer to show results.</li>
            <li> So thankful for Scalpicin! It is the only thing I&#x27;ve found to alleviate my itchy scalp!</li>
            <li> I have periods when I get sores on my scalp that are very painful. I can use Scalpicin to to relieve the problem until I can shampoo with T-Gel shampoo. I would not be without this product.</li>
            <li> IT DOES SEEM TO HELP ITCHY SCALP</li>
