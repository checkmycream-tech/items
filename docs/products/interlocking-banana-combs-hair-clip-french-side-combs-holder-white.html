    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The France Luxe Interlocking comb has been the BEST comb I have ever had.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the awesome clips you used in the 80s then don&#x27;t buy these......</li>
            <li>The plastic ones do not slide together very good and have a catch</li>
            <li>The break very easily.  </li>
            <li>VERY cheap quality.</li>
            <li>every time i put another one on, it broke one or more teeth.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for this product and I will be getting more.</li>
            <li>I love these combs, however, they need to be made with a more flexible material.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact they broke, I would love them.</li>
            <li>i like these ok</li>
            <li>maybe if teeth were were spaced a bit more apart.</li>
            <li>love these combs.  </li>
            <li>better than using rubber bands in pony tails.  </li>
            <li>if these were made more rubbery I would not have to keeo buying them.  </li>
            <li>Love these, but they are plastic &amp; break easy.</li>
            <li>Cheap...</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hold the hair securely in place.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks fantastic up in these banana combs but the teeth eventually break off.  </li>
            <li>I loved wearing this back in the day and glad I found them again.</li>
            <li>I only wore them 4 times, loved them, but they aready broke on me.  </li>
            <li>broke first time  </li>
            <li>but the teeth didnt want to interlock very well.</li>
            <li>sort of a mohawk look, but much prettier.  </li>
            <li>they are hard plastic, wish I had more colors to suit my colorful wardrobe.  </li>
            <li>Customers should be aware that these combs are very big.  </li>
            <li>The plastic is brittle and the do not come together completely.  </li>
            <li>I attirbute that to the fact that they do not come together completely.  </li>
            <li>hard to get to hold the hair because it you press harder to hold the hair, you break more teeth.</li>

            <li> keeps my hair pulled back off my face and puts it into a stream of curls down the back of my head.</li>
            <li> I have black and white sets.</li>
            <li> Might work on thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> They broke off in my hair and took forever to get all the little pieces out.</li>
            <li> especially if you have thick hair!  </li>
            <li> DISLIKE the Hard plastic, they are not easy to use for that reason, i love the design, but the hard plastic makes it impossible for comfort and the chance for breakage makes them no value</li>
            <li> Thin and the teeth broke off after the 2nd use.</li>
            <li> so they are not comfortable to wear.</li>

            <li> have purchased many banana clips and these were the worst.  </li>
            <li> Had thrown packaging away so unable to send back..</li>
            <li> hard plastic.  </li>
            <li> I have already broken some of the teeth on the combs.</li>
            <li> they are way to hard to interlock once put in hair!!</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t find those kinds anymore, sadly.</li>

            <li> They don&#x27;t interlock... worthless!</li>
            <li> no complaints about delivery or package or the way it holds my hair without pulling it out of the scalp.  I loved wearing this back in the day and glad I found them again.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed in product.</li>
            <li> I crimped my hair and wore these to the 80&#x27;s Prom!  I had a pair of these  &amp;#34;back in the day&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love these, but they are plastic &amp; break easy.</li>
            <li> have purchased many banana clips and these were the worst.  hard plastic.  no give in them.  every time i put another one on, it broke one or more teeth.  digs in the head.....hard to get to hold the hair because it you press harder to hold the hair, you break more teeth.</li>
            <li> VERY cheap quality. Thin and the teeth broke off after the 2nd use. They broke off in my hair and took forever to get all the little pieces out. Pass on these.</li>
            <li> Customers should be aware that these combs are very big.  They simply don&#x27;t work in my hair - much too heavy. Might work on thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> The France Luxe Interlocking comb has been the BEST comb I have ever had. The plastic ones do not slide together very good and have a catch so they are not comfortable to wear. The Luxe your can&#x27;t even tell you have one in your hair. Thank you for this product and I will be getting more. Dana Green</li>
