            <li>This product is amazing , I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase , I totally recommend it , also smells very good:)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>I liked it and recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s smoothed my hair out so nice, took care of the poofiness and split ends.</li>

            <li>I love, love, love Kerastase products and some more than others,  This one is a Keeper!  </li>
            <li>Consulted with my stylist from out of town who said this was a stellar product and great for me...</li>
            <li>Kerastase is one that can boldly make that statement about this product because it is definitely true!!!</li>
            <li>and my hair is in much better shape since.  </li>
            <li>(I had healthy hair to begin with).</li>
            <li>can see your hair shine more</li>
            <li>My hair felt wonderful but you really need to use the green booster caps to get the best result.</li>
            <li>and I will sure buy more of it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this product is authentic</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>you take it  off after the liquid get into the bottle and snap the sprayer ,so is the only way it works ,for you to be able to spray in your hair ,,that is the treatment !!!!</li>
            <li>Should have read description better.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks so much better after using this product.</li>
            <li>but she must do something more to it</li>
            <li>This is a stunning product.</li>
            <li>Try this, the results are stunning.</li>
            <li>THESE WORK BEST FOR STRENGTH; USING THE SAME COLOR CAP WITH THIS BOTTLE; MUST MIX CAP WITH THE BOTTLE</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more shiny.</li>
            <li>I attribute the shiny mostly to the Chroma Reflect Masque (Kerastase), but I&#x27;m sure this treatment helps.</li>
            <li>Also, it seems that moisturizing masques work better after I use this treatment.</li>
            <li>Ok-</li>
            <li>love it love</li>
            <li>With the first bottle alone, the breaking stopped - NO KIDDING!!!</li>
            <li>fast shipping and amazing results!</li>
            <li>Original product!</li>
            <li>I am so excited!</li>
            <li>Best product for dry hair.</li>
            <li>I love the weightless formula for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, certainly not the best product for me!</li>
            <li>Every hair line makes claim that their product is the best and most are not true.</li>
            <li>It seems it doesn&#x27;t break off as easily</li>
            <li>I strongly believe that this product will help my hair.</li>
            <li>Used this product when I was in Atlanta with fabulous results.  </li>
            <li>,,the vector sprayer pump can&#x27;t fit in the bottle either , so</li>
            <li>it helps my hair getting smooth a lot!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>When she does the treatment my hair feels absolutely so fabulous</li>
            <li>Product arrive without any original package, no instructions, no pump, no buster.  </li>
            <li>This looks good until the next wash.  </li>
            <li>I have had this treatment done in a salon twice--it made my hair super shiny, easier to straighten, and I didn&#x27;t have to use conditioner after shampooing for almost 2 months each time</li>
            <li>One entire bottle is used for a treatment, and I used a heat cap with it, which is best when doing deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff Highly recommend</li>
            <li>cause I&#x27;m freaking out ,first off the concentre booster caps , don&#x27;t even fit in the bottle</li>
            <li>Great protein supplement, i use after my blond high lift and it instantly makes my hair look and feel healthier!</li>
            <li>this product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is so worth the money</li>
            <li>I was hesitant because of the price, but trust me, its worth it.</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny</li>
            <li>Let me share that this product completely smoothed my frayed hair cuticles and made my hair, stronger, smoother and much more supple.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t work because the bottle are different side than cap and sprayer ,and I don&#x27;t know all those people giving good reviews if they ever have use this before , because my self that is all I use in the hair salon and at home ,so I know the product , so be careful ,and good luck for those tha never have the real product .....</li>
            <li>This is the right product.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I do know it&#x27;s not hurting anything, the price is reasonable (considering the in-salon price), and SOMETHING is definitely working because my hair is looking and feeling better all the time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m growing out old processed hair that frizzes easily.  </li>
            <li>it cant get enough hair looks healthy and its golden</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product but it is expensive.  </li>
            <li>My hair definitely welcomes a bit of tenderness, love and care from time to time.</li>
            <li>and sure wish I hadn&#x27;t because this instantly made my hair stronger softer shinier.</li>
            <li>(pretty inexpensive).</li>
            <li>through many treatments and an amino acid treatment I finally got it back to being healthy.</li>
            <li>First, I love Kerastase products and have been using them regularly for years.</li>
            <li>I used two vials (mixed with appropriate booster) on two separate occasions and my hair felt like straw each time.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product from Trace Cosmetics after reading spectacular reviews about it and using other Kerastase products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of these treatments in particular, but I don&#x27;t believe the concentrate I received from Trace Cosmetics was authentic.</li>
            <li>I need it to help make my dry, damaged hair healthy again.</li>
            <li>initially worked well for my fine, color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair got much healthier and stronger when I started juicing, so I don&#x27;t need this nearly as much now.</li>
            <li>If you really need something to treat your hair and see results over a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t soften my hair much.  </li>
            <li>I just receive my order , and I&#x27;m very dissapointed</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t figure out why the product did absolutely nothing for my hair until I went to a salon where they offer this as an in-store treatment.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely use products that will help protect my hair from my outdoor Tomgirl ways.</li>
            <li>this has a great result on my thin hair.</li>
            <li>this one didn&#x27;t do much for the texture of my hair</li>
            <li>Shipping is fast and items are very well packaged</li>
            <li>i will buy more inthe near future</li>
            <li>So far all of the vials I&#x27;ve received have had the right packaging, aroma and effect.</li>
            <li>Because this is such a highly concentrated protein treatment leaving on for too long can cause more damage!</li>
            <li>I have tired so many conditioning treatments from cheap to real</li>
            <li>I will try and keep this short and sweet..</li>
            <li>I would probably recommend the product but not this particular vendor.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the only thing that keeps my double-processed blonde locks looking shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Not the same quality product you will get from a salon, I would not recommend purchasing from amazon but definitely purchase from a reputable salon.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, as all Kerastase tends to be, but worth the extra benefits.  </li>
            <li>I out of the blue decided to change my usual brand which has worked great for me over the years,and went with some new brand that getting all the rave - BIG MISTAKE!!!</li>
            <li>A $35 treatment in a DC salon and so easy to do at home for less.</li>
            <li>Great product for my thin blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>Save my hair when it&#x27;s super dry cause of coloring.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s not terribly moisturizing I usually follow with a conditioner that is.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>and it worked like magic, as usual.</li>
            <li>but they really didn&#x27;t work the same.</li>
            <li>and it is so soft.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE ON YOUR ROOTS..</li>
            <li>My hair was falling out fast after recent damage caused by a hair relaxer.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair so soft and shiny..</li>
            <li>Really helped to fix my split ends and very dry hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to know exactly how much this treatment is helping because I&#x27;m using a variety of masques and treatments.</li>
            <li>So far everything is the same with my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used these twice, but they were recommended by my hair stylist and so far it seems to be helping my split ends.</li>
            <li>Oh don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does feel nice after</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at how quickly it softened the thick burnt hair crunshes</li>
            <li>I only did one treatment so far out of the 3 vials purchased last night.. and</li>
            <li>Just did it for the first time along with the ceramide booster and bought the little spray device to make it easier...</li>
            <li>my hair is rather dull as I do not color it and naturally have a very matte look...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do anything bad or good to my hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I absolutely use products that will help protect my hair from my outdoor Tomgirl ways.</li>
            <li> this has a great result on my thin hair.</li>
            <li> this one didn&#x27;t do much for the texture of my hair</li>
            <li> Shipping is fast and items are very well packaged</li>
            <li> i will buy more inthe near future</li>
            <li> So far all of the vials I&#x27;ve received have had the right packaging, aroma and effect.</li>
            <li> Because this is such a highly concentrated protein treatment leaving on for too long can cause more damage!</li>
            <li> I have tired so many conditioning treatments from cheap to real</li>
            <li> I will try and keep this short and sweet..</li>
            <li> I would probably recommend the product but not this particular vendor.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the only thing that keeps my double-processed blonde locks looking shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Not the same quality product you will get from a salon, I would not recommend purchasing from amazon but definitely purchase from a reputable salon.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, as all Kerastase tends to be, but worth the extra benefits.  </li>
            <li> I out of the blue decided to change my usual brand which has worked great for me over the years,and went with some new brand that getting all the rave - BIG MISTAKE!!!</li>
            <li> A $35 treatment in a DC salon and so easy to do at home for less.</li>
            <li> Great product for my thin blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> Save my hair when it&#x27;s super dry cause of coloring.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s not terribly moisturizing I usually follow with a conditioner that is.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> and it worked like magic, as usual.</li>
            <li> but they really didn&#x27;t work the same.</li>
            <li> and it is so soft.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE ON YOUR ROOTS..</li>
            <li> My hair was falling out fast after recent damage caused by a hair relaxer.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so soft and shiny..</li>
            <li> Really helped to fix my split ends and very dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know exactly how much this treatment is helping because I&#x27;m using a variety of masques and treatments.</li>
            <li> So far everything is the same with my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used these twice, but they were recommended by my hair stylist and so far it seems to be helping my split ends.</li>
            <li> Oh don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does feel nice after</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how quickly it softened the thick burnt hair crunshes</li>
            <li> I only did one treatment so far out of the 3 vials purchased last night.. and</li>
            <li> Just did it for the first time along with the ceramide booster and bought the little spray device to make it easier...</li>
            <li> my hair is rather dull as I do not color it and naturally have a very matte look...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do anything bad or good to my hair.</li>
            <li> Use a spritz bottle leave in for like 5 minutes then rinse (after regular shampoo &amp; condition) Can blow dry or just leave</li>
            <li> My hair is healthier than it has been in such a long time!!</li>
            <li> i have lots of hair and long</li>
            <li> .if anything my hair might feel a bit worse then when i first started using it.</li>
            <li> The only down side was that the treatments seemed to make my color fade faster.</li>
            <li> I like my hair and whether it is short or long; I have used this line of products and made an investment (because they are not cheap).  </li>
            <li> I have very dry curly hair-</li>
            <li> I have had very dry frizzy hair from coloring, blow drying and straightening it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> FOLLOW DIRECTIONS carefully, though.</li>
            <li> It is not very moisturizing, but that&#x27;s not why I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty useless without it.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this was different</li>
            <li> They informed me that the vendor failed to send the necessary bottle caps that contain ingredients that, when mixed with the vials, are key to the promised results.  </li>
            <li> Not nearly worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I did a dark brown once</li>
            <li> 3 vials is enough for me to do 2 applications because my hair is really thick.</li>
            <li> then towel dried, applied from the center to the ends...</li>
            <li> I usually shampoo my hair, towel dry it, then spray this treatment all over, comb through with a wide-toothed comb, cover with a shower cap, let it sit for about 10 minutes, then rinse.</li>
            <li> I have heavily highlighted hair, frizzy, delicate and I swim in saltwater daily.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted to experience the in-salon treatment at home (for a lot less money).</li>
            <li> and it looked black..</li>
            <li> this bottles are not original is a rip off , I have no idea</li>
            <li> Keratin was applied onto my hair and it was a little damaged.</li>
            <li> I highly doubt it is fake, because its nothing like what I used in the past.</li>
            <li> Maybe they are diluted, or old, or maybe they are just fake.</li>
            <li> I get the Kerastase moisture hair treatment at my salon every few months.  </li>
            <li> …don&#x27;t waste your time…this doesn&#x27;t work…</li>
            <li> I did cut off some of my hair to rid of the stringy, uneven areas caused by the breakage.</li>
            <li> It was over processed and my hair was dead...</li>
            <li> This is usually a salon treatment.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the price for such a small amount.</li>
            <li> I just got this product on Amazon and poured all three bottles in a small spray applicator.  </li>
            <li> hair is thick and hard, after use one little bottle, my hair getting smotth.</li>
            <li> I had been dying it black out of the box (AHH!!)</li>
            <li> The ENDS are the crucial part as those tend to be the bad area..</li>
            <li> Not a good purchase</li>
            <li> That;s BS and my stylist said that was incorrect as well) and then rinsed off and finished with COLD water to seal my hair cuticle and blow dried as usual...</li>
            <li> Damage and weak.</li>
            <li> I mean everything!</li>
            <li> This package came with one of the glass bottles broken.</li>
            <li> i am addicted to this stuff</li>
            <li> first off let me say how BAD BAD BAD</li>
            <li> Useless without the buster.  </li>
            <li> I mean BAD..</li>
            <li> Then being the crazy OCD person I am when it comes to my hair..</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the size of the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is a miracle! Just like all Kerastase products!!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Just like in the salon! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is usually a salon treatment.  Spray on damp washed hair, leave in five minutes and rinse.  It works best for me if I apply it between shampoo and conditioner.  Don&#x27;t leave it on longer than recommended or it can make your hair brittle enough to start breaking.&lt;br /&gt;It initially worked well for my fine, color-treated hair.  My hair got much healthier and stronger when I started juicing, so I don&#x27;t need this nearly as much now.</li>
            <li> Great product for my thin blonde hair.  I fell that the product&lt;br /&gt;give me a thicker look.  Been using it for a year.</li>
            <li> I love the weightless formula for my fine hair.  This is an awesome product but it is expensive.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This package came with one of the glass bottles broken.</li>
            <li> It was broke when it got here!!</li>
            <li> This helps repair my damage hair....i have lots of hair and long so i use 2 capsules after getting highlights or once a month and my hair is in much better shape since.  It looks to me it restores my hair when using it in a permanent way (meaning not just for the day).</li>
            <li> I have had this treatment done in a salon twice--it made my hair super shiny, easier to straighten, and I didn&#x27;t have to use conditioner after shampooing for almost 2 months each time (I had healthy hair to begin with). The only down side was that the treatments seemed to make my color fade faster. I bought these vials expecting the same result I got in the salon but they really didn&#x27;t work the same. They conditioned a bit, but only for a day or two! No additional shine, plus faded the color from my hair without the benefit of 8 weeks of conditioning. Boo. Maybe they are diluted, or old, or maybe they are just fake.</li>
            <li> If you really need something to treat your hair and see results over a couple of weeks.  This is the right product.&lt;br /&gt;You can see your hair shine more and it is so soft.  I like my hair and whether it is short or long; I have used this line of products and made an investment (because they are not cheap).  My hair definitely welcomes a bit of tenderness, love and care from time to time.</li>
            <li> My hair felt wonderful but you really need to use the green booster caps to get the best result. It is sold separately</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the size of the product. Additionally, certainly not the best product for me!</li>
            <li> They did not include the conditioner drops you put into it. It&#x27;s pretty useless without it. I will buy from salon from now on.</li>
            <li> Hair looks great until I wash it.  I&#x27;m growing out old processed hair that frizzes easily.  This looks good until the next wash.  Not nearly worth the price.  Although I can&#x27;t say how it would work on virgin hair.</li>
            <li> So my hairdresser charges $40 PER application. Order 3 &amp; do it yourself or I brought to the hairdresser with me. Great for frizzy/dry hair. Use a spritz bottle leave in for like 5 minutes then rinse (after regular shampoo &amp; condition) Can blow dry or just leave</li>
            <li> I have very dry curly hair- this product is worth every penny. I leave it in.</li>
            <li> My hair was so damaged. Breaking every time I brushed or combed it A LOT!! I trimmed off 6 inches before I found this stuff and sure wish I hadn&#x27;t because this instantly made my hair stronger softer shinier. I was skeptical because of the price for such a small amount. 3 vials is enough for me to do 2 applications because my hair is really thick. It is so worth the money and I will sure buy more of it. My hair is healthier than it has been in such a long time!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing , I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase , I totally recommend it , also smells very good:)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this product is authentic</li>
            <li> Second use of product. Can&#x27;t give a fair rating yet. So far everything is the same with my hair. Damage and weak.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t soften my hair much.  Used this product when I was in Atlanta with fabulous results.  Not sure why this was different</li>
            <li> Instant results... Just did it for the first time along with the ceramide booster and bought the little spray device to make it easier... Consulted with my stylist from out of town who said this was a stellar product and great for me... Washed my hair and applied conditioner (he said it was not necessary but I did anyways) then towel dried, applied from the center to the ends... The ENDS are the crucial part as those tend to be the bad area.. DO NOT WASTE ON YOUR ROOTS.. I have A LOT of hair and it is below my shoulders and one bottle sufficed... I have a heat cap, put it on for TWENTY minutes (read some review where it said your hair would break.. That;s BS and my stylist said that was incorrect as well) and then rinsed off and finished with COLD water to seal my hair cuticle and blow dried as usual... No Argan oil needed! FIERCE LOOKING HAIR! and SHINE!!! my hair is rather dull as I do not color it and naturally have a very matte look... LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I just receive my order , and I&#x27;m very dissapointed this bottles are not original is a rip off , I have no idea what is inside cause I&#x27;m freaking out ,first off the concentre booster caps , don&#x27;t even fit in the bottle ,,the vector sprayer pump can&#x27;t fit in the bottle either , so what that freak ,those caps suppose snap in the bottle them you take it  off after the liquid get into the bottle and snap the sprayer ,so is the only way it works ,for you to be able to spray in your hair ,,that is the treatment !!!! And it doesn&#x27;t work because the bottle are different side than cap and sprayer ,and I don&#x27;t know all those people giving good reviews if they ever have use this before , because my self that is all I use in the hair salon and at home ,so I know the product , so be careful ,and good luck for those tha never have the real product .....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about this Kerastase from friends and even as a hairdresser. I was hesitant because of the price, but trust me, its worth it. Great for your hair, (make sure you order the spray pump with it for application)</li>
            <li> This product was perfect to my hair, I love it !!! Keratin was applied onto my hair and it was a little damaged. I strongly believe that this product will help my hair.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Should have read description better.  Item does not include sprayer.  Directions not included with product. Disappointed</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Trace Cosmetics after reading spectacular reviews about it and using other Kerastase products.  Couldn&#x27;t figure out why the product did absolutely nothing for my hair until I went to a salon where they offer this as an in-store treatment.  They informed me that the vendor failed to send the necessary bottle caps that contain ingredients that, when mixed with the vials, are key to the promised results.  I would probably recommend the product but not this particular vendor.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much better after using this product. Really helped to fix my split ends and very dry hair.</li>
            <li> This Kerastase is a great product to add shine and a great feel to your hair.  A bit pricey, as all Kerastase tends to be, but worth the extra benefits.  FOLLOW DIRECTIONS carefully, though.</li>
            <li> it helps my hair getting smooth a lot!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick and hard, after use one little bottle, my hair getting smotth. love it!</li>
            <li> I get the Kerastase moisture hair treatment at my salon every few months.  When she does the treatment my hair feels absolutely so fabulous so I thought that I would try it myself at home so I bought some of this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it a lot but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to turn out the same when I do it.  Oh don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does feel nice after but she must do something more to it that I haven&#x27;t figured out.  For in between treatments it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Great protein supplement, i use after my blond high lift and it instantly makes my hair look and feel healthier!</li>
            <li> Its good but need more to continue the course and seeing a good result</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference when using this. Obviously, I will not bother again.</li>
            <li> Product arrive without any original package, no instructions, no pump, no buster.  Useless without the buster.  Not a good purchase</li>
            <li> …don&#x27;t waste your time…this doesn&#x27;t work….if anything my hair might feel a bit worse then when i first started using it.</li>
            <li> Every hair line makes claim that their product is the best and most are not true. Kerastase is one that can boldly make that statement about this product because it is definitely true!!! My hair was falling out fast after recent damage caused by a hair relaxer. I out of the blue decided to change my usual brand which has worked great for me over the years,and went with some new brand that getting all the rave - BIG MISTAKE!!! My scalp never burned but my hair simply stared falling out as I was washing the product out. The falling out continued for a month and this product was the one thing that saved my hair. With the first bottle alone, the breaking stopped - NO KIDDING!!! I did cut off some of my hair to rid of the stringy, uneven areas caused by the breakage.One entire bottle is used for a treatment, and I used a heat cap with it, which is best when doing deep conditioning treatments. It was worth every penny and I would recommend this to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> Original product! fast shipping and amazing results!</li>
            <li> Changes the texture of my bleached damaged hair to silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> The only product I have ever used that heals damage. This is a stunning product. A $35 treatment in a DC salon and so easy to do at home for less. Try this, the results are stunning.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the results.  It totally changed the texture of my hair.  I would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> very good on damaged hair smooths the hair very well</li>
            <li> I just got this product on Amazon and poured all three bottles in a small spray applicator.  Let me share that this product completely smoothed my frayed hair cuticles and made my hair, stronger, smoother and much more supple.  I love, love, love Kerastase products and some more than others,  This one is a Keeper!  I have heavily highlighted hair, frizzy, delicate and I swim in saltwater daily.  I absolutely use products that will help protect my hair from my outdoor Tomgirl ways.</li>
            <li> My only reservation about posting a five-star rating is that others may flock to this product and there&#x27;ll be none left for me at my next order. This stuff is the only thing that keeps my double-processed blonde locks looking shiny and healthy. I used to have to go to the salon to get this stuff sprayed in my hair but I couldn&#x27;t fathom paying $35 at the salon for what amounts to a simple product application I can do at home. I keep hoping no counterfeiters start making the rounds here, though. So far all of the vials I&#x27;ve received have had the right packaging, aroma and effect. Let&#x27;s hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite Kerastase products! Worth the $.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this from Velour Beauty or UBU Beauty.  I purchased this concentrate and the booster, used two bottles of each in one application, and left on for longer than recommended time.  It was no different than if I had put water on my hair.  This is probably what was in the vials.  I was ripped off for $60.  Save your money and buy somewhere else!!!</li>
            <li> THESE WORK BEST FOR STRENGTH; USING THE SAME COLOR CAP WITH THIS BOTTLE; MUST MIX CAP WITH THE BOTTLE BUT DO NOT HAVE TO USE THE SAME COLOR, THEY CAN BE MIXED AND MATCHED.</li>
            <li> Very good product and does what it says it will do. I liked it and recommend it. Used it once though.</li>
            <li> This treatment is great for weakened hair. I&#x27;ve been using this treatment for years and always gives me the results that I was looking for. Leaves my hair shinny and takes care of the damage caused by blow drying my hair every week.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do anything bad or good to my hair.</li>
            <li> Really good product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a must have. Save my hair when it&#x27;s super dry cause of coloring.</li>
            <li> Not the same quality product you will get from a salon, I would not recommend purchasing from amazon but definitely purchase from a reputable salon.</li>
            <li> this has a great result on my thin hair. As I have short hair it lasted for 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;Tottaly recommend for hair reconstruction</li>
            <li> very good weekly conditioner - recommend leaving it in for 10 minutes or more.</li>
            <li> I have had very dry frizzy hair from coloring, blow drying and straightening it. I have tired so many conditioning treatments from cheap to real expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I happened apoun this product one day on Ebay, gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smoothed my hair out so nice, took care of the poofiness and split ends. My hair looks so healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using it once a week if you can, to keep your hair looking great!&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to friends and everyone has loved it.&lt;br /&gt;You will never have to try another product again after you try this, you will be hooked!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I puts a tone of vitamins in your hair Talk about healthy! Love this stuff Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The product is really good for damaged/burned hair... I&#x27;m surprised at how quickly it softened the thick burnt hair crunshes</li>
            <li> I highly doubt it is fake, because its nothing like what I used in the past.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted to experience the in-salon treatment at home (for a lot less money). You need to buy the sprayer that is used for this product separately (pretty inexpensive). I need it to help make my dry, damaged hair healthy again. I use it once every 1.5 to 2 weeks. It is not very moisturizing, but that&#x27;s not why I bought it. I want it to help reconstruct my hair, which I know will not happen with one treatment. I do see an improvement in my hair. It seems it doesn&#x27;t break off as easily and it&#x27;s more shiny. I attribute the shiny mostly to the Chroma Reflect Masque (Kerastase), but I&#x27;m sure this treatment helps. Also, it seems that moisturizing masques work better after I use this treatment. I usually shampoo my hair, towel dry it, then spray this treatment all over, comb through with a wide-toothed comb, cover with a shower cap, let it sit for about 10 minutes, then rinse. Because it&#x27;s not terribly moisturizing I usually follow with a conditioner that is. It&#x27;s hard to know exactly how much this treatment is helping because I&#x27;m using a variety of masques and treatments. I do know it&#x27;s not hurting anything, the price is reasonable (considering the in-salon price), and SOMETHING is definitely working because my hair is looking and feeling better all the time!</li>
            <li> have used the oleo line treatments and saw a difference.  this one didn&#x27;t do much for the texture of my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used these twice, but they were recommended by my hair stylist and so far it seems to be helping my split ends.</li>
            <li> O produto veio na data indicada,de muito boa qualidade e com certeza no futuro irei usar esse vendedor novamente o</li>
            <li> Ok- I will try and keep this short and sweet.. first off let me say how BAD BAD BAD my hair is.. I mean BAD.. I had it stripped about a year ago- I had been dying it black out of the box (AHH!!) for about ten years and decided to finally strip it... It was over processed and my hair was dead... through many treatments and an amino acid treatment I finally got it back to being healthy. Then being the crazy OCD person I am when it comes to my hair.. I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep up with the salon costs and I wasn&#x27;t happy with the color- nothing would hold in my hair- I gave up and started dying out of the box agian.. I did a dark brown once and it looked black.. so I messed it all up.. and then wanted to try the ombre look so I agian had my ends bleached and then toned- double processing agian on my already damaged locks.. it was beyond fried.. I have been trying EVERYTHING! I mean everything! I have been doing deep conditioning treatments, mayonaise, olive oil you name it- I tried it. I recently purchased a heating cap on amazon and that has changed my hair forever! Along with this treatment, and the conditioning heating cap AHH miracles! I sprayed this on section by section and let it sit under heat for about 15 mins. Nothing longer! Because this is such a highly concentrated protein treatment leaving on for too long can cause more damage! I only did one treatment so far out of the 3 vials purchased last night.. and WOW! I can actually run my fingers through my hair agian! I am so excited! Great Product!</li>
            <li> Best product for dry hair. Shipping is fast and items are very well packaged</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so soft and shiny.. It looks great for weeks after treatment and I see a big difference in my split ends..</li>
            <li> First, I love Kerastase products and have been using them regularly for years. I&#x27;m a big fan of these treatments in particular, but I don&#x27;t believe the concentrate I received from Trace Cosmetics was authentic. I used two vials (mixed with appropriate booster) on two separate occasions and my hair felt like straw each time. I then purchased the Vita-Ciment elsewhere and it worked like magic, as usual. It&#x27;s unfortunate that Amazon doesn&#x27;t have a better screening process for its sellers.</li>
            <li> Not the same quality as the one used in hair salon. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> No instructions sent for how to best use this product</li>
            <li> love it love it cant get enough hair looks healthy and its golden again thx i will buy more inthe near future i am addicted to this stuff ): xoxox</li>
