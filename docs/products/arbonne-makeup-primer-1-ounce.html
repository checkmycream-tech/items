            <li> Goes on my face like silk.  :  )</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on skin.</li>
            <li> this primer makes my makeup slide on and give a airbrushed finish to my skin.  I truly do love it.</li>
            <li> I had tried two primers before my girlfriend said she loved this primer. And hands down Arbonne is the best primer. Bottle lasts about five-six months so definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I love this primer. Helps my make-up stay on better. Gliders on my face. Excellent product</li>
            <li> I can easily say this is the best primer I have every used, and I have tried quite a few. The scent is very light and is pleasant in my opinion. When applied it makes your skin feel very soft. They say all you need is one pump of it per day, but I would sometimes do two if my face was especially dry. My make up did go on easier after I applied it and I felt like it kept my foundation on for the majority of the day. I would definitely recommend this to someone who has sensitive skin, as I do and have not had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell the difference when using this primer rather than just trying to apply the makeup.  The foundation definitely goes on more easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not controlling the oil as when I purchased this product from the Arbonne website.  I just wondering if it is not an actual Arbonne product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love what it does to my skin!! it keeps my makeup on and feels like I have nothing on.  Plus the healthy benefits of Hylaronic acid!!</li>
            <li> This product has so much going for it turns the clock back I am 72 years old and feel like my skin has gone 10 years younger</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It helps my foundation to apply easily and smoothly. I&#x27;ve used this product for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, make up goes on so smooth too.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> only primer i have used so can&#x27;t compare.&lt;br /&gt;Love the feel it gives and use it without make-up and it creates nice glow</li>
            <li> Love it....it is perfect!</li>
            <li> It is the best makeup soundation I have ever used.  It feels like silk when it goes on your face.</li>
            <li> Great product for all ages 16 to 80. By the way this product is clear, no color at all.</li>
