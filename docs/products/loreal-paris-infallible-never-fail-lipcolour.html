    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It truly is the best lipstick I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Wonderful lipstick.</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;Oreal line of these Infallible lipsticks is just great.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>Great staying power and good moisturizing, but tea berry is not the color I wanted for fall and winter.  </li>
            <li>I have loved this lip color for years.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge, lasts all day and feels good.  </li>
            <li>I have found that lipstick may look good in the tube, but doesn&#x27;t not look good on me.</li>
            <li>It applies very smoothly with the applicator tip, so it&#x27;s easy to get it perfect every time.</li>
            <li>My favorite!</li>
            <li>I love this lip color!</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick!  </li>
            <li>good product/// haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere else..</li>
            <li>This is a very good color device was fast and on Time that thank you..</li>
            <li>Beautiful color and very moist on the lips.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite lip product.</li>
            <li>I love the Teaberry color and don&#x27;t wear anything else.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.  </li>
            <li>Love this color too.  </li>
            <li>With most lipsticks, your lips have color and shine for an hour or two and you have to touch up.</li>
            <li>and I have it in 4 favorite shades.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found that I can still purchase it through online orders, and I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>Color stays on lips and gloss is creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Make sure to moisturize your lips VERY WELL before you put on the lipstick, not with the balm provided.</li>
            <li>With no touch ups all day either - although the shiny silver container it comes in serves as a mini-mirror if you need to touch up quickly.</li>
            <li>I am loyal to that product.</li>
            <li>and it was pretty cheap</li>
            <li>This is the best long lasting lipstick I have found.</li>
            <li>I apply it early in the morning and it stays most of the day.</li>
            <li>and I like the old one much better.  </li>
            <li>This review is under the Teaberry one, which I like because it is a kicky fun</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fun rubbing your lips together while it sets and feeling it get stickier and stickier.</li>
            <li>Love this product and couldn&#x27;t find it in any local stores.</li>
            <li>It feels very dry once it sets, but the gloss stick makes it smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t moisturize your lips before hand, it will look very cracked because this is a very matte lipstick!</li>
            <li>The color is easily worn with orange or blue.</li>
            <li>Be sure to let the lipstick dry before applying the gloss.</li>
            <li>If it feels too thick, quickly use a tissue to lightly blot any excess, but again, just one quick blot.</li>
            <li>First, your lips must be clean and dry.</li>
            <li>Be sure to allow it to dry before adding clear gloss</li>
            <li>The color I got was more toned down than I imagined (Teaberry)</li>
            <li>I love this long lasting lip color.</li>
            <li>The color stays true &amp; doesnt dry your lips.</li>
            <li>I even showed my husband, holding up the old Teaberry to the new Teaberry.</li>
            <li>They are right, it stays on VERY LONG</li>
            <li>Thanks to this, I can rock red lips to any gig.</li>
            <li>Have used this slightly pinkish color before and it is a really nice, long lasting lip color.</li>
            <li>It might take you a few times before you get it right, but for a lipcolor like this one that lasts ALLLLL day long, it is totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I give the general product 5 stars - I&#x27;ve been using this for years, I give 1 star for the color.</li>
            <li>I am a female professional trombonist.</li>
            <li>Once the color has completely dried (and you really do have to wait for it to dry), apply the clear  twist-up chapstick-like sealer which adds shine and moisture to your lips.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Have used this slightly pinkish color before and it is a really nice, long lasting lip color.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I like to apply it in the morning before leaving home and forget about it during the rest of the day. Only if I eat oily things I have to appy it again.</li>
            <li> My favorite! Why is this being discontinued?? Can&#x27;t understand it!</li>
            <li> I have loved this lip color for years.  Doesn&#x27;t smudge, lasts all day and feels good.  Now it is not sold in stores, so thank you, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and very moist on the lips.</li>
            <li> This is the best long lasting lipstick I have found.</li>
            <li> I love this long lasting lip color. It lasts all day. I just use a gloss to add shine and moisture.  I&#x27;m really sad that l&#x27;oreal isn&#x27;t making it anymore. It&#x27;s my favorite lip product.</li>
            <li> It makes your lips dry ( don&#x27;t use the moisture lipstick that comes next to the color because it lightens the color so that is probably why I have dry lips) buy stays on for a longer time than other lipsticks.  The color is easily worn with orange or blue.</li>
            <li> I love this lip color! It applies very smoothly with the applicator tip, so it&#x27;s easy to get it perfect every time. It feels very dry once it sets, but the gloss stick makes it smooth and comfortable. I apply it early in the morning and it stays most of the day. I can apply the gloss stick every now and then if needed. The lip color does not come off on my cup or when I eat a meal. It only comes off if I eat something that is oily, but I think that&#x27;s the case with all lipsticks.  I love the Teaberry color and don&#x27;t wear anything else.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for the same item. As expected.</li>
            <li> I like this Loreal infallible lip color--i usually use it followed by a gloss to lighten the color a bit....but using the clear moisturizer that comes with it works well too.</li>
            <li> Love this product and couldn&#x27;t find it in any local stores.</li>
            <li> While I give the general product 5 stars - I&#x27;ve been using this for years, I give 1 star for the color. Teaberry was my go-to color for so long but when I ordered online, I got a different color with the same name !!! I even showed my husband, holding up the old Teaberry to the new Teaberry. I thought that maybe it was a one-time error so I ordered again. When I read other reviews, I realized this is happening to others, too, with other colors. I&#x27;m not sure if L&#x27;oreal has changed the colors or if this seller perhaps gets the \\&quot;off\\&quot; batches from L&#x27;oreal and sells them or it&#x27;s not really L&#x27;oreal? Whatever the reason, not cool.</li>
            <li> good product/// haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere else..</li>
            <li> Great staying power and good moisturizing, but tea berry is not the color I wanted for fall and winter.  One little thing is that I always run out of lipstick long before the moisturizer-- even using the moisturizer several times a day.</li>
            <li> Have wirn this for a few years. Long lasting. Be sure to allow it to dry before adding clear gloss</li>
            <li> I am a female professional trombonist. Thanks to this, I can rock red lips to any gig. Seriously, it stays through anything. If you are a lady wind musician, I cannot recommend it highly enough!!</li>
            <li> Easier that looking for it in a store and costs no more.</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick!  Can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.  They have changed the type of case it had and I like the old one much better.  The case itself becomes a mirror once you take the label off.  Love this color too.  Be sure to let the lipstick dry before applying the gloss.</li>
            <li> Left lips dry. Unsatisfied .</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lipsticks are conveniently packaged for at home or on a trip. The color stays true &amp; doesnt dry your lips.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal line of these Infallible lipsticks is just great. With most lipsticks, your lips have color and shine for an hour or two and you have to touch up. I have put this brand of lipstick on at 7:00 in the morning and by 3:00 you can still see shades of it - even after eating lunch! With no touch ups all day either - although the shiny silver container it comes in serves as a mini-mirror if you need to touch up quickly. It truly is the best lipstick I&#x27;ve ever used and I have it in 4 favorite shades. This review is under the Teaberry one, which I like because it is a kicky fun pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying this product is a two part process. First, your lips must be clean and dry. Apply the colored stain with the lip gloss applicator brush to your lips. Don&#x27;t be gloopy - treat it a bit like nail polish, brush it on once and don&#x27;t go over it again. If it feels too thick, quickly use a tissue to lightly blot any excess, but again, just one quick blot. Once the color has completely dried (and you really do have to wait for it to dry), apply the clear  twist-up chapstick-like sealer which adds shine and moisture to your lips. It might take you a few times before you get it right, but for a lipcolor like this one that lasts ALLLLL day long, it is totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS LIPSTICK! You won&#x27;t be let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I have found that lipstick may look good in the tube, but doesn&#x27;t not look good on me. When I find a product I like I am loyal to that product. And of course, when I find a product that I like, it disappears from the store shelves. Luckily, I found that I can still purchase it through online orders, and I am thrilled. This product is great. I can apply it and go out without worrying about it fading ... even after a meal. Wish they would put it back on the shelves.</li>
            <li> Make sure to moisturize your lips VERY WELL before you put on the lipstick, not with the balm provided. They are right, it stays on VERY LONG and it&#x27;s fun rubbing your lips together while it sets and feeling it get stickier and stickier. However, if you don&#x27;t moisturize your lips before hand, it will look very cracked because this is a very matte lipstick! Even with the balm!!!! But it stays for ages. The color I got was more toned down than I imagined (Teaberry) but I do like the quality and it was pretty cheap so.</li>
            <li> Wonderful lipstick. Color stays on lips and gloss is creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a very good color device was fast and on Time that thank you..</li>
