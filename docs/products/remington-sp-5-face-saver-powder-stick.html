            <li>THIS STUFF WORKS GREAT TRY IT!!</li>
            <li>Very good, can&#x27;t find in retail store</li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is a great pre-shave product.  </li>
            <li>also questioned why this stuff is not in every store, if it is so great.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t answer that one, because Remington Face Saver IS THAT GREAT.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>There is a fair amount of powder in the razor when I am done</li>
            <li>It smells good, even though you wash it off afterwards anyway.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the seller and product.</li>
            <li>Honestly, using powder doesn&#x27;t even make sense, but I tried talcum powder to see if it helped.</li>
            <li>Glad it surfaced again.</li>
            <li>Works great on a balmy and humid day, just like it always has!</li>
            <li>This product is great especially for the traveler.</li>
            <li>This powder stick prepares my face for a smooth and close shave.  </li>
            <li>stores should have it available.  </li>
            <li>Makes for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>gives u a clean feeling</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps keep me from getting razor bumps and helps the electric razor run over the skin smoothly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried liquid pre-shave-not worth it.  </li>
            <li>Like most men, I&#x27;d used Williams Lectric Shave (the green stuff with a potent odor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Helps shaving with electric shaver very much.</li>
            <li>The seller sent this as advertised, new and in original packaging.</li>
            <li>Sure, it only lasts a day, but it looks bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has never failed.</li>
            <li>I bought an average, every Joe kind of electric shaver, and I could not avoid the rash, no matter what I tried.</li>
            <li>My beloved commented that it left his face feeling smooth, soft and not the least bit irritated after he shaved.  </li>
            <li>Takes me 3X as long to clean my razor afterwards and it needs to be done 2X as often.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a significant amount of talc from the application and the first pass of your electric razor, so don&#x27;t have on dark clothes.  </li>
            <li>Also, the talc collects inside your razor, and you&#x27;ll want to clean it after every other shave.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply to those trouble areas.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why the second one was more expensive than the first one.</li>
            <li>my decades old shaver, finally needed to be retired.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not entirely sure it&#x27;s worth the extra effort.</li>

            <li> I ordered two of the Face Savers, an one cost 6.47 and the second one cost $7.96. They were suposed to be the same price $6.47 I don&#x27;t understand why the second one was more expensive than the first one. Other than the dual pricing, the order came on time and it was what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This product is great especially for the traveler. Sometimes when I travel I take a liquid pre shave  Unfortunately sometimes that bottle will leak and leave a mess.  This powder stick prepares my face for a smooth and close shave.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time but have had a hard time finding it.  Glad it surfaced again.</li>
            <li> I learned about this product while reading the customer reviews for electric shavers.  The Powder Stick was mentioned by several reviewers as contributing to their shave.  It got my attention.  As a trial, I ordered one Face Saver Powder Stick for my husband.  He tried it the day it arrived and is SOLD on it.  I am now planning to purchase the multi-pack when the Stick gets low.  My beloved commented that it left his face feeling smooth, soft and not the least bit irritated after he shaved.  His shaver even has a worn head&lt;br /&gt;(which we are replacing).  He especially likes the fact that his skin no longer burns with the application of after shave lotion.  The Face Saver Powder Stick is only a week old, but he has already signed off on other pre-shave products and has shared his &amp;#34;discovery&amp;#34; with his men friends.  That is his response.  My response is one of gratitude for those men who thought to mention it by name in their reviews of shavers.  One gentleman even mentioned the talc served to &amp;#34;lubricate&amp;#34; the shaving heads.  It is truly a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> It smoothes and cleans your face..gives u a clean feeling</li>
            <li> My husband has used it for years!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years. I cannot find it in stores, so I always order it on Amazon</li>
            <li> Helps shaving with electric shaver very much. Much less pulling of whiskers. Good product.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot but, as others have mentioned, it does get messy. Takes me 3X as long to clean my razor afterwards and it needs to be done 2X as often. It&#x27;s also fairly messy so you don&#x27;t want to use it if you&#x27;re dressed. Works quite well but I&#x27;m not entirely sure it&#x27;s worth the extra effort.</li>
            <li> Order was as expected</li>
            <li> helps my shaver. There is a fair amount of powder in the razor when I am done</li>
            <li> This stuff really helps keep me from getting razor bumps and helps the electric razor run over the skin smoothly.</li>
            <li> Very good, can&#x27;t find in retail store</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I think it helps to get a closer shave.  I&#x27;ve tried liquid pre-shave-not worth it.  It didn&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br /&gt;More stores should have it available.  I will continue to order through Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you do not like liquid/gel pre-shaves like me, you will like this product. It is powder and unscented. The seller sent this as advertised, new and in original packaging. It was delivered before the estimated date, which is always a plus. I am very satisfied with the seller and product.</li>
            <li> Makes for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great pre-shave product.  Lasts a long time and I think is&lt;br /&gt;helps the screen and blades last longer.</li>
            <li> Works great on a balmy and humid day, just like it always has!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the various liquid pre-shaves, and I&#x27;ve tried generic talcum powder... this product beats them all (impossible to find in stores)</li>
            <li> Remington pre-shave powder is a compacted, tinted powder stick to dry the face before using an electric shaver. It does everything expected of it.</li>
            <li> I have always avoided close shaves. An irritating rash appears around my upper neck, sometimes so bad, it is embarrassing. Sure, it only lasts a day, but it looks bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my decades old shaver, finally needed to be retired. I bought an average, every Joe kind of electric shaver, and I could not avoid the rash, no matter what I tried. Less pressure, shaving with the \\&quot;grain\\&quot;, pre-shave lotion, warming the face before hand, cooling the face afterwards, and rinsing with rubbing alcohol. All failures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an Internet search, I found these sticks. Honestly, using powder doesn&#x27;t even make sense, but I tried talcum powder to see if it helped. There did seem to be a difference, but it is hard to apply powder to your neck, talcum powder stinks, and there is the question of what it will do to the blades on the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also questioned why this stuff is not in every store, if it is so great. I still can&#x27;t answer that one, because Remington Face Saver IS THAT GREAT. It has never failed. It smells good, even though you wash it off afterwards anyway. It is easy to apply to those trouble areas. The container is small, but packs a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question needs to be asked again; why isn&#x27;t Remington Face Saver in every store?</li>
            <li> Your face needs lubrication when shaving with an electric razor.  Like most men, I&#x27;d used Williams Lectric Shave (the green stuff with a potent odor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This short stick is essentially compressed talc powder.  It definitely makes my shave easier, with fewer &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34; after shaving.  I didn&#x27;t have the negative experience as another reviewer; my stick is soild, and hasn&#x27;t fallen apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However...  You&#x27;ll get a significant amount of talc from the application and the first pass of your electric razor, so don&#x27;t have on dark clothes.  Also, the talc collects inside your razor, and you&#x27;ll want to clean it after every other shave.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF WORKS GREAT TRY IT!!</li>
            <li> Yep... I can&#x27;t use the powder stick since its broken. It&#x27;s all messy.</li>
            <li> it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
