            <li>What an amazing deal these are!  </li>
            <li>Provides good lift for roots and my hair dries faster.</li>
            <li>Great for adding volume on top for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Cats think these are great toys, btw. :-)</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>I could not get them to stay in place as well as I would have liked them to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice that wonderful items are finally being created to help with looser curl patterns.</li>
            <li>They are just okay.  </li>
            <li>and I think then I will appreciate the rollers more.  </li>
            <li>I do love using them for this purpose.</li>
            <li>I use them for volume on top of my head.</li>
            <li>Still better than the silver alligator clamps I&#x27;ve tried, those don&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
            <li>I clip them on top of my head for height while drying.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Perfect for giving hair an extra lift as it dries.</li>
            <li>Great item, fast delivery</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I find that duck bill clips work better for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>These are great for giving a lift to the crown if you have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>not as strong as I hoped for</li>
            <li>Maybe it is because my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>These really work to add volume to curly hair!!!</li>
            <li>These are great for keeping hair in sections for different styles but they do not hold hot rollers in place as claimed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>You can also use them to create vintage styles, like marcel waves, if you have the skills and the right length of hair.</li>
            <li>They are hot curler holders.</li>
            <li>Since I was in the market anyway for more sectioning clips, it was a no-brainer that I try them (especially at this $6 price).  </li>
            <li>Clips are a good tool for added volume as long as you have the extra time</li>
            <li>They would be good for someone who uses rollers, but they&#x27;re definitely not worth the investment for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered these after seeing on a you tube video and these clamps really helped give my hair lift and volume.</li>
            <li>These roller clamps are so much easier to use that the pins that came with my rollers,</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of different clips for this, and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Bought as a birthday present, got here very fast and included everything that was described!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for the large or extra large rollers</li>
            <li>I apply  mousse to my hair and clamp these on top then blow dry or hair dry for a while.</li>
            <li>I wish they would make these clips in more colors than black and white.</li>
            <li>I watched a video on You Tube about how someone used them with Curl Keepr for volume/lift to naturally curly hair and that this was just what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I use these when air drying my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Great for holding wet curly/wavy hair in place, especially if you are too lazy to diffuse your curls and just want to let your hair dry as you are doing other things.</li>

            <li> Great for holding wet curly/wavy hair in place, especially if you are too lazy to diffuse your curls and just want to let your hair dry as you are doing other things.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get the dreaded flat top/wavy length thing.</li>
            <li> the clamps give you the lift you need after diffusing your curls dry</li>
            <li> Clipping my hair at the front and crown when its about 80% dry and leaving the until its fully dry creates volume and makes styling easier.</li>
            <li> I was going to use them when I let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> saw these on a youtube video; the vlogger used them at her roots after diffusing to about 75% dry; they allowed the roots to dry with a little oomph and root lift while not leaving marks in the hair like traditional sectioning clips.  </li>
            <li> They open wide enough to grab on well to the medium and small size rollers.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have a tight enough grip for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use these clips as root lift clips to give my curly hair a lift when wet.</li>
            <li> Works well on hot curlers but a bit small for thick hair add a clip</li>
            <li> they are not strong enough.</li>
            <li> My hair has dried in an odd way.</li>
            <li> I need to let my hair grow a little longer</li>
            <li> Anyway, I still use them for  volume or when I dye my hair or to hold up my little girls hair for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> These did not work for my thick hair</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd set of these, because I am afraid they will be discontinued!</li>
            <li> Was not happy.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in these jumbo roller clamps.  </li>
            <li> These are silly.</li>

            <li> I use these to clip the roots of my hair to get some lift so I don&#x27;t get the dreaded flat top/wavy length thing. I have tried a number of different clips for this, and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Clips are a good tool for added volume as long as you have the extra time</li>
            <li> They are just okay.  I watched a video on You Tube about how someone used them with Curl Keepr for volume/lift to naturally curly hair and that this was just what I needed.  I&#x27;ve used them several times, and they just don&#x27;t work for me.  They would be good for someone who uses rollers, but they&#x27;re definitely not worth the investment for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> These really work to add volume to curly hair!!! I use them on the crown of my hair.</li>
            <li> My order came 2 days after it said it had been delivered and my package was opened. Was not happy.</li>
            <li> I need to let my hair grow a little longer and I think then I will appreciate the rollers more.  works wonders for my crown and adding height !</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers to serve two purposes.  I use these to hold on to my rollers.  They open wide enough to grab on well to the medium and small size rollers.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for the large or extra large rollers cause they simple cannot grasp your scalp to hold the roller in place.  The second use for these roller clips is to give my curly hair height at the roots while it is drying.  So anywhere that I need to get some height i place at clip.  The clips don&#x27;t disturb my curl pattern but lifts from the root.  I do love using them for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair. They don&#x27;t have a tight enough grip for me. I use them for volume on top of my head. I apply  mousse to my hair and clamp these on top then blow dry or hair dry for a while. When I take them out they leave the teeth marks in my hair. My hair has dried in an odd way. I have to run my hand through my hair to take out the track marks from the clamps in my hair, that could result in flaking from the mousse. Anyway, I still use them for  volume or when I dye my hair or to hold up my little girls hair for whatever reason. Still better than the silver alligator clamps I&#x27;ve tried, those don&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
            <li> I love these! Great for adding volume on top for curly hair. I wish I had ordered 2 packages.&lt;br /&gt;RSelt</li>
            <li> These are silly. They are hot curler holders.</li>
            <li> the clamps give you the lift you need after diffusing your curls dry</li>
            <li> I ordered these after seeing on a you tube video and these clamps really helped give my hair lift and volume.</li>
            <li> I use these clips alone, no curlers. I clip them on top of my head for height while drying. Great idea I got from another reviewer.</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd set of these, because I am afraid they will be discontinued! Great for holding wet curly/wavy hair in place, especially if you are too lazy to diffuse your curls and just want to let your hair dry as you are doing other things. You can also use them to create vintage styles, like marcel waves, if you have the skills and the right length of hair. These never pull or catch in your hair. It&#x27;s so nice that wonderful items are finally being created to help with looser curl patterns. Cats think these are great toys, btw. :-) I wish they would make these clips in more colors than black and white.</li>
            <li> Works well on hot curlers but a bit small for thick hair add a clip</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in these jumbo roller clamps.  They aren&#x27;t as big as I thought, and they&lt;br /&gt;are not as strong as I hoped for, if I don&#x27;t put them in just so, they fall over in my hair.</li>
            <li> I use these when air drying my naturally curly hair. Provides good lift for roots and my hair dries faster.</li>
            <li> They are great to help give volume to my curly hair.</li>
            <li> These did not work for my thick hair they are not strong enough.</li>
            <li> Great root lifting clips!</li>
            <li> These are great for keeping hair in sections for different styles but they do not hold hot rollers in place as claimed. I kept them because I didn&#x27;t have time to go to the post office for mailing them back and didn&#x27;t want to bother.</li>
            <li> Love these. Perfect for giving hair an extra lift as it dries.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw these on a youtube video; the vlogger used them at her roots after diffusing to about 75% dry; they allowed the roots to dry with a little oomph and root lift while not leaving marks in the hair like traditional sectioning clips.  Since I was in the market anyway for more sectioning clips, it was a no-brainer that I try them (especially at this $6 price).  I am happy to report that they work as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Suitable for labeled purpose with rollers as well.)</li>
            <li> I use these for root lift for my curly hair. Clipping my hair at the front and crown when its about 80% dry and leaving the until its fully dry creates volume and makes styling easier. I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Great item, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I find that duck bill clips work better for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> These are great for giving a lift to the crown if you have naturally curly hair.  Just 10 minutes does it.  I saw this trick on YouTube.  What an amazing deal these are!  I love them!</li>
            <li> Bought as a birthday present, got here very fast and included everything that was described!</li>
            <li> I wanted to use these clips as root lift clips to give my curly hair a lift when wet. I was going to use them when I let my hair air dry. I could not get them to stay in place as well as I would have liked them to. Maybe it is because my hair is fine. Perhaps they would stay in with thicker hair. I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> These roller clamps are so much easier to use that the pins that came with my rollers, originally.&lt;br /&gt;Also - the quantity of clamps EQUALS he number of rollers.  :)</li>
