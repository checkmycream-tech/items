            <li>Amazing product and great price!</li>
            <li>once the tube is squeesed in to your palm it takes alot of effort to get a good lather going, I tried putting it in to my shaving mug and using my 100% badger brush</li>
            <li>but the lather still wasnt that good  </li>
            <li>the lather in the tube isnt as good as the lather in the foam</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>The best that he could find was Gillette&#x27;s Shaving Gel for Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li>It is the most effective shaving gel for defense of Razor Bumps.</li>
            <li>Have purchased this product many times.</li>
            <li>Works very well and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Love this - get smooth, close shave from it.</li>
            <li>and I will never use another product again because I have yet to experience razor burn or irritations and it leaves my legs smooth.</li>
            <li>It ends up being more economical as well as fulfilling its claims of keeping razor bumps at bay.</li>
            <li>Stay away from this cheap item, it caused me a lot of pimples and I have to visit a doctor who caused me a lot of money.</li>
            <li>We have tried many different products over the years and this seems to be a good one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products including Nivea for Men, Barbasol (the old Marine Corps favorite) and others in-between without much success.  </li>
            <li>I still got a good shave with my double edge razor  </li>
            <li>I was thinking this was more like the norelco shaving gel, but this is more for standard shaving.</li>
            <li>My legs and skin in general are highly irritated by most products I&#x27;ve tried, but this one, my husband told my to try because he uses it to shave every morning before work and swore it felt like he was using an aloe plant because if the texture and it felt amazing....</li>
            <li>This along with using the Bump Patrol aftershave gave me results within 24 hours of the very first use.</li>
            <li>so this stuff lasts me a long time - the price is not an issue as the comfort and quality of my shaves is as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many sensitive shaving creams/gels but this one take the win hands down!  </li>

            <li>and he kept reverting back to Gillette; everything else caused so e kind of reaction.  </li>
            <li>He was right.</li>
            <li>, I am getting an incredibly close shave that meets my tough standards.  </li>
            <li>I think this is why the tube is a smaller size than most.</li>
            <li>My face  looked like I had just emerged from reconstructive surgery after I used them the first time</li>
            <li>can  the qnty in the tube doesnt seem to be too much eather  </li>
            <li>and it really helps keep razor bumps away.</li>
            <li>This product seems to work real well for him.</li>
            <li>works real well for me</li>
            <li>My husband really likes it</li>
            <li>My husband gets alot of ingrown hairs and has been dealing with it all his life, as many black men do.</li>
            <li>I use Nivea for Men Extra Soothing Aftershave Lotion for extra moisturizing after the shave and Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Stress Control Foaming Wash(not available on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>time I have ordered online, it has been at a low price and quickly delivered.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommended this to anyone having problems with hair bumps.</li>
            <li>Provided extra support for my face for a cool sensitive shave that I needed.</li>
            <li>and I quickly learned to be very, very careful.  </li>
            <li>Nivia sensitive is the</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to menthol</li>
            <li>He said with the Gillete, it was hard to control the amount he actually needed and felt most of it was doing down the drain whereas with the Bump Control, he literally needed a pea size in order to get exactly the right amount (actually 2 since he shaves his head in the shower and his face over the sink).</li>
            <li>I always go back to after trying new products.</li>
            <li>My plan moving forward is to use cocoa butter, to even out my skin tone, each day following my new shaving regimen.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better than the usual shaving cream especially if you have coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 45 year old african american male.  </li>
            <li>The only other product I would recommend besides this for shaving would be Ritual&#x27;s \\&quot;The Whip\\&quot; shaving cream, but The Whip&#x27;s cost is highly prohibitive in my opinion.  </li>

            <li> For those with sensitive skin who still feel the rough effects of shaving long after a shave, I recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> plus I  always have to dry shave to remove the stubborn stubble.  </li>
            <li> It takes a small dot on my finger tips to lather my entire leg, so a tiny amount goes a loooong way</li>
            <li> When it arrived and was in a rather small toothpaste sized tube, I was even more skeptical.  </li>
            <li> after for a little extra acne/bump prevention.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And to boot, it works the same, if not better, than the Gillette.</li>

            <li> A few months ago I was in Sally Beauty Supply for something else</li>
            <li> A thin, quarter sized dollop was all I needed to lather up my entire round face.  </li>
            <li> but the skin covers at least an average area of face for a grown man.  </li>
            <li> It does work with electric shavers, just use very little.</li>
            <li> I have a complicated routine where I use American Crew Pre-shave oil(fairly expensive) on my face before applying a small amount of this gel in my hand, adding a little water, and working into a lather.  </li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t had any razor bumps nor has he shown any negative reactions to this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and within 48 hours noticed a dramatic reduction in bumps on my neck.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the price of this shaving gel, I was very skeptical.  </li>

            <li> Nivia sensitive is the on I always go back to after trying new products.</li>
            <li> For those with sensitive skin who still feel the rough effects of shaving long after a shave, I recommend this product.  The only other product I would recommend besides this for shaving would be Ritual&#x27;s \\&quot;The Whip\\&quot; shaving cream, but The Whip&#x27;s cost is highly prohibitive in my opinion.  If you are sensitive to menthol I wouldn&#x27;t use this, but for those with extra-sensitive and/or razor-bump-prone skin pick this one.  I have a complicated routine where I use American Crew Pre-shave oil(fairly expensive) on my face before applying a small amount of this gel in my hand, adding a little water, and working into a lather.  I use Nivea for Men Extra Soothing Aftershave Lotion for extra moisturizing after the shave and Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Stress Control Foaming Wash(not available on Amazon!  Get on this, Amazon!) after for a little extra acne/bump prevention.  I swear I have the most sensitive skin in the world, and I can&#x27;t recommend this gel enough.</li>
            <li> I used all kinds of shaving creams and soaps for women and men. My legs and skin in general are highly irritated by most products I&#x27;ve tried, but this one, my husband told my to try because he uses it to shave every morning before work and swore it felt like he was using an aloe plant because if the texture and it felt amazing....He was right. It takes a small dot on my finger tips to lather my entire leg, so a tiny amount goes a loooong way and I will never use another product again because I have yet to experience razor burn or irritations and it leaves my legs smooth. I&#x27;ve used it for 3 months now..</li>
            <li> I was thinking this was more like the norelco shaving gel, but this is more for standard shaving. It does work with electric shavers, just use very little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 5 years and it works great for me. It appears Wal-Mart no longer carries this product in my area.</li>
            <li> once the tube is squeesed in to your palm it takes alot of effort to get a good lather going, I tried putting it in to my shaving mug and using my 100% badger brush but the lather still wasnt that good  the lather in the tube isnt as good as the lather in the foam can  the qnty in the tube doesnt seem to be too much eather  however the tube is less costly than the can ,but I think IM goin to stick with the can  I still got a good shave with my double edge razor  I would only by the tube again if I couldent get the can</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 45 year old african american male.  I&#x27;ve had razor bumps since I started shaving at 18. Always unsightly and discolored marking on my face from skin damaged over the years from removing ingrown hairs with tweezers.  I bought this product and within 48 hours noticed a dramatic reduction in bumps on my neck.  Encouraged by the results, I purchased the after shave Bump Patrol product.  I used it in combination with the shave gel and I noticed all razor bumps have disappeared within 48 hours after using the two products!  Nice.  My plan moving forward is to use cocoa butter, to even out my skin tone, each day following my new shaving regimen. That should blend the remaining dark spots and hopefully I&#x27;ll never have this issue again.  I&#x27;ll also pass along this solution to my son when he starts shaving in a few years.</li>
            <li> Love this - get smooth, close shave from it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better than the usual shaving cream especially if you have coarse hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it really helps keep razor bumps away.</li>

            <li> Muy bien la presentaci&amp;oacute;n y el envi&amp;oacute; fue el mas adecuado, volver&amp;iacute;a a comprarles a ellos. Son buenos productos para la pile evitando los danos de la hojilla.</li>
            <li> My husband has struggled with razor bumps for the last 25 years. The best that he could find was Gillette&#x27;s Shaving Gel for Sensitive Skin. Over the years, I&#x27;d buy all sorts of shaving creams, gels and oils both high-end and low-end and he kept reverting back to Gillette; everything else caused so e kind of reaction.  A few months ago I was in Sally Beauty Supply for something else and he happened to be with me and came in. When we got to the men&#x27;s shaving section, we both picked up the several different items they had and came upon this product. I said for under $5.00, what do we have to lose?  He hasn&#x27;t looked back. He said with the Gillete, it was hard to control the amount he actually needed and felt most of it was doing down the drain whereas with the Bump Control, he literally needed a pea size in order to get exactly the right amount (actually 2 since he shaves his head in the shower and his face over the sink). I think this is why the tube is a smaller size than most. And to boot, it works the same, if not better, than the Gillette. He hasn&#x27;t had any razor bumps nor has he shown any negative reactions to this product. At this price, I will continue to purchase it. It ends up being more economical as well as fulfilling its claims of keeping razor bumps at bay.</li>
            <li> When I saw the price of this shaving gel, I was very skeptical.  When it arrived and was in a rather small toothpaste sized tube, I was even more skeptical.  Then, I actually used it to shave and my skepticism vanished. A thin, quarter sized dollop was all I needed to lather up my entire round face.  I&#x27;m not some big watermelon head or something but the skin covers at least an average area of face for a grown man.  I don&#x27;t like electric razors and always come back to a  manual razor.  I am using a single-bladed Bic disposable razor that has the sharpest blade of any razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  My face  looked like I had just emerged from reconstructive surgery after I used them the first time and I quickly learned to be very, very careful.  I get a lot of razor burn and bumps under my chin plus I  always have to dry shave to remove the stubborn stubble.  I&#x27;ve used many products including Nivea for Men, Barbasol (the old Marine Corps favorite) and others in-between without much success.  This stuff is amazing.  Not only do I have zero razor burn or bumps, I am getting an incredibly close shave that meets my tough standards.  I don&#x27;t shave daily anymore so this stuff lasts me a long time - the price is not an issue as the comfort and quality of my shaves is as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that menthol \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; that this gel has on my face, makes me feel extra clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years now. It is the most effective shaving gel for defense of Razor Bumps. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have to order online because my local stores do not carry it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Each time I have ordered online, it has been at a low price and quickly delivered. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> My husband gets alot of ingrown hairs and has been dealing with it all his life, as many black men do. This product seems to work real well for him. We have tried many different products over the years and this seems to be a good one.</li>
            <li> Very good product. This along with using the Bump Patrol aftershave gave me results within 24 hours of the very first use. Would highly recommended this to anyone having problems with hair bumps.</li>
            <li> Works very well and pleasant scent. Great product!</li>
            <li> works real well for me</li>
            <li> very good product.  I&#x27;ve tried other shaving gels but this one gives me the cleanest shave</li>
            <li> Stay away from this cheap item, it caused me a lot of pimples and I have to visit a doctor who caused me a lot of money. This does not work at all</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. My husband really likes it and my son now loves as well since I put some in his Christmas stocking to try.</li>
