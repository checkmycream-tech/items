    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used to style my hair.</li>
            <li>Best curling iron ever!</li>
            <li>To get the best results, I suspect that you&#x27;ll probably want to purchase a silicone glove or pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But mine did not have any sort of scratch and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>Gives me awesome curls.</li>
            <li>so happy with it and would recommend to all!</li>
            <li>, I am so happy I made the leap and invested in it!  </li>
            <li>I used Tre semme and it worked beautifully!!</li>
            <li>I had perfect beach waves.</li>
            <li>Beautiful beach waves!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!!</li>
            <li>I promise, you will love it!!!</li>
            <li>You will get beautiful curls with this wand</li>
            <li>My hair turned out so beautiful.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give you that perfect rounded curl or wave, it almost looks \\&quot;imperfect\\&quot; and I think people who buy this are going more for that look than a perfectly coifed head of waves, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li>In theory, the Remington Elliptical Waving Wand is a great idea.</li>
            <li>It is a great product though</li>
            <li>I have a curler brush that is great for getting tangled in my hair if I&#x27;m in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>so I think I will be happy with it going forward.</li>
            <li>Then this magic wand lit up!!</li>
            <li>My waves looked just amazing, and they stayed for DAYS!</li>
            <li>Not this baby, OMG this product is absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li>The price is great and the quality is good.  </li>
            <li>it is easy to use and makes beautiful waves!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me a good 4-5 times to get the hang of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really good investment&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the glove didn&#x27;t do much good in protecting my hand from the heat.  </li>
            <li>They were so gorgeous that both of my sisters immediately bought their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked so incredible :-)</li>
            <li>but it gives a good curl.</li>
            <li>so I held the twirl on the wand for a good 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li>My husband came home and loved it.</li>
            <li>Makes beautiful, sexy, waves instead of girly spirals because of the elliptical shape.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure you buy another insulating glove when you buy this wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Love this wand!</li>
            <li>This wand is amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>It gives you nice curls</li>
            <li>I think if you are more experienced with styling hair, have a lot of time to practice, or plan to use it on someone else, you may be able to master this.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Please note, the glove it comes with is good but could be better.</li>
            <li>and if I had any skill at this process I probably would have had some kind of curl when I was finished.  </li>
            <li>and I would use the glove while doing my own hair</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve always wanted to try to get the kind of waves you see celebrities wearing nowadays.</li>
            <li>I think the company discontinued this item and I am really upset because this is the best curling wand EVER.</li>
            <li>This curling wand is a great wand for curling and heats up quick and the curls stay in tact without even having to use hairspray</li>
            <li>I love this product, you do your hair and it looks so nice.</li>
            <li>it would take a lot of practice for me to pull off being able to use  effectively, but</li>
            <li>Gives good curls and looks super cute for all occasions</li>
            <li>I like this product and will use it again on my hair many times to come.</li>
            <li>I really love the idea of having wavy hair with this product.</li>
            <li>degrees,\\&quot; you can actually choose any temperature from 270 to 410 degrees, so you can find the perfect balance between \\&quot;curling well enough\\&quot; and \\&quot;not damaging your hair too much\\&quot;</li>
            <li>For me, a curling iron works better than the wand.</li>
            <li>Bought for Grand Daughter, she loves it.</li>
            <li>I would also recommend using the glove that comes with it, it helps to make sure you don&#x27;t burn yourself.</li>
            <li>Either way, this elliptical waving wand is the key to getting those perfect effortless waves.</li>
            <li>A glove is included to provide heat protection, and the wand is designed to stand safely while it heats.</li>
            <li>Pin them and spray while you work for a more curly look once you remove the pins, or brush your hair out after waving for volume without curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This version is more oval shaped, and so your hair comes out with longer wavy</li>
            <li>When I saw the waving wand, I was looking forward to trying it because I absolutely love curling my hair.  </li>
            <li>The wand works wonderfully for second day hair too, creating body and making it look as though my hair is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure you buy another insulating glove when you buy this wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this three stars which by Amazon&#x27;s definition means that it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a paper that comes with the product that explains it more.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good wand, but don&#x27;t expect to get great waves.</li>
            <li>I just wish the glove had better heat protection.</li>
            <li>But, that being said I am madly in love with this waver</li>
            <li>I would hold it for 30 seconds or more though.</li>
            <li>but I was ok without it doing my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>It may be better if someone uses this on you, but to do it yourself takes a bit of practice and patience.</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve used it a couple more times and it&#x27;s getting easier to hold and know what to with it.</li>
            <li>Once you master the technique, you&#x27;ll love this tool.</li>
            <li>The wand makes awesome waves and it holds until the next wash.  </li>
            <li>I can see this getting better with practice.</li>
            <li>My favorite curling wand in the world.</li>
            <li>Not one burn :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s REALLY easy to bump the power and temp buttons repeatedly when you&#x27;re using this, so be sure to hold the \\&quot;-\\&quot; button for 2 seconds to lock the temp&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The wand heats quickly, which is nice</li>
            <li>Really fun waving wand--does what it says it will; nice beachy waves.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and does creates perfect soft waves once you get the hang of it, though it took me a few times to figure out the best method.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this because I&#x27;ve tried so many others and either they didn&#x27;t create waves or if they did, they came out within an hour.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This wand is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Curls come out beautiful and last.</li>
            <li>I bought this wand because I wanted a wand that would give me more of a wavy look rather than a real curl and from the look of the flat barrel I thought this would be perfect.</li>
            <li>fantastic tool to have in your styling arsenal and at a very reasonable price, the Remington Silk Ceramic Elliptical Waving Wand is an easy four stars!</li>
            <li>The moment I pulled the wand and glove out of the box, the glove ripped and a huge hole appeared in the side.  </li>
            <li>as in, you probably would not see great results unless it is all the way to the back.</li>
            <li>If you know this is the only size you are going to use, then I would say this is a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I actually ended up using a pair of leather gloves I have to protect my fingers at the gun range, lol.  </li>
            <li>The trick is learning how to hold the wand in a comfortable way and to learn how to manage your hair with a glove on.</li>
            <li>works great and curls last all day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking gorgeous waves that last for three days or more even in</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like using this as it is easy to use and the hair will stay while it is twirled around the wand and gives beautiful soft waves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li>The curl at first looks like it might have &amp;#34;square&amp;#34; curves, but it relaxes into a very nice natural look.  </li>
            <li>The results were just so so and it would probably look great for someone with long hair</li>
            <li>I have used the wand many times now and have found that the best technique is to use small sections of hair to make lots of pretty curls.  </li>
            <li>The concept of using a glove to wind hair around a hot barrel is an interesting one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>, I was pretty pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>And the curls held vertically - exactly as I had envisioned them but never thought I&#x27;d be able to do accomplish on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks really nice the next day too just need to touch up the top layer.  </li>
            <li>THis heats up quickly and automatically turns off, which is an important safety feature.</li>
            <li>This is great for people with fine, colored hair--I typically set it to 300 degrees with fantastic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The location of the on/off button is right where you would put your hand, so it is easy to turn off accidentaly.  </li>
            <li>I really just need to use this on my head and post a picture so you get a better idea of what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li>I also tried using it on straight hair and didn&#x27;t like the results any better.  </li>
            <li>My hair did not look natural, but I still liked it.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fairly quickly, which is perfect for those late mornings</li>
            <li>I just purchased another of this products and the same brand, but this time a curler wand for big curls, and I&#x27;m sure it will work just as good!</li>
            <li>My first time I used this was sooo easy.</li>
            <li>I suspect this might work best for persons with straight, coarse hair who need high heat to get waves.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a clamp--it&#x27;s just an oval stick that heats up quickly</li>
            <li>and I work fairly quickly, the glove&#x27;s helped quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are so many products out there similar to this, that do a much better job.</li>
            <li>It does seem to get very hot so a lot of caution is needed while using this.</li>
            <li>Even at the cooler temperatures the barrel gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>Also, do not get too close to the scalp as it&#x27;s very hot</li>
            <li>To start, it heats up super fast and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you want those gorgeous soft Hollywood waves that you see everywhere, don&#x27;t roll the wand up too high around your face.  </li>
            <li>I have long, straight hair and the Remington Silk Ceramic Elliptical Waving Wand has been wonderful in adding soft, wavy curls for a salon-style look!  </li>
            <li>The wand itself seemed sturdy with nice temperature features but without some kind of clamp, I was not able to get satisfactory results.  </li>
            <li>I can finally create the beautiful soft waves that I&#x27;ve coveted for years.  </li>
            <li>I leaves fun waves rather than fancy curls and lasts ALL DAY, which never happens for me.</li>
            <li>love it so far...  </li>
            <li>which is nice because I can use the smaller ones on my daughter.  </li>
            <li>It was far too challenging for me to use, and I have given up trying to make it work for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wand created a springy and fun curl in my medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like there was always a significant chunk left at the top or bottom of my hair that didn&#x27;t fully wave.  </li>
            <li>However, the controls for the heat settings, etc. are right under your hand</li>
            <li>it seems like a nice hot iron, but there&#x27;s a definite learning curve that I&#x27;d have to get through to be an expert.</li>
            <li>This Remington Ceramic Elliptical Waving Wand is very interesting because it produces a different type of curl/wave than a regular curling iron or hot rollers - more vertical than horizontal.</li>
            <li>I quickly realized that trying to wave large portions of my hair would not work.  </li>
            <li>and did I mention how super fast and goof proof</li>
            <li>It heats very fast.</li>
            <li>and I had used so many different methods to curl and wave my hair, and this wand has been AWESOMEEE!!!</li>
            <li>This ceramic wand gets incredibly hot but there is a glove included so that helps protect hands and fingers from getting burned.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m really lovin it!</li>
            <li>And, its FAST!</li>
            <li>OK, this is the second wand style curler I have.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While you may need some practice to get just the effect you want, this tool is not difficult to use.</li>
            <li>Try as I might, my results were mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>second time I tried the wand, I used medium sections of hair and my hair looked really cute.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the styling wand and have been using it on nearly a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>the glove doesn&#x27;t protect your hand from lengthy exposure to the hot barrel</li>
            <li>with this hot instrument.  </li>
            <li>This alone would have gotten three stars since it does get hot</li>
            <li>It gets really hot and stays hot and you must use with caution.</li>
            <li>I was a bit tentative at first</li>
            <li>&quot; so don&#x27;t give up if you don&#x27;t achieve the look on the first try.</li>
            <li>Perfection the first time.</li>
            <li>This waving wand creates soft, natural looking waves quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>was much too excited to return the wand just to get a new glove, so I plugged it in and went to work on my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely more for long hair...</li>
            <li>I really wanted to have the pretty curls I see so often</li>
            <li>This is pretty hard to use but it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>I think this feature is useful, if not critical, to making certain that you don&#x27;t inadvertently get the wand up to a high heat if you have fine or damaged</li>
            <li>Waving my hair seemed like a fun new alternative.  </li>
            <li>I was personally pretty petrified about getting burned since the glove itself really did not seem very heat resistant and it even says to not touch the wand with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I picked up this oddly shaped styling wand, but I&#x27;m thrilled that I did.  </li>
            <li>This is not an easy task to do and at the same time you are trying not to touch your ear, face, etc.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the highest tolerance in doing my hair, I&#x27;m mostly a wash, dry, brush, and go type of girl</li>
            <li>First of all, for those of you who aren&#x27;t familiar with this product, there is no clamp like you have with a traditional curling iron.  </li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job of creating loose, beachy waves, although if you make the curls super tight the oval shape makes them look</li>
            <li>The heat setting was pretty high too.</li>
            <li>However, I really just tried it twice and gave up on it.</li>
            <li>I have straight</li>
            <li>For me, the wand also took much longer to heat up than advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The glove included its very helpful.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t include much in the way of instructions, but there are YouTube videos showing the correct technique.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve found that because the wand heats up fast</li>
            <li>and I learned that I really needed the glove to work with this type of style tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this curler and it did not work very well.</li>
            <li>Even after the 40 seconds the curls did not turn out very well and didn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
            <li>It took me 26 minutes to do my whole head .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a wash-n-go sort with shoulder length straight hair</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t find that the glove that came with it really helped much.</li>
            <li>I bought this weirdly-shaped curling wand after having great success with the slim tapered Remington curling wand on my long, thick, straight, hard-to-curl hair.  </li>
            <li>and I also like how you can set heating temperatures up to 410 degrees by degree instead of the sliders most other curling irons use.  </li>
            <li>Ok so I first blow dried my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Other than the damage to the glove, the wand is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it for those who want to have fun and bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li>Other than the damage to the glove, the wand is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it for those who want to have fun and bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it creates the most fantastic waves that last not all day long but into the next day when I wake up, no I&#x27;m not kidding.</li>
            <li>When you use more hair the curl is loose and long, kind of like that loose beach-like look.</li>
            <li>What curls I achieved through the effort of trying this was not bad and did last.  </li>
            <li>This particular wand comes with a heat resistant glove and you are just suppose to twirl your hair around the wand with the glove.</li>
            <li>My problem with this is that I have a little bit past the shoulder length hair and it seem like no matter what I did, the wand got way too close to my face for comfort and it did not give as many waves as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>but mostly I just created a mess.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this for women who don&#x27;t want tight curls, but more of a relaxed wavy look.</li>
            <li>Consider using heat protectant if you use the high salon-style heat.</li>
            <li>High heat.</li>
            <li>and I find that describes it a little bit better.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really cooperate how I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
            <li>Looks even better after a few hours when the curls settle.  </li>
            <li>The damage to the glove annoyed me since I am fairly accident prone</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>They were pretty similar  </li>
            <li>At first, I tried to do larger chunks of my hair at one time, like I do with my curling iron.  </li>
            <li>THAT is the only advantage I see to using a glove and winding your hair around a hot barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a Waving Wand and it is also the last.  </li>
            <li>The first two times I tried to style my hair with this was a bit of a comedy routine but third time was the charm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old school - grew up using hot rollers (the hard plastic kind that melt if you leave them plugged in too long) and curling irons.  </li>
            <li>This one works well, it heats up fast and can be set by temp rather than high - medium - low.  </li>
            <li>and I have long hair that is typically easy to flat iron and curl.  </li>
            <li>While the small tapered wand gives me tight, Taylor Swift-esque curls, this wand gives me effortless perfect waves, as though I spent the day at the beach.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I have very smooth hair and this only lasted about half the day, if that.</li>
            <li>Be careful because it heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I had first straightened it with the Remington S9620 Silk ceramic Flat Iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m known to be pretty laid back when it comes to hair care, and using a traditional curling iron is just too much work for me.</li>
            <li>sure your hair lays flat on the wand, don&#x27;t let it lay on it twisted, as that is easy to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you get looks strange when you first take your hair off the curler since it looks almost like a rectangle.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t place it too close to my head, or wind my hair too close to my fingers, so this left the root section and ends of my hair perfectly straight.  </li>
            <li>have naturally wavy hair that takes well to heat, so</li>
            <li>This just didn&#x27;t produce results that appeared natural at all.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, even with thick straight hair, I don&#x27;t need to use the highest heat setting for lasting curls.  </li>
            <li>It also give a different texture to my hair than a flat iron, almost more volume or something, especially when I alternate the direction of the curls throughout the process.</li>
            <li>The curls were loose and looked so pretty.</li>
            <li>This curls hair faster than a typical curling iron but can be a little clumsy for those who may not be the greatest at styling hair.  </li>
            <li>I usually use my flat iron to curl my hair, but this wand gives a more natural beach wave look that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I advise people to never use it on the highest heat just because it gets to such a high temperature</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t take me that long to curl my hair and after I was done</li>
            <li>/&gt;Similar curling wands have narrowed tips to create corkscrew curls, but this one is straight, for soft, loose ringlets.</li>
            <li>It takes less than half the time of my old curling iron (which was still pretty fast) and I can take large sections of hair at a time.  </li>
            <li>Just so everyone knows, the product does not come in its original box and there may be a small scratch or two.</li>
            <li>B008B4TIPA Remington T Studio Pearl Ceramic Professional Styling Elliptical Wand, Large, Pink]] to see if a slightly larger barrel size made a difference.  </li>
            <li>This particular wand makes wavy hair which lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that its easy to mess with the temperature when using it because the controls are right at the palm area.</li>
            <li>I also like that my hair doesn&#x27;t slip nearly as much on this wand as it does on my other tapered wands.</li>
            <li>That really challenged me since I had to relearn how to hold this (much different than holding a curling iron) and to carefully wrap the hair around the wand.</li>
            <li>I had trouble getting my hair to stay wrapped around the barrel without burning my fingers [with the enclosed heat-safe glove] and it also was so hot on the medium temperature that my hair was singed.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product because although I have naturally wavy hair, it often waves unevenly with some pieces being tightly spirals and others being tangled and unruly.  </li>
            <li>It barely protects your hand, and only for a few seconds if you&#x27;re really holding onto your hair on the barrel.</li>
            <li>The less hair you use the more delicate it looks</li>
            <li>Let me begin by saying I&#x27;m not a very coordinated person when it comes to hair tools (other than hot rollers).</li>
            <li>and then I sprayed it with a little bit of spray (not too much</li>
            <li>I expected the elliptical shape of the wand to produce fake looking bent curls, but it actually creates the most natural looking waves I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a curling/styling iron.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used to style my hair.</li>
            <li> Best curling iron ever!</li>
            <li> To get the best results, I suspect that you&#x27;ll probably want to purchase a silicone glove or pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But mine did not have any sort of scratch and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> Gives me awesome curls.</li>
            <li> so happy with it and would recommend to all!</li>
            <li> , I am so happy I made the leap and invested in it!  </li>
            <li> I used Tre semme and it worked beautifully!!</li>
            <li> I had perfect beach waves.</li>
            <li> Beautiful beach waves!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I promise, you will love it!!!</li>
            <li> You will get beautiful curls with this wand</li>
            <li> My hair turned out so beautiful.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you that perfect rounded curl or wave, it almost looks \\&quot;imperfect\\&quot; and I think people who buy this are going more for that look than a perfectly coifed head of waves, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> In theory, the Remington Elliptical Waving Wand is a great idea.</li>
            <li> It is a great product though</li>
            <li> I have a curler brush that is great for getting tangled in my hair if I&#x27;m in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> so I think I will be happy with it going forward.</li>
            <li> Then this magic wand lit up!!</li>
            <li> My waves looked just amazing, and they stayed for DAYS!</li>
            <li> Not this baby, OMG this product is absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li> The price is great and the quality is good.  </li>
            <li> it is easy to use and makes beautiful waves!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me a good 4-5 times to get the hang of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really good investment&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the glove didn&#x27;t do much good in protecting my hand from the heat.  </li>
            <li> They were so gorgeous that both of my sisters immediately bought their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked so incredible :-)</li>
            <li> but it gives a good curl.</li>
            <li> so I held the twirl on the wand for a good 30 seconds</li>
            <li> Gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li> My husband came home and loved it.</li>
            <li> Makes beautiful, sexy, waves instead of girly spirals because of the elliptical shape.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure you buy another insulating glove when you buy this wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Love this wand!</li>
            <li> This wand is amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> It gives you nice curls</li>
            <li> I think if you are more experienced with styling hair, have a lot of time to practice, or plan to use it on someone else, you may be able to master this.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Please note, the glove it comes with is good but could be better.</li>
            <li> and if I had any skill at this process I probably would have had some kind of curl when I was finished.  </li>
            <li> and I would use the glove while doing my own hair</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve always wanted to try to get the kind of waves you see celebrities wearing nowadays.</li>
            <li> I think the company discontinued this item and I am really upset because this is the best curling wand EVER.</li>
            <li> This curling wand is a great wand for curling and heats up quick and the curls stay in tact without even having to use hairspray</li>
            <li> I love this product, you do your hair and it looks so nice.</li>
            <li> it would take a lot of practice for me to pull off being able to use  effectively, but</li>
            <li> Gives good curls and looks super cute for all occasions</li>
            <li> I like this product and will use it again on my hair many times to come.</li>
            <li> I really love the idea of having wavy hair with this product.</li>
            <li> degrees,\\&quot; you can actually choose any temperature from 270 to 410 degrees, so you can find the perfect balance between \\&quot;curling well enough\\&quot; and \\&quot;not damaging your hair too much\\&quot;</li>
            <li> For me, a curling iron works better than the wand.</li>
            <li> Bought for Grand Daughter, she loves it.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend using the glove that comes with it, it helps to make sure you don&#x27;t burn yourself.</li>
            <li> Either way, this elliptical waving wand is the key to getting those perfect effortless waves.</li>
            <li> A glove is included to provide heat protection, and the wand is designed to stand safely while it heats.</li>
            <li> Pin them and spray while you work for a more curly look once you remove the pins, or brush your hair out after waving for volume without curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This version is more oval shaped, and so your hair comes out with longer wavy</li>
            <li> When I saw the waving wand, I was looking forward to trying it because I absolutely love curling my hair.  </li>
            <li> The wand works wonderfully for second day hair too, creating body and making it look as though my hair is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure you buy another insulating glove when you buy this wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this three stars which by Amazon&#x27;s definition means that it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a paper that comes with the product that explains it more.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good wand, but don&#x27;t expect to get great waves.</li>
            <li> I just wish the glove had better heat protection.</li>
            <li> But, that being said I am madly in love with this waver</li>
            <li> I would hold it for 30 seconds or more though.</li>
            <li> but I was ok without it doing my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It may be better if someone uses this on you, but to do it yourself takes a bit of practice and patience.</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve used it a couple more times and it&#x27;s getting easier to hold and know what to with it.</li>
            <li> Once you master the technique, you&#x27;ll love this tool.</li>
            <li> The wand makes awesome waves and it holds until the next wash.  </li>
            <li> I can see this getting better with practice.</li>
            <li> My favorite curling wand in the world.</li>
            <li> Not one burn :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s REALLY easy to bump the power and temp buttons repeatedly when you&#x27;re using this, so be sure to hold the \\&quot;-\\&quot; button for 2 seconds to lock the temp&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The wand heats quickly, which is nice</li>
            <li> Really fun waving wand--does what it says it will; nice beachy waves.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and does creates perfect soft waves once you get the hang of it, though it took me a few times to figure out the best method.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this because I&#x27;ve tried so many others and either they didn&#x27;t create waves or if they did, they came out within an hour.</li>
            <li> So easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This wand is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Curls come out beautiful and last.</li>
            <li> I bought this wand because I wanted a wand that would give me more of a wavy look rather than a real curl and from the look of the flat barrel I thought this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> fantastic tool to have in your styling arsenal and at a very reasonable price, the Remington Silk Ceramic Elliptical Waving Wand is an easy four stars!</li>
            <li> The moment I pulled the wand and glove out of the box, the glove ripped and a huge hole appeared in the side.  </li>
            <li> as in, you probably would not see great results unless it is all the way to the back.</li>
            <li> If you know this is the only size you are going to use, then I would say this is a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I actually ended up using a pair of leather gloves I have to protect my fingers at the gun range, lol.  </li>
            <li> The trick is learning how to hold the wand in a comfortable way and to learn how to manage your hair with a glove on.</li>
            <li> works great and curls last all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking gorgeous waves that last for three days or more even in</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like using this as it is easy to use and the hair will stay while it is twirled around the wand and gives beautiful soft waves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li> The curl at first looks like it might have &amp;#34;square&amp;#34; curves, but it relaxes into a very nice natural look.  </li>
            <li> The results were just so so and it would probably look great for someone with long hair</li>
            <li> I have used the wand many times now and have found that the best technique is to use small sections of hair to make lots of pretty curls.  </li>
            <li> The concept of using a glove to wind hair around a hot barrel is an interesting one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> , I was pretty pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> And the curls held vertically - exactly as I had envisioned them but never thought I&#x27;d be able to do accomplish on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks really nice the next day too just need to touch up the top layer.  </li>
            <li> THis heats up quickly and automatically turns off, which is an important safety feature.</li>
            <li> This is great for people with fine, colored hair--I typically set it to 300 degrees with fantastic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The location of the on/off button is right where you would put your hand, so it is easy to turn off accidentaly.  </li>
            <li> I really just need to use this on my head and post a picture so you get a better idea of what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> I also tried using it on straight hair and didn&#x27;t like the results any better.  </li>
            <li> My hair did not look natural, but I still liked it.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fairly quickly, which is perfect for those late mornings</li>
            <li> I just purchased another of this products and the same brand, but this time a curler wand for big curls, and I&#x27;m sure it will work just as good!</li>
            <li> My first time I used this was sooo easy.</li>
            <li> I suspect this might work best for persons with straight, coarse hair who need high heat to get waves.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a clamp--it&#x27;s just an oval stick that heats up quickly</li>
            <li> and I work fairly quickly, the glove&#x27;s helped quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are so many products out there similar to this, that do a much better job.</li>
            <li> It does seem to get very hot so a lot of caution is needed while using this.</li>
            <li> Even at the cooler temperatures the barrel gets very hot.  </li>
            <li> Also, do not get too close to the scalp as it&#x27;s very hot</li>
            <li> To start, it heats up super fast and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> If you want those gorgeous soft Hollywood waves that you see everywhere, don&#x27;t roll the wand up too high around your face.  </li>
            <li> I have long, straight hair and the Remington Silk Ceramic Elliptical Waving Wand has been wonderful in adding soft, wavy curls for a salon-style look!  </li>
            <li> The wand itself seemed sturdy with nice temperature features but without some kind of clamp, I was not able to get satisfactory results.  </li>
            <li> I can finally create the beautiful soft waves that I&#x27;ve coveted for years.  </li>
            <li> I leaves fun waves rather than fancy curls and lasts ALL DAY, which never happens for me.</li>
            <li> love it so far...  </li>
            <li> which is nice because I can use the smaller ones on my daughter.  </li>
            <li> It was far too challenging for me to use, and I have given up trying to make it work for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wand created a springy and fun curl in my medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like there was always a significant chunk left at the top or bottom of my hair that didn&#x27;t fully wave.  </li>
            <li> However, the controls for the heat settings, etc. are right under your hand</li>
            <li> it seems like a nice hot iron, but there&#x27;s a definite learning curve that I&#x27;d have to get through to be an expert.</li>
            <li> This Remington Ceramic Elliptical Waving Wand is very interesting because it produces a different type of curl/wave than a regular curling iron or hot rollers - more vertical than horizontal.</li>
            <li> I quickly realized that trying to wave large portions of my hair would not work.  </li>
            <li> and did I mention how super fast and goof proof</li>
            <li> It heats very fast.</li>
            <li> and I had used so many different methods to curl and wave my hair, and this wand has been AWESOMEEE!!!</li>
            <li> This ceramic wand gets incredibly hot but there is a glove included so that helps protect hands and fingers from getting burned.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m really lovin it!</li>
            <li> And, its FAST!</li>
            <li> OK, this is the second wand style curler I have.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While you may need some practice to get just the effect you want, this tool is not difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Try as I might, my results were mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> second time I tried the wand, I used medium sections of hair and my hair looked really cute.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the styling wand and have been using it on nearly a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> the glove doesn&#x27;t protect your hand from lengthy exposure to the hot barrel</li>
            <li> with this hot instrument.  </li>
            <li> This alone would have gotten three stars since it does get hot</li>
            <li> It gets really hot and stays hot and you must use with caution.</li>
            <li> I was a bit tentative at first</li>
            <li> &quot; so don&#x27;t give up if you don&#x27;t achieve the look on the first try.</li>
            <li> Perfection the first time.</li>
            <li> This waving wand creates soft, natural looking waves quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> was much too excited to return the wand just to get a new glove, so I plugged it in and went to work on my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely more for long hair...</li>
            <li> I really wanted to have the pretty curls I see so often</li>
            <li> This is pretty hard to use but it does a good job.  </li>
            <li> I think this feature is useful, if not critical, to making certain that you don&#x27;t inadvertently get the wand up to a high heat if you have fine or damaged</li>
            <li> Waving my hair seemed like a fun new alternative.  </li>
            <li> I was personally pretty petrified about getting burned since the glove itself really did not seem very heat resistant and it even says to not touch the wand with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I picked up this oddly shaped styling wand, but I&#x27;m thrilled that I did.  </li>
            <li> This is not an easy task to do and at the same time you are trying not to touch your ear, face, etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the highest tolerance in doing my hair, I&#x27;m mostly a wash, dry, brush, and go type of girl</li>
            <li> First of all, for those of you who aren&#x27;t familiar with this product, there is no clamp like you have with a traditional curling iron.  </li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job of creating loose, beachy waves, although if you make the curls super tight the oval shape makes them look</li>
            <li> The heat setting was pretty high too.</li>
            <li> However, I really just tried it twice and gave up on it.</li>
            <li> I have straight</li>
            <li> For me, the wand also took much longer to heat up than advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The glove included its very helpful.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t include much in the way of instructions, but there are YouTube videos showing the correct technique.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve found that because the wand heats up fast</li>
            <li> and I learned that I really needed the glove to work with this type of style tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this curler and it did not work very well.</li>
            <li> Even after the 40 seconds the curls did not turn out very well and didn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
            <li> It took me 26 minutes to do my whole head .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a wash-n-go sort with shoulder length straight hair</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t find that the glove that came with it really helped much.</li>
            <li> I bought this weirdly-shaped curling wand after having great success with the slim tapered Remington curling wand on my long, thick, straight, hard-to-curl hair.  </li>
            <li> and I also like how you can set heating temperatures up to 410 degrees by degree instead of the sliders most other curling irons use.  </li>
            <li> Ok so I first blow dried my hair straight.</li>
            <li> Other than the damage to the glove, the wand is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it for those who want to have fun and bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li> Other than the damage to the glove, the wand is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it for those who want to have fun and bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it creates the most fantastic waves that last not all day long but into the next day when I wake up, no I&#x27;m not kidding.</li>
            <li> When you use more hair the curl is loose and long, kind of like that loose beach-like look.</li>
            <li> What curls I achieved through the effort of trying this was not bad and did last.  </li>
            <li> This particular wand comes with a heat resistant glove and you are just suppose to twirl your hair around the wand with the glove.</li>
            <li> My problem with this is that I have a little bit past the shoulder length hair and it seem like no matter what I did, the wand got way too close to my face for comfort and it did not give as many waves as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> but mostly I just created a mess.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this for women who don&#x27;t want tight curls, but more of a relaxed wavy look.</li>
            <li> Consider using heat protectant if you use the high salon-style heat.</li>
            <li> High heat.</li>
            <li> and I find that describes it a little bit better.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really cooperate how I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
            <li> Looks even better after a few hours when the curls settle.  </li>
            <li> The damage to the glove annoyed me since I am fairly accident prone</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> They were pretty similar  </li>
            <li> At first, I tried to do larger chunks of my hair at one time, like I do with my curling iron.  </li>
            <li> THAT is the only advantage I see to using a glove and winding your hair around a hot barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a Waving Wand and it is also the last.  </li>
            <li> The first two times I tried to style my hair with this was a bit of a comedy routine but third time was the charm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old school - grew up using hot rollers (the hard plastic kind that melt if you leave them plugged in too long) and curling irons.  </li>
            <li> This one works well, it heats up fast and can be set by temp rather than high - medium - low.  </li>
            <li> and I have long hair that is typically easy to flat iron and curl.  </li>
            <li> While the small tapered wand gives me tight, Taylor Swift-esque curls, this wand gives me effortless perfect waves, as though I spent the day at the beach.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I have very smooth hair and this only lasted about half the day, if that.</li>
            <li> Be careful because it heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> I had first straightened it with the Remington S9620 Silk ceramic Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m known to be pretty laid back when it comes to hair care, and using a traditional curling iron is just too much work for me.</li>
            <li> sure your hair lays flat on the wand, don&#x27;t let it lay on it twisted, as that is easy to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you get looks strange when you first take your hair off the curler since it looks almost like a rectangle.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t place it too close to my head, or wind my hair too close to my fingers, so this left the root section and ends of my hair perfectly straight.  </li>
            <li> have naturally wavy hair that takes well to heat, so</li>
            <li> This just didn&#x27;t produce results that appeared natural at all.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, even with thick straight hair, I don&#x27;t need to use the highest heat setting for lasting curls.  </li>
            <li> It also give a different texture to my hair than a flat iron, almost more volume or something, especially when I alternate the direction of the curls throughout the process.</li>
            <li> The curls were loose and looked so pretty.</li>
            <li> This curls hair faster than a typical curling iron but can be a little clumsy for those who may not be the greatest at styling hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually use my flat iron to curl my hair, but this wand gives a more natural beach wave look that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> I advise people to never use it on the highest heat just because it gets to such a high temperature</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t take me that long to curl my hair and after I was done</li>
            <li> /&gt;Similar curling wands have narrowed tips to create corkscrew curls, but this one is straight, for soft, loose ringlets.</li>
            <li> It takes less than half the time of my old curling iron (which was still pretty fast) and I can take large sections of hair at a time.  </li>
            <li> Just so everyone knows, the product does not come in its original box and there may be a small scratch or two.</li>
            <li> B008B4TIPA Remington T Studio Pearl Ceramic Professional Styling Elliptical Wand, Large, Pink]] to see if a slightly larger barrel size made a difference.  </li>
            <li> This particular wand makes wavy hair which lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that its easy to mess with the temperature when using it because the controls are right at the palm area.</li>
            <li> I also like that my hair doesn&#x27;t slip nearly as much on this wand as it does on my other tapered wands.</li>
            <li> That really challenged me since I had to relearn how to hold this (much different than holding a curling iron) and to carefully wrap the hair around the wand.</li>
            <li> I had trouble getting my hair to stay wrapped around the barrel without burning my fingers [with the enclosed heat-safe glove] and it also was so hot on the medium temperature that my hair was singed.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product because although I have naturally wavy hair, it often waves unevenly with some pieces being tightly spirals and others being tangled and unruly.  </li>
            <li> It barely protects your hand, and only for a few seconds if you&#x27;re really holding onto your hair on the barrel.</li>
            <li> The less hair you use the more delicate it looks</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying I&#x27;m not a very coordinated person when it comes to hair tools (other than hot rollers).</li>
            <li> and then I sprayed it with a little bit of spray (not too much</li>
            <li> I expected the elliptical shape of the wand to produce fake looking bent curls, but it actually creates the most natural looking waves I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a curling/styling iron.  </li>
            <li> The waving wand did take a little getting used to, especially if you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t normally curl your hair.</li>
            <li> If the waves are a little smaller than you want, try twisting the hair together when you release new sections from the wand.  </li>
            <li> This is different from a curling iron where you don&#x27;t have a clamp to hold down the hair while you work on the curling action.</li>
            <li> The insulating glove is essential because you need get the end of your hair curled too or your hair looks strange, and in order to curl the end of your hair, you need to move your hand close to the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m right handed and found it impossible to create the waves on the right side of my head.  </li>
            <li> Shaft is long enough to wrap long hair around it.</li>
            <li> The type of curl this wand makes is alright, but I prefer one that makes big loose curls.</li>
            <li> Yes, if you are&lt;br /&gt;quick to roll your hair, and not leave it on too long, it could curl.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair and are used to handling hair styling tools, this might be for you.  </li>
            <li> You can hold it as long as curly you want.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t end up using the glove that comes with this as it was way too big, but after a couple tries, I&#x27;ve figured out how close to wrap my hair without getting too close to the wand.  </li>
            <li> I eventually ended up curling my hair with only a few singes, and feeling still left in my fingers, so not a total loss.  </li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair that hits just below my shoulder blades</li>
            <li> iron itself is red and black, with a digital temperature display.  </li>
            <li> It is the same on my other one too, so I am getting used to it.  </li>
            <li> curls last all day without having to use hairspray or any other styling products.  </li>
            <li> The only other thing I didn&#x27;t like was the glove.</li>
            <li> a bit forced and unnatural (usually curly hair is more round instead of elliptical).</li>
            <li> Put the glove on and then just wrap your hair in secitions going backwards, you don&#x27;t need to hold it on very long</li>
            <li> I  have very long frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> While damaging an auxiliary item would typically allow a five star review, in the case of this product the auxiliary product is necessary to prevent burning your hand.  </li>
            <li> Since hair grows down and not up, you&#x27;ll need to hold the red part of the barrel above your head so you can twist the hair down toward the end of the wand without having the barrel block your other hand.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and I have trouble styling it, but this makes soft curls and big waves effortlessly - unlike other wands I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Never mind the fact that my hair constantly slipped on the shaft and never really wounded up tightly</li>
            <li> For any of you who were getting frustrated by being able to touch/turn off buttons with your fingers</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the glove it came with because it doesn&#x27;t help, just be careful not to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> The thing heats up from 270 to 410 degrees and once the unit reaches the desired temp, you can hold the - key for a few seconds to lock the setting keys so you don&#x27;t change or turn off the iron.  </li>
            <li> and it all ended up slipping to the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead, you have a heat resistant glove and you carefully wrap your hair around the wand.  </li>
            <li> This waving wand is really no help either.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> other notes:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This one comes with just the one size, my other one came with changable wands for the size of the curl/person.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few times and got strange results each time.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this wand, but due it&#x27;s shape, it leaves dents in the curls.</li>
            <li> It was a bit scary to use this since it was so hot</li>
            <li> lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only other negative for this product is that I can think of is that it is made in PRC, so if you are for American made products, now you know.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the effort it took to use it.</li>
            <li> while using it, if you hold down the lower temp button it will lock it for you.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t sit it down on any countertop, for it will burn.</li>
            <li> I kept clicking it down from 410 even on lockdown.</li>
            <li> I was planning on curling one side of my head with a round wand and the other side with this elliptical wand to take a picture and post, but I haven&#x27;t gotten around to that yet,</li>
            <li> because my hair isn&#x27;t that long - it&#x27;s chin length, or it may just be that I am clumsy, or need practice.  </li>
            <li> When I thought I had a handle on it, I wrapped my hair just like it said, and got...a yucky, oddly-shaped mess of hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick and long hair and nothing I have used, product or styling tool, has ever held its shape.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a lot of work to have both arms up trying to hold hair tightly around this barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was unfortunate that it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> It did take me a little time to learn to use it correctly.</li>
            <li> It take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> Having the glove helped a little bit in using the wand</li>

            <li> Maybe more.&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;Watch you tube videos of how to do this!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a product I see myself using everyday.</li>
            <li> Few Tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suggest watching a few youtube videos.</li>
            <li> or it can get too stiff with this type of curl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only real complaint is that the Waving Wand isn&#x27;t international-travel-friendly.  </li>
            <li> My hair is down past my bra strap and thick.</li>
            <li> so you are forced to hold a strand of hair away from the barrel and not touch the barrel longer than a few seconds</li>
            <li> Even when using the glove, I had a hard time getting hair to stay put on the wand and getting a uniform wave from root to tip without burning my head.  </li>
            <li> so I keep it at least an inch or so from the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was very difficult trying to gather my hair in the back to get the wave effect.</li>
            <li> I was curling very small sections of hair at a time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the people giving bad reviews are being patient enough.</li>
            <li> If you curl upwards and then release the hair, it will look REALLY weird and uneven when you release because of the elliptical shape</li>
            <li> Remington Ci96z1 Silk Ceramic Elliptical Waving Wand, for me, burned my hair, was awkward to use and didn&#x27;t produce the results I expected.  </li>
            <li> hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One feature I despised is the included glove - it&#x27;s crappy, completely useless, ill-formed, poor fitting and terrible quality.</li>
            <li> I have medium-long hair (just below the shoulders) and it&#x27;s cut in layers because it is very thick.  </li>
            <li> No good at all!  </li>
            <li> and I havcen&#x27;t used a curling iron in a while, so needless to say it took me a while to get the hang of using the Remington Elliptical Waving Wand.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t deliver on what I needed it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think the biggest problem is it is difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> I found this difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> I was also uncomfortable working with the heat glove.</li>
            <li> After opening the box, I became skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I tried to fix my hair, but failed, and I ran out of time to play with the wand.  </li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Sadly I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to be afraid I was going to burn my hand.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the power button is in a terrible place, I turned it off a couple times by accident.</li>
            <li> It comes with a glove so as not to burn yourself, but it&#x27;s all just very awkward and the results are not flattering.</li>
            <li> so the glove in my opinion is crap.  </li>
            <li> I do see where the heat setter sits is a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> If you hate styling your hair, get this!</li>
            <li> It was really terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this because it gives a slightly different look to my curls. It did take me a little time to learn to use it correctly.</li>
            <li> ***UPDATE: For any of you who were getting frustrated by being able to touch/turn off buttons with your fingers while using it, if you hold down the lower temp button it will lock it for you. Still cannot be happier with this, months later.*** ----- This is the best product I have ever used to style my hair. I leaves fun waves rather than fancy curls and lasts ALL DAY, which never happens for me. My only complaint is that its easy to mess with the temperature when using it because the controls are right at the palm area. I don&#x27;t use the glove it came with because it doesn&#x27;t help, just be careful not to burn yourself. Its a lot like the pricey ones at Ulta and Sephora. MUST BUY.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot! I don&#x27;t think the people giving bad reviews are being patient enough. It takes me 20 or so minutes to do all my hair. Maybe more.&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;Watch you tube videos of how to do this!&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your hair lays flat on the wand, don&#x27;t let it lay on it twisted, as that is easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;It took me a good 4-5 times to get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;Again, watch you tube videos!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my daughter.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> It gives you nice curls</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to receiving &amp; using this hair product.&lt;br /&gt;It was unfortunate that it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. Yes, if you are&lt;br /&gt;quick to roll your hair, and not leave it on too long, it could curl. It can&lt;br /&gt;also burn your hair away, and your scalp, if its close enough.&lt;br /&gt;  Don&#x27;t sit it down on any countertop, for it will burn. Also, its very&lt;br /&gt;dangerous to handle. I would not recommend this for teenagers. Even adults&lt;br /&gt;will find handling this hair product a challenge.</li>
            <li> I was planning on curling one side of my head with a round wand and the other side with this elliptical wand to take a picture and post, but I haven&#x27;t gotten around to that yet, but when I do I will post the picture on here. Let me see, so the curl or wave you get looks strange when you first take your hair off the curler since it looks almost like a rectangle. It doesn&#x27;t give you that perfect rounded curl or wave, it almost looks \\&quot;imperfect\\&quot; and I think people who buy this are going more for that look than a perfectly coifed head of waves, if that makes any sense. I really just need to use this on my head and post a picture so you get a better idea of what I&#x27;m talking about. I like this product and will use it again on my hair many times to come.</li>
            <li> I really love the idea of having wavy hair with this product. However, I really just tried it twice and gave up on it. This is different from a curling iron where you don&#x27;t have a clamp to hold down the hair while you work on the curling action. This particular wand comes with a heat resistant glove and you are just suppose to twirl your hair around the wand with the glove. I was personally pretty petrified about getting burned since the glove itself really did not seem very heat resistant and it even says to not touch the wand with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time it takes to heat up is about the same time as my $20 curling iron. It does seem to get very hot so a lot of caution is needed while using this. My problem with this is that I have a little bit past the shoulder length hair and it seem like no matter what I did, the wand got way too close to my face for comfort and it did not give as many waves as I would have liked. This is definitely more for long hair... as in, you probably would not see great results unless it is all the way to the back. It was very difficult trying to gather my hair in the back to get the wave effect. If you&#x27;re doing this by yourself, it just seems like a lot of practice is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I have very smooth hair and this only lasted about half the day, if that. The results were just so so and it would probably look great for someone with long hair but it just didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> I have straight and I had used so many different methods to curl and wave my hair, and this wand has been AWESOMEEE!!! My waves looked just amazing, and they stayed for DAYS! Wow! I love it!!! I just purchased another of this products and the same brand, but this time a curler wand for big curls, and I&#x27;m sure it will work just as good!</li>
            <li> Best curling iron ever! Takes about 5-10 mins to do all my hair. So easy to use.  Makes beautiful, sexy, waves instead of girly spirals because of the elliptical shape.  Looks even better after a few hours when the curls settle.  Looks really nice the next day too just need to touch up the top layer.  Recommended to all my girlfriends and sisters!</li>
            <li> I have never used a device like this and I havcen&#x27;t used a curling iron in a while, so needless to say it took me a while to get the hang of using the Remington Elliptical Waving Wand.  This ceramic wand gets incredibly hot but there is a glove included so that helps protect hands and fingers from getting burned.  This curls hair faster than a typical curling iron but can be a little clumsy for those who may not be the greatest at styling hair.  It isn&#x27;t a product I see myself using everyday.</li>
            <li> I am all thumbs when it comes to hairstyling stuff, but this styling wand is no problem. In fact, I&#x27;m really lovin it! My hair is long and I have trouble styling it, but this makes soft curls and big waves effortlessly - unlike other wands I&#x27;ve tried in the past. (In fact, I threw all the others out!) And, its FAST! If you hate styling your hair, get this!</li>
            <li> You will get beautiful curls with this wand&lt;br /&gt;A really good investment&lt;br /&gt;The curls last for ever</li>
            <li> Although Amazon lists this as a \\&quot;ceramic elliptical waving wand,\\&quot; the packaging calls it an \\&quot;oval ceramic barrel\\&quot; and I find that describes it a little bit better. It doesn&#x27;t have a clamp--it&#x27;s just an oval stick that heats up quickly and you wrap your hair around, hold (with your fingertips) and release. It does a pretty good job of creating loose, beachy waves, although if you make the curls super tight the oval shape makes them look a bit forced and unnatural (usually curly hair is more round instead of elliptical). But that just takes a bit of practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other notes:&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s REALLY easy to bump the power and temp buttons repeatedly when you&#x27;re using this, so be sure to hold the \\&quot;-\\&quot; button for 2 seconds to lock the temp&lt;br /&gt;* Since hair grows down and not up, you&#x27;ll need to hold the red part of the barrel above your head so you can twist the hair down toward the end of the wand without having the barrel block your other hand. If you curl upwards and then release the hair, it will look REALLY weird and uneven when you release because of the elliptical shape&lt;br /&gt;* The glove helps a teensy bit, but you still can&#x27;t touch the barrel with your hand--you still just use your fingertips to hold the end of your hair&lt;br /&gt;* The wand heats quickly, which is nice&lt;br /&gt;* Although it says \\&quot;410 degrees,\\&quot; you can actually choose any temperature from 270 to 410 degrees, so you can find the perfect balance between \\&quot;curling well enough\\&quot; and \\&quot;not damaging your hair too much\\&quot;</li>
            <li> In theory, the Remington Elliptical Waving Wand is a great idea. The package includes a heat resistant glove for styling hair. Unlike a curling iron, there is no clamp to keep hair in place. It take a little getting used to. For me, a curling iron works better than the wand.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product because although I have naturally wavy hair, it often waves unevenly with some pieces being tightly spirals and others being tangled and unruly.  I thought this wand would be a solution, allowing me to touch up strands of hair that weren&#x27;t quite behaving.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t deliver on what I needed it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the biggest problem is it is difficult to use.  Even when using the glove, I had a hard time getting hair to stay put on the wand and getting a uniform wave from root to tip without burning my head.  It seemed like there was always a significant chunk left at the top or bottom of my hair that didn&#x27;t fully wave.  My hair never looked anywhere close to what is advertised and I have long hair that is typically easy to flat iron and curl.  Also, the glove didn&#x27;t do much good in protecting my hand from the heat.  After styling for awhile the heat does transfer through and the glove makes you lose your dexterity.  I also tried using it on straight hair and didn&#x27;t like the results any better.  For me, the wand also took much longer to heat up than advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was just not a fan.  I think if you are more experienced with styling hair, have a lot of time to practice, or plan to use it on someone else, you may be able to master this.  However, for me it was just too tricky to use, especially given the look of the results.</li>
            <li> Remington Ci96z1 Silk Ceramic Elliptical Waving Wand, for me, burned my hair, was awkward to use and didn&#x27;t produce the results I expected.  I had trouble getting my hair to stay wrapped around the barrel without burning my fingers [with the enclosed heat-safe glove] and it also was so hot on the medium temperature that my hair was singed.  I can&#x27;t honestly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Volume and waves and waves of loveliness...  love it so far...  Yes you are constantly pressing the button to change the temp but it&#x27;s no big deal..it doesn&#x27;t interfere with styling at all...</li>
            <li> I found this difficult to use.  It may be because my hair isn&#x27;t that long - it&#x27;s chin length, or it may just be that I am clumsy, or need practice.  Even at the cooler temperatures the barrel gets very hot.  I couldn&#x27;t place it too close to my head, or wind my hair too close to my fingers, so this left the root section and ends of my hair perfectly straight.  If you have long hair and are used to handling hair styling tools, this might be for you.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try to use it again,though.</li>
            <li> I was eager to try the waving wand but it exceeded my hairstyling capability.  The wand itself seemed sturdy with nice temperature features but without some kind of clamp, I was not able to get satisfactory results.  I was also uncomfortable working with the heat glove.</li>
            <li> It heats very fast. The glove included its very helpful. I love this product, you do your hair and it looks so nice. You can hold it as long as curly you want.</li>
            <li> Bought for Grand Daughter, she loves it.</li>
            <li> OK, this is the second wand style curler I have.  Wand curlers take some time to learn how to use.  Not that it is rocket science, just the coordination of hands.  This one works well, it heats up fast and can be set by temp rather than high - medium - low.  The location of the on/off button is right where you would put your hand, so it is easy to turn off accidentaly.  It is the same on my other one too, so I am getting used to it.  This one comes with just the one size, my other one came with changable wands for the size of the curl/person.  which is nice because I can use the smaller ones on my daughter.  If you know this is the only size you are going to use, then I would say this is a great deal.  The price is great and the quality is good.  I would also recommend using the glove that comes with it, it helps to make sure you don&#x27;t burn yourself.</li>
            <li> This is pretty hard to use but it does a good job.  This reason I gave it only one star is because of the location of the on/off and the heat adjuster buttons.  As I was using the waver, I kept hitting the buttons either changing the setting or turning it off.  It just made it a hassle to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I picked up this oddly shaped styling wand, but I&#x27;m thrilled that I did.  I can finally create the beautiful soft waves that I&#x27;ve coveted for years.  I expected the elliptical shape of the wand to produce fake looking bent curls, but it actually creates the most natural looking waves I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a curling/styling iron.  They were so gorgeous that both of my sisters immediately bought their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and did I mention how super fast and goof proof it is?  It takes less than half the time of my old curling iron (which was still pretty fast) and I can take large sections of hair at a time.  I didn&#x27;t end up using the glove that comes with this as it was way too big, but after a couple tries, I&#x27;ve figured out how close to wrap my hair without getting too close to the wand.  The waves have killer staying power too!  I have thick straight hair that hits just below my shoulder blades and I didn&#x27;t have to use any styling proucts, not even hairspray!  I&#x27;m talking gorgeous waves that last for three days or more even in humidity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Few Tips:&lt;br /&gt;- If you want those gorgeous soft Hollywood waves that you see everywhere, don&#x27;t roll the wand up too high around your face.  Stop about 2-3 inches from your face.&lt;br /&gt;- If the waves are a little smaller than you want, try twisting the hair together when you release new sections from the wand.  When it cools, run your fingers through them to separate them.&lt;br /&gt;- I found that the day after I use the wand, my hair looks even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy the [[ASIN:B008B4TIPA Remington T Studio Pearl Ceramic Professional Styling Elliptical Wand, Large, Pink]] to see if a slightly larger barrel size made a difference.  They were pretty similar  (and the size difference was negligible), though the Pearl wand is a tiny bit cheaper, so save a buck and pick up that one.  Either way, this elliptical waving wand is the key to getting those perfect effortless waves.</li>
            <li> This waving wand creates soft, natural looking waves quickly and easily. A glove is included to provide heat protection, and the wand is designed to stand safely while it heats. An off switch and temperature controls add to the safety and precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar curling wands have narrowed tips to create corkscrew curls, but this one is straight, for soft, loose ringlets. Pin them and spray while you work for a more curly look once you remove the pins, or brush your hair out after waving for volume without curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you may need some practice to get just the effect you want, this tool is not difficult to use. The product doesn&#x27;t include much in the way of instructions, but there are YouTube videos showing the correct technique. Consider using heat protectant if you use the high salon-style heat.</li>
            <li> I have been seeing these curling irons everywhere, and people seem to like them a lot. So, I figured sure...why not try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron itself is red and black, with a digital temperature display.  Three buttons +, -,  and the on/off.  The thing heats up from 270 to 410 degrees and once the unit reaches the desired temp, you can hold the - key for a few seconds to lock the setting keys so you don&#x27;t change or turn off the iron.  This version is more oval shaped, and so your hair comes out with longer wavy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a \\&quot;Protective Glove\\&quot; which didn&#x27;t help for anything, burnt my fingers anyway so the glove in my opinion is crap.  No good at all!  I actually ended up using a pair of leather gloves I have to protect my fingers at the gun range, lol.  You can get similar gloves at any hardware store, or on amazon for that matter.  I eventually ended up curling my hair with only a few singes, and feeling still left in my fingers, so not a total loss.  I even managed to not melt my hair off like that girl on YouTube, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only other negative for this product is that I can think of is that it is made in PRC, so if you are for American made products, now you know.  Would I use this again to fix my hair...it would take a lot of practice for me to pull off being able to use  effectively, but yeah it seems like a nice hot iron, but there&#x27;s a definite learning curve that I&#x27;d have to get through to be an expert.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight hair and the Remington Silk Ceramic Elliptical Waving Wand has been wonderful in adding soft, wavy curls for a salon-style look!  It heats up fairly quickly, which is perfect for those late mornings and I also like how you can set heating temperatures up to 410 degrees by degree instead of the sliders most other curling irons use.  This is great for people with fine, colored hair--I typically set it to 300 degrees with fantastic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it comes with a heat-resistant glove.  It&#x27;s not a fireman&#x27;s glove, so if you use the wand for a while, the heat will still get through.  However, I&#x27;ve found that because the wand heats up fast and I work fairly quickly, the glove&#x27;s helped quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that the Waving Wand isn&#x27;t international-travel-friendly.  It&#x27;s rated for 110-volts and is not dual-voltage.  I travel a lot, so I can&#x27;t just use an adaptor, but will have to buy a convertor if I want to take this on a trip, so I may wind up leaving this at home, even if I&#x27;ve been using it every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fantastic tool to have in your styling arsenal and at a very reasonable price, the Remington Silk Ceramic Elliptical Waving Wand is an easy four stars!</li>
            <li> No matter how I tried, I never got the hang of using this elliptical wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally wavy hair that takes well to heat, so I thought that this might help me enhance and improve my waves. No such luck. Try as I might, my results were mediocre at best. I felt like I was working against my hair, rather than with my hair. It was far too challenging for me to use, and I have given up trying to make it work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One feature I do like on this wand is the temperature lock. Once at the desired temperature, hold the \\&quot;-\\&quot; button for 2 seconds, and a lock icon will appear. I think this feature is useful, if not critical, to making certain that you don&#x27;t inadvertently get the wand up to a high heat if you have fine or damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One feature I despised is the included glove - it&#x27;s crappy, completely useless, ill-formed, poor fitting and terrible quality. To get the best results, I suspect that you&#x27;ll probably want to purchase a silicone glove or pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth a try, if only to get a sense of what it can do for your hair. I suspect this might work best for persons with straight, coarse hair who need high heat to get waves.</li>
            <li> When I saw the waving wand, I was looking forward to trying it because I absolutely love curling my hair.  Waving my hair seemed like a fun new alternative.  After opening the box, I became skeptical.  The moment I pulled the wand and glove out of the box, the glove ripped and a huge hole appeared in the side.  The damage to the glove annoyed me since I am fairly accident prone and I learned that I really needed the glove to work with this type of style tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was much too excited to return the wand just to get a new glove, so I plugged it in and went to work on my hair.  At first, I tried to do larger chunks of my hair at one time, like I do with my curling iron.  I quickly realized that trying to wave large portions of my hair would not work.  I tried to fix my hair, but failed, and I ran out of time to play with the wand.  I had to wait until another time to try the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I tried the wand, I used medium sections of hair and my hair looked really cute.  My hair did not look natural, but I still liked it.  The wand created a springy and fun curl in my medium length hair.  I have used the wand many times now and have found that the best technique is to use small sections of hair to make lots of pretty curls.  The insulating glove is essential because you need get the end of your hair curled too or your hair looks strange, and in order to curl the end of your hair, you need to move your hand close to the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curls last all day without having to use hairspray or any other styling products.  The wand works wonderfully for second day hair too, creating body and making it look as though my hair is not greasy.  I absolutely love the styling wand and have been using it on nearly a daily basis.  The only reason I am giving the wand four stars is because the glove damaged when removing it from the box.  While damaging an auxiliary item would typically allow a five star review, in the case of this product the auxiliary product is necessary to prevent burning your hand.  Other than the damage to the glove, the wand is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it for those who want to have fun and bouncy curls.  Just be sure you buy another insulating glove when you buy this wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!oduct is necessary to prevent burning your hand.

            <li> I&#x27;m giving this three stars which by Amazon&#x27;s definition means that it&#x27;s okay.  The concept of using a glove to wind hair around a hot barrel is an interesting one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is it needed however?  I guess if you do not want to have a dent in your hair?  I understand the standard curling iron has a clip to hold your hair (or what do you call this mechanism?) and there is a possibility where if you started curling above your hair ends that you could end up with a dent in your hair. THAT is the only advantage I see to using a glove and winding your hair around a hot barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this tool isn&#x27;t efficient in my opinion.  I have long, thick and coarse hair.  I have LOTS of hair and I don&#x27;t curl ALL of it using a curling iron but depending on what I want to do, it&#x27;s a lot of work to have both arms up trying to hold hair tightly around this barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never mind the fact that my hair constantly slipped on the shaft and never really wounded up tightly and it all ended up slipping to the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the glove doesn&#x27;t protect your hand from lengthy exposure to the hot barrel so you are forced to hold a strand of hair away from the barrel and not touch the barrel longer than a few seconds or you do feel it through the glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the results of the effort I put in to use this ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eh it&#x27;s okay.  What curls I achieved through the effort of trying this was not bad and did last.  I will admit I used some hair spray (which I always do) to help with the hold.</li>
            <li> Really fun waving wand--does what it says it will; nice beachy waves.</li>
            <li> I love it so much! Just so everyone knows, the product does not come in its original box and there may be a small scratch or two. There&#x27;s a paper that comes with the product that explains it more. But mine did not have any sort of scratch and it worked perfectly! I advise people to never use it on the highest heat just because it gets to such a high temperature and it&#x27;s not necessary to use it on 410 degrees. It is a great product though and I would recommend it if you like having tousseled waves!</li>
            <li> I bought this wand because I wanted a wand that would give me more of a wavy look rather than a real curl and from the look of the flat barrel I thought this would be perfect. Well, I was wrong. This curling wand is a great wand for curling and heats up quick and the curls stay in tact without even having to use hairspray but it doesn&#x27;t give me the waved look I was looking for, only curls. Overall it&#x27;s a good wand, but don&#x27;t expect to get great waves. I would recommend it for curls, though.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this because I&#x27;ve tried so many others and either they didn&#x27;t create waves or if they did, they came out within an hour. Not this baby, OMG this product is absolutely AMAZING! First of all, it creates the most fantastic waves that last not all day long but into the next day when I wake up, no I&#x27;m not kidding. It&#x27;s super easy to use. Just turn it on then press the - or + button to lower or raise the temperature. Then, press and hold the - button and it will lock in your temp so that while you are using it if you hit the button the temp won&#x27;t change and it won&#x27;t go off. Put the glove on and then just wrap your hair in secitions going backwards, you don&#x27;t need to hold it on very long it works like a dream. Please note, the glove it comes with is good but could be better. You must use the glove or you will burn yourself I just wish the glove had better heat protection. But, that being said I am madly in love with this waver I&#x27;m thinking of buying another just to have a back up. DO NOT hesitate, buy this NOW!!!!! I promise, you will love it!!! My hair has never looked so incredible :-)</li>
            <li> I really wanted to have the pretty curls I see so often but this tool doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  I&#x27;m old school - grew up using hot rollers (the hard plastic kind that melt if you leave them plugged in too long) and curling irons.  I have a curler brush that is great for getting tangled in my hair if I&#x27;m in a hurry.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a Waving Wand and it is also the last.  First of all, for those of you who aren&#x27;t familiar with this product, there is no clamp like you have with a traditional curling iron.  Instead, you have a heat resistant glove and you carefully wrap your hair around the wand.  This is not an easy task to do and at the same time you are trying not to touch your ear, face, etc. with this hot instrument.  I&#x27;m right handed and found it impossible to create the waves on the right side of my head.  on the left side I managed a couple but mostly I just created a mess.  This alone would have gotten three stars since it does get hot and if I had any skill at this process I probably would have had some kind of curl when I was finished.  However, the controls for the heat settings, etc. are right under your hand so I kept changing the temp as I wrapped hair around it.  I have medium-long hair (just below the shoulders) and it&#x27;s cut in layers because it is very thick.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with hair that length or any shorter.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo9GDOBIWB59VS]]Remington Ci96z1 Silk Ceramic Elliptical Waving Wand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this wand on my daughter&#x27;s waist length hair I had first straightened it with the Remington S9620 Silk ceramic Flat Iron. The curls were loose and looked so pretty. The less hair you use the more delicate it looks but it gives a good curl. I would hold it for 30 seconds or more though. When you use more hair the curl is loose and long, kind of like that loose beach-like look. This wand is easy to handle. It gets really hot and stays hot and you must use with caution. This comes with a glove and I would use the glove while doing my own hair but I was ok without it doing my daughter&#x27;s hair. Also, do not get too close to the scalp as it&#x27;s very hot so I keep it at least an inch or so from the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like using this as it is easy to use and the hair will stay while it is twirled around the wand and gives beautiful soft waves.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really cooperate how I&#x27;d like it to. This waving wand is really no help either. I like that it lets you control the heat settings, although I keep it on the highest all the time regardless. It comes with a glove so as not to burn yourself, but it&#x27;s all just very awkward and the results are not flattering. It may be better if someone uses this on you, but to do it yourself takes a bit of practice and patience. When I thought I had a handle on it, I wrapped my hair just like it said, and got...a yucky, oddly-shaped mess of hair. The end result was not waves, but bent-looking sections of hair. I don&#x27;t think the shape of the actual wand help at all. It&#x27;s too boxy. You will not get the waves you want from using this. I tried a few times and got strange results each time. There are so many products out there similar to this, that do a much better job. This just didn&#x27;t produce results that appeared natural at all. I&#x27;m not a fan, and do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the highest tolerance in doing my hair, I&#x27;m mostly a wash, dry, brush, and go type of girl but I&#x27;ve always wanted to try to get the kind of waves you see celebrities wearing nowadays. The waving wand did take a little getting used to, especially if you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t normally curl your hair. Having the glove helped a little bit in using the wand so I didn&#x27;t have to be afraid I was going to burn my hand. I was a bit tentative at first but it started getting a little easier as I went on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really didn&#x27;t take me that long to curl my hair and after I was done, I was pretty pleased with the results. Since then I&#x27;ve used it a couple more times and it&#x27;s getting easier to hold and know what to with it. I would recommend this wand for both novices and those who are pros at waving their hair.</li>
            <li> THis heats up quickly and automatically turns off, which is an important safety feature. This particular wand makes wavy hair which lasts for a very long time. I recommend this for women who don&#x27;t want tight curls, but more of a relaxed wavy look. My daughter loves this product and uses it often.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying I&#x27;m not a very coordinated person when it comes to hair tools (other than hot rollers). This Remington Ceramic Elliptical Waving Wand is very interesting because it produces a different type of curl/wave than a regular curling iron or hot rollers - more vertical than horizontal. Doing this requires not having the clip on the wand to hold the hair onto it. That really challenged me since I had to relearn how to hold this (much different than holding a curling iron) and to carefully wrap the hair around the wand. The wand comes with a glove to protect the hand doing the wrapping. The first two times I tried to style my hair with this was a bit of a comedy routine but third time was the charm. The trick is learning how to hold the wand in a comfortable way and to learn how to manage your hair with a glove on. Be careful because it heats up quickly. I have thick-ish hair so I held the twirl on the wand for a good 30 seconds and then I sprayed it with a little bit of spray (not too much or it can get too stiff with this type of curl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the third attempt, I had lift off. And the curls held vertically - exactly as I had envisioned them but never thought I&#x27;d be able to do accomplish on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product. It&#x27;s not something I do every day so I think I will be happy with it going forward. You may need a bit of practice to \\&quot;get\\&quot; so don&#x27;t give up if you don&#x27;t achieve the look on the first try. Once you master the technique, you&#x27;ll love this tool.</li>
            <li> love it! works great and curls last all day!</li>
            <li> I tried this curler and it did not work very well. I was curling very small sections of hair at a time and I still had to hold the hair on the curler for 40 seconds. Even after the 40 seconds the curls did not turn out very well and didn&#x27;t hold well. The heat setting was pretty high too. The type of curl this wand makes is alright, but I prefer one that makes big loose curls.</li>
            <li> I usually use my flat iron to curl my hair, but this wand gives a more natural beach wave look that lasts all day.  My sister had one and I had to get one for myself and my two little girls.  The curl at first looks like it might have &amp;#34;square&amp;#34; curves, but it relaxes into a very nice natural look.  It also give a different texture to my hair than a flat iron, almost more volume or something, especially when I alternate the direction of the curls throughout the process.</li>
            <li> I think the company discontinued this item and I am really upset because this is the best curling wand EVER. I get complements all the time when I use it. Gives me awesome curls.</li>
            <li> This wand is amazing it is easy to use and makes beautiful waves!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing.  I have naturally thick and long hair and nothing I have used, product or styling tool, has ever held its shape.  The wand makes awesome waves and it holds until the next wash.  so happy with it and would recommend to all!</li>
            <li> I bought this weirdly-shaped curling wand after having great success with the slim tapered Remington curling wand on my long, thick, straight, hard-to-curl hair.  I have to say, I am so happy I made the leap and invested in it!  While the small tapered wand gives me tight, Taylor Swift-esque curls, this wand gives me effortless perfect waves, as though I spent the day at the beach.  What&#x27;s more, even with thick straight hair, I don&#x27;t need to use the highest heat setting for lasting curls.  It&#x27;s amazing!  I also like that my hair doesn&#x27;t slip nearly as much on this wand as it does on my other tapered wands.</li>
            <li> High heat. Shaft is long enough to wrap long hair around it. Gives good curls and looks super cute for all occasions</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this wand, but due it&#x27;s shape, it leaves dents in the curls. Also, I can achieve the same curl when wrapping a piece of hair around a regular curling iron. Sadly I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I suggest watching a few youtube videos. I  have very long frizzy hair. Ok so I first blow dried my hair straight. Then this magic wand lit up!! I turned it to the 410 degree mark. Please ladies use a heat protecton on your hair!! I used Tre semme and it worked beautifully!! My hair is down past my bra strap and thick. My first time I used this was sooo easy. I didn&#x27;t even need the glove!! It took me 26 minutes to do my whole head . I can see this time going to about 16 minutes!! My hair turned out so beautiful. I had perfect beach waves. Gorgeous hair. My husband came home and loved it. I put it in a side ponytail with a South Korean hair tie. Kinda looks like rabbit ears or bow. I do see where the heat setter sits is a bit annoying. I kept clicking it down from 410 even on lockdown. I can see this getting better with practice. My favorite curling wand in the world. Beautiful beach waves!! Perfection the first time. Not one burn :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m known to be pretty laid back when it comes to hair care, and using a traditional curling iron is just too much work for me. I&#x27;m a wash-n-go sort with shoulder length straight hair but I was intrigued by this Remington elliptical waving wand. To start, it heats up super fast and is easy to use. Unfortunately the power button is in a terrible place, I turned it off a couple times by accident. It gets very hot and does creates perfect soft waves once you get the hang of it, though it took me a few times to figure out the best method. The only other thing I didn&#x27;t like was the glove. It barely protects your hand, and only for a few seconds if you&#x27;re really holding onto your hair on the barrel. Otherwise I think it&#x27;s well priced and efficient if you like to spice things up now and then!</li>
            <li> Love this wand! Curls come out beautiful and last.</li>
            <li> It was a bit scary to use this since it was so hot and I didn&#x27;t find that the glove that came with it really helped much. Not worth the effort it took to use it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use this correctly? I used it the way I do any regular curling wand but I ended up with crimps all over. It was really terrible.</li>
