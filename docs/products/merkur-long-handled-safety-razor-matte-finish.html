            <li>great razor</li>
            <li>Always get a great shave and the number of nicks and cuts</li>
            <li>the law does not allow to return it, even with Amazon great Customer care.  </li>
            <li>I have electric shaver and as great as mine</li>
            <li>Always keep the blade very warm.  </li>
            <li>Feels good in my hand and holds the blade at a great angle.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with the closeness and consistency of the shave, and pleased with the weight and feel of the razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent three piece DE razor with the famous Merkur head.</li>
            <li>and he is more then happy!</li>
            <li>As most DE shavers I am always on the prowl for the elusive PERFECT razor.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it comes with a pack of 10 or so blades, so that is nice, too!</li>
            <li>It has a great weight and finish, superior shave and</li>
            <li>Good grip.</li>
            <li>The razor feels good in my hand, and it doesn&#x27;t tear or pull at any of my stubble while I&#x27;m shaving.</li>

            <li>Price is good</li>
            <li>Excellent starter DE safety razor that will serve advanced as well as beginning DE shavers.</li>
            <li>Good luck in your search</li>
            <li>The knurling on the handle is fantastic and provides a wonderfully grippy holding surface.</li>
            <li>The razor has a good grip and plenty of weight to it.</li>
            <li>I am a 9 and the 8 fit perfect.  </li>
            <li>Best shave I have ever had, with no razor burn and smooth feel closeness,  </li>
            <li>a good bit off your razor blade replacement budget.</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as my Edwin Jagger, but that razor is the pinnacle of quality and craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>Decided to get this Merkur shaver because of its good price and reputation for quality.  </li>
            <li>So, moving it up to 5 since this is a good value.</li>
            <li>This is not as good as March 3 or March 3+ shaving razor.  </li>
            <li>Being that I&#x27;d rather not fumble around with a tool designed to be literally razor-sharp, this is a good thing.</li>
            <li>It shaves exceptionally well and saves tons of money on blades.  </li>
            <li>i switch all the time trying the latest greatest and looking for something that will work better for me.</li>
            <li>It is well made and exceptionally sturdy.</li>
            <li>Merkur makes exceptional razors produced in Germany.</li>
            <li>Looks good and works even better!</li>
            <li>The razor looks great and shaves even better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great razor to my rotation, I don&#x27;t think that it will ever replace my Gillette adjustable&#x27;s as my favorite, but I do like it a lot.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor.</li>
            <li>I started wetshaving with a Merkur HD, which is a great razor, but this is even better.  </li>
            <li>More passes are required though, to get a close shave, but the great thing is that there are also fewer nicks.</li>
            <li>I am so very glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>Good quality, nice finish</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This razor is outstanding!</li>
            <li>I find myself actually enjoying shaving in the morning!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am really impressed with my first safety razor</li>
            <li>If you are a man who shaves, or you love a man who shaves - buy him this razor!  </li>
            <li>It feels great to use and also gives a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li>I use with persons blades, but the one that comes with this is also amazing.</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing.</li>
            <li>The included blade is a nice boon, but I picked up some Astra blades ([[ASIN:B001QY8QXM B001QY8QXM]]</li>
            <li>The satin finish is nice because it doesn&#x27;t get slippery while shaving, but the rust is unacceptable.</li>
            <li>You know guys may stretch the truth from time to time but they will be candid when it comes to their shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice grip</li>
            <li>I honestly question how they care for it.</li>
            <li>It is has built in control with nice heft and balance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Design: I own the Matte version of this product.</li>
            <li>Fairly affordable upfront cost, bought a pack of 100 razors for $10 and gives me a better shave.</li>
            <li>Old school is best, better shave for a tenth the cost of premium disposables!</li>
            <li>Could not wait to get my razor, I am new to this style of shaving, I am impressed with the balance and weight of the razor.  </li>
            <li>However it is an stainless alloy with a hatch patter that gives a very good grip.  </li>
            <li>At any rate, my experience with the Merkur razor is excellent thus far.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly, the Merkur shaved better in one pass than the adjustable Gillette.</li>
            <li>The most honest review and the one that tipped the scales for me was the one by the sailor.</li>
            <li>I own a Gillette Fatboy, Parker, and Timor and this razor more than measures up.</li>
            <li>so I had some time to decide if I liked the bundled blade, or if there was another that suited me better.  </li>
            <li>Husband is thrilled and says it gives a better shave than the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; razors out there.</li>
            <li>IT has a nice weight, it&#x27;s easy to handle, it looks really nice.</li>
            <li>Perfectly balanced, just the right amount of weight, just the right blade angle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very smooth shave, although I think the Merkur blade that came with it doesn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li>I figured for under $30, this was an excellent opportunity to own a long handled Merkur without breaking the bank.  </li>
            <li>The handle has a super grip to it and just feels good in the hand.  </li>
            <li>The quality is top notch, weight is great, and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor, and I find it both a beautifully made item, and easy to use too.</li>
            <li>The shaver has good weight and with the way it curves the blade makes for smooth, easy shaving.</li>
            <li>what a great shaving experience I recently purchased the Art of Shaving set and followed up with this Awesome razor to complete the experience, it is a wonderful shaving tool, well balanced, well made, handle is easy to hold onto even with wet hands, easy to use, and beautiful to behold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like going back in time for me, and the experience has been wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>Love having inexpensive blades.</li>
            <li>And I absolutely love it, I was a bit nervous trying it out, but I had no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li>for later on, heard good things about them and the price was great.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more.</li>
            <li>best razor, ever, I should have bought this years ago when I started growing whiskers, you only need ONE BLADE to shave.</li>
            <li>The matte finish gives it an elegant look.</li>
            <li>The finish and build is top notch and</li>
            <li>Works excellent and is a big upgrade after using the plastic ones.</li>
            <li>I Love this thing.  </li>
            <li>Was shaving with a cheaper butterfly safety razor and this is sooo much better.</li>
            <li>The shipping time was excellent and I cant say enough about the quality of this razor.</li>
            <li>I still love it.</li>
            <li>The handle sets this apart from most.  </li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I have calloused finger tips from playing guitar.</li>
            <li>So much better.  </li>
            <li>Really cute boots.  </li>
            <li>The quality is top notch with a feel of a dentist tool or surgical instrument.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now able to shave every day if I want.</li>
            <li>Probably should change more</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The more blades, the more they clogged, the longer it took to shave.  </li>
            <li>For the money, I don&#x27;t think you can find a better razor.</li>
            <li>All finishes are excellent and the razor should out last me.</li>
            <li>I would love to extend that recommendation to</li>
            <li>Be sure to buy a shave brush (I got a Parker Badger model) -- to me that has been the biggest difference in my shave.</li>
            <li>and this is an outstanding razor for the price.</li>
            <li>It was a good choice, and I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to experience what a good shave is like!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor to anyone wanting a great shave.</li>
            <li>That said, many people consider Feathers to be the best blades around, so receiving them is a good value and might prove useful down the road.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to DE razors, watch some videos and take your time and you&#x27;ll have a great shave for a fraction of the cost of cartridges.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning: The razor is very easy to clean, coming apart in four separate pieces.</li>
            <li>I am using the Merkur stainless blades that came with this Great Razor and am very pleased with the whole purchase, Thank you Merkur you make</li>
            <li>This is an elegant finely made quality product.&lt;br /&gt;The handle and balance work well.  </li>
            <li>what a clean shave!.</li>
            <li>One or two passes on every part of my face and it&#x27;s clean!</li>
            <li>In fact it was the closest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>The matte finished handle is excellent and offers a great grip even when wet.</li>
            <li>I get a much more comfortable shave than I used to.  </li>
            <li>Blade changes are easy.</li>
            <li>I used the blade that came with the razor, no problems cleans so easy.</li>
            <li>The blades are easy to change.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to replace the blade</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a more traditional shave this is a great one to use</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and you irritate easily around your neck, it&#x27;s probably the razor you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product without reservations.</li>
            <li>I honestly look forward to shaving now and enjoy the shave and afterwards, where as with cartridges I loathed it very much and would try to go with out it for some time.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this razor thus far and would highly recommend it to anyone who is on the fence.  </li>
            <li>However, I find this product well made and accurate to the descriptions I read before purchasing.  </li>
            <li>My impressions are that it is solidly built, attractive, and its grip feels secure in the hand.</li>
            <li>I find I enjoy and even look forward to my shave each morning.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and change blades.  </li>
            <li>Not to be taken lightly however, you must follow the methods that are out there.</li>
            <li>Start at Astra if you want to be cheap.</li>
            <li>The tooling and attention to detail on all their safety razors is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>Never again will I buy a cheap disposable.</li>
            <li>The Merkur handle seems to be made of a combination of chrome and aluminum and is knurled lightly.</li>
            <li>The design on the handle is like a spiral around the entire handle of the razor, and makes holding onto it a great boon.</li>
            <li>Easy to keep clean</li>
            <li>Been using as my primary shaver.  </li>
            <li>Works great and have had no issues with various brands of blades.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now about a month in to my conversion to the DE razor world, and I must say I really enjoy the experience.</li>
            <li>It looks great, and feels nice and heavy.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, it took less than 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li>On my first two shaves with this razor no nics no irritation, and I actually enjoyed shaving.</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;ve been using an original Gillette Adjustable Butterfly Razor since 1998.</li>
            <li>First safety razor and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li>Unique handle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bummer since this is a new razor for me, so it would&#x27;ve been nice to get all 10 blades</li>
            <li>Switching from a Gillete Fusion, this was easier than I thought it would be, and with great results.&lt;br /&gt;Healthier, cheaper, more green; I see no downsides.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first safety razor, and at the time of this writing I&#x27;ve only shaved once with it; that one shave has been the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>The pictures just don&#x27;t do the handle justice, for while it looks really cool</li>
            <li>Find yourself good blades and never look back</li>
            <li>and he immediately loved it, I bout this with the following for him  </li>
            <li>I took that opportunity to put together a sweet surprise Valentine&#x27;s Day shaving kit.  </li>
            <li>Used best to get a good feel for how to shave with a safety razor, especially if you have some decent blades, but not aggressive enough to cause any real damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;Merkur Model 178 Classic Safety Razor, Straight&amp;#34; for 3 years now and enjoyed its close shaves.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this razor very much.  </li>
            <li>The first one I bought was a cheap one sold through the Shaving Factory.  </li>
            <li>it feels worth the extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped really fast, happy with the razor itself.</li>
            <li>Merkur Long Handled Razor is a good starter razor.  </li>
            <li>This is not balanced in my large hand, That is why I ordered the merkur long handled razor, now I&amp;#34;m happy .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to put in a new blade, and economical now!  </li>
            <li>But with a little guidance and some great hints, his second shave was nice and close and almost nick-free.  </li>
            <li>This razor has a nice weight to it and feels very solid and reliable in your hand.  </li>
            <li>Nicely and solidly constructed razor with medium agression.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely  love this old style of shaving</li>
            <li>I shave way more frequently now and look forward to doing so.  </li>
            <li>The handle provides a good grip when hands are wet or soapy.  </li>
            <li>This particular product also comes with a pack of 10 blades which are easily switched out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is good for a back up and its definitely much cheaper, but the cheaper in reality apply to the blades not the Handle.</li>
            <li>razor comes with a single sample blade that is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Just an excellent product--way, way better than the ridiculous multi-bladed junk that the American companies are producing nowadays.</li>
            <li>A SUPER close shave, but be gentle!</li>
            <li>It is longer than most other full-sized razors, and is well and fairly sharply textured for a secure grip even when covered with soap in the shower; this is a really great</li>
            <li>That is very important that you have a nice firm grip when shaving!  </li>
            <li>Twist the handle, comes right off, in three parts.  </li>
            <li>I was right.  </li>
            <li>The matte finish handle and the right amount of weight of this shaver giives it</li>
            <li>This is my first double edge razor and I am very impressed, an extremely well crafted razor.</li>
            <li>I use cartridges in general as with most people</li>
            <li>Comes with one Merkur super stainless razor blade.</li>
            <li>In summary, it shaves better from the very first stroke, offers a better sense of feeling even in wet soapy hands and reduces stress.</li>
            <li>I find this a bit too mild for my face, personally and will be moving onto a more aggressive razor (I&#x27;d recommend people who are interested in doing the same and getting a better shave go vintage).</li>
            <li>I like this razor very much.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different types of razors over the course of my life, but so far this is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy and a good long handle, haven&#x27;t cut myself yet!</li>
            <li>I love it and wouldn&#x27;t switch if someone gave me one of the other brands for free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not troubled either way.  </li>
            <li>I simply didn&#x27;t realize shaving was a challenge until I started using something better.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately the lighter weight, longer handle and better knurl make it easier to hold and control reducing my stress.  </li>
            <li>The whole experience is mind blowing!</li>
            <li>The money you will save not having to buy overpriced blades will more than justify the  initial purchase price.</li>
            <li>I was suspect at first, but then bought this razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li>to Shark or something of the same quality for a closer, more thorough, and cleaner shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still gives a better than generic razors though.  </li>
            <li>I now use a double edge razor on the first pass, doing most of the shaving.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie, the first time he shaved, he had the bloodiest neck ever.  </li>
            <li>The next time he shaved it was much better.  </li>
            <li>more switching back to cartridge razor.</li>
            <li>Love the finished of the material, the weight, how it feels on my hands, not to heavy not to lightly, simple as good.</li>
            <li>At first touch the quality is evident.  </li>
            <li>I was nervous at first when beginning to shave using this.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>I am used to more details and mechanistic safety razors where parts do not completely come apart with chance or loss with each blade change.</li>
            <li>I must admit that I am pretty hairy, with a fast growing beard, and change my Feather blade once a week.  </li>
            <li>The matte-finished Merkur is my first ever safety razor, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li>Once you have your razor, a box of a hundred blades average about ten cents each, and with a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I have large hands and the weight of the merkur 2 Pc.</li>
            <li>My glove size is large.</li>
            <li>It is very well made, attrative to look at, and easy to use,  If you want to return to the economy of a double edged blade and still get a close shave</li>
            <li>If its your first, second, third or fourth razor this is a great razor to have.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, I will be using it for years.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product as your first, safety razor.  </li>
            <li>Not just a touch up shave, but a full absolute clean shaven face every day of the year minus weekends and</li>
            <li>I followed several methods on YouTube, definitely need to do two passes, but the result is amazing</li>
            <li>; I can really appreciate the close shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how much easier shaving has became as a result of these features.</li>
            <li>I tried derby blades , but I really like the astro  100 pack blades .</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>and I have to say it is the very definition of Night and Day.</li>
            <li>my skin feels much smoother, cleaner, and not iritated at all after each shave.</li>
            <li>You can cut yourself much easier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I upgraded to this after wearing out a cheap $10 razor I purchased last year.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel the blade as much as I do on the Model 178.  </li>
            <li>It really seems to soften my beard and improves the shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>Takes getting used to because you get a really close shave.</li>
            <li>He was looking to get into a standard razor, like he used growing up and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>If you need tips on how to shave with this razor, you should absolute read that article.</li>
            <li>Very cost effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this style of shaving, and this razor!</li>
            <li>weight of the razor is nice, not too hefty but definitely not light either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 2 blades, 3 blades, 4 blades, but this simple single blade system is hands down the best shave.</li>
            <li>I am now planning on purchasing a new higher end Merkur razor.</li>
            <li>In order to change blades it needs to be disassembled, there is not a way other than removing the top section to change blade.  </li>
            <li>Not really so difficult and the solid strength of the shaver is worth it.</li>
            <li>The stainless steel is highly polished and</li>
            <li>My dear sweet husband has a very coarse and prickly beard.  </li>
            <li>Had my first shave today, and while it takes longer than the old razor (Mach 3)</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy one size down.</li>
            <li>In this way, the disposable razor is lasting up to a month, since the cheaper double edge razors do most of the shaving.  </li>
            <li>(Not that I get a lot of nicks with my Classic model.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the look of this razor&#x27;s style and</li>
            <li>If you use shave soap, occasionally it will develop a cloudy film over the shiny parts; this is very easily wiped off with a dry</li>
            <li>Earth-friendly and wallet friendly in the long term.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have been using those drugstore Gilette razors since I started shaving in high school</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is truly a shock to me, since I used to despise shaving, whether using my high end Braun electric or a Mach 3 cartridge world.  </li>
            <li>I got this, some Taylor of Old Bond Street cream, a Marvy shaving mug, and  an Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a little longer than the Gillette yet knurled better than the Gillette.</li>
            <li>I love this little guy.</li>
            <li>It may take a little loner shaving with this safety razor but the results are much better.  </li>
            <li>Works great as an alternative to one of those expensive schick razors.</li>
            <li>I like the stylish look, and the heavy feel of it while shaving.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Function: Sometimes you can tell a solid peace of craftsmanship right away.</li>
            <li>Simple, sophisticated design and solid stainless steel will last me a lifetime.</li>
            <li>Still use it, feels like new</li>
            <li>Still, for the price, I don&#x27;t plan on dropping any coin for a new razor for years and years.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;ll be looking into buying new blades for it and I will go from there.  </li>
            <li>Another plus is the blades are so affordable it&#x27;s a wonder any of the new razors are in business.  </li>
            <li>While my electric Braun shaved adequately, I used it dry</li>
            <li>I was very cautious at first, since I had been warned, but I found this razor so much easier to use than my old Mach 3 that by the end of my shave I was working very confidently with no fear of cutting myself.</li>
            <li>Long handle is easy to use with big hands and you can&#x27;t beat the quality.</li>
            <li>After 30 years of paying high prices for replacement cartridges, I switched back to safety razor, where I first learned how to shaved with my dad&#x27;s old gillette safety razor.</li>
            <li>The first time my dad showed me how to shave he broke out one of the orange and white bics.</li>
            <li>This is my first, and probably the only safety razor I will ever need.</li>
            <li>I did go slow until I developed muscle memory on handling the new razor, but WOW what a good deal on the overall price and shaves!</li>
            <li>You can teach an old dog new tricks.  </li>
            <li>I was an avid Gillette user, and shaved with their products my entire adult life.</li>
            <li>The longer handle allows a different angle at certain areas of my face.  </li>
            <li>it feels even better; definitely not worried about using the razor with wet hands, the lines in the handle provide a lot of extra grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The aluminum handle is groved in such a way that it is very grippy.</li>
            <li>old school is the way to go.</li>
            <li>Bought this old school razor.  </li>
            <li>Then when I started reading about the old safety razors I figured why not give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back to a modern razor again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nearly identical to shaving with a disposable in action, but a faster cleaner shave is the end result.</li>
            <li>So far, Rust resistant</li>
            <li>I have had this razor since Christmas of last year and have yet to see any rust develop on it, despite my carelessness of not drying it more than a few times after use.</li>
            <li>It leaves me shopping for a new blade now, which takes a little fun out of the new \\&quot;toy\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>bought the razor from this particular listing because it included 10 extra blades.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd Merkur razor and I highly recommend these razors.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the long handle for balance.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and it was pretty rough looking.  </li>
            <li>Hard to imagine shaving is so easy, and OH BOY ,</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t go back to the new</li>
            <li>shave you get from an old school single blade is closer and far better than the over priced 4 blades that are dull after 3 shaves!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Well, I really like the weight and overall quality of the razor, but I&#x27;ve recently been noticing rust spots on the satin part of the handle.</li>
            <li>just didn&#x27;t seem to do any better for my thick facial hair</li>
            <li>Everybody should go back to the old ways of shaving!</li>
            <li>I only use my older Classic model when I want an extremely close shave.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I thought that the middle section might be plastic from the picture, and was pleasantly surprised that it is all metal.</li>
            <li>I am well in my 20&#x27;s now and I am embarrassed to admit that I barely just started using &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; razors.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected it to be and will last forever.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem with this DE is that if your skin is anything like mine (IE; you have a fairly tough hide), you&#x27;ll end up bearing down on the blade and putting far too much pressure on your face to get the shave you want, only resulting in cuts and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for finding out how to shave properly but there are more efficient DE&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li>However, the expense of cleaning the Braun (with the shaver cleaning solution) and buying a new screen and blade each year was more expensive than my current shaving solution.  </li>
            <li>I bought this Merkur based on the great reviews and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li>Not as heavy or substantial as one of the HD or Heavy Merkur razors, but it&#x27;s still solid in the hand and the extra long handle provides extra area to grip for those with large hands (or for those who just enjoy a longer handle).</li>

            <li> Not quite as good as my Edwin Jagger, but that razor is the pinnacle of quality and craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> Decided to get this Merkur shaver because of its good price and reputation for quality.  </li>
            <li> So, moving it up to 5 since this is a good value.</li>
            <li> This is not as good as March 3 or March 3+ shaving razor.  </li>
            <li> Being that I&#x27;d rather not fumble around with a tool designed to be literally razor-sharp, this is a good thing.</li>
            <li> It shaves exceptionally well and saves tons of money on blades.  </li>
            <li> i switch all the time trying the latest greatest and looking for something that will work better for me.</li>
            <li> It is well made and exceptionally sturdy.</li>
            <li> Merkur makes exceptional razors produced in Germany.</li>
            <li> Looks good and works even better!</li>
            <li> The razor looks great and shaves even better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great razor to my rotation, I don&#x27;t think that it will ever replace my Gillette adjustable&#x27;s as my favorite, but I do like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor.</li>
            <li> I started wetshaving with a Merkur HD, which is a great razor, but this is even better.  </li>
            <li> More passes are required though, to get a close shave, but the great thing is that there are also fewer nicks.</li>
            <li> I am so very glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Good quality, nice finish</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This razor is outstanding!</li>
            <li> I find myself actually enjoying shaving in the morning!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am really impressed with my first safety razor</li>
            <li> If you are a man who shaves, or you love a man who shaves - buy him this razor!  </li>
            <li> It feels great to use and also gives a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li> I use with persons blades, but the one that comes with this is also amazing.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing.</li>
            <li> The included blade is a nice boon, but I picked up some Astra blades ([[ASIN:B001QY8QXM B001QY8QXM]]</li>
            <li> The satin finish is nice because it doesn&#x27;t get slippery while shaving, but the rust is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> You know guys may stretch the truth from time to time but they will be candid when it comes to their shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice grip</li>
            <li> I honestly question how they care for it.</li>
            <li> It is has built in control with nice heft and balance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Design: I own the Matte version of this product.</li>
            <li> Fairly affordable upfront cost, bought a pack of 100 razors for $10 and gives me a better shave.</li>
            <li> Old school is best, better shave for a tenth the cost of premium disposables!</li>
            <li> Could not wait to get my razor, I am new to this style of shaving, I am impressed with the balance and weight of the razor.  </li>
            <li> However it is an stainless alloy with a hatch patter that gives a very good grip.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, my experience with the Merkur razor is excellent thus far.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly, the Merkur shaved better in one pass than the adjustable Gillette.</li>
            <li> The most honest review and the one that tipped the scales for me was the one by the sailor.</li>
            <li> I own a Gillette Fatboy, Parker, and Timor and this razor more than measures up.</li>
            <li> so I had some time to decide if I liked the bundled blade, or if there was another that suited me better.  </li>
            <li> Husband is thrilled and says it gives a better shave than the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; razors out there.</li>
            <li> IT has a nice weight, it&#x27;s easy to handle, it looks really nice.</li>
            <li> Perfectly balanced, just the right amount of weight, just the right blade angle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very smooth shave, although I think the Merkur blade that came with it doesn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li> I figured for under $30, this was an excellent opportunity to own a long handled Merkur without breaking the bank.  </li>
            <li> The handle has a super grip to it and just feels good in the hand.  </li>
            <li> The quality is top notch, weight is great, and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor, and I find it both a beautifully made item, and easy to use too.</li>
            <li> The shaver has good weight and with the way it curves the blade makes for smooth, easy shaving.</li>
            <li> what a great shaving experience I recently purchased the Art of Shaving set and followed up with this Awesome razor to complete the experience, it is a wonderful shaving tool, well balanced, well made, handle is easy to hold onto even with wet hands, easy to use, and beautiful to behold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like going back in time for me, and the experience has been wonderful!  </li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> Love having inexpensive blades.</li>
            <li> And I absolutely love it, I was a bit nervous trying it out, but I had no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> for later on, heard good things about them and the price was great.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s more.</li>
            <li> best razor, ever, I should have bought this years ago when I started growing whiskers, you only need ONE BLADE to shave.</li>
            <li> The matte finish gives it an elegant look.</li>
            <li> The finish and build is top notch and</li>
            <li> Works excellent and is a big upgrade after using the plastic ones.</li>
            <li> I Love this thing.  </li>
            <li> Was shaving with a cheaper butterfly safety razor and this is sooo much better.</li>
            <li> The shipping time was excellent and I cant say enough about the quality of this razor.</li>
            <li> I still love it.</li>
            <li> The handle sets this apart from most.  </li>
            <li> Not any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I have calloused finger tips from playing guitar.</li>
            <li> So much better.  </li>
            <li> Really cute boots.  </li>
            <li> The quality is top notch with a feel of a dentist tool or surgical instrument.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now able to shave every day if I want.</li>
            <li> Probably should change more</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The more blades, the more they clogged, the longer it took to shave.  </li>
            <li> For the money, I don&#x27;t think you can find a better razor.</li>
            <li> All finishes are excellent and the razor should out last me.</li>
            <li> I would love to extend that recommendation to</li>
            <li> Be sure to buy a shave brush (I got a Parker Badger model) -- to me that has been the biggest difference in my shave.</li>
            <li> and this is an outstanding razor for the price.</li>
            <li> It was a good choice, and I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to experience what a good shave is like!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor to anyone wanting a great shave.</li>
            <li> That said, many people consider Feathers to be the best blades around, so receiving them is a good value and might prove useful down the road.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to DE razors, watch some videos and take your time and you&#x27;ll have a great shave for a fraction of the cost of cartridges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning: The razor is very easy to clean, coming apart in four separate pieces.</li>
            <li> I am using the Merkur stainless blades that came with this Great Razor and am very pleased with the whole purchase, Thank you Merkur you make</li>
            <li> This is an elegant finely made quality product.&lt;br /&gt;The handle and balance work well.  </li>
            <li> what a clean shave!.</li>
            <li> One or two passes on every part of my face and it&#x27;s clean!</li>
            <li> In fact it was the closest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> The matte finished handle is excellent and offers a great grip even when wet.</li>
            <li> I get a much more comfortable shave than I used to.  </li>
            <li> Blade changes are easy.</li>
            <li> I used the blade that came with the razor, no problems cleans so easy.</li>
            <li> The blades are easy to change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to replace the blade</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a more traditional shave this is a great one to use</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you irritate easily around your neck, it&#x27;s probably the razor you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product without reservations.</li>
            <li> I honestly look forward to shaving now and enjoy the shave and afterwards, where as with cartridges I loathed it very much and would try to go with out it for some time.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this razor thus far and would highly recommend it to anyone who is on the fence.  </li>
            <li> However, I find this product well made and accurate to the descriptions I read before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> My impressions are that it is solidly built, attractive, and its grip feels secure in the hand.</li>
            <li> I find I enjoy and even look forward to my shave each morning.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and change blades.  </li>
            <li> Not to be taken lightly however, you must follow the methods that are out there.</li>
            <li> Start at Astra if you want to be cheap.</li>
            <li> The tooling and attention to detail on all their safety razors is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> Never again will I buy a cheap disposable.</li>
            <li> The Merkur handle seems to be made of a combination of chrome and aluminum and is knurled lightly.</li>
            <li> The design on the handle is like a spiral around the entire handle of the razor, and makes holding onto it a great boon.</li>
            <li> Easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> Been using as my primary shaver.  </li>
            <li> Works great and have had no issues with various brands of blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now about a month in to my conversion to the DE razor world, and I must say I really enjoy the experience.</li>
            <li> It looks great, and feels nice and heavy.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, it took less than 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li> On my first two shaves with this razor no nics no irritation, and I actually enjoyed shaving.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;ve been using an original Gillette Adjustable Butterfly Razor since 1998.</li>
            <li> First safety razor and I love it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li> Unique handle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bummer since this is a new razor for me, so it would&#x27;ve been nice to get all 10 blades</li>
            <li> Switching from a Gillete Fusion, this was easier than I thought it would be, and with great results.&lt;br /&gt;Healthier, cheaper, more green; I see no downsides.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first safety razor, and at the time of this writing I&#x27;ve only shaved once with it; that one shave has been the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> The pictures just don&#x27;t do the handle justice, for while it looks really cool</li>
            <li> Find yourself good blades and never look back</li>
            <li> and he immediately loved it, I bout this with the following for him  </li>
            <li> I took that opportunity to put together a sweet surprise Valentine&#x27;s Day shaving kit.  </li>
            <li> Used best to get a good feel for how to shave with a safety razor, especially if you have some decent blades, but not aggressive enough to cause any real damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;Merkur Model 178 Classic Safety Razor, Straight&amp;#34; for 3 years now and enjoyed its close shaves.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy this razor very much.  </li>
            <li> The first one I bought was a cheap one sold through the Shaving Factory.  </li>
            <li> it feels worth the extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped really fast, happy with the razor itself.</li>
            <li> Merkur Long Handled Razor is a good starter razor.  </li>
            <li> This is not balanced in my large hand, That is why I ordered the merkur long handled razor, now I&amp;#34;m happy .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to put in a new blade, and economical now!  </li>
            <li> But with a little guidance and some great hints, his second shave was nice and close and almost nick-free.  </li>
            <li> This razor has a nice weight to it and feels very solid and reliable in your hand.  </li>
            <li> Nicely and solidly constructed razor with medium agression.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely  love this old style of shaving</li>
            <li> I shave way more frequently now and look forward to doing so.  </li>
            <li> The handle provides a good grip when hands are wet or soapy.  </li>
            <li> This particular product also comes with a pack of 10 blades which are easily switched out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is good for a back up and its definitely much cheaper, but the cheaper in reality apply to the blades not the Handle.</li>
            <li> razor comes with a single sample blade that is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Just an excellent product--way, way better than the ridiculous multi-bladed junk that the American companies are producing nowadays.</li>
            <li> A SUPER close shave, but be gentle!</li>
            <li> It is longer than most other full-sized razors, and is well and fairly sharply textured for a secure grip even when covered with soap in the shower; this is a really great</li>
            <li> That is very important that you have a nice firm grip when shaving!  </li>
            <li> Twist the handle, comes right off, in three parts.  </li>
            <li> I was right.  </li>
            <li> The matte finish handle and the right amount of weight of this shaver giives it</li>
            <li> This is my first double edge razor and I am very impressed, an extremely well crafted razor.</li>
            <li> I use cartridges in general as with most people</li>
            <li> Comes with one Merkur super stainless razor blade.</li>
            <li> In summary, it shaves better from the very first stroke, offers a better sense of feeling even in wet soapy hands and reduces stress.</li>
            <li> I find this a bit too mild for my face, personally and will be moving onto a more aggressive razor (I&#x27;d recommend people who are interested in doing the same and getting a better shave go vintage).</li>
            <li> I like this razor very much.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different types of razors over the course of my life, but so far this is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy and a good long handle, haven&#x27;t cut myself yet!</li>
            <li> I love it and wouldn&#x27;t switch if someone gave me one of the other brands for free.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not troubled either way.  </li>
            <li> I simply didn&#x27;t realize shaving was a challenge until I started using something better.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately the lighter weight, longer handle and better knurl make it easier to hold and control reducing my stress.  </li>
            <li> The whole experience is mind blowing!</li>
            <li> The money you will save not having to buy overpriced blades will more than justify the  initial purchase price.</li>
            <li> I was suspect at first, but then bought this razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li> to Shark or something of the same quality for a closer, more thorough, and cleaner shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still gives a better than generic razors though.  </li>
            <li> I now use a double edge razor on the first pass, doing most of the shaving.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, the first time he shaved, he had the bloodiest neck ever.  </li>
            <li> The next time he shaved it was much better.  </li>
            <li> more switching back to cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> Love the finished of the material, the weight, how it feels on my hands, not to heavy not to lightly, simple as good.</li>
            <li> At first touch the quality is evident.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous at first when beginning to shave using this.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> I am used to more details and mechanistic safety razors where parts do not completely come apart with chance or loss with each blade change.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I am pretty hairy, with a fast growing beard, and change my Feather blade once a week.  </li>
            <li> The matte-finished Merkur is my first ever safety razor, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Once you have your razor, a box of a hundred blades average about ten cents each, and with a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I have large hands and the weight of the merkur 2 Pc.</li>
            <li> My glove size is large.</li>
            <li> It is very well made, attrative to look at, and easy to use,  If you want to return to the economy of a double edged blade and still get a close shave</li>
            <li> If its your first, second, third or fourth razor this is a great razor to have.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, I will be using it for years.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product as your first, safety razor.  </li>
            <li> Not just a touch up shave, but a full absolute clean shaven face every day of the year minus weekends and</li>
            <li> I followed several methods on YouTube, definitely need to do two passes, but the result is amazing</li>
            <li> ; I can really appreciate the close shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how much easier shaving has became as a result of these features.</li>
            <li> I tried derby blades , but I really like the astro  100 pack blades .</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> and I have to say it is the very definition of Night and Day.</li>
            <li> my skin feels much smoother, cleaner, and not iritated at all after each shave.</li>
            <li> You can cut yourself much easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this after wearing out a cheap $10 razor I purchased last year.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the blade as much as I do on the Model 178.  </li>
            <li> It really seems to soften my beard and improves the shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> Takes getting used to because you get a really close shave.</li>
            <li> He was looking to get into a standard razor, like he used growing up and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> If you need tips on how to shave with this razor, you should absolute read that article.</li>
            <li> Very cost effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this style of shaving, and this razor!</li>
            <li> weight of the razor is nice, not too hefty but definitely not light either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 blades, 3 blades, 4 blades, but this simple single blade system is hands down the best shave.</li>
            <li> I am now planning on purchasing a new higher end Merkur razor.</li>
            <li> In order to change blades it needs to be disassembled, there is not a way other than removing the top section to change blade.  </li>
            <li> Not really so difficult and the solid strength of the shaver is worth it.</li>
            <li> The stainless steel is highly polished and</li>
            <li> My dear sweet husband has a very coarse and prickly beard.  </li>
            <li> Had my first shave today, and while it takes longer than the old razor (Mach 3)</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy one size down.</li>
            <li> In this way, the disposable razor is lasting up to a month, since the cheaper double edge razors do most of the shaving.  </li>
            <li> (Not that I get a lot of nicks with my Classic model.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the look of this razor&#x27;s style and</li>
            <li> If you use shave soap, occasionally it will develop a cloudy film over the shiny parts; this is very easily wiped off with a dry</li>
            <li> Earth-friendly and wallet friendly in the long term.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using those drugstore Gilette razors since I started shaving in high school</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is truly a shock to me, since I used to despise shaving, whether using my high end Braun electric or a Mach 3 cartridge world.  </li>
            <li> I got this, some Taylor of Old Bond Street cream, a Marvy shaving mug, and  an Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little longer than the Gillette yet knurled better than the Gillette.</li>
            <li> I love this little guy.</li>
            <li> It may take a little loner shaving with this safety razor but the results are much better.  </li>
            <li> Works great as an alternative to one of those expensive schick razors.</li>
            <li> I like the stylish look, and the heavy feel of it while shaving.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Function: Sometimes you can tell a solid peace of craftsmanship right away.</li>
            <li> Simple, sophisticated design and solid stainless steel will last me a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Still use it, feels like new</li>
            <li> Still, for the price, I don&#x27;t plan on dropping any coin for a new razor for years and years.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ll be looking into buying new blades for it and I will go from there.  </li>
            <li> Another plus is the blades are so affordable it&#x27;s a wonder any of the new razors are in business.  </li>
            <li> While my electric Braun shaved adequately, I used it dry</li>
            <li> I was very cautious at first, since I had been warned, but I found this razor so much easier to use than my old Mach 3 that by the end of my shave I was working very confidently with no fear of cutting myself.</li>
            <li> Long handle is easy to use with big hands and you can&#x27;t beat the quality.</li>
            <li> After 30 years of paying high prices for replacement cartridges, I switched back to safety razor, where I first learned how to shaved with my dad&#x27;s old gillette safety razor.</li>
            <li> The first time my dad showed me how to shave he broke out one of the orange and white bics.</li>
            <li> This is my first, and probably the only safety razor I will ever need.</li>
            <li> I did go slow until I developed muscle memory on handling the new razor, but WOW what a good deal on the overall price and shaves!</li>
            <li> You can teach an old dog new tricks.  </li>
            <li> I was an avid Gillette user, and shaved with their products my entire adult life.</li>
            <li> The longer handle allows a different angle at certain areas of my face.  </li>
            <li> it feels even better; definitely not worried about using the razor with wet hands, the lines in the handle provide a lot of extra grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The aluminum handle is groved in such a way that it is very grippy.</li>
            <li> old school is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Bought this old school razor.  </li>
            <li> Then when I started reading about the old safety razors I figured why not give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to a modern razor again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly identical to shaving with a disposable in action, but a faster cleaner shave is the end result.</li>
            <li> So far, Rust resistant</li>
            <li> I have had this razor since Christmas of last year and have yet to see any rust develop on it, despite my carelessness of not drying it more than a few times after use.</li>
            <li> It leaves me shopping for a new blade now, which takes a little fun out of the new \\&quot;toy\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> bought the razor from this particular listing because it included 10 extra blades.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Merkur razor and I highly recommend these razors.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the long handle for balance.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and it was pretty rough looking.  </li>
            <li> Hard to imagine shaving is so easy, and OH BOY ,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go back to the new</li>
            <li> shave you get from an old school single blade is closer and far better than the over priced 4 blades that are dull after 3 shaves!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Well, I really like the weight and overall quality of the razor, but I&#x27;ve recently been noticing rust spots on the satin part of the handle.</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t seem to do any better for my thick facial hair</li>
            <li> Everybody should go back to the old ways of shaving!</li>
            <li> I only use my older Classic model when I want an extremely close shave.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I thought that the middle section might be plastic from the picture, and was pleasantly surprised that it is all metal.</li>
            <li> I am well in my 20&#x27;s now and I am embarrassed to admit that I barely just started using &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; razors.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected it to be and will last forever.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem with this DE is that if your skin is anything like mine (IE; you have a fairly tough hide), you&#x27;ll end up bearing down on the blade and putting far too much pressure on your face to get the shave you want, only resulting in cuts and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for finding out how to shave properly but there are more efficient DE&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> However, the expense of cleaning the Braun (with the shaver cleaning solution) and buying a new screen and blade each year was more expensive than my current shaving solution.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Merkur based on the great reviews and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy or substantial as one of the HD or Heavy Merkur razors, but it&#x27;s still solid in the hand and the extra long handle provides extra area to grip for those with large hands (or for those who just enjoy a longer handle).</li>
            <li> It is hard to explain, but it just feels right.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and so far seem to last two weeks with my shaving routine.</li>
            <li> Feathers are renowned for their superior sharpness, and are not often advised for newbie wet-shavers due to the risk of accidental cutting.</li>
            <li> It shaves very well with medium sharp to sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this razor, with even minimal care, will still be completely usable long after I&#x27;m gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Preferably I rather have March 3  razor blade as back up since either one will last a long time since it is being use just for touch up.</li>
            <li> Again a bit small for large hands.</li>
            <li> The razor I received came with a box of ten Feather blades and a single Merkur blade.</li>
            <li> works great, less irritation and a hell of lot cheaper than todays commercial crap.</li>
            <li> If I have a pimple or some raised bump, I naturally draw a little blood.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with a safety razor takes some practice and a light hand, but it&#x27;s not as scary as you might think.  </li>
            <li> Hearing the Merkur had a long handle made me think it would be like shaving with a rake.</li>
            <li> long .</li>
            <li> long .</li>
            <li> i have the long handle one for home and</li>
            <li> Being a beginer the Merkur has worked wonders for me and I will have this razor for a long time.</li>
            <li> Saving money in the long run..</li>
            <li> I used to use a safety razor a few years ago and then stopped when mine wouldn&#x27;t hold the blade correctly since it was old and worn out.</li>
            <li> So for day-to-day use, this newer Long Handled Merkur is my choice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There were other safety razors that were cheaper, but i chose Merkur because of its German engineering.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Quattros, Mach IIIs and various other razors.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a back-up razor and wondered if other Merkur models might provide a different experience.  </li>
            <li> If you are coming for Gillette March series or any other, I suggest you try buying a cheaper handle and try open blade system like this to see if you like it.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re making the transition to safety razors give yourself a couple shaves to learn the correct angle, buy a sample pack of blades to determine which ones you prefer and don&#x27;t try to dry shave.</li>
            <li> After every shave I take it apart to rinse, dry, and place it in a stand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for a few years and wanted to go old school.  </li>
            <li> He tried the single blade, the dual blade, the triple blades, and the quad blades.  </li>
            <li> This Long Handled Razor actually provides a smoother, less aggressive shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually amazing how much money you can save by shaving this way, compared to the crazy, expensive quad blades out there.  </li>
            <li> Now I can just pop in a new blade when I feel that the blade is getting the slightest bit dull.</li>
            <li> This razor should last till I pass it down to my grandson.</li>
            <li> This would&#x27;ve been a 4 or 5 star review, only down side was that it advertised that it came with 10 blades.</li>
            <li> The physical dimensions of the Merkur&#x27;s shaving head are also less bulky.</li>
            <li> with any three piece razor, slight tweaking of the blade exposure is needed on assembly to ensure that it is parallel to the bar and even on both sides.  </li>
            <li> though I&#x27;ve never held the fully chromed version - that the matte finish adds a little bit of extra friction to the grip as well.</li>
            <li> Wanting a closer shave and tired of paying the high prices for multi-blade cartridges, I took a chance and purchased the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor.  </li>
            <li> a truly great gift for anyone who shaves and buys those stupid disposable 5 blade razors!!</li>
            <li> More risk of cutting yourself, more irritation, and not as close shave or eased of use as you need to be delicate or risk cutting your face.  </li>
            <li> I too was persuaded to change from an electric shave to a wet shave by the article &amp;#34;How to Shave Like your Grandpa&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I also like the effect wet shaving is having on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The rep. further warned that I might &amp;#34;knick myself&amp;#34; a few times while I was transitioning from my Gillette razor, but this was not a danger at all.</li>
            <li> No problems when hands are wet</li>
            <li> I switched to a safety razor a few months ago and thought they were all the same.  </li>
            <li> so when you get your hands wet or when the razor is wet, of course, it stays well in your hands.  </li>
            <li> The product description did not specify the brand of blades that would be included, so I expected that the razor would come with Merkur-brand blades.</li>
            <li> Make no mistake, this razor is heavy for such a small thing, and the last thing you would want is for it to slip out of your hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not have experience with any other safety razor, so I cannot compare the experience.  </li>
            <li> You need some sharp razors for this handle.</li>
            <li> head &amp; the 3 7/8&amp;#34; handle is extremely well balanced.</li>
            <li> I am not proned to razor bumps or cuts but after using this style of shaving for a week i noticed i was having a lot of skin issues due to the cartridges.</li>
            <li> Ive had no issues or signs of rust and have used it every other day this about 6 months</li>
            <li> My only complaint is changing the blade is a precarious venture.  </li>
            <li> You really cant go wrong with any Merkur</li>
            <li> is down substantially.</li>
            <li> since I just plunked down $20 and stuck with it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to save money on razors as my budget grew tighter, so I picked up this model as it was few bucks under the other Merkur models while still having the longer handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, this is a Merkur 20C without the black color on the handle&#x27;s aluminum part.</li>
            <li> It shaves at about a medium aggressive, it&#x27;s not really mild, but not overly aggressive either, about a 6 or so in a Gillette adjustible for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may seem silly, but that little extra bit of visibility has also made shaving easier further reducing stress.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of shaving, my face is less irritated and softer.  </li>
            <li> I will also say that the pattern on the handle feels almost too grippy and a little</li>
            <li> He was so used to making 10+ passes with the disposable razors and using a lot of pressure that the learning curve with ther Merkur was a little steep.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble replacing the blade without getting little cuts on my finger tips from replacing the head.  </li>
            <li> Also a little harder to get under me nose, if you nose what I mean.</li>
            <li> I also thought the Merkur would be heavy and bulky.</li>
            <li> Medium aggressive when even, but you can adjust one side to \\&quot;mild\\&quot; with a thumbnail in a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> You will have to relearn to shave but after a few times you will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> After just a few uses I was sold.</li>
            <li> A few seconds in</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what my intuition says despite not having any experience with other safety razors before.  </li>
            <li> : Looks like the updated the description so it won&#x27;t be as confusing for other buyers.  </li>
            <li> Much closer than those very expensive, multi-blade products.  </li>
            <li> Disposable razors have a hard time cutting through anything longer than stubble and regularly get mucked up with long whiskers, but this doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Oh, and being part black used to mean shave bumps...</li>
            <li> No more throw aways.</li>
            <li> Like trying to shave with a small brass mallet.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m not sure why this is the &amp;#34;long handled&amp;#34; length.</li>
            <li> Nicks are so small that all bleeding stops by the time I&#x27;m done.)  </li>
            <li> I have no ingrown hairs, no razor burn, and I actually forget that there is hair growing on my neck for about a week, whereas with my previous razors, my neck was itchy, painful, and dotted with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> For me this combination is hard to beat .</li>
            <li> i was afraid the handle might be too short</li>
            <li> I am in the United States Navy which should tell you that I shave at least 261 days per year.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the included blades are always Feathers or if it&#x27;s just random, but it&#x27;s something to consider if you&#x27;re inexperienced.</li>
            <li> If two reviews by people who used to hate shaving isn&#x27;t enough...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not proud of this</li>
            <li> Again, false.</li>
            <li> Call it nostalgia, or just being bored with the chore of shaving.  </li>
            <li> Disposable razor blades are getting expensive.  </li>
            <li> This is one of those thing that wasn&#x27;t broken so you shouldn&#x27;t have tried to fix it!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you get it.</li>
            <li> I almost feel guilty giving it 4 out of 5, but I hesitate to give anything a 5 when I don&#x27;t have a basis of comparison.  </li>
            <li> It works and is a pleasure to use, nothing bad to say about it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Still use it, feels like new</li>
            <li> I switched to a safety razor from a Braun electric.  I too was persuaded to change from an electric shave to a wet shave by the article &amp;#34;How to Shave Like your Grandpa&amp;#34;.  Call it nostalgia, or just being bored with the chore of shaving.  At any rate, my experience with the Merkur razor is excellent thus far.  I find I enjoy and even look forward to my shave each morning.  I do not have experience with any other safety razor, so I cannot compare the experience.  However, I find this product well made and accurate to the descriptions I read before purchasing.  One note: on looking at the pictures online at Amazon, I assumed that the middle of the handle was ivory, or a material made to look like ivory.  In fact is is a brushed steel.  I&#x27;m not troubled either way.  The razor looks great and shaves even better.  While my electric Braun shaved adequately, I used it dry and it left my skin feeling chaffed.  I used a Nivea aftershave which worked well.  However, the expense of cleaning the Braun (with the shaver cleaning solution) and buying a new screen and blade each year was more expensive than my current shaving solution.  I also like the effect wet shaving is having on my skin.  After a few weeks of shaving, my face is less irritated and softer.  Nostalgia or reality, I am happier with shaving than I have been in  20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased a set of Personna blades.  The Merkur came with one blade and it seemed to shave well.  I also like the Personna blades.  They are sharp and so far seem to last two weeks with my shaving routine.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, well made product. Feels substantial in the hand. I love it! I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to try this type of shaving without spending a ton of money.</li>
            <li> It shaves exceptionally well and saves tons of money on blades.  Easy to clean and change blades.  Feels good in my hand and holds the blade at a great angle.</li>
            <li> Wanting a closer shave and tired of paying the high prices for multi-blade cartridges, I took a chance and purchased the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor.  It&#x27;s like going back in time for me, and the experience has been wonderful!  As I&#x27;m &amp;#34;older than dirt,&amp;#34; I can really appreciate the close shave I remembered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were other safety razors that were cheaper, but i chose Merkur because of its German engineering.  It was a good choice, and I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to experience what a good shave is like!</li>
            <li> Wish that pictures and diagrams outlined how this razor went together. I am used to more details and mechanistic safety razors where parts do not completely come apart with chance or loss with each blade change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this razor.  Blade changes are easy. Good grip.</li>
            <li> Could not wait to get my razor, I am new to this style of shaving, I am impressed with the balance and weight of the razor.  I followed several methods on YouTube, definitely need to do two passes, but the result is amazing, I will never go back to the disposable razors, (trust me tried them all) twenty years in the army and this is the trick to a great shave.  Not to be taken lightly however, you must follow the methods that are out there. On my first two shaves with this razor no nics no irritation, and I actually enjoyed shaving. I used the blade that came with the razor, no problems cleans so easy.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. Love having inexpensive blades. It is exactly what I expected it to be and will last forever. No more throw aways.</li>
            <li> And I absolutely love it, I was a bit nervous trying it out, but I had no problems whatsoever. The razor feels good in my hand, and it doesn&#x27;t tear or pull at any of my stubble while I&#x27;m shaving. In fact it was the closest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone, whether or not they&#x27;ve used a safety razor before. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is an elegant finely made quality product.&lt;br /&gt;The handle and balance work well.  The stainless steel is highly polished and solid.&lt;br /&gt;Should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I was an avid Gillette user, and shaved with their products my entire adult life. I wanted to save money on razors as my budget grew tighter, so I picked up this model as it was few bucks under the other Merkur models while still having the longer handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the razor is nice, not too hefty but definitely not light either. The pictures just don&#x27;t do the handle justice, for while it looks really cool it feels even better; definitely not worried about using the razor with wet hands, the lines in the handle provide a lot of extra grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first safety razor, and at the time of this writing I&#x27;ve only shaved once with it; that one shave has been the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced. The included blade is a nice boon, but I picked up some Astra blades ([[ASIN:B001QY8QXM B001QY8QXM]] for later on, heard good things about them and the price was great.</li>
            <li> good quality.  works as it should</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;ve been using an original Gillette Adjustable Butterfly Razor since 1998. I found it in an antique store. It works. I pull it across my whiskers. They&#x27;re cut off. Simple; that&#x27;s the way I like to keep things. Skipping the reasons for making this purchase, I&#x27;ll get to the review.  This razor is outstanding! I tested it against my Gillette by using the same blade. Meaning, I took the blade I had been using out of the Gillette and put that same blade into the Merkur. Amazingly, the Merkur shaved better in one pass than the adjustable Gillette. The Gillette is like shaving with a snowplow. The angle of the blade pushes my flesh away and drags the blade across my skin regardless of how it&#x27;s held or adjusted. The Merkur actually shaves.  There&#x27;s more. Hearing the Merkur had a long handle made me think it would be like shaving with a rake. Untrue. The handle is perfect. It&#x27;s just a little longer than the Gillette yet knurled better than the Gillette. I&#x27;m amazed at how much easier shaving has became as a result of these features. I simply didn&#x27;t realize shaving was a challenge until I started using something better.  I also thought the Merkur would be heavy and bulky. Like trying to shave with a small brass mallet. Again, false. It is lighter than the Adjustable Butterfly Gillette. Perhaps that&#x27;s because it has no moving parts. Ultimately the lighter weight, longer handle and better knurl make it easier to hold and control reducing my stress.  The physical dimensions of the Merkur&#x27;s shaving head are also less bulky. It may seem silly, but that little extra bit of visibility has also made shaving easier further reducing stress.  In summary, it shaves better from the very first stroke, offers a better sense of feeling even in wet soapy hands and reduces stress. Wouldn&#x27;t we all like to have something like that.</li>
            <li> best razor, ever, I should have bought this years ago when I started growing whiskers, you only need ONE BLADE to shave.</li>
            <li> Looking for a way to shave cheaper than disposables, I bought this and a sample pack of various razor blades to give it a try.  This razor has a nice weight to it and feels very solid and reliable in your hand.  I have no doubt that this razor, with even minimal care, will still be completely usable long after I&#x27;m gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re making the transition to safety razors give yourself a couple shaves to learn the correct angle, buy a sample pack of blades to determine which ones you prefer and don&#x27;t try to dry shave.</li>
            <li> The matte finish gives it an elegant look. It has a balanced feel, and shaves perfectly. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Find yourself good blades and never look back</li>
            <li> I love this little guy. I am finally seeing what all the hype of DE is! The whole experience is mind blowing! I find myself actually enjoying shaving in the morning!</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a gift from my girlfriend, who bought it for me for Christmas upon recommendation by a representative at Nordstrom. The rep. said it was the best thing going, and I can&#x27;t disagree. I am very impressed with the closeness and consistency of the shave, and pleased with the weight and feel of the razor. The rep. further warned that I might &amp;#34;knick myself&amp;#34; a few times while I was transitioning from my Gillette razor, but this was not a danger at all. I was very cautious at first, since I had been warned, but I found this razor so much easier to use than my old Mach 3 that by the end of my shave I was working very confidently with no fear of cutting myself. I strongly recommend this product without reservations.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this razor very much.  I switched form a fusion and a mach 3 to this safety razor, The shave is closer than the cartridge razors.  I shave my head along with my face and this razor gets the job dome without the irritation I would sometimes get with the cartridge razors.  It may take a little loner shaving with this safety razor but the results are much better.  The price of the razor shouldn&#x27;t deter you from taking the plunge.  The money you will save not having to buy overpriced blades will more than justify the  initial purchase price.</li>
            <li> You need some sharp razors for this handle. No derby. Start at Astra if you want to be cheap. Good starter for the price.</li>
            <li> This razor is excellent. The finish and build is top notch and weight is good in the hands. Again a bit small for large hands. Works excellent and is a big upgrade after using the plastic ones.</li>
            <li> This thing shaves like a rolls royce. Hard to imagine shaving is so easy, and OH BOY , what a clean shave!. I tried derby blades , but I really like the astro  100 pack blades . Price is good and so are the astro blades. For me this combination is hard to beat . The Merkur handle is 3 . 7/8 &amp;#34; long . I have large hands and the weight of the merkur 2 Pc. head &amp; the 3 7/8&amp;#34; handle is extremely well balanced. Before the merkur purchase I ordered  the Edwin Jagger L89. The edwin jagger is also well made, but the handle is 3 1/4&amp;#34; long . This is not balanced in my large hand, That is why I ordered the merkur long handled razor, now I&amp;#34;m happy . My glove size is large. I also ordered a 10 pack of the feather blades ,$ 3.46 cents  that are made in japan. I have not received them yet , so i don&#x27;t know the quality. but if the feather blades don&#x27;t work out I&#x27;ll stay with the astro brand. Thank You. ED.</li>
            <li> It is very well made, attrative to look at, and easy to use,  If you want to return to the economy of a double edged blade and still get a close shave this is the razor to use.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, this is a Merkur 20C without the black color on the handle&#x27;s aluminum part. I had to peel a sticker off of the barcode on the box but I don&#x27;t know how to decipher this barcode to get a model number. If anyone knows how please drop me a comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent three piece DE razor with the famous Merkur head. Mine has excellent plating, as I know this is a concern with some folks and Merkur. The aluminum handle is groved in such a way that it is very grippy. I would compare it to the surface of a medium wood file. the ends of the handle are chromed with the Merkur logo stamped on the bottom. It shaves very well with medium sharp to sharp blades. Mine likes the red Personnas, avoid the Derby&#x27;s with this one. It shaves at about a medium aggressive, it&#x27;s not really mild, but not overly aggressive either, about a 6 or so in a Gillette adjustible for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great razor to my rotation, I don&#x27;t think that it will ever replace my Gillette adjustable&#x27;s as my favorite, but I do like it a lot. It won&#x27;t ever be my daily driver but I give it a solid 9 out of 10.</li>
            <li> Great looking razor, feels great in the hand. No problems when hands are wet, the handle is great!! Paired this with Feather blades and Proraso Blue cream  and it&#x27;s shaving heaven. If you&#x27;re new to DE razors, watch some videos and take your time and you&#x27;ll have a great shave for a fraction of the cost of cartridges.</li>
            <li> i have the long handle one for home and the short handle one for travel. the best razors ever made. if you use a razor forget the 2, 3, 4 , 6 blade models a lot of hype. old school is the way to go. works great, less irritation and a hell of lot cheaper than todays commercial crap.</li>
            <li> Looks: This thing is beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics: The handle is the perfect length. In fact, I&#x27;m not sure why this is the &amp;#34;long handled&amp;#34; length. I don&#x27;t think I could use a regular sized length. I will also say that the pattern on the handle feels almost too grippy and a little abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function: Sometimes you can tell a solid peace of craftsmanship right away. This is one of those times. I thought this razor had the butterfly twist function to switch blades but it doesn&#x27;t. I checked the description and pictures and I must have seen it on another Merkur. Still, for the price, I don&#x27;t plan on dropping any coin for a new razor for years and years.</li>
            <li> Great razor.  Best shave ever and no nicks or cuts.  I Love this thing.  Was shaving with a cheaper butterfly safety razor and this is sooo much better.</li>
            <li> Excellent starter DE safety razor that will serve advanced as well as beginning DE shavers. The matte finished handle is excellent and offers a great grip even when wet. The shipping time was excellent and I cant say enough about the quality of this razor. I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> A week has gone by since I started shaving with the Safety Razor DE and I have to say it is the very definition of Night and Day. Now I used to shave with the 5 blade cartridges and have tried lower blade counts also. I am not proned to razor bumps or cuts but after using this style of shaving for a week i noticed i was having a lot of skin issues due to the cartridges. I use cartridges in general as with most people i switch all the time trying the latest greatest and looking for something that will work better for me. my skin feels much smoother, cleaner, and not iritated at all after each shave. I honestly look forward to shaving now and enjoy the shave and afterwards, where as with cartridges I loathed it very much and would try to go with out it for some time. Being a beginer the Merkur has worked wonders for me and I will have this razor for a long time.</li>
            <li> Well, I really like the weight and overall quality of the razor, but I&#x27;ve recently been noticing rust spots on the satin part of the handle. The satin finish is nice because it doesn&#x27;t get slippery while shaving, but the rust is unacceptable. I would recommend going with an all chrome razor for this reason.</li>
            <li> What a great razor. It feels great to use and also gives a fantastic shave. It is well made and exceptionally sturdy. A great piece of engineering. Should have got one of these years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have tried Quattros, Mach IIIs and various other razors.  I switched to a safety razor a few months ago and thought they were all the same.  The first one I bought was a cheap one sold through the Shaving Factory.  I contemplated the Merkur after reading online reviews and different sites on the web that discussed safety razor shaving. I also visited the retailer, Art of Shaving, in our local mall.  The guy there mentioned a safety razor as an alternative if you are proned to bumping.  I was suspect at first, but then bought this razor.  I love it and wouldn&#x27;t switch if someone gave me one of the other brands for free.  This along with the Derby blades is a plus.  My razor bump problems have improved 100%.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor. This is my first DE razor, and I find it both a beautifully made item, and easy to use too. Plus, I thought that the middle section might be plastic from the picture, and was pleasantly surprised that it is all metal. It works and is a pleasure to use, nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor for a while now. I still love it. A SUPER close shave, but be gentle! You can cut yourself much easier. Also a little harder to get under me nose, if you nose what I mean.</li>
            <li> First safety razor and I love it.  Have used several others since, but I always come back to my Merkur.  Great great purchase!</li>
            <li> Nicely and solidly constructed razor with medium agression.  The handle sets this apart from most.  It is longer than most other full-sized razors, and is well and fairly sharply textured for a secure grip even when covered with soap in the shower; this is a really great feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any three piece razor, slight tweaking of the blade exposure is needed on assembly to ensure that it is parallel to the bar and even on both sides.  Medium aggressive when even, but you can adjust one side to \\&quot;mild\\&quot; with a thumbnail in a few seconds.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The most honest review and the one that tipped the scales for me was the one by the sailor. Oh, and being part black used to mean shave bumps... Not any more. If two reviews by people who used to hate shaving isn&#x27;t enough... Good luck in your search and then come back and get this razor. I use with persons blades, but the one that comes with this is also amazing.</li>
            <li> Merkur makes exceptional razors produced in Germany. The tooling and attention to detail on all their safety razors is absolutely fantastic. This razor is no exception. The knurling on the handle is fantastic and provides a wonderfully grippy holding surface. Not as heavy or substantial as one of the HD or Heavy Merkur razors, but it&#x27;s still solid in the hand and the extra long handle provides extra area to grip for those with large hands (or for those who just enjoy a longer handle).</li>
            <li> The looks and quality of this safety razor are great, and you&#x27;ll save money on blades.  I don&#x27;t find that I get as close a shave, and I cut myself a couple times a week.  It&#x27;s not a big deal, though.  Shaving with a safety razor takes some practice and a light hand, but it&#x27;s not as scary as you might think.  My only complaint is changing the blade is a precarious venture.  I have trouble replacing the blade without getting little cuts on my finger tips from replacing the head.  I&#x27;m glad I have calloused finger tips from playing guitar.</li>
            <li> The blades are easy to change. The handle has the correct length and weight. The closeness of the shave is wonderful. You know guys may stretch the truth from time to time but they will be candid when it comes to their shave. I use the Merkur razor along with the Tribute shave cream and an shaving brush. I purchased all this on Amazon. I absolutely  love this old style of shaving and I know you will too.</li>
            <li> Great shave with 100 pack of Astra platinum blades no way am I going back to a multi blade razor</li>
            <li> This razor is perfect. Never again will I buy a cheap disposable. Nor one with replaceable heads. Earth-friendly and wallet friendly in the long term. Can&#x27;t praise these enough!</li>
            <li> This is my first double edge razor and I am very impressed, an extremely well crafted razor. The razor has a good grip and plenty of weight to it. It is hard to explain, but it just feels right. Very high quality, I will be using it for years. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Hello all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first safety razor.  I have been using those drugstore Gilette razors since I started shaving in high school so that&#x27;s all I could compare it to.  I am well in my 20&#x27;s now and I am embarrassed to admit that I barely just started using &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; razors.  All guys that have facial hair that needs to be shaved need to dump their convenience store razors and buy one of these now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur Long Handled Razor is a good starter razor.  At least that&#x27;s what my intuition says despite not having any experience with other safety razors before.  It&#x27;s really really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice grip so when you get your hands wet or when the razor is wet, of course, it stays well in your hands.  That is very important that you have a nice firm grip when shaving!  Always keep the blade very warm.  And shave in short strokes, and until you start feeling a bit of resistance, you need to rinse the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed with my first safety razor and I will never go back to those cheapo razors again.  It&#x27;s a very smooth shave, although I think the Merkur blade that came with it doesn&#x27;t do the job.  I&#x27;ve done a bit of research and I will have to be replacing the blade a.s.a.p. to Shark or something of the same quality for a closer, more thorough, and cleaner shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is great.  It&#x27;s just the Merkur blade that isn&#x27;t very good.  Still gives a better than generic razors though.  So much better.  It&#x27;s very easy to clean.  Twist the handle, comes right off, in three parts.  It&#x27;s so easy to replace the blade that anyone can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product as your first, safety razor.  The price is a great value.  Now, I&#x27;ll be looking into buying new blades for it and I will go from there.  I&#x27;m already eyeing the Edwin Jagger de89.</li>
            <li> Disposable razor blades are getting expensive.  Bought this old school razor.  The shave is not as close as disposable razors that have 3-5 blades, but it does cut the cost of shaving.  I use one double edge blade per week, at 10 cents a blade, you can see the savings.  I now use a double edge razor on the first pass, doing most of the shaving.  Then I perform a second pass with the more expensive disposable razors.  In this way, the disposable razor is lasting up to a month, since the cheaper double edge razors do most of the shaving.  Saving money in the long run..</li>
            <li> Really cute boots.  Make sure you buy one size down. I am a 9 and the 8 fit perfect.  I think I would weatherproof them</li>
            <li> In the picture the handle appears to be an ivory colour.  However it is an stainless alloy with a hatch patter that gives a very good grip.  The shaver has good weight and with the way it curves the blade makes for smooth, easy shaving.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing. I upgraded to this after wearing out a cheap $10 razor I purchased last year. The quality is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers complain about it rusting. I honestly question how they care for it. After every shave I take it apart to rinse, dry, and place it in a stand. Ive had no issues or signs of rust and have used it every other day this about 6 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use feather blades. I will never buy another disposable razor. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> If you are still using one of those 4-5, 10 razor things then you need to take a step back in time to the Merkur. The quality is top notch with a feel of a dentist tool or surgical instrument. The first time my dad showed me how to shave he broke out one of the orange and white bics. Now going from that to the Gillettes was a substantial upgrade. Then when I started reading about the old safety razors I figured why not give it a try. I&#x27;ll tell you know that I have I can&#x27;t go back to the new razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why people ever switched to disposable razors? This is one of those thing that wasn&#x27;t broken so you shouldn&#x27;t have tried to fix it!</li>
            <li> and he immediately loved it, I bout this with the following for him  [[ASIN:B00112WRB6 B00112WRB6]] [[ASIN:B0046MKF30 B0046MKF30]] [[ASIN:B001XURHNY B001XURHNY]] [[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW B0007MW2ZW]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000G647Y8 B000G647Y8]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0022R947O B0022R947O]]&lt;br /&gt; and he is more then happy! a truly great gift for anyone who shaves and buys those stupid disposable 5 blade razors!! If your looking for a gift for a man who shaves this is it!</li>
            <li> This is a breeze to use and it is a great product at a great price. It is has built in control with nice heft and balance. Simple, sophisticated design and solid stainless steel will last me a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I used to use a safety razor a few years ago and then stopped when mine wouldn&#x27;t hold the blade correctly since it was old and worn out. I didn&#x27;t think anyone was making them anymore until I found this one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I did! This is a great razor and a great price. Good quality, nice finish and I really like the long handle for balance.&lt;br /&gt;The shave you get from an old school single blade is closer and far better than the over priced 4 blades that are dull after 3 shaves!&lt;br /&gt;This razor comes with a single sample blade that is pretty good. You will have to relearn to shave but after a few times you will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;And the money you save on blades alone will blow you away!</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  I started wetshaving with a Merkur HD, which is a great razor, but this is even better.  Perfectly balanced, just the right amount of weight, just the right blade angle.  And the thing is beautiful as well.  Just an excellent product--way, way better than the ridiculous multi-bladed junk that the American companies are producing nowadays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a couple weeks now and it&#x27;s great.  I get a much more comfortable shave than I used to.  I&#x27;m now able to shave every day if I want.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor at the urging of a friend. After just a few uses I was sold. This is an excellent product and one which I would buy again. I am now planning on purchasing a new higher end Merkur razor. I&#x27;ll never go back to a modern razor again.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I would move to safety razors.  This actual product is well made but I went back to an electric razor combined with a disposable as this just didn&#x27;t seem to do any better for my thick facial hair no matter what brush, lathered soap/cream, or blade I used.</li>
            <li> I decided to pull the trigger on this razor after reading the reviews.  As most DE shavers I am always on the prowl for the elusive PERFECT razor. I own a Gillette Fatboy, Parker, and Timor and this razor more than measures up. I figured for under $30, this was an excellent opportunity to own a long handled Merkur without breaking the bank.  I was right.  The handle has a super grip to it and just feels good in the hand.  This is nothing too fancy, but the weight and balance are perfect and the blade gap is not overly aggressive.  I am very happy with this razor thus far and would highly recommend it to anyone who is on the fence.  Comes with one Merkur super stainless razor blade. Happy shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;Merkur Model 178 Classic Safety Razor, Straight&amp;#34; for 3 years now and enjoyed its close shaves.  Much closer than those very expensive, multi-blade products.  I wanted a back-up razor and wondered if other Merkur models might provide a different experience.  This Long Handled Razor actually provides a smoother, less aggressive shave.  I don&#x27;t feel the blade as much as I do on the Model 178.  More passes are required though, to get a close shave, but the great thing is that there are also fewer nicks. (Not that I get a lot of nicks with my Classic model.  It depends on the day or the condition of my skin, I guess.  If I have a pimple or some raised bump, I naturally draw a little blood.  Nicks are so small that all bleeding stops by the time I&#x27;m done.)  So for day-to-day use, this newer Long Handled Merkur is my choice.  I only use my older Classic model when I want an extremely close shave.  I must admit that I am pretty hairy, with a fast growing beard, and change my Feather blade once a week.  Probably should change more often.&lt;br /&gt;I also just discovered Proraso&#x27;s pre-shave moisturizer!  I never used a pre-shave before but am now a convert.  It really seems to soften my beard and improves the shaving experience.  You can teach an old dog new tricks.  Proraso&#x27;s after shave splash on is also great.</li>
            <li> Best shave I have ever had, with no razor burn and smooth feel closeness,  I shave way more frequently now and look forward to doing so.  I particularly like the look of this razor&#x27;s style and the feel it has while using it.  Another plus is the blades are so affordable it&#x27;s a wonder any of the new razors are in business.  Check out this article, it convinced me to switch to safety razors:  [...]</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. IT has a nice weight, it&#x27;s easy to handle, it looks really nice. I love it. If you&#x27;re looking for a more traditional shave this is a great one to use</li>
            <li> I like this razor very much.  Well balanced...i was afraid the handle might be too short but it is not ...&lt;br /&gt;its all great!!!</li>
            <li> My dear sweet husband has a very coarse and prickly beard.  It would take him about 30 minutes to shave with a disposable razor.  He tried the single blade, the dual blade, the triple blades, and the quad blades.  The more blades, the more they clogged, the longer it took to shave.  My brother-in-law has been using the safety razor for a while and he suggested that my hubby try it.  I took that opportunity to put together a sweet surprise Valentine&#x27;s Day shaving kit.  I got this, some Taylor of Old Bond Street cream, a Marvy shaving mug, and  an Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush.  I won&#x27;t lie, the first time he shaved, he had the bloodiest neck ever.  Nicks and cuts and blood and it was pretty rough looking.  The next time he shaved it was much better.  He was so used to making 10+ passes with the disposable razors and using a lot of pressure that the learning curve with ther Merkur was a little steep.  But with a little guidance and some great hints, his second shave was nice and close and almost nick-free.  Best of all, it took less than 10 minutes!  I wish I&#x27;d bought one of these for him years ago.  If you are a man who shaves, or you love a man who shaves - buy him this razor!  Oh, and it comes with a pack of 10 or so blades, so that is nice, too!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!! what a great shaving experience I recently purchased the Art of Shaving set and followed up with this Awesome razor to complete the experience, it is a wonderful shaving tool, well balanced, well made, handle is easy to hold onto even with wet hands, easy to use, and beautiful to behold. Great for those that would have the best tools of the trade. I am so very glad I made this purchase. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone wanting a great shave. I am using the Merkur stainless blades that came with this Great Razor and am very pleased with the whole purchase, Thank you Merkur you make Great Products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L.Murphey&lt;br /&gt;White House TN.</li>
            <li> Simply put, buy this system. I&#x27;ve used 2 blades, 3 blades, 4 blades, but this simple single blade system is hands down the best shave. I did go slow until I developed muscle memory on handling the new razor, but WOW what a good deal on the overall price and shaves! Going on 4 weeks using the &amp;#34;old fashion way&amp;#34; of shaving and no cuts. Buy it you will like it.</li>
            <li> A great starter razor, I&#x27;d say. Used best to get a good feel for how to shave with a safety razor, especially if you have some decent blades, but not aggressive enough to cause any real damage. I find this a bit too mild for my face, personally and will be moving onto a more aggressive razor (I&#x27;d recommend people who are interested in doing the same and getting a better shave go vintage). The biggest problem with this DE is that if your skin is anything like mine (IE; you have a fairly tough hide), you&#x27;ll end up bearing down on the blade and putting far too much pressure on your face to get the shave you want, only resulting in cuts and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for finding out how to shave properly but there are more efficient DE&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> So I habitually shave about every 2 to 3 weeks. I&#x27;m not proud of this but that&#x27;s the truth. Disposable razors have a hard time cutting through anything longer than stubble and regularly get mucked up with long whiskers, but this doesn&#x27;t! One or two passes on every part of my face and it&#x27;s clean! If you&#x27;re like me and you irritate easily around your neck, it&#x27;s probably the razor you&#x27;re using. Switch over to this and that goes away. It&#x27;s nearly identical to shaving with a disposable in action, but a faster cleaner shave is the end result.</li>
            <li> This razor shaves very good for not having 3,4 or 5 blades.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a bit longer compared to the multi bladed competitors but you&#x27;ll&lt;br /&gt;shave a good bit off your razor blade replacement budget.</li>
            <li> So will you if like using a double edge razor.  Takes getting used to because you get a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Long handle is easy to use with big hands and you can&#x27;t beat the quality. This razor should last till I pass it down to my grandson. Wish I had kept the Gillette my gave me when I started to shave. Old school is best, better shave for a tenth the cost of premium disposables!</li>
            <li> The finish on this razor is excellent. Not quite as good as my Edwin Jagger, but that razor is the pinnacle of quality and craftsmanship. The Merkur handle seems to be made of a combination of chrome and aluminum and is knurled lightly. For the money, I don&#x27;t think you can find a better razor. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I have to say I love it. Great quality. I like the fact that it has some weight to it, so as I&#x27;m shaving I let the razor sit on my face and glide without adding pressure so my face does not get irritated.</li>
            <li> After 30 years of paying high prices for replacement cartridges, I switched back to safety razor, where I first learned how to shaved with my dad&#x27;s old gillette safety razor. Decided to get this Merkur shaver because of its good price and reputation for quality.  Boy, I was amazed! I should have done this years ago! The matte finish handle and the right amount of weight of this shaver giives it the perfect handling everytime I shave. You can bet that this is it for me.&lt;br /&gt;No more switching back to cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> I have never had a cleaner shave in my life. I have no ingrown hairs, no razor burn, and I actually forget that there is hair growing on my neck for about a week, whereas with my previous razors, my neck was itchy, painful, and dotted with ingrown hairs. After learning the nuances of shaving with the Safety Razor, none of this is an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I might add that using a badger brush and shave soap is wonderful. Everybody should go back to the old ways of shaving!</li>
            <li> Had my first shave today, and while it takes longer than the old razor (Mach 3) it feels worth the extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped really fast, happy with the razor itself. This would&#x27;ve been a 4 or 5 star review, only down side was that it advertised that it came with 10 blades. Mine only came with the one that was inserted into the blade packaging. It&#x27;s a bummer since this is a new razor for me, so it would&#x27;ve been nice to get all 10 blades so I had some time to decide if I liked the bundled blade, or if there was another that suited me better.  It leaves me shopping for a new blade now, which takes a little fun out of the new \\&quot;toy\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Looks like the updated the description so it won&#x27;t be as confusing for other buyers.  So, moving it up to 5 since this is a good value.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Merkur razor and I highly recommend these razors.  The price was especially nice and was why I purchased this model.  It is my weekend razor.  The handle provides a good grip when hands are wet or soapy.  The razor spins as ones hand changes grip.  I used the Merkur blade that came with it and after 8 shaves I changed it out for my preferred blade and it is a great combination.  The longer handle allows a different angle at certain areas of my face.  All finishes are excellent and the razor should out last me.</li>
            <li> great razor I changed from a clam type safety razor this Merkur.  Always get a great shave and the number of nicks and cuts is down substantially.</li>
            <li> Love the finished of the material, the weight, how it feels on my hands, not to heavy not to lightly, simple as good.</li>
            <li> Switching from a Gillete Fusion, this was easier than I thought it would be, and with great results.&lt;br /&gt;Healthier, cheaper, more green; I see no downsides.</li>
            <li> At first touch the quality is evident.  In order to change blades it needs to be disassembled, there is not a way other than removing the top section to change blade.  Not really so difficult and the solid strength of the shaver is worth it.</li>
            <li> He was looking to get into a standard razor, like he used growing up and this fit the bill.  It has a great weight and finish, superior shave and you won&#x27;t break the bank in buying it.  It&#x27;s actually amazing how much money you can save by shaving this way, compared to the crazy, expensive quad blades out there.  Once you have your razor, a box of a hundred blades average about ten cents each, and with a great shave.  I&#x27;m told that there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but that there are lots of YouTube videos out there.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Husband is thrilled and says it gives a better shave than the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; razors out there. You won&#x27;t be sorry if you get it.</li>
            <li> I am in the United States Navy which should tell you that I shave at least 261 days per year. Not just a touch up shave, but a full absolute clean shaven face every day of the year minus weekends and any leave I may take. I am no stranger to shaving. I have used many different types of razors over the course of my life, but so far this is my absolute favorite. I was turned on to the Safety Razor by an article called, \\&quot;Learn How to Shave Like Your Grandpa,\\&quot; on The Art of Manliness. If you need tips on how to shave with this razor, you should absolute read that article. This review will focus on the product alone; not the absolutely wonderful experience of using a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design: I own the Matte version of this product. The only piece on it that isn&#x27;t shiny is the handle itself with the design on it. The design on the handle is like a spiral around the entire handle of the razor, and makes holding onto it a great boon. Make no mistake, this razor is heavy for such a small thing, and the last thing you would want is for it to slip out of your hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: The razor is very easy to clean, coming apart in four separate pieces. I have had this razor since Christmas of last year and have yet to see any rust develop on it, despite my carelessness of not drying it more than a few times after use. If you use shave soap, occasionally it will develop a cloudy film over the shiny parts; this is very easily wiped off with a dry towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consists of four solid parts: The handle, the blade head, the blade chasis, and the bottom weight. This particular product also comes with a pack of 10 blades which are easily switched out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this razor to several friends and shipmates. I would love to extend that recommendation to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;+ Solid construction&lt;br /&gt;+ Unique handle&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to keep clean&lt;br /&gt;+ Comes with 10 Mekur blades&lt;br /&gt;+ So far, Rust resistant&lt;br /&gt;+ Very cost effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- None.r /&gt;- None.</li>
            <li> Been using as my primary shaver.  Works great and have had no issues with various brands of blades.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now about a month in to my conversion to the DE razor world, and I must say I really enjoy the experience. This is truly a shock to me, since I used to despise shaving, whether using my high end Braun electric or a Mach 3 cartridge world.  I bought this Merkur based on the great reviews and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed. No complaints at all. It looks great, and feels nice and heavy.  I almost feel guilty giving it 4 out of 5, but I hesitate to give anything a 5 when I don&#x27;t have a basis of comparison.  I may come back and update this later.  Be sure to buy a shave brush (I got a Parker Badger model) -- to me that has been the biggest difference in my shave.</li>
            <li> I recently made the switch from cartridge type razors to the safety razor.  I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for a few years and wanted to go old school.  This razor totally fits the bill!  Nice and heavy and a good long handle, haven&#x27;t cut myself yet! Looks good and works even better!</li>
            <li> This is my first, and probably the only safety razor I will ever need. The quality is top notch, weight is great, and super easy to use. I was nervous at first when beginning to shave using this. A few seconds in and you&#x27;ll get the hang of it, just don&#x27;t apply any pressure! My face has never been smoother. I can get by with one blade per week, shaving every day! I highly recommend this style of shaving, and this razor!</li>
            <li> I like the stylish look, and the heavy feel of it while shaving.  It&#x27;s so easy to put in a new blade, and economical now!  I used to try and stretch out the use of my old tri-blades, as they were sooo expensive to replace, that I sacrificed a comfortable close shave for the thought of saving money.  Now I can just pop in a new blade when I feel that the blade is getting the slightest bit dull.</li>
            <li> You really cant go wrong with any Merkur and this is an outstanding razor for the price. If its your first, second, third or fourth razor this is a great razor to have.</li>
            <li> I bought for my husband 2 types of razors: Edwin and Merkur 180 for his choice and decision. without doubts, Edwin was winner .&lt;br /&gt;small addition information for your consideration: you have NOT return your Edwin Razor in case that you will wаnt to.</li>
            <li> Works great as an alternative to one of those expensive schick razors. Fairly affordable upfront cost, bought a pack of 100 razors for $10 and gives me a better shave.</li>
            <li> This is not as good as March 3 or March 3+ shaving razor.  More risk of cutting yourself, more irritation, and not as close shave or eased of use as you need to be delicate or risk cutting your face.  This is good for a back up and its definitely much cheaper, but the cheaper in reality apply to the blades not the Handle. So this handle is over price as I did not see why a piece of metal cost $20. However I think this $20 piece should last a lot time.  If you are coming for Gillette March series or any other, I suggest you try buying a cheaper handle and try open blade system like this to see if you like it.  Its not the same and the law does not allow to return it, even with Amazon great Customer care.  I have electric shaver and as great as mine are, I need to revisiting one or two places that it miss, so I use this razor just for that since I just plunked down $20 and stuck with it. Preferably I rather have March 3  razor blade as back up since either one will last a long time since it is being use just for touch up.</li>
            <li> The matte-finished Merkur is my first ever safety razor, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. My impressions are that it is solidly built, attractive, and its grip feels secure in the hand. I suspect - though I&#x27;ve never held the fully chromed version - that the matte finish adds a little bit of extra friction to the grip as well. Being that I&#x27;d rather not fumble around with a tool designed to be literally razor-sharp, this is a good thing. The matte finish was also a bit cheaper than full-chrome, another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the razor from this particular listing because it included 10 extra blades. The product description did not specify the brand of blades that would be included, so I expected that the razor would come with Merkur-brand blades. The razor I received came with a box of ten Feather blades and a single Merkur blade. Feathers are renowned for their superior sharpness, and are not often advised for newbie wet-shavers due to the risk of accidental cutting. That said, many people consider Feathers to be the best blades around, so receiving them is a good value and might prove useful down the road. I don&#x27;t know if the included blades are always Feathers or if it&#x27;s just random, but it&#x27;s something to consider if you&#x27;re inexperienced.</li>
