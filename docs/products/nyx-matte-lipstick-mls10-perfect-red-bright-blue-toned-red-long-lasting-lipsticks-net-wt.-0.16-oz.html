            <li>so that was very important to me.</li>
            <li>This is THE perfect red.</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>The best red matte lipstick!</li>

            <li>This lipstick is indeed the perfect red!</li>
            <li>I love this color....</li>
            <li>but I still love it.</li>
            <li>It has more of an orange hue to it.</li>
            <li>when applied on to the hand its perfect red but when applied on the lips it looks orange.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of Mac Ruby Woo.. LoVe it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t drying the way most matte lipsticks tend to be.</li>
            <li>OMG I absolutely love this lip color.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect red, just as it claims to be!!</li>
            <li>Love the lipstick.  </li>
            <li>One of the best shades of red out there.</li>
            <li>Very nice needs high gloss</li>
            <li>Though it took a while to deliver, it was worth the wait!!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lipstick I have ever used, and I highly recommend to all makeup lovers!</li>
            <li>The color fits perfectly wiyh my skin tone; not too bright of a red but just enough to make a statement.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t so red that it looks trashy &amp; gives a beautiful touch of color to the lips.</li>
            <li>Beautiful shade of red</li>
            <li>I never thought I could wear colors so bold before, but Nyx made me fall in love with color for my lips.</li>
            <li>it is super matt finish and did i mention it stays on all day!</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t smudge and</li>
            <li>This lipstick is a beautiful red color, and it&#x27;s true to the picture and the description.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s amazing, and i reccomend anyone to buy it!</li>
            <li>Its more blue toned which I love because it goes better with my paler skin.</li>
            <li>The colors are just as described, they stand out, unique, &amp; stays on.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the perfect deep red to fit my light skin tone.</li>
            <li>Color is a bright, true red.</li>
            <li>Color was true to description.  </li>
            <li>so it looks super RED but not too bright.</li>
            <li>It takes courage to wear such a bright color but it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li>I ordered the lipstick &amp;#34;Perfect Red&amp;#34;, being a little hesitant about the color because I&#x27;m very picky about my makeup, but when I received it I was thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li>Great pigment, even on dark skin.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying this brand of lipstick more often!</li>
            <li>Nice red color.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have light hair, green eyes and fair skin.</li>
            <li>Very exotic and not too dry.</li>
            <li>I always figured I&#x27;d never be able to wear red lips.</li>
            <li>It stays on for quite a while too and doesn&#x27;t disappear after kissing someone a couple times. ;)&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first red lipstick and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li>It also arrived a day earlier than scheduled for me. :)</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s review: Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast!</li>
            <li>it is my ultimate favorite.</li>
            <li>Purchase lip liner to keep it looking crisp.</li>
            <li>Exactly the right colour, applies well, stays on reasonably well.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new and found Nyx Lip products to be very user friendly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very high pigment.</li>
            <li>I much prefer Rimmel Show Off Lip Velvet in Burning Lava.</li>
            <li>Not orangy, but a nice deep, matte, red.</li>
            <li>Nice color, matte, deep red.  </li>
            <li>So far, my absolute favorites are Alabama (rich red) and Violet.</li>
            <li>The color is highly pigmented and pops on my lips.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look good on my pale, cool-toned skin or my partner&#x27;s dark warm-toned skin.</li>
            <li>This is nowhere near blue-based, it&#x27;s...awful.</li>
            <li>I have been told for years that I need a blue based red in order for my complexion to stay fair and not suddenly look pink after applying a red lip.</li>
            <li>Chill or is OK but not true blue red.</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful red with blue undertones for those of us with tan skinny can&#x27;t go wrong though it&#x27;s not long lasting it does dry your lips out</li>
            <li>I have very pale skin and have never been able to find a red lipstick that doesn&#x27;t make the outside of my mouth area look pink.</li>
            <li>I wish it lasted a little longer — it usually wears off after 2-3 hours where most people say this is an &amp;#34;all-day&amp;#34; wear.</li>

            <li> Long lasting !</li>
            <li> The color stays on for a long while.</li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t tried any other matte sticks) with a Deep Purple liner allover the lip underneath.</li>
            <li> It is a matte lipstick, but doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips and would probably stay on for days.</li>
            <li> its feels dry, but the lipstick not your lips like some lipsticks tend to do.</li>

            <li> not really matte in my opinion,</li>
            <li> but that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark skinned woman</li>
            <li> The texture is kinda sticky/dry, not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I just keep wearing it everyday.</li>
            <li> I am slowly working my way into every shade in this collection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just awful.</li>
            <li> a little bit disappointed with the colour.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> I have very pale skin and have never been able to find a red lipstick that doesn&#x27;t make the outside of my mouth area look pink. I have been told for years that I need a blue based red in order for my complexion to stay fair and not suddenly look pink after applying a red lip. Well folks, this shade of red is truly a blue based red. It looks amazing on me, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I always figured I&#x27;d never be able to wear red lips. Boy, was I wrong! This is THE perfect red. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t smudge and it&#x27;s long lasting.  The color fits perfectly wiyh my skin tone; not too bright of a red but just enough to make a statement.  I will definitely be buying this brand of lipstick more often!</li>
            <li> Long lasting ! I love the color. I don&#x27;t know about anyone else but it&#x27;s the perfect deep red to fit my light skin tone. Very exotic and not too dry. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it yet.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. Though it took a while to deliver, it was worth the wait!! Amazing color and great texture. I reccomend this for all ages. From children to elders because it looks great. I honestly feel like wearing it 24/7 and yes, even in pjs lol. Overall it&#x27;s amazing, and i reccomend anyone to buy it!</li>
            <li> The best red matte lipstick!</li>
            <li> I was hoping the shade was going to be a tad darker but that wasn&#x27;t the case. Gave it to my sister. Looks better on the lighter skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! I got it a few days ago and only had the chance to try it out once. But it goes on smooth and looks great. The pigment is great. Its more blue toned which I love because it goes better with my paler skin. It comes off easily, but I have yet to see if it is resistant to water, but I will soon!</li>
            <li> Nice red color. Looks great on my complexion. Doesn&#x27;t last the entire day, but it definitely serves its purpose.  I would order this product again.</li>
            <li> Exactly the right colour, applies well, stays on reasonably well. Doesn&#x27;t bleed when you&#x27;re eating or drinking. Great pigment, even on dark skin.</li>
            <li> Bright, brilliant, and perfect!</li>
            <li> This is literally THE perfect lipstick! I ordered the lipstick &amp;#34;Perfect Red&amp;#34;, being a little hesitant about the color because I&#x27;m very picky about my makeup, but when I received it I was thoroughly impressed. This lipstick is indeed the perfect red! It is pigmented a deep color red, with no orangey tones. It is a matte lipstick, but doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips and would probably stay on for days. Doesn&#x27;t come off when you drink or eat. This is by far the best lipstick I have ever used, and I highly recommend to all makeup lovers!</li>
            <li> Color is a bright, true red. It&#x27;s very high pigment. It takes courage to wear such a bright color but it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li> I love this color.... It looks really good on myself who is light and my sister who is a darker shade..... I just keep wearing it everyday.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. not really matte in my opinion, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> It has more of an orange hue to it. when applied on to the hand its perfect red but when applied on the lips it looks orange. a little bit disappointed with the colour.</li>
            <li> Arrived 11/8, as promissed!</li>
            <li> This color is perfect. It isn&#x27;t so red that it looks trashy &amp; gives a beautiful touch of color to the lips. I&#x27;m a dark skinned woman so that was very important to me. I love it. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is a beautiful red color, and it&#x27;s true to the picture and the description. It stays on for quite a while too and doesn&#x27;t disappear after kissing someone a couple times. ;)&lt;br /&gt;This is my first red lipstick and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - It also arrived a day earlier than scheduled for me. :)</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s review: Exactly what I wanted. The colors are just as described, they stand out, unique, &amp; stays on.</li>
            <li> Very nice needs high gloss though</li>
            <li> Lipstick is red. It feels like its gonna stay on for hours. its feels dry, but the lipstick not your lips like some lipsticks tend to do. really nice color and the feeling on the lips</li>
            <li> I hoped it would be a bit darker on my lips but it&#x27;s definitely red. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick! It arrived fast! Very happy!</li>
            <li> Color was true to description.  I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color.. Loved</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Mac Ruby Woo.. LoVe it</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a blue-based red, go with Nyx Matte Lip Cream in Copenhagen (I haven&#x27;t tried any other matte sticks) with a Deep Purple liner allover the lip underneath. This is nowhere near blue-based, it&#x27;s...awful. It&#x27;s really just awful. Doesn&#x27;t look good on my pale, cool-toned skin or my partner&#x27;s dark warm-toned skin. Maybe there&#x27;s someone in between who would look good in it, but...I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li> Lasting.  Almost through a meal</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;She loves that it lasts all day. I&#x27;m glad she likes it! Good choice&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not as dry as a matte should be. Chill or is OK but not true blue red.</li>
            <li> Beautiful shade of red</li>
            <li> Perfect!! The color stays on for a long while.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Nyx Matte Lipsticks! The feel is creamy and glides on effortlessly. It isn&#x27;t drying the way most matte lipsticks tend to be. The color is highly pigmented and pops on my lips. I am slowly working my way into every shade in this collection. So far, my absolute favorites are Alabama (rich red) and Violet. For reference, I have light hair, green eyes and fair skin. And have always worn nude type shades on my lips. I wanted to try something new and found Nyx Lip products to be very user friendly.  I never thought I could wear colors so bold before, but Nyx made me fall in love with color for my lips.</li>
            <li> OMG I absolutely love this lip color. it is the truest blue red that has all day staying power! it is my ultimate favorite. it is super matt finish and did i mention it stays on all day! superb and came in  2 days</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful red with blue undertones for those of us with tan skinny can&#x27;t go wrong though it&#x27;s not long lasting it does dry your lips out but amazing matte color</li>
            <li> This is the perfect red, just as it claims to be!! The matteness does dry my lips out but that was to be expected. I wish it lasted a little longer — it usually wears off after 2-3 hours where most people say this is an &amp;#34;all-day&amp;#34; wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product but I don&#x27;t like the consistency.  It&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> Giving it five stars because it&#x27;s a blue tone red so it looks super RED but not too bright. Perfect for dressing up ✴ ✴</li>
            <li> Love the lipstick.  I have worn it with and without lipgloss. It lasts all day !!! I love the way it feels against my lips !!!</li>
            <li> The texture is kinda sticky/dry, not very comfortable. I much prefer Rimmel Show Off Lip Velvet in Burning Lava.</li>
            <li> One of the best shades of red out there. Not orangy, but a nice deep, matte, red.</li>
            <li> Nice color, matte, deep red.  Purchase lip liner to keep it looking crisp.</li>
