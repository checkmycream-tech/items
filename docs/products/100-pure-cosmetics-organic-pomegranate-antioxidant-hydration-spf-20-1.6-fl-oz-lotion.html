            <li>The best things are the ones closest to nature.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the best part is...</li>
            <li>I mix it with my makeup before applying for best sunscreen and coverage benefits.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t consider this product very effective at moisturizing</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t consider this product very effective at moisturizing</li>
            <li>I will say that in the morning my skin looks good, however, I now have to purchase another moisturizer for use in the morning.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen is good for my hands not for my face.</li>
            <li>So, I figured their moisturizer was just as good.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;ll have to be on the hunt for a replacement moisturizer, and that&#x27;s not an easy task!!</li>
            <li>it has a very interesting flagrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging--The pump bottle is nice looking and hygienic</li>
            <li>The number of  ingredients in this product is about 11 or 12 mostly of herb extracts, but are these ingredients really necessarily good for my face?</li>
            <li>The number of  ingredients in this product is about 11 or 12 mostly of herb extracts, but are these ingredients really necessarily good for my face?</li>
            <li>Although I would have loved the slightest bit of fragrance, it&#x27;s probably better for my skin that it doesn&#x27;t have any.  </li>
            <li>Out of all the moisturizers with spf that I have tried, this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I have an oily nose and forehead but the rest of my face is normal/sensitive and can get flaky in the winter when the weather is more dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works like a charm! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the ingredients, lightweight texture, and its consistency.  </li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Love how it has a pump in the tube -</li>
            <li>you ok?</li>
            <li>While this cream isn&#x27;t the most moisturizing, more mattifying, I balance it out with a rich night cream.</li>
            <li>and I heard really good things about 100% Pure products.</li>
            <li>They always smell delicious, have only natural (identifiable) ingredients, and work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I love this SPF cream for its rich antioxidants and smoothing texture.</li>
            <li>Well done 100% Pure!!!  </li>
            <li>Unless I find a better organic line, I&#x27;m now a loyal customer.  </li>
            <li>As the others have mentioned, it&#x27;s light, spreads easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly under Aveda Inner Light Mineral Foundation, and stays nicely throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The original was perfect-smooth and blended perfectly with little product.</li>
            <li>I hope they see the customer feedback and return to the original formula</li>
            <li>I love anything from the 100% Pure lineup.</li>
            <li>The lotion doesn&#x27;t smell like pomegranates or essential oils or anything good.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to get my money&#x27;s worth by being able to squeeze every last bit of product out.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, doesn&#x27;t have any white-ish residue, and soaks in properly...</li>
            <li>assuming that the same would hold true, but I was fairly disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>--Sure this product is all natural but I realized natural does not mean good or even safe because all compounds should be treated as chemicals.</li>
            <li>I mainly chose this product because I was looking for good natural moisturizer/sunscreen for the day time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients--Sure this product is all natural but I realized natural does not mean good or even safe because all compounds should be treated as chemicals.</li>
            <li>Great packaging, no prob shipping and even a little free sample of a 6ml face lotion that I prob wont be using as I&#x27;m diehard 100% Pure products but will pass on to someone who would like to try it.</li>
            <li>But for everyday use, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes well, and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s made with natural products.    </li>
            <li>and I continue to like it very much.</li>
            <li>This is the purest and best formula out there for SPF daily facial moisturizer, no worries on breakouts, no residual zinc oxide on face after application and knowing your skin will drink natural product w/o chemicals or toxins is very reassuring.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and after the lotion dries out from being greasy, it feels really light on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked for products that have healthy ingredients such as this.</li>
            <li>After unscrewing the top, simply use an emery board (disposable nail file) to scoop out what you need.</li>
            <li>I do plan on trying their argan oil moisturizer with a higher SPF of 30.</li>
            <li>Please be aware though that it is sold in a 1.6 oz size instead of 2.0 ounces as listed.</li>
            <li>I tried it several times, and it doesn&#x27;t get any better...</li>
            <li>First time I wore it, my boyfriend comes home and says: &amp;#34;are</li>
            <li>, I love the ingredients and the description but the actual product was not for me</li>
            <li>I recently received a facial cleanser from the same company and I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I used to love this facial hydration product and used it for over two years.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of 100% Pure products for a while now.  </li>
            <li>Pure really needs to rethink the change, because I will no longer purchase this.</li>
            <li>Not what I expected for 100% pure, I usually love their products.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this product after much research on the EWG&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>I understand with higher spf products, like sunblock, that it&#x27;s rather normal.</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews I was excited but after using this product for 3 months, I think it does not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Effectiveness--I am assuming the lotion does a good job of blocking UV rays but as for moisturizing properties, it&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your face shiny or white.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes that this stuff would go in and not leave me looking like &amp;#34;white face&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a product for the face with high spf, and antioxidants.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If I was on the beach or playing sports in the sun, I&#x27;d go for something more heavy duty.</li>
            <li>I can only apply it overnight because by morning it has absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>it is kind of expensive, but definitely worth.</li>
            <li>Only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is b/c I&#x27;d like it if it was even higher spf.</li>
            <li>I usually like 100% pure products as they are free of a lot of things I don&#x27;t want in my skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try 100% pure&#x27;s argan oil lotion with spf next to give the company another chance.e bottle.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try 100% pure&#x27;s argan oil lotion with spf next to give the company another chance.</li>
            <li>But recently 100% Pure changed</li>
            <li>For example, cyanide is found naturally in peach pits and apple seeds.</li>
            <li>For example, cyanide is found naturally in peach pits and apple seeds.</li>
            <li>I had to spend quite a bit of time completely rubbing the lotion in for it to disappear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ONLY setback is that DERMSTORE needs to get their product information online straight as when paying $26 bucks for 2 ounces it should be 2 OUNCES not the 1.6 OUNCES that is shipped to you.</li>
            <li>I find that a better way to buy skincare products is to buy products with as few ingredients as possible.</li>
            <li>I find that a better way to buy skincare products is to buy products with as few ingredients as possible.</li>
            <li>I use it over Mad Hippie Vitamin C serum, but until recently I used it on its own which was fine too.</li>
            <li>one I use right now is by Pur~lisse SPF 30 Essential Daily Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is extremely light and contains very little if any fragrance.  </li>
            <li>so I really only use this on my face and use Alba Very Emollient SPF 30 facial sunscreen on neck and decolletage, which also provides richer moisture.</li>
            <li>You look super pale and pasty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive and acute sense of smell), does not absorb easily, or not at all, and it leaves my face pale and white like a geisha!</li>
            <li>I previously used the argan oil spf30 and it was a little on the greasy side, but after a little bit it would be absorbed and it was ok.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s packaging from glass to plastic, reduced the content from 2.0 fl oz to 1.6 fl oz and (apparently) also revamped the formula.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I love the idea behind this product, I don&#x27;t know that it is for me.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product for a very long time, bought through The Vitamin Shoppe until the company (100% Pure) went through some FDA changes for SPF in product licensing along with internal licensing for their company, which took this product off the shelf for about 4 months.</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s free of parabens and other dangerous chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Prior to the change, this product was creamy, smooth and a little went a long way.</li>
            <li>This new formula is terrible-sticky and dry.</li>
            <li>I found 2 pumps dispensed too little product to cover my face and 3 was too much.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just wanted to warn you all ... The product description states 2 ounces but the bottle I received only contains 1.6 ounces.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Amazon (not a third party seller) and received the 2 fl oz bottle. I mainly chose this product because I was looking for good natural moisturizer/sunscreen for the day time. After reading all the positive reviews I was excited but after using this product for 3 months, I think it does not live up to the hype. I also like to mention I have combination/sensitive/problem skin. I have an oily nose and forehead but the rest of my face is normal/sensitive and can get flaky in the winter when the weather is more dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging--The pump bottle is nice looking and hygienic but I don&#x27;t like the pump itself. The pump dispenses product in a tiny line. I found 2 pumps dispensed too little product to cover my face and 3 was too much. It also doesn&#x27;t help that the product is on the greasy side so I don&#x27;t like to use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency--The product feels somewhat greasy and sticky. It&#x27;s not so bad as those lotions that make my face feel like it&#x27;s sweating after I put it on but I definitely would prefer a drier feeling lotion. I wish this lotion made my face feel silkier, not sticky. It goes on clear and after the lotion dries out from being greasy, it feels really light on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell--The lotion doesn&#x27;t smell like pomegranates or essential oils or anything good. It smells sort of like liquid concealer or foundation probably due the sunscreen powders put in this lotion. I don&#x27;t care for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness--I am assuming the lotion does a good job of blocking UV rays but as for moisturizing properties, it&#x27;s no good. Going into winter months, I used this lotion everyday and my skin is still dry and flakey at places. It doesn&#x27;t break me out but it didn&#x27;t help to even my skin tone or brighten my complexion either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price/Value--This lotion&#x27;s more on the expensive side for me (any facial moisturizer over $10 is expensive to me) but the bottle does last a long time. I&#x27;ve used this lotion almost everyday for 3 months and I&#x27;ve only gone through half the bottle. However, I don&#x27;t consider this product very effective at moisturizing so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients--Sure this product is all natural but I realized natural does not mean good or even safe because all compounds should be treated as chemicals. For example, cyanide is found naturally in peach pits and apple seeds. I find that a better way to buy skincare products is to buy products with as few ingredients as possible. That way, there is less chance of an ingredient irritating my skin. The number of  ingredients in this product is about 11 or 12 mostly of herb extracts, but are these ingredients really necessarily good for my face? After all, I noticed no results in improved skin with the use of this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I would not buy this product again or recommend it because it is a somewhat greasy facial moisturizer with no obvious benefits. Maybe I&#x27;ll try 100% pure&#x27;s argan oil lotion with spf next to give the company another chance.e bottle.

            <li> As the others have mentioned, it&#x27;s light, spreads easily and smoothly. Non irritating and with virtually no scent.   I&#x27;ve looked for products that have healthy ingredients such as this. I&#x27;ve finally found the product I&#x27;ve been searching for.   Update 11-7-2011: I am still using this and I continue to like it very much. In response to a couple of others comments, I have ordered this twice now and have received both times the 1.6 OZ (50 ML) size glass bottle. I HOPE they have made a larger size (2 OZ) as that 10 ML difference could extend usage. BTW, 10 ML&#x27;s is 2 Teaspoons.   As for the glass container being undesirable. Glass doesn&#x27;t have any toxins unlike plastics do. I&#x27;ll take glass any day over plastics.   Here is a tip for getting out the rest sitting at the bottom. After unscrewing the top, simply use an emery board (disposable nail file) to scoop out what you need. Works like a charm! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an organic moisturizer that I can become addicted to.  I absolutely love the ingredients, lightweight texture, and its consistency.  It glides onto my skin with ease and doesn&#x27;t leave the white film like a couple of other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried do.  Although I would have loved the slightest bit of fragrance, it&#x27;s probably better for my skin that it doesn&#x27;t have any.  Tube packaging, as opposed to a glass pump, would have earned the fifth star from me.  I would have liked to get my money&#x27;s worth by being able to squeeze every last bit of product out.  Unless I find a better organic line, I&#x27;m now a loyal customer.  I do plan on trying their argan oil moisturizer with a higher SPF of 30.</li>
            <li> This is the only chemical-free SPF moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried that doesn&#x27;t make you look like a ghost. It moisturizes well, and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s made with natural products.    Only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is b/c I&#x27;d like it if it was even higher spf. Like 30 or 45.    But for everyday use, it&#x27;s great. If I was on the beach or playing sports in the sun, I&#x27;d go for something more heavy duty.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer leaves a heavy white residue on my face. I can only apply it overnight because by morning it has absorbed into my skin. I will say that in the morning my skin looks good, however, I now have to purchase another moisturizer for use in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love anything from the 100% Pure lineup. I can wear this moisturizer without any worries of my baby boy being exposed to harmful chemicals. The best things are the ones closest to nature.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. Love how it has a pump in the tube - like the feel of it. I like to use organic products and this was top-rated. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Out of all the moisturizers with spf that I have tried, this one is by far the best.  It is extremely light and contains very little if any fragrance.  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your face shiny or white.  I also love that it&#x27;s free of parabens and other dangerous chemicals.  Well done 100% Pure!!!  Please be aware though that it is sold in a 1.6 oz size instead of 2.0 ounces as listed.</li>
            <li> This new formula is terrible-sticky and dry. The original was perfect-smooth and blended perfectly with little product. I hope they see the customer feedback and return to the original formula or I&#x27;ll have to be on the hunt for a replacement moisturizer, and that&#x27;s not an easy task!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m vegan and I heard really good things about 100% Pure products. Maybe it&#x27;s because of the SPF, but this lotion does not soak in the way I would like it to. It is also rather sticky and leaves this white-ish residue on your skin. Oh, and the best part is... it has a very interesting flagrance. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it really... it has this rotten stench about it. I tried it several times, and it doesn&#x27;t get any better... I just had to throw away an almost-full bottle... a total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I use right now is by Pur~lisse SPF 30 Essential Daily Moisturizer. It smells good, doesn&#x27;t have any white-ish residue, and soaks in properly... it is kind of expensive, but definitely worth.</li>
            <li> I waited a year for this product to come back into stock. Unfortunately, the wait was not worth it. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin AT ALL and left it feeling tight and crusty. I&#x27;ll use it in the summer over a different moisturizer just for the sun protection.</li>
            <li> it leaves your face white.  I am going to try there other products because I like the fact there isn&#x27;t anything nasty in the sunscreen.  The sunscreen is good for my hands not for my face.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after much research on the EWG&#x27;s website. It&#x27;s amazing- I mix it with my makeup before applying for best sunscreen and coverage benefits. Will keep purchasing!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this stuff would go in and not leave me looking like &amp;#34;white face&amp;#34;.  Unfortunately it white-faced me if you know what I mean... Unless you don&#x27;t mind having white stuff on your face, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> This product does not blend well, and leaves a white film on your skin which even shows through make-up.  I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Chalky, dry and tuns me white.  Not what I expected for 100% pure, I usually love their products.  I am sticking with with DeVita Solar Protective Moisturizer.  It is creamy and doen&#x27;t change your skin color</li>
            <li> I love this SPF cream for its rich antioxidants and smoothing texture. I use it over Mad Hippie Vitamin C serum, but until recently I used it on its own which was fine too. It is quite expensive for the quantity so I really only use this on my face and use Alba Very Emollient SPF 30 facial sunscreen on neck and decolletage, which also provides richer moisture. While this cream isn&#x27;t the most moisturizing, more mattifying, I balance it out with a rich night cream. It works amazingly under Aveda Inner Light Mineral Foundation, and stays nicely throughout the day. If you have a darker complexion this might not be the one for you as it does leave a thin, white film.</li>
            <li> I usually like 100% pure products as they are free of a lot of things I don&#x27;t want in my skin. However, this one, for some reason, doesn&#x27;t do the trick for me. I previously used the argan oil spf30 and it was a little on the greasy side, but after a little bit it would be absorbed and it was ok. This one has the weirdest smell (for me at least.. I have a very sensitive and acute sense of smell), does not absorb easily, or not at all, and it leaves my face pale and white like a geisha! First time I wore it, my boyfriend comes home and says: &amp;#34;are you ok? You look super pale and pasty&amp;#34;. For a men to notice this, you can imagine how I must have looked! Not sure what to do about it... I wish I could return it or exchange it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product for the face with high spf, and antioxidants. However, this product made my face look dry, when it isn&#x27;t and also look like I had a sunburn, which I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I kinda didn&#x27;t like how this looks like sunblock and makes your face look white, I have to add cream or oil to my face to blend the white from the product. I didn&#x27;t like it, I love the ingredients and the description but the actual product was not for me</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this moisturizer. I recently received a facial cleanser from the same company and I&#x27;m very happy with the product. So, I figured their moisturizer was just as good. Yeah, no! Especially if you plan on wearing foundation. This stuff goes on so dry and very white. I had to mix some night time cream into my face with this moisturizer just to get it to absorb into my skin. I understand with higher spf products, like sunblock, that it&#x27;s rather normal. But this is advertised as a MOISTURIZER, so the assumption would be that it would blend easier. I have to go back to using my Alba sea moss moisturizer with spf 15. Yeah, it&#x27;s not as protective but at least I don&#x27;t look like a ghost when I apply it.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of 100% Pure products for a while now.  They always smell delicious, have only natural (identifiable) ingredients, and work wonderfully.  I purchased this Pomegranate Antioxidant Hydration SPF 20 assuming that the same would hold true, but I was fairly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like pomegranate (the scent is definitely a combination between rosemary and thyme).  Secondly, it goes on incredibly thick - it left my face white and pasty which was certainly not the look I was going for.  I had to spend quite a bit of time completely rubbing the lotion in for it to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Though I love the idea behind this product, I don&#x27;t know that it is for me.  Yes, my skin did feel moisturized, but I don&#x27;t know that I can spend 15 minutes rubbing my moisturizer in each morning.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a very long time, bought through The Vitamin Shoppe until the company (100% Pure) went through some FDA changes for SPF in product licensing along with internal licensing for their company, which took this product off the shelf for about 4 months. Finally back in production and I found the product on Amazon through Dermstore, which packaged and sold it promptly. This is the purest and best formula out there for SPF daily facial moisturizer, no worries on breakouts, no residual zinc oxide on face after application and knowing your skin will drink natural product w/o chemicals or toxins is very reassuring. The ONLY setback is that DERMSTORE needs to get their product information online straight as when paying $26 bucks for 2 ounces it should be 2 OUNCES not the 1.6 OUNCES that is shipped to you. Great packaging, no prob shipping and even a little free sample of a 6ml face lotion that I prob wont be using as I&#x27;m diehard 100% Pure products but will pass on to someone who would like to try it. I would order again from this company I just hope they make the proper changes on what your paying for in quantity.</li>
            <li> I used to love this facial hydration product and used it for over two years. But recently 100% Pure changed it&#x27;s packaging from glass to plastic, reduced the content from 2.0 fl oz to 1.6 fl oz and (apparently) also revamped the formula. Prior to the change, this product was creamy, smooth and a little went a long way. It is now sticky and slightly chalky leaving a faint white residue on my face and takes much more for my face to feel remotely hydrated. 100% Pure really needs to rethink the change, because I will no longer purchase this.</li>
