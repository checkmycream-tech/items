            <li>but thats probably my own fault so That wont go against the company.</li>
            <li>I never used Coconut Oil of any kind, I like Coconut</li>
            <li>Use it as a Conditioner, Place Jar in warm water to Liquefy, then apply 2 teaspoons to the Hair 1 to 2 Hours before Washing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>love this stuff - can use it on skin, hair and cooking</li>
            <li>What is not to love?</li>
            <li>Love this coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t cook with it, because it has too many calories, but I use it on my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>So many uses for coconut oil....</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try more of the many purposes.</li>
            <li>And it turned to be better than I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in love with the product.</li>
            <li>Comes in a sealed jar, and the aroma is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>It has helped me feel better.</li>
            <li>so make sure you have a scoop or something and don&#x27;t do what I do</li>
            <li>Love this coconut oil, feels light and not at all oily.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil is hands down the best moisturizer for hair and skin.</li>
            <li>Great stuff - interesting texture that starts out a bit more dense than petroleum jelly and then with not much heat, turns quickly to oil (that is, after pulling out a chunk with your finger, you have about 4 seconds to figure out what to do with it).    </li>
            <li>I have used many different types of coconut oil and this is the most creamy and easy to use at room temperature.</li>
            <li>but I really like this one the most</li>
            <li>I like the slightly sweet taste that it adds to meats and veggies when I am sauteing.</li>
            <li>I have also applied it to my Face, made it Nice and Soft...</li>
            <li>Coconut Oil is a Good addition to my Physical Activity Exercise and Weight Loss Programs.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and smells nice.</li>
            <li>and it liquifies quickly in my hands.</li>
            <li>Quick service.</li>
            <li>Adsorbs fast, has nice light fragrance and makes skin so soft without making it too oily.</li>
            <li>This brand is nice because it is not very greasy - it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of fun to open up the jar and see what it&#x27;s doing.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not a whole lot to say about it, really - it&#x27;s just great.  </li>
            <li>I have some in my cart right now as I have used this stuff up.</li>
            <li>This has a lovely sweet coconut scent, especially when it&#x27;s liquid (when ambient temperatures are warmer).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s moisturizing but not sticky , absorbed very fast .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, goes on nice and light and leaves her skin so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Coconut Oil is a Natural Energy Source, it contains High Levels of Healthy type of</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Terrific, what more can I say.  </li>
            <li>Other times I love it!</li>
            <li>but it solidifies really easily (especially in the winter when we use it most) -</li>
            <li>Smooth, clearly organic, and a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>This was the first coconut oil I have ever bought, so I had no issues with it.</li>
            <li>Fat called MCTs \\&quot;Medium Chain Triglycerides\\&quot; Pure Form of Coconut Oil, MCTs are different from other Fats primarily because they are digested much more easily and efficiently.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and very hydrated!!</li>
            <li>so I will update this a little more later on when Ive had some more time to use it.</li>
            <li>I use coconut oil for my psorisis and it works really well.</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t know much about coconut oil</li>
            <li>This makes them an extremely efficient Energy Source much more than Sugar.</li>
            <li>: Use it as a Moisturizing Lotion, Place Jar in warm water to Liquefy, Massage small amounts onto the Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>use it for cooking, mainly baking, in some salads and also on my skin and hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I recently ordered a different brand which I like much more, mainly for the consistency.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say about the weight because I am eating normally and not dieting.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the shower and put it all over my body right before I do a final rinse.</li>
            <li>The oil itself is fantastic - a little goes a long way, has a very light smell, and keeps all of us (from ages 37 to 6 months) more comfortable in the cold Northeast winters.</li>
            <li>I decided to try a new one and bought this to give it a go.</li>
            <li>Just be careful to store it below about 75 degrees F, as it will turn to a jar full of oil if you don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I like the Pure Extra Virgin Coconut Oil to the point that has become a Staple in my Kitchen! ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solid and can be stirred into a very creamy texture.  </li>
            <li>Cooling it back down should pull it back into its more manageable, firmer state.    </li>
            <li>Organic, Extra Virgin, decent price, subscribe and save, glass container????</li>
            <li>I tried it first in a bottle which was a disaster because I couldn&#x27;t get the last third out.</li>
            <li>works very well on my fett, which become extremely dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>Oh well, I hope it is BPA free at least, but I couldn&#x27;t see that indicated anywhere?  </li>
            <li>The seller was very professional and very fast in delivery of an extraordinary creme Organic Fiji Cold Pressed Certified Organic Coconut Oil, 13-Ounce Jars&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>

            <li> The seller was very professional and very fast in delivery of an extraordinary creme Organic Fiji Cold Pressed Certified Organic Coconut Oil, 13-Ounce Jars&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s a solid, other times liquid</li>
            <li> It arrived faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> You can definitely taste the coconut, but it&#x27;s subtle enough that you can hide it.</li>
            <li> And it has done wonders to stop the outbreaks of eczema without the need for steroids or other drugs.</li>
            <li> I have ordered other coconut oils</li>
            <li> Other days I just have a tablespoon in the morning.</li>
            <li> and I use it in my hair at night about every other week.</li>
            <li> you can mix with some other body cream.</li>
            <li> Use it in Place of Butter, Margarine, Shortening or other Cooking Oils, for Baking or Frying in Temperatures up to 350F</li>
            <li> Also MCTs don&#x27;t add to Fat Cells or form Artery Hardening Plaque as readily as other Fats.</li>
            <li> but there in lies the problem, I was hoping from the image in the listing that this coconut oil was packaged in glass, but alas it arrived in a black plastic container, with the safety seal damaged nonetheless, so I had to send it back.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that \\&quot;Organic Fiji Cold Pressed Certified Coconut Oil\\&quot; is congealed into a Thick White Paste with the aroma of Coconut.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s colder it is very hard</li>
            <li> Too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in quality as a body lotion.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Used up very quickly!</li>

Smells amazing (if you like coconut)!</li>
            <li> This has a lovely sweet coconut scent, especially when it&#x27;s liquid (when ambient temperatures are warmer). When it&#x27;s colder it is very hard but I can scrape it out and it liquifies quickly in my hands. I love putting it on after a shower and it keeps my body warmer when I step out of the shower. Keeps my skin moisturized all day!</li>
            <li> love this stuff - can use it on skin, hair and cooking</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil for my psorisis and it works really well. I decided to try a new one and bought this to give it a go. I didn&#x27;t realize that it would be fractionated oil but thats probably my own fault so That wont go against the company. Asides from that this oil smells really REALLY good!! I will be using this daily so I will update this a little more later on when Ive had some more time to use it. But overall...I like this oil a lot!!</li>
            <li> Our dermatologist recommended coconut oil for my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  She has been using it now for almost 6 months and her skin is beautiful.  She loves this Fiji coconut oil.  It&#x27;s not too heavy, goes on nice and light and leaves her skin so soft and smooth.  And it has done wonders to stop the outbreaks of eczema without the need for steroids or other drugs.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this coconut oil.  What is not to love? Organic, Extra Virgin, decent price, subscribe and save, glass container???? but there in lies the problem, I was hoping from the image in the listing that this coconut oil was packaged in glass, but alas it arrived in a black plastic container, with the safety seal damaged nonetheless, so I had to send it back.  Oh well, I hope it is BPA free at least, but I couldn&#x27;t see that indicated anywhere?  So, if you are looking at this listing hoping to get coconut oil in a glass container, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have used many different types of coconut oil and this is the most creamy and easy to use at room temperature. I keep it in the shower and put it all over my body right before I do a final rinse. It leaves my skin soft and very hydrated!!</li>
            <li> Love this coconut oil. It was exactly what I wanted. I have ordered other coconut oils but I really like this one the most</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t cook with it, because it has too many calories, but I use it on my hair and skin. works very well on my fett, which become extremely dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as oil pulling, a mouth rinse in the morning.  As soon as I opened the jar, by the next morning it was solidified.  I use it to saute vegtables, it&#x27;s great for that.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my baby girl&#x27;s eczema problem which it didn&#x27;t help so ended up drinking it. Taste good that even my hubby who cringe at the thought of ingesting it, took a spoon with his coffee and he loves it now!</li>
            <li> Love this!  So many uses for coconut oil.... both internal and external!  Can&#x27;t wait to try more of the many purposes.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in 100 degree temperatures and I immediately refrigerated.  2 hours later I used it to remove my makeup, brush my teeth and used as deodorant after shower.  Terrific, what more can I say.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> Best I have tried...so smooth and creamy....great taste....and great on the skin!</li>
            <li> It arrived faster than I expected. And it turned to be better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love with the product. Adsorbs fast, has nice light fragrance and makes skin so soft without making it too oily.</li>
            <li> Comes in a sealed jar, and the aroma is overwhelming.  It&#x27;s solid and can be stirred into a very creamy texture.  I use it on my body and I consume it as well.  Love it!</li>
            <li> We bought this for our birds, yes our birds! Lol&lt;br /&gt;It works great on everything.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in quality as a body lotion.</li>
            <li> Excellent if you want the coconut flavor.  But for me it limits it&#x27;s usage.  Somethings you just don&#x27;t want tasting like coconut.  Other times I love it!</li>
            <li> Too expensive.  I just found 78 oz of this stuff at Costco for $23.99.</li>
            <li> Love this coconut oil, feels light and not at all oily. I use it for my hair and skin the best part is it smells nice so I can leave it in my hair without getting a headache from the smell. There are a lot of coconut oils to choose from I like that this one is fair trade certified.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  And it smells SO &amp;#34;Coconutty&amp;#34;.  I have some in my cart right now as I have used this stuff up.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! I use it as a moisturizer. Very light and pleasant coconut scent.</li>
            <li> The seller was very professional and very fast in delivery of an extraordinary creme Organic Fiji Cold Pressed Certified Organic Coconut Oil, 13-Ounce Jars&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Great product.  Quick service.</li>
            <li> I use this in my oatmeal and some mornings in my coffee. Other days I just have a tablespoon in the morning. It has helped me feel better. Can&#x27;t say about the weight because I am eating normally and not dieting. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve oil pulled with this, used it on my skin, my hair and I have another jar that I use in lieu of olive oil.  I like the slightly sweet taste that it adds to meats and veggies when I am sauteing.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and on everything!! It works as a great lotion and I use it in my hair at night about every other week. (wear a cap on your head so your pillow doesnt get oily)</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is hands down the best moisturizer for hair and skin. It&#x27;s also a great diaper area ointment. This brand is nice because it is not very greasy - it absorbs very quickly. I tried it first in a bottle which was a disaster because I couldn&#x27;t get the last third out. So now I am trying the jar. It is definitely easier to get the stuff out of the jar but it solidifies really easily (especially in the winter when we use it most) - so make sure you have a scoop or something and don&#x27;t do what I do which is try to scoop it out with your fingers.  The oil itself is fantastic - a little goes a long way, has a very light smell, and keeps all of us (from ages 37 to 6 months) more comfortable in the cold Northeast winters. Don&#x27;t bother with moisturizers - just use this.</li>
            <li> This was a great price, &amp; very healthy to cook with!!</li>
            <li> Love this brand of coconut oil!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a whole lot to say about it, really - it&#x27;s just great.  Smooth, clearly organic, and a lot of it.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> This is a great and versatile product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for cooking, mainly baking, in some salads and also on my skin and hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would like to note that I CAN taste it in the dishes, especially fried ones. So if you do not like coconut flavor on your meat/chicken/veggies consider frying with something else.</li>
            <li> Great for so many things, including animal rehabilitation.  I use this for wounds and skin issues for animals.  Great results, including scar healing.</li>
            <li> This was the first coconut oil I have ever bought, so I had no issues with it. It arrived promptly and I used it for cooking/beauty products. However, I recently ordered a different brand which I like much more, mainly for the consistency. This one is the consistency of a vegetable oil, while the one I just ordered is a white solid which can be melted down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t know much about coconut oil, so I&#x27;m assuming they are different types in some way, but I wanted to give a heads up to the coconut oil novices like me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s moisturizing but not sticky , absorbed very fast . you can mix with some other body cream. haven&#x27;t try to use it to cook yet coz I bought it for body care . recommended .</li>
            <li> I never used Coconut Oil of any kind, I like Coconut but I am not a Big Fan. I was surprised to see that \\&quot;Organic Fiji Cold Pressed Certified Coconut Oil\\&quot; is congealed into a Thick White Paste with the aroma of Coconut. An Oil that is good for just about everything, 1 Tablespoon has 120 Calories, I have used it in Baking and Cooking instead of Butter with excellent results and the taste of Coconut is not that noticeable. I have also applied it to my Face, made it Nice and Soft...Next I want to try it on my Scalp to see if it will grow Thicker Hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Oil is Recommended as a Supplement, Take 1 Tablespoon 1 to 4 times daily, maybe use it as a Spread or added to Salad Dressings and Smoothies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR COOKING: Use it in Place of Butter, Margarine, Shortening or other Cooking Oils, for Baking or Frying in Temperatures up to 350F degrees&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR SKIN CARE: Use it as a Moisturizing Lotion, Place Jar in warm water to Liquefy, Massage small amounts onto the Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR HAIR CARE: Use it as a Conditioner, Place Jar in warm water to Liquefy, then apply 2 teaspoons to the Hair 1 to 2 Hours before Washing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Oil is a Natural Energy Source, it contains High Levels of Healthy type of Fat called MCTs \\&quot;Medium Chain Triglycerides\\&quot; Pure Form of Coconut Oil, MCTs are different from other Fats primarily because they are digested much more easily and efficiently. This makes them an extremely efficient Energy Source much more than Sugar. Also MCTs don&#x27;t add to Fat Cells or form Artery Hardening Plaque as readily as other Fats. Coconut Oil is a Good addition to my Physical Activity Exercise and Weight Loss Programs. I like the Pure Extra Virgin Coconut Oil to the point that has become a Staple in my Kitchen! ...Thank You, D.D.</li>
            <li> Works well for my skin. I have an allergy to chlorine in water which causes my skin to itch immensely after I shower. I just rub on some of this oil after I shower works wonders. Makes my skin soft and smells nice.</li>
