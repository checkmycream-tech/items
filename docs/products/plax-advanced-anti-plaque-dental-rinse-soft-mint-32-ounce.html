            <li>/&gt;I could not be more impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brand has no sweetener unlike most store brands</li>
            <li>I believe in using a pre-rinse then brushing then using a mouthwash have not had a cavity in many years.</li>

            <li>Flavor is fine.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily before brushing my teeth with toothpaste to keep my teeth squeaky clean -- better than brushing alone -- and it tastes great.</li>
            <li>I have been using Plax for a month now and have noticed a huge difference.</li>

            <li>This product leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and clean after using.</li>
            <li>There is still some more that needs to come off, but my teeth are so much cleaner than they were.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t brush my teeth without using this first!  </li>
            <li>It is very hard to find a pre-rinse and was very happy to find Plax on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Plaque comes right off.</li>
            <li>In the first week of use I saw mini plaque bits falling out</li>
            <li>Bought this on the advise of my dental technician, to keep my teeth plaque free longer between professional cleanings.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking to remove plaque and would like to forego an expensive dental cleaning, Plax is your new best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this anti-plaque dental rinse so much that I purchase the twin-pack now for additional savings in cost.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am not going to go into my own mouth with the sharp tools and get any long term build-up off.</li>
            <li>I had heard about Plax, and people&#x27;s opinions seemed to fall into one of two camps:  (1) Plax is the best thing since sliced bread or (2)</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I was completely pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty expensive at the store, but buying two large bottles from Amazon with free shipping and no taxes helps with the cost.</li>
            <li>Long story short, it has actually been several years since someone has really cleaned my teeth well.</li>
            <li>I had become discouraged with various dental techs who would not clean my teeth very well.</li>

            <li> This stuff works! Plaque comes right off.</li>
            <li> I used to get a lot of plaque and tartar buildup on my teeth and would scrape them off constantly. After getting this product I rarely have any plaque buildup anymore! I love this! I found a video on YouTube recommending so I tried it, glad I did!</li>
            <li> Plax Advanced Anti- Plaque mouthwash removed the plaque I had in my teeth.It has also whiten my teeth as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great mouthwash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for products to get rid of the plaque behind my teeth for years. This stuff got rid of my plaque in about a week. I was completely pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone else in the house, I don&#x27;t have a lot of plaque myself. But I thought I&#x27;d try it. It is not \\&quot;soft\\&quot; mint! It burns like scary chemicals, not like hot peppers. I suppose it might eat away at plaque, I felt like my tongue was going to dissolve.</li>
            <li> I bought this rinse after visiting my dental office. I brush and floss every day and get dental check ups every six months. I bought this rinse to reduce my plague build up. This tastes great and keeps my breathe fresh and keeps my teeth plaque free.</li>
            <li> Was happy to find this product here at amazon. Works well</li>
            <li> This product actually works! In the first week of use I saw mini plaque bits falling out but I found that if you use a plaque scraper it comes off even faster. This is my second week of using it and majority of my plaque is gone. Only a few around my gum line on the back teeth....hard to reach. Overall one of the best products I have bought to date.</li>
            <li> I had become discouraged with various dental techs who would not clean my teeth very well. I have had my teeth cleaned over the years by some top notch dental techs and you know when you&#x27;re teeth are cleaned well. I do not have dental insurance so I try to space my cleanings out every 6 months or so. Long story short, it has actually been several years since someone has really cleaned my teeth well. I have been using Plax for a month now and have noticed a huge difference. Immediately, (within a week) when I would rinse with the Plax, I could see the plague or brownish colored tartar coming off my teeth. There is still some more that needs to come off, but my teeth are so much cleaner than they were.&lt;br /&gt;I will try to find, via referrals, a dentist office that has a good dental tech, because I do believe in professional check-ups and cleanings. I am not going to go into my own mouth with the sharp tools and get any long term build-up off. The Plax, however, is slowly helping to remove a lot of the build-up. I think everyone will have a different experience. I use the rinse twice a day, and brush after with my Sonicare toothbrush. I continue to floss and brush after I eat.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice a day for years; before I brush. I like the way it makes my mouth feel after. It&#x27;s pretty expensive at the store, but buying two large bottles from Amazon with free shipping and no taxes helps with the cost.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t brush my teeth without using this first!  I feel it removes a lot of tartar prior to brushing the teeth.</li>
            <li> Plax really works great!  Cleans your teeth as nothing else can do.  Flavor is fine.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Use before brushing your teeth and your dentist will be amazed as mine was. Keep on using at least once a day for all the build up.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on purchasing this product and glad i did. This product leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and clean after using.</li>
            <li> Plax 24oz is only 5.99 at Walgreens and a little less at Walmart.  This is 14.99 for 32 OZ.  Do the math, then go to walgreens or walmart and get 48 oz for 12 bucks.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing Plax, but after just one week of using it I became a committed believer.  I&#x27;m taking a gap year for my college education and am going a while without a dental plan, so I was looking for a cost-effective means of removing my plaque without paying for a trip to the dentist.  I had heard about Plax, and people&#x27;s opinions seemed to fall into one of two camps:  (1) Plax is the best thing since sliced bread or (2) Plax is an ineffective placebo and its effectiveness is not supported by research.  Uncertain about what to do, I considered purchasing a dental scraper.  In the final analysis, the thought of sticking a sharp object into my mouth and scraping sensitive areas with no relevant training or experience prompted me to take a chance on Plax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be more impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per the instructions, I swished Plax in my mouth for 30 seconds and then commenced brushing my teeth as usual.  After just one week of this, the plaque that had built up behind my two lower front teeth had completely disappeared.  Problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to remove plaque and would like to forego an expensive dental cleaning, Plax is your new best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I noticed one of other reviewers mentioned a bad burning sensation from the Plax-- I did not experience anything remotely like this.  It simply tasted like mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Bought this on the advise of my dental technician, to keep my teeth plaque free longer between professional cleanings. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find this size at any drug store anywhere. WOW!  This brand has no sweetener unlike most store brands</li>
            <li> A good preventative in addition to brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li> I like this anti-plaque dental rinse so much that I purchase the twin-pack now for additional savings in cost.  I use it daily before brushing my teeth with toothpaste to keep my teeth squeaky clean -- better than brushing alone -- and it tastes great.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find a pre-rinse and was very happy to find Plax on Amazon.  I had forgotten that I had used this rinse a while back and was happy that I found it again.I believe in using a pre-rinse then brushing then using a mouthwash have not had a cavity in many years.</li>
