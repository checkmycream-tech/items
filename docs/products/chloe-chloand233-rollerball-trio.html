            <li>I have been telling my friend what great</li>
            <li>Great Products....</li>
            <li>Chloe is wonderful and smells lovely -somewhat like Roses and a hint of something spicy that I can&#x27;t put my finger on.</li>
            <li>Chloe smells very good and lot of people ask me what was I wearing I love this perfume</li>
            <li>it makes me happy and confident .</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>had to try after loving Rose de Chloe</li>
            <li>Handy to have your perfume touch up on the go</li>
            <li>This set is a wonderful value if you&#x27;re looking to try a new fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Great fresh scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying my favorite rollerball and giving 2 away as gifts.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of having the purse size of my favorite</li>
            <li>this does not seem authentic at all, it smells like rubbing alcohol and nothing like the retail store version</li>
            <li>but Im still really glad</li>
            <li>I fell in love this fragrances</li>
            <li>I love the price and the timing it arrive.</li>
            <li>Chloe is one of my favorite fragrances</li>
            <li>Lovely packaging.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of these fragrances.</li>
            <li>Chloe Love has more of a evening scent.</li>
            <li>I bought it two months ago because I was absolutely in love with a Chloe sample I received and couldn&#x27;t pass up what a great value it was to try the whole set.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>as I really love them all.</li>
            <li>I use the Chloe when I&#x27;m headed out at night and the Chloe Love as more a daytime scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend checking this one out in store to make sure you like it before committing to the trio here.</li>
            <li>These came package very well &amp; the price was great for the 3 very good &amp; different fragrances.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love Chloe!!!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go with either fragrance because they are each very fresh, clean and feminine</li>
            <li>These are the real and beautiful and fresh.  </li>
            <li>would recommend trying this sample if you love the original Chloe parfum (which is included in the set).  </li>
            <li>It can be a bit strong, so use sparingly.  </li>
            <li>I know I will be going trough this quickly!</li>
            <li>Rosie, light, feminine, and amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Will be a great present for my mother.</li>
            <li>I LOVE CHLOE but only one of these smells good.</li>
            <li>I love the original Chloe and I really like the Chloe Love perfume as well.</li>
            <li>My new favorite perfumes!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased just for the Chloe perfume and intended to give the others away if I didn&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li>If you love soft smelling fragrances, she will enjoy these!</li>
            <li>but it is specially if you can take it on the go every woman should carry in the go Perfumes.i will buy again.</li>
            <li>Only one of the 3 smelled good.</li>
            <li>Very &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; like a cheap 70&#x27;s Coty perfume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big Chloe fan so to be fair, I really just wanted the rollerball ease for my purse perfum.</li>
            <li>Two are musky and they are white florals but not in a sexy way--a lot of metal and synthetic cheap smells.  </li>
            <li>its fresh for some reason</li>
            <li>However, the price was worth having two perfumes that I adore.</li>
            <li>at the right price.</li>
            <li>The rollerball idea is fantastic for perfume and the 3 different scents are very complimentary.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>Love Chloe!wonderful present for any woman!</li>
            <li>and I love that this trip set gives different variations!</li>
            <li>I bought this trio because the one rollerball was $20 at my local beauty store and thought it was a steal to pay $10 more for 2 additional fragrances.</li>
            <li>None of the fragrances are particularly strong and overwhelming, though they last all day which is absolutely essential for me.  </li>
            <li>but these arrived really fast and smell just like the perfume I got in the Sephora holiday sampler.</li>
            <li>so much I wear it every day</li>
            <li>Very floral fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really musky.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>I know others say it grows on you, and perhaps I haven&#x27;t given it enough time like I did with Chloe Love, but I think it smells like old lady perfume.  </li>
            <li>The other 2 I gave to my Grandma because they smelled better on her</li>
            <li>Chloe is very similar to Chloe by Chloe only with a more powdery over tone.</li>
            <li>The regular Chloe and Love Chloe are terrific.</li>
            <li>It is very strong, has a heavy musk smell, and feels very old.</li>
            <li>Love is a little softer and better for everyday.  </li>
            <li>Im not a big fan of the third rollerball just because it seems to be more masculine to me</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve become my new favorites.</li>
            <li>I really wanted a Chloe by Chloe roller ball and at my local Sephora one roller ball is $25</li>
            <li>I worry sometimes with buying perfume on Amazon just because you dont know how old it is or if it will smell the way you want it to</li>
            <li>I was surprised it&#x27;s even a variation of the Chloe scent.</li>
            <li>So economical and enough to try out before spending big bucks on a larger size.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this set because I&#x27;d heard mixed reviews about the Chloe perfumes and wanted to try them prior to spending a large dollar amount on the perfume.</li>
            <li>However, compared to Rose de Chloe these smell weird.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing at least one of the full size bottles, though I haven&#x27;t decided which one yet</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m buying my favorite rollerball and giving 2 away as gifts. #moneysaved</li>
            <li> I really wanted a Chloe by Chloe roller ball and at my local Sephora one roller ball is $25 so I thought why not spend an extra $15 and get two others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Chloe by Chloe roller ball is perfect. My all time favorite scent. Rosie, light, feminine, and amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Love Chloe is very similar to Chloe by Chloe only with a more powdery over tone. Great day time scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Eau de Chloe on the other hand is horrible. It gives me a headache. It is very strong, has a heavy musk smell, and feels very old. Nothing like the other two scents and I don&#x27;t think I will every use this roller ball.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of having the purse size of my favorite scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and at a good price!</li>

            <li> Awesome gift for my wife!</li>
            <li> These are the real and beautiful and fresh.  However, compared to Rose de Chloe these smell weird.  Very &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; like a cheap 70&#x27;s Coty perfume.  I didn&#x27;t care for them at all.  Two are musky and they are white florals but not in a sexy way--a lot of metal and synthetic cheap smells.

            <li> Will be a great present for my mother. Very floral fragrance.</li>
            <li> These came package very well &amp; the price was great for the 3 very good &amp; different fragrances.</li>
            <li> I love the price and the timing it arrive. I have been telling my friend what great but it is specially if you can take it on the go every woman should carry in the go Perfumes.i will buy again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved the option of the rollerballs! Chloe is one of my favorite fragrances and I love that this trip set gives different variations! LOVE!</li>
            <li> Great fresh scents. Lovely packaging. The rollerball idea is fantastic for perfume and the 3 different scents are very complimentary.</li>
            <li> Wish I had opted for choosing one only. Two of what was included either DO NOT agree with my system or make me break out. Not sure what to do about that as they came in a &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of these fragrances. If you love soft smelling fragrances, she will enjoy these! Very fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set because I&#x27;d heard mixed reviews about the Chloe perfumes and wanted to try them prior to spending a large dollar amount on the perfume. I originally purchased just for the Chloe perfume and intended to give the others away if I didn&#x27;t like them. Chloe is wonderful and smells lovely -somewhat like Roses and a hint of something spicy that I can&#x27;t put my finger on. It can be a bit strong, so use sparingly.  Chloe Love has more of a evening scent. This perfume seems to have a touch of vanilla and perhaps somewhat of a musk but not so overpowering that it couldn&#x27;t be worn during the day. Give it a couple tries before you dismiss it.  L&#x27;eau de Chloe is not my cup of tea. I know others say it grows on you, and perhaps I haven&#x27;t given it enough time like I did with Chloe Love, but I think it smells like old lady perfume.  It made me crinkle my nose when I first smelled it and after wearing it once I still thought it smelled awful. However, the price was worth having two perfumes that I adore. They&#x27;ve become my new favorites.</li>
            <li> This set is a wonderful value if you&#x27;re looking to try a new fragrance.  I bought it two months ago because I was absolutely in love with a Chloe sample I received and couldn&#x27;t pass up what a great value it was to try the whole set.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying this sample if you love the original Chloe parfum (which is included in the set).  I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;eau de Chloe for going out because it&#x27;s a bit stronger.  Love is a little softer and better for everyday.  None of the fragrances are particularly strong and overwhelming, though they last all day which is absolutely essential for me.  An added bonus is that the containers are small enough to take on an airplane for traveling.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing at least one of the full size bottles, though I haven&#x27;t decided which one yet as I really love them all.</li>
            <li> I bought this trio because the one rollerball was $20 at my local beauty store and thought it was a steal to pay $10 more for 2 additional fragrances. The regular Chloe and Love Chloe are terrific. I use the Chloe when I&#x27;m headed out at night and the Chloe Love as more a daytime scent. I will say though, I do not care at all for the L&#x27;Eau de Chloe (the one on the left.) It&#x27;s really musky. Really. I was surprised it&#x27;s even a variation of the Chloe scent. I&#x27;d recommend checking this one out in store to make sure you like it before committing to the trio here.</li>
