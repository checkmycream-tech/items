            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>I blame myself for not checking, the product is nice, just not for me.</li>
            <li>Unlike the shampoo that contains very strong peppermint smell.</li>
            <li>I love shampoo (I know it&#x27;s a men&#x27;s product) because it smells amazing and takes all the build-up out of my hair.</li>
            <li>and this is by far one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li>The tea tree oil smells so nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li>, the most important is hide my good bathroom stuff.  </li>
            <li>The bottle did not come with a pump top like in the picture, but honestly I find that works better anyway.</li>
            <li>love the mint smell and the refreshing feeling on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner</li>
            <li>Kreiger + sÃ¶hne conditioner is definitely better than my Paul Mitchell tea tree equivalent.</li>
            <li>Love this smell in the morning</li>
            <li>What a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I have never sued such a great combination of shampoo and conditioner, ever!  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair healthy and conditioned better than most.</li>
            <li>Works better than most men&#x27;s conditioners I have tried.</li>
            <li>but I will make sure to mention the brand to friends/family looking for something like this.</li>
            <li>My dome piece has never felt better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Krieger S&amp;ouml;hne&#x27;s Man Series Conditioner Is fantastic!</li>
            <li>My husband seems to love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Contains refreshing peppermint oil.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and love them both.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>My hair styles better after using this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is so refreshing.</li>
            <li>My husband, my son, and myself all use and love tgis.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the peppermint smell.  </li>
            <li>It is so refreshing while washing/conditioning my hair and is so relaxing while showering.  </li>
            <li>Also, the tingling sensation as I massage my scalp is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>the shampoo and conditioner come in beautiful shades of blue bottles that look nice in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Like the shampoo my wife absolutely loves the smell but perhaps more importantly my hair is in great shape.</li>
            <li>but be warned.. if you do purchase the shampoo - guard it well, for it is the best shampoo I have ever used, it smells so great that if there is a female in the vicinity when you use it, she will find a way into your house and the next thing</li>
            <li>Most importantly, the girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li>Avery good companion to the K&amp;S shampoo,compliments it very well .</li>
            <li>We both really like the scent and that it smells good while being manly.</li>
            <li>Smell is very nice but is strictly masculine, as is the feel of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Lathers well and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>(got the shampoo too!)- not greasy, feels soft and has a nice shine!</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>hand soap works just fine.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the quick reply!</li>
            <li>conditioner absolutely changed his hair; it is now silky smooth and wonderfully healthy, and he&#x27;s never had any problems with his allergies!</li>
            <li>slender and easy to clean</li>
            <li>Great for MEN with short to medium-long hair.</li>
            <li>Yes, conditioner is important.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Paraben free</li>
            <li>, this makes my hair so smooth &amp; flowy.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes my hair look terrific.</li>
            <li>Nice Conditioner, makes my hair feel much smoother.  </li>
            <li>But keep in mind this is NOT sulfate free.</li>
            <li>The tingly clean is fantastic too.</li>
            <li>This has become my new favorite conditioner!</li>
            <li>Makes his hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my husband&#x27;s hair clean and not at all greasy, and it seems to help moisturize his often dry/flaky scalp.</li>
            <li>I also like the way it leaves my hair - nice and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Not overpowering, just that nice just showered smell with a masculine touch.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected, even after using the conditioner my hair felt sort of dry and fine after washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Wow, excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>Great product other than this flaw</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair so clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>I guess I must just now bear the burden of frequently reordering this stuff, because it really is that good.  </li>
            <li>Not as much tingling sensation as I&#x27;d hoped for, but overall, great product and will be buying again.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend because his hair was pretty rough from not taking great care of it.</li>
            <li>Soft, manageable, and full of volume, love my hair.</li>
            <li>This Is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased and it gets better!  </li>
            <li>After several use , my hair becomes more moisture and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>but after a workout or if i want a good clean feeling and not the over dried feeling i use this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this line of hair care products and was excited for me to get the matching conditioner to the rest of the set.</li>
            <li>I am already more than half way through this bottle and they better come-up with a redesign.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Great thick conditioner.</li>
            <li>Most likely not.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these products to any if my friends!!</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t ask for much but he asks for this shampo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>A nice change of pace from all the other monotonous brands.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say how much difference there is between cheaper conditioners, but nice smell and leaves hair feeling soft for the entire day.</li>
            <li>It also leaves your hair feeling super soft.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice slight tingle as it sits on your hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair super soft.</li>
            <li>I gave 4/5 because this combo of products sends to dry my hair/ scalp more than Paul Mitchell tea tree did.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>Smell is great, dry skin was significantly reduced after a single use and gone after multiple, don&#x27;t need much per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>however after washing cant really smell the peppermint (my wife tried)</li>
            <li>He is allergic to many things, so I was careful to pick one out that wouldn&#x27;t irritate him!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about the products I use in my hair</li>
            <li>This conditioner works very well.  </li>
            <li>Some tea tree doesn&#x27;t really tingle</li>
            <li>conditioner also has a very pleasing, invigorating scent.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend absolutely loves this product.</li>
            <li>Will smooth your hair and smells terrific.</li>
            <li>Not too much, just enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This conditioner works really well.</li>
            <li>absolutely be buying both bottles again.</li>
            <li>I love the light, subtle smell of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Great line, I like the fact that with this brand a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>you have to use both shampoo and conditioner in the first use you will see the diference your hair is really soft and ready for any style 5 stars</li>
            <li>only I could live with myself for knocking off stars for a product being so good that other people (wife) steal it..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I love the way the peppermint has a cooling feeling while I leave the conditioner in my hair for a few minutes during use.  </li>
            <li>My personal favorite is BIG by Lush.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is good but not great.</li>
            <li>The deep blue, glossy bottle is very sturdy and holds a full sixteen ounces of conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will be my new go-to shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>It makes hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>No problems with dandruff anymore and my scalp and hair and so healthy its unbelievable.....</li>
            <li>Rinses clean does not weigh down hair or ends.  </li>
            <li>but this smells great &amp; tingles like crazy.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li>Does leave your hair with a soft feel.</li>
            <li>So I have been using this alongside the shampoo for over a month, first thing I want to say is that this conditioner lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Smells minty and leaves your hair soft</li>
            <li>He says it makes his scalp tingle and his hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>Same as the shampoo, works very well.  </li>
            <li>It is consistent with all the other high quality products I have purchased from krieger and sohne.</li>
            <li>feeling I get on my head from dry scalp after wearing a hat and sweating on hot days.  </li>
            <li>She has no less than 468 bottles of miscellaneous &#x27;girl stuff&#x27;, that I don&#x27;t understand, overflowing from every cabinet/drawer/nook and cranny of our bathroom..</li>
            <li>Plain and simple, smells nice (a little minty, nothing overpowering), works well, keeps my hair smooth with a little volume.  </li>
            <li>the many things I&#x27;m slowly learning from cohabitation with a member of the opposite sex</li>
            <li>The shampoo comes out easily but the conditoner is too thick and doesn&#x27;t flow.</li>
            <li>This does not come packaged in a pink bottle with unicorns and glitter on it, rather a sleek manly blue (thats still a boys color right?)</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing about these products is that my hair does not feel heavy, weighted down or greasy at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of tea tree scent, but is not overwhelming.</li>

            <li> received a discount in exchange for providing this honest review.</li>
            <li> used together is nice and tingling.  </li>

            <li> Conditioner also has a nice texture.</li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> I blame myself for not checking, the product is nice, just not for me.</li>
            <li> Unlike the shampoo that contains very strong peppermint smell.</li>
            <li> I love shampoo (I know it&#x27;s a men&#x27;s product) because it smells amazing and takes all the build-up out of my hair.</li>
            <li> and this is by far one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Cleans and conditions with a nice mint smell.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this product at a discount in exchange for my honest feedback and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> The tea tree oil smells so nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li> , the most important is hide my good bathroom stuff.  </li>
            <li> The bottle did not come with a pump top like in the picture, but honestly I find that works better anyway.</li>
            <li> love the mint smell and the refreshing feeling on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner</li>
            <li> Kreiger + sÃ¶hne conditioner is definitely better than my Paul Mitchell tea tree equivalent.</li>
            <li> Love this smell in the morning</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I have never sued such a great combination of shampoo and conditioner, ever!  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair healthy and conditioned better than most.</li>
            <li> Works better than most men&#x27;s conditioners I have tried.</li>
            <li> but I will make sure to mention the brand to friends/family looking for something like this.</li>
            <li> My dome piece has never felt better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Krieger S&amp;ouml;hne&#x27;s Man Series Conditioner Is fantastic!</li>
            <li> My husband seems to love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Contains refreshing peppermint oil.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and love them both.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> My hair styles better after using this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This is so refreshing.</li>
            <li> My husband, my son, and myself all use and love tgis.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is the peppermint smell.  </li>
            <li> It is so refreshing while washing/conditioning my hair and is so relaxing while showering.  </li>
            <li> Also, the tingling sensation as I massage my scalp is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> the shampoo and conditioner come in beautiful shades of blue bottles that look nice in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo my wife absolutely loves the smell but perhaps more importantly my hair is in great shape.</li>
            <li> but be warned.. if you do purchase the shampoo - guard it well, for it is the best shampoo I have ever used, it smells so great that if there is a female in the vicinity when you use it, she will find a way into your house and the next thing</li>
            <li> Most importantly, the girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Avery good companion to the K&amp;S shampoo,compliments it very well .</li>
            <li> We both really like the scent and that it smells good while being manly.</li>
            <li> Smell is very nice but is strictly masculine, as is the feel of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and rinses easily.</li>
            <li> (got the shampoo too!)- not greasy, feels soft and has a nice shine!</li>
            <li> Works just fine.</li>
            <li> hand soap works just fine.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the quick reply!</li>
            <li> conditioner absolutely changed his hair; it is now silky smooth and wonderfully healthy, and he&#x27;s never had any problems with his allergies!</li>
            <li> slender and easy to clean</li>
            <li> Great for MEN with short to medium-long hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, conditioner is important.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Paraben free</li>
            <li> , this makes my hair so smooth &amp; flowy.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my hair look terrific.</li>
            <li> Nice Conditioner, makes my hair feel much smoother.  </li>
            <li> But keep in mind this is NOT sulfate free.</li>
            <li> The tingly clean is fantastic too.</li>
            <li> This has become my new favorite conditioner!</li>
            <li> Makes his hair feel clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my husband&#x27;s hair clean and not at all greasy, and it seems to help moisturize his often dry/flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> I also like the way it leaves my hair - nice and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Not overpowering, just that nice just showered smell with a masculine touch.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected, even after using the conditioner my hair felt sort of dry and fine after washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Wow, excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> Great product other than this flaw</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair so clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I guess I must just now bear the burden of frequently reordering this stuff, because it really is that good.  </li>
            <li> Not as much tingling sensation as I&#x27;d hoped for, but overall, great product and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because his hair was pretty rough from not taking great care of it.</li>
            <li> Soft, manageable, and full of volume, love my hair.</li>
            <li> This Is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased and it gets better!  </li>
            <li> After several use , my hair becomes more moisture and easy to comb.</li>
            <li> but after a workout or if i want a good clean feeling and not the over dried feeling i use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this line of hair care products and was excited for me to get the matching conditioner to the rest of the set.</li>
            <li> I am already more than half way through this bottle and they better come-up with a redesign.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great thick conditioner.</li>
            <li> Most likely not.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these products to any if my friends!!</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t ask for much but he asks for this shampo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> A nice change of pace from all the other monotonous brands.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say how much difference there is between cheaper conditioners, but nice smell and leaves hair feeling soft for the entire day.</li>
            <li> It also leaves your hair feeling super soft.  </li>
            <li> It gives a nice slight tingle as it sits on your hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I gave 4/5 because this combo of products sends to dry my hair/ scalp more than Paul Mitchell tea tree did.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Smell is great, dry skin was significantly reduced after a single use and gone after multiple, don&#x27;t need much per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> however after washing cant really smell the peppermint (my wife tried)</li>
            <li> He is allergic to many things, so I was careful to pick one out that wouldn&#x27;t irritate him!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about the products I use in my hair</li>
            <li> This conditioner works very well.  </li>
            <li> Some tea tree doesn&#x27;t really tingle</li>
            <li> conditioner also has a very pleasing, invigorating scent.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend absolutely loves this product.</li>
            <li> Will smooth your hair and smells terrific.</li>
            <li> Not too much, just enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well.</li>
            <li> absolutely be buying both bottles again.</li>
            <li> I love the light, subtle smell of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Great line, I like the fact that with this brand a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> you have to use both shampoo and conditioner in the first use you will see the diference your hair is really soft and ready for any style 5 stars</li>
            <li> only I could live with myself for knocking off stars for a product being so good that other people (wife) steal it..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love the way the peppermint has a cooling feeling while I leave the conditioner in my hair for a few minutes during use.  </li>
            <li> My personal favorite is BIG by Lush.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is good but not great.</li>
            <li> The deep blue, glossy bottle is very sturdy and holds a full sixteen ounces of conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will be my new go-to shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> It makes hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> No problems with dandruff anymore and my scalp and hair and so healthy its unbelievable.....</li>
            <li> Rinses clean does not weigh down hair or ends.  </li>
            <li> but this smells great &amp; tingles like crazy.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li> Does leave your hair with a soft feel.</li>
            <li> So I have been using this alongside the shampoo for over a month, first thing I want to say is that this conditioner lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells minty and leaves your hair soft</li>
            <li> He says it makes his scalp tingle and his hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> Same as the shampoo, works very well.  </li>
            <li> It is consistent with all the other high quality products I have purchased from krieger and sohne.</li>
            <li> feeling I get on my head from dry scalp after wearing a hat and sweating on hot days.  </li>
            <li> She has no less than 468 bottles of miscellaneous &#x27;girl stuff&#x27;, that I don&#x27;t understand, overflowing from every cabinet/drawer/nook and cranny of our bathroom..</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, smells nice (a little minty, nothing overpowering), works well, keeps my hair smooth with a little volume.  </li>
            <li> the many things I&#x27;m slowly learning from cohabitation with a member of the opposite sex</li>
            <li> The shampoo comes out easily but the conditoner is too thick and doesn&#x27;t flow.</li>
            <li> This does not come packaged in a pink bottle with unicorns and glitter on it, rather a sleek manly blue (thats still a boys color right?)</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing about these products is that my hair does not feel heavy, weighted down or greasy at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of tea tree scent, but is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have a harder and harder time squeezing out the contents due to its high viscosity compared to the sister shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have naturally tangly, slightly wavy, color treated hair down to my mid back (think where your bra starts).  </li>
            <li> My husband suffers from dandruff and has added this into a rotation of products that he uses and is pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Would NOT recommend for women or men with long hair.</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry and fall out.   </li>
            <li> It contains peppermint oil that helps to soothe dry scalp and reduce dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> use this shampoo with K + S Salon Quality Men&#x27;s Shampoo - Tea Tree Oil Infused To Prevent Hair Loss, Dandruff, and Dry Scalp (also sold on Amazon).  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> That said if you have oily hair or even less dry hair than I do, this will likely convert you from other salon brands.</li>
            <li> I use it paired with the shampoo and it leaves my hair so soft and shiny, but it is increasingly hard to get the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Not much tingle from the peppermint.</li>
            <li> Had to throw this away after only a few uses --</li>
            <li> 1 week later no more dry scalp.</li>
            <li> It is super thick and a little hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It has a soft subtle peppermint smell.</li>
            <li> I little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Other the glorious smell of this conditioner, in tandem with the shampoo</li>
            <li> I used to use Crew and other brands specifically geared toward men, but this has supplanted them.</li>
            <li> My hair has several times dye and perm, it becomes very dry and hard to modeling.</li>
            <li> It has cut down on a lot of the &#x27;itching&#x27;</li>
            <li> both me and my husband thought the odor and texture were odd, which was a shame.  </li>
            <li> Not at all heavy, nor does it weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> With a little effort it does come out.</li>
            <li> I have to sqeeze the container just to get a little out</li>
            <li> I was a little weary of buying a conditioner for him-</li>
            <li> Is the plastic actually a half inch thick and there&#x27;s really not much product?  </li>
            <li> It came in a small Amazon box, well protected with air cushion pouches.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this conditioner to anyone looking to have softer hair, and anyone that is having trouble with knots or tangles!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why it says for men</li>
            <li> Hard as heck to get this product to come out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid some product may be wasted because of this.</li>
            <li> also i ahvent seen any dramatic improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the answers are No</li>
            <li> Maybe something wrong with our batch, but we weren&#x27;t fans.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the conditioner smells great when you use it. the peppermint feeling also freshnes up the scalp and wakes u up with a warm tingling sensation. however after washing cant really smell the peppermint (my wife tried) also i ahvent seen any dramatic improvement in my hair. its good but nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> Avery good companion to the K&amp;S shampoo,compliments it very well .</li>
            <li> A bottle of conditioner this size used to last me a year, now I somehow find myself reordering after a couple weeks.  I initially thought perhaps deceptive or malfunctioning packaging.. was it leaking in the shower?  Is the plastic actually a half inch thick and there&#x27;s really not much product?  Unfortunately the answers are No and No..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the many things I&#x27;m slowly learning from cohabitation with a member of the opposite sex, the most important is hide my good bathroom stuff.  This does not come packaged in a pink bottle with unicorns and glitter on it, rather a sleek manly blue (thats still a boys color right?) bottle - why does EverydayNormalGuy&#x27;s Wife feel the need to steal massive amounts of this conditioner?  She has no less than 468 bottles of miscellaneous &#x27;girl stuff&#x27;, that I don&#x27;t understand, overflowing from every cabinet/drawer/nook and cranny of our bathroom.. however this is what she chooses to use now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only I could live with myself for knocking off stars for a product being so good that other people (wife) steal it.. I guess I must just now bear the burden of frequently reordering this stuff, because it really is that good.  A perfect compliment to K&amp;H Men&#x27;s shampoo.. but be warned.. if you do purchase the shampoo - guard it well, for it is the best shampoo I have ever used, it smells so great that if there is a female in the vicinity when you use it, she will find a way into your house and the next thing you know you&#x27;re working a second job just to cover the replacement costs of your hair cleansing products.</li>
            <li> Smells Good. Works just fine.</li>
            <li> Used this product with the shampoo and i am very satisfied with the product. Lives up to all the reviews I will continue to purchase this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this brand! I have purchased the shampoo before but not the conditioner. I figured I would give it a try. I love shampoo (I know it&#x27;s a men&#x27;s product) because it smells amazing and takes all the build-up out of my hair. I used the conditioner this morning. It is super thick and a little hard to get out of the bottle. With a little effort it does come out. It has the same minty smell as the shampoo. It is silky and I let it sit in my hair for a bit. It made my hair so unbelievably soft. I can&#x27;t say enough about this brand!  Loving this condition as well!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because his hair was pretty rough from not taking great care of it. He is allergic to many things, so I was careful to pick one out that wouldn&#x27;t irritate him!&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner absolutely changed his hair; it is now silky smooth and wonderfully healthy, and he&#x27;s never had any problems with his allergies! Great product!</li>
            <li> My son liked this. Makes his hair feel clean.</li>
            <li> love it, light weight , works great, and awesome buy. slender and easy to clean</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner.  Can&#x27;t really say how much difference there is between cheaper conditioners, but nice smell and leaves hair feeling soft for the entire day.</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry and fall out.   Great company. Refunded my money with no questions asked!!</li>
            <li> great hair product. love the mint smell and the refreshing feeling on my scalp. my hair is short (buzz cut) so i don&#x27;t always use shampoo. hand soap works just fine. but after a workout or if i want a good clean feeling and not the over dried feeling i use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner I&#x27;m very picky about the products I use in my hair and this is by far one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. I use to only use aveda but I think in making the switch to this entirely.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works very well.  It has a soft subtle peppermint smell.</li>
            <li> Kreiger + sÃ¶hne conditioner is definitely better than my Paul Mitchell tea tree equivalent. It got my hair softer which is great. The shampoo is also nice. I will definitely be ordered again when I run out. Unless I opt to go bald.</li>
            <li> Great smell! Not much tingle from the peppermint. Does leave your hair with a soft feel.</li>
            <li> It works great. I use it paired with the shampoo and it leaves my hair so soft and shiny, but it is increasingly hard to get the product out of the bottle. The shampoo comes out easily but the conditoner is too thick and doesn&#x27;t flow. I have to sqeeze the container just to get a little out and I&#x27;m afraid some product may be wasted because of this. Great product other than this flaw</li>
            <li> This set is similar to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree products! Love this smell in the morning</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product! Fast shipping! Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and rinses easily. Smell is very nice but is strictly masculine, as is the feel of the conditioner. Would NOT recommend for women or men with long hair. Great for MEN with short to medium-long hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this shampoo/conditoner is only geared towards men....I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Cleans and conditions with a nice mint smell.</li>
            <li> What a refreshing minty smells!! I bought this for my husband who has oily hair. He often uses a 2 in 1 product and I think it just doesn&#x27;t suit his needs- I was a little weary of buying a conditioner for him- but it was a great deal so I could not pass it up. He has used it for a couple days now and his hair looks great! (got the shampoo too!)- not greasy, feels soft and has a nice shine! I&#x27;m tempted to try it out myself!!</li>
            <li> So I have been using this alongside the shampoo for over a month, first thing I want to say is that this conditioner lasts for a long time. Like the shampoo my wife absolutely loves the smell but perhaps more importantly my hair is in great shape. No problems with dandruff anymore and my scalp and hair and so healthy its unbelievable.....I have never sued such a great combination of shampoo and conditioner, ever!  Just placed another order.</li>
            <li> This has become my new favorite conditioner! I use it with their shampoo. It has just the right amount of tea tree scent, but is not overwhelming. My favorite thing about these products is that my hair does not feel heavy, weighted down or greasy at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I use it and I&#x27;m female.  It leaves my hair very soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves hair healthy and conditioned better than most.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome!!  It has cut down on a lot of the &#x27;itching&#x27; feeling I get on my head from dry scalp after wearing a hat and sweating on hot days.  I love the way the peppermint has a cooling feeling while I leave the conditioner in my hair for a few minutes during use.  I also like the way it leaves my hair - nice and soft to the touch.  Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> love this product works great</li>
            <li> These are the same hair products used at my upscale salon. They have a great scent and feel very nice on my scalp. My wife loves the smell. This will be my new go-to shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great thick conditioner. Works better than most men&#x27;s conditioners I have tried. Lighter mint scent than the shampoo. To me, it has a hint of coconut scent (though no coconut in the ingredients). Not as much tingling sensation as I&#x27;d hoped for, but overall, great product and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected, even after using the conditioner my hair felt sort of dry and fine after washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Wow, excellent customer service. The company sent me an email and a refund for the purchase the same day I posted my review. I may not have the hair type for this product but I will make sure to mention the brand to friends/family looking for something like this. Thank you for the quick reply! (+2 stars for excellent service)</li>
            <li> Great smell and does a good job. Hard as heck to get this product to come out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> My dome piece has never felt better. This stuff is to die for.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Some tea tree doesn&#x27;t really tingle but this smells great &amp; tingles like crazy. Not overpoweringly scented but a nice smell to it. It&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:d8799cefcd1a1d366bc15dbcd46678e8]] The K and S Men&#x27;s Hair Conditioner arrived on time from Amazon Prime in two days.  It came in a small Amazon box, well protected with air cushion pouches.  The bottle also had a plastic sleeve over it to protect the finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product and packaging is salon quality all the way.  The deep blue, glossy bottle is very sturdy and holds a full sixteen ounces of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner also has a very pleasing, invigorating scent.  It contains peppermint oil that helps to soothe dry scalp and reduce dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount in exchange for providing this honest review.</li>
            <li> I realize this is a &amp;#34;mens&amp;#34; conditioner, I am a woman.  I have naturally tangly, slightly wavy, color treated hair down to my mid back (think where your bra starts).  I love the light, subtle smell of this conditioner.  Rinses clean does not weigh down hair or ends.  I have not had any build up after a month!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this shampoo with K + S Salon Quality Men&#x27;s Shampoo - Tea Tree Oil Infused To Prevent Hair Loss, Dandruff, and Dry Scalp (also sold on Amazon).  This conditioner does a good job smoothing and detangling.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best for all conditions! With having longer hair, sometimes there is a hassle with knots and tangles. Using this conditioner has made the world of difference when dealing with these inconveniences. I recommend this conditioner to anyone looking to have softer hair, and anyone that is having trouble with knots or tangles!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smelling of mint. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is good but not great. I am already more than half way through this bottle and they better come-up with a redesign. I have a harder and harder time squeezing out the contents due to its high viscosity compared to the sister shampoo. The cap should be inverted with a larger outlet nozzle, i.e. let gravity do the work when not used. Would I buy this again? Most likely not. I would buy the shampoo again though. My personal favorite is BIG by Lush.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend absolutely loves this product. It even help get rid of his dandruff. He will not use anything else now.</li>
            <li> Will smooth your hair and smells terrific.</li>
            <li> bought this with the shampoo.  used together is nice and tingling.  Left my hair soft.  im happy!</li>
            <li> Yes, conditioner is important. This one pairs great with the shampoo. It smells fantastic. Not overpowering, just that nice just showered smell with a masculine touch. The bottle did not come with a pump top like in the picture, but honestly I find that works better anyway. Completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, smells nice (a little minty, nothing overpowering), works well, keeps my hair smooth with a little volume.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> you have to use both shampoo and conditioner in the first use you will see the diference your hair is really soft and ready for any style 5 stars</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo and it makes his hair smell so good!</li>
            <li> Krieger S&amp;ouml;hne&#x27;s Man Series Conditioner Is fantastic! My husband seems to love this conditioner. Smells great and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Contains refreshing peppermint oil.&lt;br /&gt;- Paraben free&lt;br /&gt;- For all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;- Pleasing fragrance. Not too much, just enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I know this is supposed to be for men but I used it and loved it!! I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and love them both. If you have never used a hair product with tea tree in it, or even if you have, you must try this one. The shampoo makes your scalp tingle as it cleans. You can feel it working. The conditioner has a nice scent that is good for men or women. It leaves your hair so clean and fresh feeling. It is really good for anyone that uses a lot of styling product in their hair. This will remove all of the build up.&lt;br /&gt;Both the shampoo and conditioner come in beautiful shades of blue bottles that look nice in the bathroom. I would highly recommend these products to any if my friends!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells wonderful.  It also leaves your hair feeling super soft.  I ordered both it and the shampoo and I am pleased with my purchase.  I am def. Planning on buying from this company again.</li>
            <li> This works great. Smells minty and leaves your hair soft</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well. It is consistent with all the other high quality products I have purchased from krieger and sohne. It leaves my husband&#x27;s hair clean and not at all greasy, and it seems to help moisturize his often dry/flaky scalp. It smells really good and works well in conjunction with their shampoo.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner love the way it feels and refreshes.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t ask for much but he asks for this shampo and conditioner! Lol. He says it makes his scalp tingle and his hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brand!  This Is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased and it gets better!  The smell is amazing and I&#x27;m not sure why it says for men but I use it EVERY day and get compliments from my man!</li>
            <li> The smell of the conditioner and shampoo is amazing! It gives a nice slight tingle as it sits on your hair. It leaves your hair super soft. I will for sure buy this again!</li>
            <li> Other the glorious smell of this conditioner, in tandem with the shampoo, this makes my hair so smooth &amp; flowy. Not at all heavy, nor does it weigh down my hair. But also, I once ran out of shaving cream &amp; remembered a hack that you can use conditioner instead, OMG, this, with it&#x27;s tingling after sensation is amazing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product as I use this with K + S shampoo. Smells great and makes my hair look terrific.</li>
            <li> Same as the shampoo, works very well.  My hair styles better after using this stuff.  Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Nice Conditioner, makes my hair feel much smoother.  I&#x27;d buy it again, well, when I run out!</li>
            <li> The peppermint oil feels amazing. I haven&#x27;t scene products in the store that are quite like this brand. A nice change of pace from all the other monotonous brands.</li>
            <li> Great product. I gave 4/5 because this combo of products sends to dry my hair/ scalp more than Paul Mitchell tea tree did. That said if you have oily hair or even less dry hair than I do, this will likely convert you from other salon brands. It smells great, and isn&#x27;t floral at all. My wife even likes to use it when I&#x27;m not paying attention. Conditioner also has a nice texture. Will definitely buy again, even with drying effects on my hair.</li>
            <li> Both their shampoo and conditioner are AMAZING</li>
            <li> Had to throw this away after only a few uses -- both me and my husband thought the odor and texture were odd, which was a shame.  Maybe something wrong with our batch, but we weren&#x27;t fans.</li>
            <li> Great product. It smells and feels terrific. I used to use Crew and other brands specifically geared toward men, but this has supplanted them. Most importantly, the girlfriend loves it. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a dry scalp. 1 week later no more dry scalp. I little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> This is so refreshing. My husband, my son, and myself all use and love tgis. Soft, manageable, and full of volume, love my hair. The tingly clean is fantastic too.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. Very high quality.</li>
            <li> I buy this product for my husband, but I also use it to care my hair. My hair has several times dye and perm, it becomes very dry and hard to modeling. After several use , my hair becomes more moisture and easy to comb. I&#x27;ll keep to use and hope it will keep works well on my hair!</li>
            <li> My husband uses the hair gel product and loves the scent (so do I), so I decided to purchase the conditioner and shampoo. Great line, I like the fact that with this brand a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I order the Krieger + Sohne shampoo/conditioner as a set on Feb 9 and received on Feb 14 with Prime no rush shipping. Both my hubby and I tried it (I am a woman with hairs a bit under my shoulder). Unlike the shampoo that contains very strong peppermint smell. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t have any smells. My hairs have been knotted since I started using a &amp;#34;Tea tree conditioner&amp;#34;. Therefore, I was eager to try Krieger + Sohne conditioner. It is a big help with the knots. I love it. My hubby also said It&#x27;s a great conditioner and gives volume to the hair.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair softer than a baby&#x27;s butt</li>
            <li> It smells nice. But keep in mind this is NOT sulfate free. I assumed for the price it just would be, didn&#x27;t do my research. Strips all of the oils from my hair, so I have stopped using it. I blame myself for not checking, the product is nice, just not for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for women as well as for men.  I was able to purchase this product at a discount in exchange for my honest feedback and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  My husband suffers from dandruff and has added this into a rotation of products that he uses and is pleased with the results.  It makes my hair soft and smells wonderful.  My favorite part is the peppermint smell.  It is so refreshing while washing/conditioning my hair and is so relaxing while showering.  Also, the tingling sensation as I massage my scalp is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Just reviewed the shampoo, thought I&#x27;d leave a short one for the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as advertised. Smell is great, dry skin was significantly reduced after a single use and gone after multiple, don&#x27;t need much per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will absolutely be buying both bottles again.</li>
            <li> Great combo (shampoo and conditioner) my husband says it cleans well.  It does smell like mint chocolate chip ice cream though.</li>
            <li> I love this series of products, good quality and feel luxurious when I use them!</li>
            <li> I received This conditioner for mens hair, It is good for my boy&#x27;s help them smell the hair so good!  Thank you! I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this line of hair care products and was excited for me to get the matching conditioner to the rest of the set. We both really like the scent and that it smells good while being manly. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> It makes hair very soft and shiny. I bought this with its shampoo and together they works well. Great combo.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It feels amazing on my scalp. The tea tree oil smells so nice and refreshing. It has a soothing sensation and reliefs my scalp from being itchy without over moisturizing or drying out. I recommend it and the shampoo. I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review.</li>
