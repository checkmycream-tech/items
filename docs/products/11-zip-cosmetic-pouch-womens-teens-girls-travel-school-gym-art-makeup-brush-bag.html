            <li> Not too small and not overly large either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s larger than I expected</li>
            <li> Bought this a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I have other make-up bags that will stand up with things are in them (as the bottom opens up and is flat), but this one does not do that.  </li>
            <li> This item had the most awful odor.  </li>
            <li> Hard to shop for a teenager, but this was truly a hit.</li>
            <li> I like the pattern on the bag, hard to misplace, but no frills.</li>

And the fabric of this case, is great too! It is just as pictured! And has lotsss of space to store all your makeup products! Must buy! If I ever need, I will definetely buy from this seller again! :)</li>
            <li> This item had the most awful odor.  I returned it immediately!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother making a purchase on this item, ever!</li>

Highly recommend this bag for anyone looking for a makeup bag or just a zebra print bag in general. Zipper is high quality as well. Love this bag.

            <li> All my nail polish fits in here! Good quality</li>

            <li> This bag is cute and serves its purpose, for makeup mostly.  Nice material and was a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> This was bought for my granddaughter.  She uses it for school and for her make up.  She is a zebra fan.</li>
            <li> On time It is just the right size to fit makeup items into, especially when travelling. Maked a super stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for my makeup!! No problems at all. It&#x27;s small enough to fit my purse and big enough to hold all my makeup</li>
            <li> Bought this a long time ago.  Still love it, thinking of moving just makeup brushes to this bag because, even though I&#x27;ve put my makeup in a new bag, this one is still holding up well after about 4 years of constant use!</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift to a gal who loves anything zebra.  Was surprised by the great quality.  Made a great Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> This is a good bag...I use it for keeping personal female items in my work bag.  It&#x27;s a little big probably, but it&#x27;s thin, so it slides in and out very easily.  I have other make-up bags that will stand up with things are in them (as the bottom opens up and is flat), but this one does not do that.  So if you are looking for a make-up bag that will be easy to things in and out of on a counter, this is not your bag.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy zipper bag. I keep all my bills that need to be mailed out or payed in this bag. It matched the purse I bought from Amazon as well</li>
            <li> Great match for her zebra back pack</li>
