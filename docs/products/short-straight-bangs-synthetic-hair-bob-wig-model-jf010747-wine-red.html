            <li>Great wig and pretty color.</li>
            <li>This is a cute wig, nicer than a costume wig.  </li>
            <li>lovely color and fits well does not seem to mind that when you use a wig</li>
            <li>I love the wig nevertheless</li>
            <li>Overall a very good buy!</li>
            <li>Perfect color, I get lots of complements, received my order a couple of weeks earlier than stated I will order again.</li>
            <li>Not the most comfortable wig and a lot of the hair falls out, but it looks somewhat real and is great for the price</li>
            <li>The feel of the wig was so great and felt quite natural.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s beautiful and feels like real hair, you can use high heat tool on it and everything.</li>
            <li>This is a cute wig and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It fit me, my 6 year old, and my 14 year old perfectly well, so you could order for anyone really.</li>
            <li>Luckily I&#x27;m a plan ahead person</li>
            <li>The color is pretty, accurately shown.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even fit my fiance&#x27;s rather large head.</li>
            <li>Even though my adult daughter says it&#x27;s more</li>
            <li>Right off the bat, part of the weft on the bangs fell out.</li>
            <li>The color is a little bright, but I still got away with wearing it.</li>
            <li>It hits me more above the chin than I would like.</li>
            <li>it was a hit, people thought it was my real hair!</li>
            <li>Not only did it come two weeks ahead of schedule, the quality and the style of the wig was lovely.</li>
            <li>The top looks fakeish, but isn&#x27;t too big of a deal.</li>
            <li>This wig is definitely a waste of money if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality wig.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wig was natural looking, soft, great quality, fast shipping and came with a wig cap, would definitely recommend and will be wearing for Halloweens to come!</li>
            <li>first of all the bangs were way to long and went to the top of my nose.</li>
            <li>the color is exactly what is pictured and thy came relativly fast considering</li>
            <li>Not straight bangs despite what it is advertised as, but can easily be cut.!</li>
            <li>People thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>It did not look like real hair at all.</li>
            <li>it got very tangled also</li>
            <li>Not as purple as the picture would indicate but is still very flattering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s REALLY dark, and those of you who review with &amp;#34;the bangs are too long&amp;#34; you obviously don&#x27;t buy very many wigs.</li>
            <li>It feels really soft and looks fairly real.</li>
            <li>IF YOU HAVE A NORMAL SIZED HEAD</li>
            <li>This wig was my favorite, besides the fact that it was a little small, it was super pretty when I put it on and looked so real.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a new one as soon as I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>The texture of it is very soft.</li>
            <li>:) I have an average head size and it was short.</li>
            <li>Stretches only to about 20 inches all the way around and looks really nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li>We are dressing as Ghostbusters this year and my 14 year old daughter is going to be Annie Pots character &amp;#34;Janine&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>how far away it is</li>
            <li>When I went to the actual wedding the girls didn&#x27;t recognize me with my natural brown</li>
            <li>A little shedding at first, and it&#x27;s quite scratchy by the shedding stops after a while</li>
            <li>This came exactly as pictured, color and cut where dead on.  </li>

            <li> They make the bangs long because everyone has different sized foreheads, they do it so you can cut them to the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it is quite shiny and hard to pass off as real in any way.</li>
            <li> It was a bit shiny when I received it but dry shampoo has helped tone that done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little long, but I assume that it&#x27;s only so you can cut it to the desired length.</li>
            <li> I wore it out as soon as I got it, which was sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> The color is nice, the fibers are the same, but the way it was made is awful.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really concerned about it looking fake</li>
            <li> A little talc to bring the shine down</li>
            <li> As a cosplayer, I have plenty of experience with good and bad quality wigs; I definitely have to say that this wig is among the bad ones.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the length in front would be a little longer.</li>
            <li> The model must have a little head.</li>
            <li> As someone said before, the wig is very dark, but it&#x27;s still to my liking.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how we are going to get all her hair under it, but that&#x27;s no fault of the wig.</li>
            <li> : This shipped from Asia and took seriously months to arrive.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re skeptical on buying this wig, I would tell you not to be.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the wig I received.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for my fiance to be Ichigo Momomyia from Tokyo Mew Mew, but this is awful and now she&#x27;s upset.</li>

            <li> This is a cute wig and well worth the price. It was a bit shiny when I received it but dry shampoo has helped tone that done. People thought it was my real hair. The color is very lovely.</li>
            <li> Tooo shiny to wear out.. maybe for Halloween.... maybe</li>
            <li> This is a cute wig, nicer than a costume wig.  The color is pretty, accurately shown.  The cut is nice and blunt.</li>
            <li> Going to a 70&#x27;s costume party later this month..it feels great and I&#x27;m happy... Even though my adult daughter says it&#x27;s more 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the wig I received. Right off the bat, part of the weft on the bangs fell out. The rest of the time, trying to cut and style it was a nightmare. The color is nice, the fibers are the same, but the way it was made is awful. Also, the wig itself is enormous. It doesn&#x27;t even fit my fiance&#x27;s rather large head. I won&#x27;t be buying from here again. As a cosplayer, I have plenty of experience with good and bad quality wigs; I definitely have to say that this wig is among the bad ones. I ordered this wig for my fiance to be Ichigo Momomyia from Tokyo Mew Mew, but this is awful and now she&#x27;s upset. I&#x27;m looking for a new one as soon as I&#x27;m done. This wig is definitely a waste of money if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality wig.</li>
            <li> It is a nice wig for 10 bucks. A little talc to bring the shine down and I was good to go. I was hoping the length in front would be a little longer. It hits me more above the chin than I would like.The model must have a little head. :) I have an average head size and it was short. Still a very cute wig for the money.</li>
            <li> first of all the bangs were way to long and went to the top of my nose. It did not look like real hair at all. it got very tangled also</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, looks real, fabulous color. Not as purple as the picture would indicate but is still very flattering. Not straight bangs despite what it is advertised as, but can easily be cut.!</li>
            <li> Channeled my inner Rihanna with this wig...Bought this wig for a bachelorette party around Halloween time...it was a hit, people thought it was my real hair! When I went to the actual wedding the girls didn&#x27;t recognize me with my natural brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig was natural looking, soft, great quality, fast shipping and came with a wig cap, would definitely recommend and will be wearing for Halloweens to come!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A NORMAL SIZED HEAD AT ALL!! I ended up giving it to one of my friends with a freakishly small head, and it was pretty snug on her too.</li>
            <li> This wig was my favorite, besides the fact that it was a little small, it was super pretty when I put it on and looked so real. I wore it out as soon as I got it, which was sooner than expected. I would order from this company again!</li>
            <li> Not the most comfortable wig and a lot of the hair falls out, but it looks somewhat real and is great for the price</li>
            <li> This is the smallest wig I&#x27;ve ever seen. Stretches only to about 20 inches all the way around and looks really nothing like the picture. It&#x27;s a lot shorter.</li>
            <li> lovely color and fits well does not seem to mind that when you use a wig</li>
            <li> Perfect for a Halloween costume. We are dressing as Ghostbusters this year and my 14 year old daughter is going to be Annie Pots character &amp;#34;Janine&amp;#34;. This wig is literally PERFECT. It fit me, my 6 year old, and my 14 year old perfectly well, so you could order for anyone really. Of course, my daughter has a ton of hair and this is a short wig so I&#x27;m not sure how we are going to get all her hair under it, but that&#x27;s no fault of the wig. For the price it&#x27;s great. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily wear this as my actual hair, but again, for one night costume purposes it is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: This shipped from Asia and took seriously months to arrive. Luckily I&#x27;m a plan ahead person so we have plenty of time before Halloween but I would recommend purchasing this wig by July if you want it for Halloween.</li>
            <li> The color appears to be almost brunet with red hues. It&#x27;s REALLY dark, and those of you who review with &amp;#34;the bangs are too long&amp;#34; you obviously don&#x27;t buy very many wigs. They make the bangs long because everyone has different sized foreheads, they do it so you can cut them to the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; length for your face, it&#x27;s not a mistake. I love the wig nevertheless because it&#x27;s beautiful and feels like real hair, you can use high heat tool on it and everything.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase! Not only did it come two weeks ahead of schedule, the quality and the style of the wig was lovely. The feel of the wig was so great and felt quite natural. The color is a little bright, but I still got away with wearing it. People even asked me where I had got my hair done. So if you&#x27;re skeptical on buying this wig, I would tell you not to be. Go ahead and buy it! its great!</li>
            <li> i loved it the quality is goo the color is exactly what is pictured and thy came relativly fast considering how far away it is from!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gret great product</li>
            <li> Love the color of this wig!!</li>
            <li> Great wig! It feels really soft and looks fairly real. The top looks fakeish, but isn&#x27;t too big of a deal. If you&#x27;re really concerned about it looking fake then I suggest a hat, I wore one with it and it looks amazing!</li>
            <li> As someone said before, the wig is very dark, but it&#x27;s still to my liking. It&#x27;s a little long, but I assume that it&#x27;s only so you can cut it to the desired length. A little shedding at first, and it&#x27;s quite scratchy by the shedding stops after a while and you get used to the scratchiness. Overall a very good buy!</li>
            <li> Great wig and pretty color.The texture of it is very soft. I am very happy with my purchase</li>
