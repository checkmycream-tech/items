            <li>and I LOVE IT  </li>
            <li>They are more manageable.</li>
            <li>Thank  You :)</li>
            <li>i use this every day and love how it helps my hair stay healthy since i straighten my hair every day</li>
            <li>This has been my FAVORITE heat spray since it came out.  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing and reminds me of mens cologne, but fresh!  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best flat iron sprays I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>whoever buys it will most definately enjoy its effects... and as for the lady who said her hair is brittle... redken has another heat protectant that works as a spritz also</li>
            <li>hair is silky smooth, I can run my fingers easily through it</li>
            <li>My daughter bought this, and it makes her hair so smooth, shiny and straight!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>This product is great for use with a flat iron, or a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Spray is great when using a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO MAKE THIS</li>
            <li>Spray helps to keep hair straight, but its just ok.</li>
            <li>It adds some extra protection from heat damage, smells great, and really does make your hair feel like silk.</li>
            <li>It can be sticky if you spray it too close to the hair, but as long as you keep a good distance it doesn&#x27;t get sticky.</li>
            <li>but this is the one that was made for making your hair shiny, straight, and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>its well worth a try and money.</li>
            <li>my hair curls easily and straightens easily giving it an actual silk effect.</li>
            <li>The best part about this product is its good on wet or dry hair, and does have minimal hold for styling purposes.</li>
            <li>if you have fine hair like me, I don&#x27;t recommend spraying this stuff on right at the roots, or it will make your hair a bit flatter than normal.</li>
            <li>Using Iron Silk before I flat iron my hair really makes an amazing difference.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of my favorite Redken products.</li>
            <li>I am giving it 4 stars because i haven&#x27;t found anything better yet, although i might try Aveda products next.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this spray</li>
            <li>Most definitely a must if you flatiron your hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product, i use a long time ago</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone who regularly straightens and colors their hair to keep it from becoming damaged.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this product to anyone who has good results with their flat iron but want to take their look to the next level.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed that when I use it</li>
            <li>and I like that I don&#x27;t have to use TOO much</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, I straightened them a lot my hair stylist told me about Redken Iron 07</li>
            <li>and it does keep my hair silky and straight even with humidity in the 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>It helps to protect the hair, and keep it straight when styling.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much healthier.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair easier to flat iron and the results are smooth, silky, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who flat irons or curls their hair, because it&#x27;s extremely important to protect your hair from mechanical damage.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted my hair to be super straight and protected from the heat from the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and smooth after flat ironing.</li>
            <li>highly highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I only use a few (maybe at most 5) light mists on my fine hair, otherwise it will build up too much and leave heavy residue.  </li>
            <li>Normally I straighten my hair</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products by Redken, I used this everyday before I use my straightening iron on my hair</li>
            <li>Instead of just lying flat, as it does when I just wash, condition, dry, and flat iron it, my hair got \\&quot;fat\\&quot; ... and not in a good or funky way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>You must spray each section on dry hair before straightening, but it works well and the style holds all day and most of the next.</li>
            <li>I put it on my wet hair before blowdrying and it makes a significant difference in frizz and straightness by the blowdryer.</li>
            <li>I am new to the Redken line, but I have used many a costly hair product in the past.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed less breakage since I started using it and the smell is light</li>
            <li>I bought this because I saw a youtube review that said it made her hair really soft.  </li>
            <li>I can do curly hair and we can see look natural.</li>
            <li>..makes my hair shiny and soft...</li>
            <li>Be sure to spritz a little before running the flat iron over it and it will keep your hair heathly and shiny.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel stiff or sticky once you brush your hair, which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>right away-it makes my hair wet</li>
            <li>It helps tame the flyaway and provides frizz control in light rain and humid climate.</li>
            <li>and I really think that added factor has saved my hair from the flat iron heat day in and day out.</li>
            <li>so i was really looking for a spray that would hold my straight flat ironed hair for long.</li>
            <li>It does not make my hair straight, in fact I think it makes it more difficult to straighten using this product.  </li>
            <li>I does make my hair feel soft, but really this product does not live up to it&#x27;s name!!</li>
            <li>A little spritz goes pretty far with this one.  </li>
            <li>You have to be careful not to use too much spray</li>
            <li>As a hair care professional I use this product on all my clients before flat ironing or curling their hair.</li>

            <li> As a hair care professional I use this product on all my clients before flat ironing or curling their hair.</li>
            <li> (i only flat iron my hair once a week)...</li>
            <li> The only solution, while waiting for the chunks (yes, chunks) to grow out and blend with the ends, was to flat iron it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair twice a week, and was looking for something to protect it and add shine.  </li>
            <li> When I flat iron my hair without using Iron Silk</li>
            <li> The directions say to spray on your hair and then flat iron</li>
            <li> Works wonders if you have curly hair and use a flat iron to straighten it.</li>
            <li> but if you apply to wet hair (not dry like the bottle says)</li>
            <li> product doesn;t dry her hair out when she uses a flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and very coarse; it is very frizzy after blowdrying as well.</li>
            <li> I gave the item 4 stars instead of 5 only becuase of apparent leakage of a small amount of product.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews I figured I had nothing to loose by trying it.</li>
            <li> I really DO NOT like it.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if that made it work different or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some negative reviews about how it left hair tangled and sticky....</li>
            <li> im not even half way through it ..</li>
            <li> have long thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle also does not work well and leaks a little.</li>
            <li> , the bottle does not spray evenly, but drips and drizzles, and the product, no matter how little I use, makes my hair sticky.  </li>
            <li> I have very long naturally curly hair, and last week got the second worst haircut of my life.</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy though, so</li>
            <li> It did up to a few hours with no frizz</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so stiff and brittle.  </li>
            <li> I straighten my hair at least 5 days a week</li>
            <li> that in a pink bottle that holds the hair.. maybe you purchased the wrong bottle</li>
            <li> it just sprays around thick in one spot</li>
            <li> My hair Is thick and bleached</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick hair and</li>
            <li> Its expensive and made my hair dull and weighed down.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is very difficult to find in store.</li>
            <li> it is horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This smells incredible.  I only use a few (maybe at most 5) light mists on my fine hair, otherwise it will build up too much and leave heavy residue.  I bought this because I saw a youtube review that said it made her hair really soft.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed that when I use it but I like the smell alot.</li>
            <li> This product is great for use with a flat iron, or a curling iron. It adds some extra protection from heat damage, smells great, and really does make your hair feel like silk. It also help your keep your style longer, and it helps to block humidity out too. It is a bit heavy though, so if you have fine hair like me, I don&#x27;t recommend spraying this stuff on right at the roots, or it will make your hair a bit flatter than normal. It doesn&#x27;t feel stiff or sticky once you brush your hair, which is a huge plus for me. This is definitely one of my favorite Redken products.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a hair stylist.  I flat iron my hair twice a week, and was looking for something to protect it and add shine.  This product makes my hair so stiff and brittle.  I followed the instructions on the bottle, and it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I can&#x27;t even run my fingers through it after I straighten it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!!!! Works SO WELL when used for straightening!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I figured I had nothing to loose by trying it. And it&#x27;s GREAT! I straighten my hair at least 5 days a week so I want something to not only straighten my hair but protect it from all of the heat.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is silky smooth, I can run my fingers easily through it and I like that I don&#x27;t have to use TOO much product.&lt;br /&gt;I have long thick wavy hair so this is definitely perfect for me.</li>
            <li> As a hair care professional I use this product on all my clients before flat ironing or curling their hair. It can be sticky if you spray it too close to the hair, but as long as you keep a good distance it doesn&#x27;t get sticky. I use this product on myself, and I have medium hair. It makes my hair very soft and smooth after flat ironing. The product also smells great. I would recommend it to anyone who flat irons or curls their hair, because it&#x27;s extremely important to protect your hair from mechanical damage.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, I straightened them a lot my hair stylist told me about Redken Iron 07 I try it and I LOVE IT  I also use redken #12 it&#x27;s really great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Normally I straighten my hair about 30-35 min, and with this product it takes me about 10-15 minutes and the results are amazing.  Anyone who lives in Chicago needs this</li>
            <li> Redken is suppose to be a good brand. When i decided to purchase i saw good reviews on you tube about it. I also have curly hair so i was really looking for a spray that would hold my straight flat ironed hair for long. It did up to a few hours with no frizz but i wished it had for a bit longer. Apart from that the product came on time and supplier was good.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products by Redken, I used this everyday before I use my straightening iron on my hair and it does keep my hair silky and straight even with humidity in the 90&#x27;s highly highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Spray helps to keep hair straight, but its just ok. I am giving it 4 stars because i haven&#x27;t found anything better yet, although i might try Aveda products next. The spray nozzle also does not work well and leaks a little. Also, it sprays the liquid in clumps on hair and just does not spray well at all.</li>
            <li> They stopped carrying this in the salon so I have been buying it everywhere I can get my hands on it.  The Redken 11 that replaced it is horrible.  It is like flower scent water.  This product really works.</li>
            <li> Redkin iron silk 07 ultra is perfect and was what I was looking for.  Hair are not pouf pouf anymore.  They are more manageable. Thank  You :)</li>
            <li> Spray is great when using a flat iron. It helps to protect the hair, and keep it straight when styling.</li>
            <li> I love this product, i use a long time ago and im so happy. I can do curly hair and we can see look natural.</li>
            <li> It works well. You must spray each section on dry hair before straightening, but it works well and the style holds all day and most of the next.</li>
            <li> I did not like it. it just sprays around thick in one spot I don&#x27;t like these kind anyway I don&#x27;t even know why I wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> as somebody who has had to start their hair growing process over many times, i can honestly say that i love all redken products. My hair is so much healthier. I especially love this product when applying heat to my hair .. my hair curls easily and straightens easily giving it an actual silk effect. I buy my products iin gift sets from salons since its cheaper and a im a student .. but i have had the same bottle for six months and im not even half way through it ..(i only flat iron my hair once a week)... its well worth a try and money. whoever buys it will most definately enjoy its effects... and as for the lady who said her hair is brittle... redken has another heat protectant that works as a spritz also that in a pink bottle that holds the hair.. maybe you purchased the wrong bottle</li>
            <li> I have been using Iron Silk 07 for about 2 years now. My hair is very thick and very coarse; it is very frizzy after blowdrying as well. Using Iron Silk before I flat iron my hair really makes an amazing difference. It makes my hair easier to flat iron and the results are smooth, silky, straight hair. When I flat iron my hair without using Iron Silk I can always tell the difference - it takes longer to get kinda close to the desired result, but I can always tell it&#x27;s just not the same look. The bonus for me is that it is also a thermal protectant and I really think that added factor has saved my hair from the flat iron heat day in and day out. I really recommend this product to anyone who has good results with their flat iron but want to take their look to the next level.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted my hair to be super straight and protected from the heat from the flat iron.  I really DO NOT like it.  The directions say to spray on your hair and then flat iron right away-it makes my hair wet and then it gets frizzy.  It does not make my hair straight, in fact I think it makes it more difficult to straighten using this product.  I wish I could return it! I does make my hair feel soft, but really this product does not live up to it&#x27;s name!!</li>
            <li> I have very long naturally curly hair, and last week got the second worst haircut of my life. The only solution, while waiting for the chunks (yes, chunks) to grow out and blend with the ends, was to flat iron it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The women at my local beauty supply suggested this Redken product.  Oh my God.  Instead of just lying flat, as it does when I just wash, condition, dry, and flat iron it, my hair got \\&quot;fat\\&quot; ... and not in a good or funky way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bottle does not spray evenly, but drips and drizzles, and the product, no matter how little I use, makes my hair sticky.  It&#x27;s three o&#x27;clock in the morning and fifty-eight degrees in my house, but I&#x27;m about to wash it because I just can&#x27;t stand the stickiness and the smell. (I didn&#x27;t mention that this stuff smells like a beauty salon, so I smell like chemicals rather than my perfume.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always respected Redken.  Not anymore.  I&#x27;m just going to wash, condition, use Infusium 23 leave-in, and then when I&#x27;m done, if I need something for the ends, I&#x27;ll use either Silk or Soy Renewal.  I&#x27;m returning the Redken this morning as soon as the shop opens.</li>
            <li> I use 02, 22, and 07.  These three make a great combo when straightening my hair but this is the one that was made for making your hair shiny, straight, and silky smooth.  I notice my hair looks perfect every time I use this product and I like the smell.  It&#x27;s a great product and the bottle is a generous size which lasts forever.  A little spritz goes pretty far with this one.  I recommend it for anyone who regularly straightens and colors their hair to keep it from becoming damaged.  Mine is damaged so I use this as damage control!</li>
            <li> I am new to the Redken line, but I have used many a costly hair product in the past.  This is one of the best flat iron sprays I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve found it also dries out my hair the slightest bit, which is helpful for days when I go without shampooing.</li>
            <li> i use this every day and love how it helps my hair stay healthy since i straighten my hair every day</li>
            <li> Works wonders if you have curly hair and use a flat iron to straighten it. Be sure to spritz a little before running the flat iron over it and it will keep your hair heathly and shiny.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all!! Its expensive and made my hair dull and weighed down. My hair Is thick and bleached so I&#x27;m not sure if that made it work different or not.</li>
            <li> I love this spray! I put it on my wet hair before blowdrying and it makes a significant difference in frizz and straightness by the blowdryer. I have noticed less breakage since I started using it and the smell is light</li>
            <li> This has been my FAVORITE heat spray since it came out.  The scent is amazing and reminds me of mens cologne, but fresh!  The seller sent the item as promised and it came promptly.  The best part about this product is its good on wet or dry hair, and does have minimal hold for styling purposes.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this spray and I love it..makes my hair shiny and soft...I&#x27;ve read some negative reviews about how it left hair tangled and sticky....but if you apply to wet hair (not dry like the bottle says) it works wonders</li>
            <li> I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO MAKE THIS UNTIL I USED IT. I SPRAY FEELS LIKE WATER AND SMELLS LIKE WATER.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist uses this product on my hair all the time. Unfortunately it is very difficult to find in store. This is the best product to use if you need to flatiron your hair. It helps tame the flyaway and provides frizz control in light rain and humid climate. This product smells great too. A little goes a long way. You have to be careful not to use too much spray otherwise your hair feels sticky. I have a lot of thick hair and I section off my hair. Most definitely a must if you flatiron your hair. This product makes your hair look beautiful, smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I gave the item 4 stars instead of 5 only becuase of apparent leakage of a small amount of product.  The product does it&#x27;s job, I like the ease of use and the discount I recieved.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this, and it makes her hair so smooth, shiny and straight!&lt;br /&gt;And it SMELLS so goood!&lt;br /&gt;Great product doesn;t dry her hair out when she uses a flat iron.</li>
