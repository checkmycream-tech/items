    <ol>
            <li>excellent conditioner(along with the shampoo)!</li>
            <li>Yes I called it delicious!</li>
            <li>The results are wonderful for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was impressed with its use on my hair when a hair designer used it.</li>
            <li>The smell is absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is awesome!</li>
            <li>Hmmm...great product line; not the best product for my frizzy, curly hair.</li>
            <li>As a leave in though, it was not the best for my hair.</li>
            <li>Great shipping!!</li>
            <li>This product is the best in-shower detangler I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and there have been many---this does the best job of softening and moisturizing my hair and keeping it that way.  </li>
            <li>It is the best conditioner ever.</li>
            <li>Love This Conditioner!!!</li>
            <li>Good !</li>
            <li>It gave my hair great slip.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I read some reviews about the best moisturing conditioners for permed and colored treated hair and this was in the top 3.</li>
            <li>So, I have started using some Tresemme in between and it seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li>but it definitely is good for some of us.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I will order more!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this conditioner that I will be ordering the liter from now on!</li>
            <li>great product, for fine, curly hair, has a nice protein umph.</li>
            <li>love it, love it,love it!</li>
            <li>Best conditioner I&#x27;ve used so far!  </li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I love this and will try to never be without it again.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and the shampoo is fantastic also!</li>
            <li>how much I love this conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It just makes my Af-Am curls SOOOO much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I intend to use this product for many years to come.</li>
            <li>Makes hair incredibly soft,lovely apricot like smell terrific product.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best Conditioners I&#x27;ve used on my natural curly hair, it deep conditions and is good for easy detangling.</li>
            <li>I have used products that were amazing the first one or two uses and then frizzed me out like a pomeranian by week</li>
            <li>I have baught this produce many times in the past and it smells wonderful, this bottle smelt rancid, would not buy again.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>If anyone is going natural and know what type of hair they have then this conditioner is perfect for natural curlies trying to avoid the alcohol and phosphates in hair products.  </li>
            <li>It detangles like NOTHING else, silicone free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great dynamic duo!  </li>
            <li>The shampoo, however, is fantastic and I use it weekly.</li>
            <li>as i used katin hair straitnet i had to use sulphat free Shampoo and conditioner, and i bought this product together with kratin hairstraitner  </li>
            <li>My daughters and I are transiting from a perm to natural and our hair is soft, easy to comb, moisturized and it looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>Is great for 3B. Plenty of slip for easy detangling, lightly moisturizes without weighing hair down and adds some silkiness.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It is great with detangling, but it made my hair very dry.</li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>so I tried a few things through out the years but after much experimenting there is nothing that is as rich, moisturizing and delicious as this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal user for 6 years...</li>
            <li>It is a great detangler and makes my very thick and curly hair very easy to comb.</li>
            <li>Iam a hairstylist and love it on my relaxed and natural clients!</li>
            <li>This product has really helped my hair look fabulous.</li>
            <li>I really see and feel a huge difference when using this.</li>
            <li>Love the way it leaves my hair feeling so soft and managable.</li>
            <li>My hair (2c) has never looked this good in my life; I thought that it&#x27;d be frizzy and rough forever!</li>
            <li>As I age, my hair needs more moisture, and I will never switch hair products as long as Elucence is available.</li>
            <li>Available at my high end salon for more than double the price of amazon!</li>
            <li>Tresemme leaves more frizz in my hair than this does, but alternating between the two seems to make this last longer for me.</li>
            <li>I have tried it many different way.</li>
            <li>and I have never had such healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Good for a daily conditioner, but still have to use another conditioner once a week for deep moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing. ..</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin cleared up around my forehead by using this conditioner and my scalp did not itch as much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>For a conditioner, the consistency is very dense.</li>
            <li>It detangles my texturized 3b/3c curls without much pulling.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this product back in 2005 and thought it was great but not amazing-</li>
            <li>Gentle to my hair; no excessive chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Great products even tho its a bit on the expensive side</li>
            <li>It really made my hair soft and workable.</li>
            <li>This is the first amazon review I&#x27;ve ever written, because I&#x27;m usually too lazy to write one, but everyone should know how great this brand is.</li>
            <li>the country that i live and wheni decided during xmas come to US ,i ordered this two and took it with me to Germany.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know my hair was naturally this spirally!</li>
            <li>it may be great for hair with very low porosity - they were obviously wrong.</li>
            <li>I tried this conditioner based on the reviews on naturally curly website and the price.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair moist and soft.</li>
            <li>So, I now use that one as a deep conditioning treatment and use this as my main cowash.</li>
            <li>The only thing that bothers me is that its high in proteins</li>
            <li>so if you are protein sensitive using this daily might make your hair a bit stringy/dry to the touch-</li>
            <li>It makes the hair so soft instantly! !!!!!</li>
            <li>I like it so far, though I haven&#x27;t had it for long.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> First of all, I always use hair products for at least 2 weeks before submitting a review.</li>
            <li> I just wish that it was easier to find as I can only buy it limited places on-line!</li>
            <li> A lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African-American with extremely low-porosity hair (when I do the strand test, the only way the strand will sink is if the water evaporates).  </li>
            <li> a hair was brittle and dry after using it.</li>
            <li> My only tiny complaints are that it does leave a residue on my scalp, and that it&#x27;s so hard to find.</li>
            <li> 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a part Puerto-Rican naturally curlied beauty with 3b extremely thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Brought back some life, no more dryness and dullness.</li>
            <li> Compared to other conditioners I&#x27;ve used--</li>
            <li> When I use a little, it is as if I haven&#x27;t used any conditioner at all</li>
            <li> I use A LOT of conditioner since I cowash everyday with it.</li>
            <li> A few tips that worked for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks my hair felt stronger and softer.</li>
            <li> Not really that tough to condition.</li>
            <li> I use the Elucence moisture acidifying shampoo (because I have hard water) and then I use this as a leave-in.</li>
            <li> Tresemme is definitely not as good as this.</li>
            <li> My other expensive salon brand curly conditioner was so moisturizing that it was causing my skin on my forehead to break out!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I just got a bad bottle or what.</li>
            <li> It smooths out the woodiness and split ends and gets out all those annoying knots.</li>

            <li> great product, for fine, curly hair, has a nice protein umph.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal user for 6 years...excellent conditioner(along with the shampoo)! It is very moisturizing. .. A lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Makes hair incredibly soft,lovely apricot like smell terrific product. Available at my high end salon for more than double the price of amazon!</li>
            <li> I first tried this product back in 2005 and thought it was great but not amazing- so I tried a few things through out the years but after much experimenting there is nothing that is as rich, moisturizing and delicious as this conditioner. Yes I called it delicious! It detangles like NOTHING else, silicone free. The only thing that bothers me is that its high in proteins so if you are protein sensitive using this daily might make your hair a bit stringy/dry to the touch- but for everyone else I&#x27;d imagine this as being Holy Grail material. I love this and will try to never be without it again. Love love love!</li>
            <li> Loveeeeeeeeeee it! So moisturizing</li>
            <li> This is one of the best Conditioners I&#x27;ve used on my natural curly hair, it deep conditions and is good for easy detangling.This along with the elucence moisture benefits s shampoo work wonders on my hair and hopefully yours. Try it!</li>
            <li> First of all, I always use hair products for at least 2 weeks before submitting a review. I have used products that were amazing the first one or two uses and then frizzed me out like a pomeranian by week 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a part Puerto-Rican naturally curlied beauty with 3b extremely thick curly hair. I tried this conditioner based on the reviews on naturally curly website and the price. I use A LOT of conditioner since I cowash everyday with it. I only use shampoo once a week. I needed a cheaper alternative. I tried this and I absolutely love it! A few tips that worked for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I have to use a lot of it. Using a lot seems to make a big difference. When I use a little, it is as if I haven&#x27;t used any conditioner at all and my hair does not look as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The texture of this is similar to Tresemme. So, I have started using some Tresemme in between and it seems to do a good job. Tresemme is definitely not as good as this. Tresemme leaves more frizz in my hair than this does, but alternating between the two seems to make this last longer for me. I will order the larger size of this next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I noticed my skin cleared up around my forehead by using this conditioner and my scalp did not itch as much. My other expensive salon brand curly conditioner was so moisturizing that it was causing my skin on my forehead to break out! So, I now use that one as a deep conditioning treatment and use this as my main cowash. The results are wonderful for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how this product might not work for all types of hair. Especially with the 4+, but it definitely is good for some of us. I say give it a try, the price can&#x27;t be beat and you never know what will work for your hair!</li>
            <li> Is great for 3B. Plenty of slip for easy detangling, lightly moisturizes without weighing hair down and adds some silkiness. Good for a daily conditioner, but still have to use another conditioner once a week for deep moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I like it so far, though I haven&#x27;t had it for long.  I was impressed with its use on my hair when a hair designer used it.</li>
            <li> Love This Conditioner!!! It makes the hair so soft instantly! !!!!! IT Smells Good ! Iam a hairstylist and love it on my relaxed and natural clients! I will order more!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and the shampoo is fantastic also! It&#x27;s a great dynamic duo!  Leaves my hair moist and soft. Used as a leave- in; detangling is a breeze.  The smell is absolutely wonderful! love it, love it,love it!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome! It is a great detangler and makes my very thick and curly hair very easy to comb. I just wish that it was easier to find as I can only buy it limited places on-line! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have baught this produce many times in the past and it smells wonderful, this bottle smelt rancid, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I did not like this conditioner. My mixed 3/c and 4/a hair was brittle and dry after using it. Not sure if I just got a bad bottle or what.</li>
            <li> Hmmm...great product line; not the best product for my frizzy, curly hair. The shampoo, however, is fantastic and I use it weekly.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I are transiting from a perm to natural and our hair is soft, easy to comb, moisturized and it looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> It is great with detangling, but it made my hair very dry. I have tried it many different way. I will try it as a deep conditioner next and see how that works. As a leave in though, it was not the best for my hair.</li>
            <li> For a conditioner, the consistency is very dense. For 4c/4d hair, it lacks. I bought it because I read somewhere it may be great for hair with very low porosity - they were obviously wrong.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair. Not really that tough to condition. This conditioner just doesn&#x27;t, well, condition. My hair ends up with lots of body, but it also ends up frizzy. I can&#x27;t speak to the detangling, because I don&#x27;t comb my hair after shampooing and conditioning.</li>
            <li> If anyone is going natural and know what type of hair they have then this conditioner is perfect for natural curlies trying to avoid the alcohol and phosphates in hair products.  After using this for a few weeks my hair felt stronger and softer. Great products even tho its a bit on the expensive side</li>
            <li> as i used katin hair straitnet i had to use sulphat free Shampoo and conditioner, and i bought this product together with kratin hairstraitner  but unfortunetly i couldnt find ths product in Germany the country that i live and wheni decided during xmas come to US ,i ordered this two and took it with me to Germany.</li>
            <li> It really made my hair soft and workable. It gave my hair great slip.I used it as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great product.  This product has really helped my hair look fabulous. Brought back some life, no more dryness and dullness. Great shipping!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how to put into words how much I love this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just makes my Af-Am curls SOOOO much more manageable. I really see and feel a huge difference when using this.</li>
            <li> This product is the best in-shower detangler I&#x27;ve ever used. It smooths out the woodiness and split ends and gets out all those annoying knots. The scent is clean, not overpowering. I intend to use this product for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve used so far!  I&#x27;m African-American with extremely low-porosity hair (when I do the strand test, the only way the strand will sink is if the water evaporates).  Compared to other conditioners I&#x27;ve used--and there have been many---this does the best job of softening and moisturizing my hair and keeping it that way.  My only tiny complaints are that it does leave a residue on my scalp, and that it&#x27;s so hard to find.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about the best moisturing conditioners for permed and colored treated hair and this was in the top 3. I am so pleased with this conditioner that I will be ordering the liter from now on!</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo,s with this conditioner and I have never had such healthy hair. As I age, my hair needs more moisture, and I will never switch hair products as long as Elucence is available. It is the best conditioner ever.</li>
            <li> Gentle to my hair; no excessive chemicals.  Not an alcohol based product.  Assist with healing damaged hair.  Overall good product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend recommended this product and I use this in conjuction with the shampoo. Love the way it leaves my hair feeling so soft and managable. It detangles my texturized 3b/3c curls without much pulling.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My hair (2c) has never looked this good in my life; I thought that it&#x27;d be frizzy and rough forever! This is the first amazon review I&#x27;ve ever written, because I&#x27;m usually too lazy to write one, but everyone should know how great this brand is. I&#x27;ve used a ton of no-poo/organic shampoo and conditioners, but after Elucence I&#x27;m never going to use anything else ever again. I use the Elucence moisture acidifying shampoo (because I have hard water) and then I use this as a leave-in. That&#x27;s all. I didn&#x27;t even know my hair was naturally this spirally!</li>
