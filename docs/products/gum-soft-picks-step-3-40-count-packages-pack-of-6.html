            <li>They fit in your pocket or purse for after lunch or a snack.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only a good product but</li>
            <li>These &amp;#34;toothpicks&amp;#34; are far superior to the wooden kind.  </li>

            <li>easy gentle way  to clean between teeth when flossing won&#x27;t work.</li>

            <li>These little picks are great for on the go \\&quot;flossing\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Def worth a buy, esp if you have root canal and crowns.  </li>
            <li>Our dentist suggested using these for routine dental maintenance and by golly, that was a useful suggestion.  </li>
            <li>These are good for older folks too, especially between meals or as a quickie cleanse.</li>
            <li>They feel really good against the gums, not as abrasive and hurtful as some other picks out there.</li>
            <li>There are times when floss is still necessary, but these are great for daily use.</li>
            <li>The soft picks were recommended by my Dental Tech along with a free sample.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>During my most recent teeth-cleaning appointment, the dental hygienist recommended these picks to me.</li>
            <li>They are soft and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>First, they come stuck together</li>
            <li>The soft textured material is easy on the gums, and gently massages the gums as you use them.</li>
            <li>They are flexible and can reach into back corners easily.  </li>
            <li>Contrast this with the Doctors brand which come already in a case with a flip top and a hole that can dispense a single pick at a time.  </li>
            <li>These were recommended by my dentist because I have large gaps between my teeth at the root</li>
            <li>Most of the kinds like this lose a little stability compared to their wooden counterparts, but of the brands I&#x27;ve tried, this one is durable as long as you line it up with the gap in your tooth as best as possible and don&#x27;t force it.  </li>
            <li>They work fine if you have enough space between your teeth, but they don&#x27;t hold up to teeth that are closer together.  </li>
            <li>good price, hard to find..........</li>
            <li>The improvement from the deep cleaning was good, but not nearly as good and as easy as the improvement that was quickly achieved through my using these Soft Picks.</li>
            <li>so very convenient to order.  </li>
            <li>Fast ship</li>
            <li>The whole family loves these brush picks.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really like any of them</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t think that would be very sanitary.</li>
            <li>Really helps your gums.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>They are so cost effective, I have enough to last for years.</li>
            <li>She wanted to know what I had been doing as the deep pockets in my gums had significantly improved.</li>
            <li>hygienist said that for teeth which have pockets that are beyond the normal range of 1-3 mm between the gums and the teeth, these picks can be very helpful.</li>
            <li>These are an innovative way to Clean between teeth - plain and simple !</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>The silicone tips with little studs on them really makes getting all the food out after lunch an extremely fast and pain free experience.  </li>
            <li>They are, as advertised, soft, with little brushes on the end, so they are much more comfortable against my gums than a sharp, plastic pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They break inside very easily, but at least I have a lot of them.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love the small case for using when I travel.</li>
            <li>By contrast, this actually gets food out from between my teeth while not disturbing my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>not just the Bridge.&lt;br /&gt;It is the cleanest my teeth have been in years.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by other picks, GUM is gentle, yet sturdy; doesn&#x27;t make your gums bleed, because it&#x27;s soft rubber, not hard plastic; and reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been using these G-U-M Soft Picks for about 6 months now.</li>
            <li>Was surprised to see that this was a lot cheaper than walmart and target.  </li>
            <li>I regularly order this product from this vendor and it is always packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>The first shipment was not complete.</li>
            <li>It completely cleans the space between your teeth and stimulates your gums without injuring them in any way.</li>
            <li>A fantastic product, with the exception of the environmental waste.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews of your Soft Picks, and decided to try them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She suggested coating the brush end of the pick with Listerine or hydrogen peroxide and working the brush end horizontally around the complete circumference of teeth with too-large pockets, rather than just inserting the tip between those teeth and the teeth on either side.</li>
            <li>My periodontist now raves about the condition of my gums when I go for visits, and they&#x27;ve said I don&#x27;t need to come in as frequently.</li>
            <li>I was instead supposed to try other products (one that looked more like a pipe cleaner, a water pick, a pink rubber tip you were supposed to use to poke in between your gums, etc.)</li>
            <li>The flat handle permits the user to reach all cracks and crevices in the mouth and gently remove any unwanted particles of food stuffs.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the way they work in-between the back molars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that because these actually have tiny little rubber brushes on them, that my gums feel squeaky clean after using them, much cleaner than if I&#x27;d just used floss.</li>
            <li>These gum soft picks really help to remove food and other debris stuck between the teeth.</li>
            <li>I sometimes will floss and then use the soft pick and am still able to get out other small particles of food.</li>
            <li>They are soft enough to not damage gums, but strong enough to last for a few cleanings.  </li>
            <li>They are made of soft enough material that I don&#x27;t feel like I am hurting my gums.</li>
            <li>I had enjoyed other GUM products in the past</li>
            <li>One reviewer wrote that they are too soft to be durable, but I only use them once, so I don&#x27;t know if they could last longer.</li>
            <li>I really like these little things.</li>

            <li> not just the Bridge.&lt;br /&gt;It is the cleanest my teeth have been in years.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by other picks, GUM is gentle, yet sturdy; doesn&#x27;t make your gums bleed, because it&#x27;s soft rubber, not hard plastic; and reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using these G-U-M Soft Picks for about 6 months now.</li>
            <li> Was surprised to see that this was a lot cheaper than walmart and target.  </li>

            <li> A fantastic product, with the exception of the environmental waste.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of your Soft Picks, and decided to try them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She suggested coating the brush end of the pick with Listerine or hydrogen peroxide and working the brush end horizontally around the complete circumference of teeth with too-large pockets, rather than just inserting the tip between those teeth and the teeth on either side.</li>
            <li> My periodontist now raves about the condition of my gums when I go for visits, and they&#x27;ve said I don&#x27;t need to come in as frequently.</li>
            <li> I was instead supposed to try other products (one that looked more like a pipe cleaner, a water pick, a pink rubber tip you were supposed to use to poke in between your gums, etc.)</li>
            <li> The flat handle permits the user to reach all cracks and crevices in the mouth and gently remove any unwanted particles of food stuffs.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the way they work in-between the back molars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that because these actually have tiny little rubber brushes on them, that my gums feel squeaky clean after using them, much cleaner than if I&#x27;d just used floss.</li>
            <li> These gum soft picks really help to remove food and other debris stuck between the teeth.</li>

            <li> They are soft enough to not damage gums, but strong enough to last for a few cleanings.  </li>
            <li> They are made of soft enough material that I don&#x27;t feel like I am hurting my gums.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using these G-U-M Soft Picks for about 6 months now. They feel really good against the gums, not as abrasive and hurtful as some other picks out there. I&#x27;ve tried many others including Stim-U-Dent and the ever popular Doctor&#x27;s Brush Picks which are also available on Amazon. I found those to be very stiff and hard against my gums and they felt like you could literally do some damage if used incorrectly. These by comparison feel better, but also seem to do the job better as well. I have both small tight gaps as well as larger gaps between my teeth. These work well in all of them. I particularly like the way they work in-between the back molars. I sometimes will floss and then use the soft pick and am still able to get out other small particles of food. I find that you will need two of them to finish the job in the mouth. One for the upper teeth and one for the lower teeth. What happens is that sometimes when you are using them in the back molars, the tip will bend and once that happens it is hard to use it anymore, so I always start with the front teeth and then move towards the back. I&#x27;ve noticed that because these actually have tiny little rubber brushes on them, that my gums feel squeaky clean after using them, much cleaner than if I&#x27;d just used floss. As they say, the proof is in the pudding: My last visit to the hygienist was the best I&#x27;ve ever had. She wanted to know what I had been doing as the deep pockets in my gums had significantly improved. About 5 years ago I had to go through the painful process of a deep cleaning where they have to numb a quarter of your mouth at a time so that they can clean below the gum line in an attempt to help improve the size of the pockets in the gums surrounding the teeth. This is a laborious process that took four visits to the dentist. Trust me, it&#x27;s better to not have to get to the point where this is needed! The improvement from the deep cleaning was good, but not nearly as good and as easy as the improvement that was quickly achieved through my using these Soft Picks.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. It helps one to maintain a clean and healthy mouth.  I use it after  I brush my teeth and it catches quite a bit of \\&quot;debris.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Was surprised to see that this was a lot cheaper than walmart and target.  Def worth a buy, esp if you have root canal and crowns.  Floss gets stuck on the crown sometimes.</li>
            <li> I bought these trying to save on packaging--usually they are sold as 40 count.  The company sent me 40 packs instead.  So this is false advertising.</li>
            <li> I regularly order this product from this vendor and it is always packaged very well.  It&#x27;s not only a good product but so very convenient to order.  My husband and I use these and often it&#x27;s difficult to find in the stores in our area.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described, well-packed, and in excellent condition.  I would order from them again since the service was so good.  I have used the product for quite a while and was glad to find an easier and less expensive way to buy it.</li>
            <li> The product is great. Just what I expect. The service was so-so.  The first shipment was not complete. I had to contact the vendor to get them to send the rest of the items ordered.  They responded and shipped the rest of the items.</li>
            <li> Good abd just as good as the wider ones...</li>
            <li> easy gentle way  to clean between teeth when flossing won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have used them for years.  The first in my routine is flossing with the usual floss then I use the dental floss needed by my 2 permanent bridges then finally I finish up by using the pics between each tooth.  With all the previous flossing, I still find a lot of food left behind.</li>
            <li> These are the best I&#x27;ve used.  I have implants and these are very effective in gently removing food particles.  The soft textured material is easy on the gums, and gently massages the gums as you use them. My hygenist even asked me what I use to keep my gums so healthy.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product to use along with my normal flossing and brushing routine -- it really feels good between the teeth when using --</li>
            <li> I feel a little guilty for throwing a couple of pieces of plastic into the trash every day, especially when I consider the amount of waste over my lifetime, because that is exactly how long I intend to use this product. It amazes me how much more effective this is than dental floss. It completely cleans the space between your teeth and stimulates your gums without injuring them in any way. A fantastic product, with the exception of the environmental waste.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast ship</li>
            <li> Perfect, travel case is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of toothpicks.  Most of the kinds like this lose a little stability compared to their wooden counterparts, but of the brands I&#x27;ve tried, this one is durable as long as you line it up with the gap in your tooth as best as possible and don&#x27;t force it.  Where it shines is in how comfortable it is.  I&#x27;ve had some that feel like wire bristles ripping your gums apart.  The silicone tips with little studs on them really makes getting all the food out after lunch an extremely fast and pain free experience.  On some of my teeth, this gets more out than dental floss can do for some reason.</li>
            <li> The soft picks were recommended by my Dental Tech along with a free sample.&lt;br /&gt;This is helping have better check-ups.  Prompt Delivery and I would recommend the product and the handling of the purchase.</li>
            <li> good price, hard to find..........</li>
            <li> habit forming and wonderful</li>
            <li> I have a Bridge, in the front.  The Dentist recommended the &#x27;threader&#x27; method, for cleaning between the bridge &amp; my own teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Then I read the reviews of your Soft Picks, and decided to try them.&lt;br /&gt;Every night, after cleaning my teeth, with regular floss, I use your Soft-picks, and go over every tooth again...not just the Bridge.&lt;br /&gt;It is the cleanest my teeth have been in years.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by other picks, GUM is gentle, yet sturdy; doesn&#x27;t make your gums bleed, because it&#x27;s soft rubber, not hard plastic; and reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;I also carry some, in my purse, for when I eat out.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON PRIME is the only way to go, when ordering online.  If they have your product, and it&#x27;s a PRIME product, you have free shipping, &amp; receive your item(s) within 3 days.  There &#x27;money back guarantee&#x27; is above reproach.&lt;br /&gt;This will be my 3rd Year, as a Member, and I&#x27;ve never been dissatisfied, with their service....regardless of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You AMAZON!

            <li> Great product - fantastic item for the care of your teeth!!!</li>
            <li> During my most recent teeth-cleaning appointment, the dental hygienist recommended these picks to me. For many years I had been using [[ASIN:B000ET4MTW Rotadent Rota-Point Interdental Cleaners]] as an adjunct to flossing, which is the same purpose of these soft-picks. The hygienist says these picks are the best on the market currently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these so much better than Rotadent! They are, as advertised, soft, with little brushes on the end, so they are much more comfortable against my gums than a sharp, plastic pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hygienist said that for teeth which have pockets that are beyond the normal range of 1-3 mm between the gums and the teeth, these picks can be very helpful. She suggested coating the brush end of the pick with Listerine or hydrogen peroxide and working the brush end horizontally around the complete circumference of teeth with too-large pockets, rather than just inserting the tip between those teeth and the teeth on either side. This allows the brush to get out all the debris of food in the tooth&#x27;s pockets on all sides, rather than just two sides. She further stated that this technique works really well to disrupt and remove the waste matter produced by the bacteria feeding off food debris in the pocket around the compromised tooth, thus preventing potential infection. Finally, she admonished me that anyone with a tooth pocket of 4 mm or above should consider that they have gingivitis, and take the situation very seriously. Once an infection in the tooth pocket progresses to the root area of the tooth and from there enters the bone, you are in danger of the infection spreading to all parts of the body through the bloodstream. Current research indicates that this type of bacteria is implicated in heart disease and cancer.</li>
            <li> These are good for older folks too, especially between meals or as a quickie cleanse. I use them every morning, and my dentist is happy with the results. I use floss at night, but morning is for the Soft-picks.</li>
            <li> Nice large box of picks !!</li>
            <li> So these are the best teeth picks bar none, the only issue is price.  The Amazon price is usually competitive if not the lowest.</li>
            <li> These soft picks are easy to use &amp; do a good job.  The small carrying case makes them convenient to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> These gum soft picks really help to remove food and other debris stuck between the teeth. When I go to the dentist, they comment on how healthy my gums look. That never happened before I started using these GUM soft-picks along with my sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and packed well. I have some small gaps in my teeth and gums. These have been the best thing ever! They are soft and comfortable to use. The little carrying case is awesome.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;toothpicks&amp;#34; are far superior to the wooden kind.  They are flexible and can reach into back corners easily.  I also like that they come with a small carrying case for pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> These have helped me avoid pariadontal work. They brought the gum line up extremely well after having braces. I use these and floss once a day, and now get excellent dental check-ups.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that makes your gums happy. Happy gums mean happy breath.  I was thankful to by these in bulk.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering and using these for quite a long time now and found that they are the best toothpick on the market.</li>
            <li> They are great for pushing cleaning between teeth. They are so cost effective, I have enough to last for years.</li>
            <li> They break inside very easily, but at least I have a lot of them.&lt;br /&gt;The rubber bristles don&#x27;t catch food or scrub plaque much, and they&#x27;re weak.</li>
            <li> I had recently tried a package of Doctors brand brushpicks and was very happy with them so I thought I&#x27;d give these a try.  I was disappointed and somewhat annoyed.  First, they come stuck together so you have to manually separate them and put them in the case.  Of course I washed my hands first, but fondling all my toothpicks before storing them for later use is not my idea of a good idea. Second, the case is not big enough to store all 40 picks so I had to find some alternative storage for the remainder.  Then later, I guess I&#x27;ll have to fondle the rest of them in order to reload the case.  Contrast this with the Doctors brand which come already in a case with a flip top and a hole that can dispense a single pick at a time.  Much more convenient and sanitary.  I had enjoyed other GUM products in the past but I won&#x27;t be getting these again unless they drastically change the packaging.</li>
            <li> My hygenist recommended these for a couple of weird spots in my mouth that are difficult to keep clean with floss. I really like these little things. They&#x27;re perfect for dislodging debris in those areas which are too wide for floss to efficiently clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how well this review holds up after my next hygiene appointment in several months.</li>
            <li> The whole family loves these brush picks.  Easier to use than floss, won&#x27;t splinter like a toothpick, and the dental hygienist approves.  There are times when floss is still necessary, but these are great for daily use.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend these enough! For me, this product was &amp;#34;the answer&amp;#34; to my gum disease (receding gums) problem. My periodontist recommended I stop flossing because I was slicing into my gums with the floss and causing more harm than good. I was instead supposed to try other products (one that looked more like a pipe cleaner, a water pick, a pink rubber tip you were supposed to use to poke in between your gums, etc.) but I didn&#x27;t really like any of them - they often made me feel like I wasn&#x27;t actually cleaning between my teeth. By contrast, this actually gets food out from between my teeth while not disturbing my sensitive gums. My periodontist now raves about the condition of my gums when I go for visits, and they&#x27;ve said I don&#x27;t need to come in as frequently. Try them!!!</li>
            <li> These were recommended by my dentist because I have large gaps between my teeth at the root and they are 100% better than floss.  I hate floss.  These are great, easy to use and have produced the results my dentist wanted.  I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
            <li> The brush picks I was using before were larger and had harder bristles which hurt my gums. These are small enough to reach into all the spaces I need to reach. They are made of soft enough material that I don&#x27;t feel like I am hurting my gums. They still have bristles, though. One reviewer wrote that they are too soft to be durable, but I only use them once, so I don&#x27;t know if they could last longer. However, I don&#x27;t think that would be very sanitary. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I alternate using these and dental floss.  I have larger spaces between my teeth, and these do a great job of cleaning my gums and teeth. I love the small case for using when I travel.</li>
            <li> These are an innovative way to Clean between teeth - plain and simple !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are not as strong as could be, but they work well and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> They work fine if you have enough space between your teeth, but they don&#x27;t hold up to teeth that are closer together.  They just bend and become useless.  They work well for the teeth that you are able to clean.</li>
            <li> These little picks are great for on the go \\&quot;flossing\\&quot;.  They come with a little plastic case that holds ten picks and that should be enough for a week depending on your usage.  They are soft enough to not damage gums, but strong enough to last for a few cleanings.  I have used them and my dentist says they do just as good a job as flossing.</li>
            <li> At the advice of my dentist, I have been using GUM Soft-picks every day for several years.  They are great for cleaning between teeth and are better on the gums than dental floss.</li>
            <li> Our dentist suggested using these for routine dental maintenance and by golly, that was a useful suggestion.  They work and do not tear up the gums, although they could if not used with sense.  The flat handle permits the user to reach all cracks and crevices in the mouth and gently remove any unwanted particles of food stuffs.  The pick part is flexible enough to assure the user that there is a reduced chance of bleeding gums although that can happen if that last piece just refuses to budge.  These picks are really effective and good.  Along with the other tools in our dental care box this is a standout for effectiveness.</li>
            <li> These are the easiest to use between the teeth cleaners I know.  They don&#x27;t do damage to the gum tissue and they are quick to use.</li>
            <li> They work, but break easily, and add to the landfill problems because they can&#x27;t be recycled.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about 2 years.  Really helps your gums.  The soft -pick is great if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Great quick and easy way to keep your teeth and gums clean and healthy at a reasonable cost. Great way to ensure less trips to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Great for permanent retainers. Very convenient. They fit in your pocket or purse for after lunch or a snack. Impress your hygeinist!</li>
