            <li>The brushes are each handcrafted from ultra-lightweight wood, allowing for optimal ease of use without compromising on flawless application.</li>
            <li>Flawless application will not be achieved with sub par tools.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes arrived at the perfect time for my experiment.</li>
            <li>I have 3 carrying cases and learned this is the best way to keep the bristles from getting damaged or picking up anything that may be looming in your cosmetic bag, train case or even drawer.</li>
            <li>so if need be and is perfect in size to carry in your purse&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>it came to the foundation brush, I tend to blend best with my fingers but always touch up under my eyes with a foundation brush.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality brushes.  </li>
            <li>The sleek carrying case that holds the 7 piece set is absolutely perfect for keeping up with my brushes.</li>
            <li>I placed a bright stripe of polish on each of the brushes declaring they were mine!</li>
            <li>They should be sold at nordstroms, because they are that great and look like something I would pick up if they were sold there.</li>

            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>Some companies blend some of the tips to give you the best of both worlds (i.e. synthetic with real), so I am not closed minded to those either.</li>

            <li>I have had free ones sent by cosmetic companies, brushes I bought a la carte, to full sets I purchased at Costco and let us not forget the make-up counter at department stores.</li>
            <li>High quality, superb resilience, and outstanding for everyday use, Xtava 7 piece makeup set is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Aside from the right makeup, there is one thing that is just as important to have when getting ready each day, nice makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>It is beautifully designed, I love the look of the case, and I love the overall set up as well as extra side compartment.</li>
            <li>Plus they&#x27;re super comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on cleanly</li>

            <li>The blending one was also good at applying concealer and highlighter to the upper arch area of my eye.</li>
            <li>and these were truly great like my other mac brushes.</li>
            <li>Featuring an extra zipper close pocket perfectly sized for your daily essentials, you might just be tempted to leave your purse at home!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>When it came to my bottom lashes, I used a shimmery shadow and opted to not wet the product, again the brush blotted nicely to where I wanted the shadow with zero flecks jumping onto my cheeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that Xtava does not believe in bleeding the pocket book like so many other companies do.</li>

            <li>a sucker for great packaging.  </li>
            <li>Recently, I had a chance to try the 7 Piece Makeup Brushes Set with Stylish Case by Xtava</li>
            <li>It comes in a stylish carrying case that makes organizing, storage and grabbing it for travel, such a breeze.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>The bb cream brush fell apart the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I do not use face powder with tint, but more of a finishing and setting powder that goes over my foundation and only in my T-zone areas.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure with all the above products</li>
            <li>and I only mind that when it&#x27;s a lot and thankfully with Xtava, it&#x27;s not. :)</li>

            <li>and I only mind that when it&#x27;s a lot and thankfully with Xtava, it&#x27;s not. :)</li>
            <li>Using the right makeup brushes and tools will not only help give you a flawless makeup look, but you&#x27;ll actually save money in the long run.</li>
            <li>This kit also has 2 different types of foundation brushes that are dense and are great for applying loose powder foundation or blush.</li>
            <li>The various types of bristles are nice for certain tasks - natural bristles for powder, synthetic for liquid.</li>
            <li>They really feel amazing on your face and not even rough at all!</li>
            <li>Finally a great lip brush that will stay clean and not collect random partials of stuff sticking to it, but also a cap</li>
            <li>Finally a great lip brush that will stay clean and not collect random partials of stuff sticking to it, but also a cap</li>
            <li>I love this brush set - every single brush in this set!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use them that often because none of my brushes really seemed to get a good solid line with them because they were not stiff enough and gave to much</li>
            <li>They hold makeup on the bristles well without absorbing the makeup.</li>
            <li>not so much so that you feel like your scratching at your skin.</li>
            <li>but I it  also works really well with my tubs of eyeliner gel/creams that I have.</li>
            <li>so I would wind up with more of a wide band.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>It would not take up much needed product space in my kit either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I got so much into my make-up,</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Xtava.  </li>

            <li>The kit really has a lot to offer.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>other favorite brush in the group</li>
            <li>other favorite brush in the group</li>
            <li>The tips of the brushes always went back to their original shape each time after use and wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has the companies name embossed on the front and when you snap it open each brush has a pocket/slot that it fits into and there is fabric both under the brushes and a piece that you can keep over the brushes to help keep both them and your bag clean.</li>
            <li>and I have full coverage, especially for my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The zipper pocket is handy to work as a clutch and toss in a small item.</li>
            <li>My 2 personal favorites are the full size blusher tool and the lip brush .</li>
            <li>I love that they come with a carry bag to keep them all together and also have a plastic cover to kepp them from making a mess.</li>
            <li>The brushes are made of high quality fibers that did not fall out when applying the makeup.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these brushes.  </li>
            <li>but not least, the lip brush.</li>
            <li>but not least, the lip brush.</li>
            <li>I found that they were all just the right amount of stiffness and softness necessary for each brush to do their job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 7 Piece Makeup Brushes Set with Stylish Case by Xtava is a great and complete set of brushes made from natural and synthetic bristles and ultra-lightweight wood that includes 1 Powder Brush, 1 Foundation Brush, 1 Contour Brush, 1 Blending Brush, 1 Eye Shadow Base Brush, 1 Angle Brush, and 1 Lip</li>
            <li>that all I know is I washed it when I finished and then realized, &amp;#34;oh, I was using the new brush&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>that all I know is I washed it when I finished and then realized, &amp;#34;oh, I was using the new brush&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>the brushes arrived, I quickly washed them and set them out to air dry.</li>
            <li>The blusher is large, natural feeling, soft, and fluffy with strong bristles.</li>
            <li>The next day I sat down with more of a brain and figured out it came apart...</li>
            <li>The next day I sat down with more of a brain and figured out it came apart...</li>
            <li>The brushes are extremely soft and didn&#x27;t streak my makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different brushes throughout the years from the cheap to the more expensive</li>
            <li>The angler is by far the stiffest of all of them, but</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well the bristles held up to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s economical and 4 of the brushes performed as well as my expensive branded ones and even my favorite ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s economical and 4 of the brushes performed as well as my expensive branded ones and even my favorite ones.</li>
            <li>You get the the best of the basics with this set: 1 Powder Brush, 1 Foundation Brush, 1 Kabuki Brush, 1 Precision Eyebrow Definer Brush, 1 Eye Shadow Base Brush, 1 Eye Shader Brush, and 1 Lip Brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing I really loved is the soft, black carrying/storage case with magnetic snaps the brushes come in that also has a zip pocket for storing small items.</li>
            <li>large powder brush dropped a few bristles (3 whole and one sectioned) but I attribute it to being new.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll use less product and your makeup will last longer and remain germ free.  </li>
            <li>Protection all the way around, though it is a bit bulky and won&#x27;t fit in a small purse so that is why I keep referring to a &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love the soft but sturdy clutch case makes midday or late night touch ups a breeze, and provides ultimate protection for your tools with fitted brush slots and a canvas cover flap to preserve the bristles.</li>
            <li>I have a large assortment of cosmetic brushes and price point does not guarantee a brush will perform well or even last with proper care.</li>
            <li>I love the precision I can get with the small brushes and the buff of the long kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, is a set I purchased at Costco that was being cleared out by a major brand.</li>

            <li>Really nice storage case for the brushes and an extra zip pocket for storing other small items.</li>
            <li>of the brushes are lightweight, easy to hold and use, very soft bristles and do not leave any streaks or poor makeup application appearance after use.</li>
            <li>Lightweight but substantial, this brush set comes in a variety of sizes to complete the basic tricks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty little head)</li>

            <li> The brushes are each handcrafted from ultra-lightweight wood, allowing for optimal ease of use without compromising on flawless application.</li>
            <li> Flawless application will not be achieved with sub par tools.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These brushes arrived at the perfect time for my experiment.</li>
            <li> I have 3 carrying cases and learned this is the best way to keep the bristles from getting damaged or picking up anything that may be looming in your cosmetic bag, train case or even drawer.</li>
            <li> so if need be and is perfect in size to carry in your purse&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> it came to the foundation brush, I tend to blend best with my fingers but always touch up under my eyes with a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality brushes.  </li>
            <li> The sleek carrying case that holds the 7 piece set is absolutely perfect for keeping up with my brushes.</li>

            <li> The brushes pick up product well and work great for blending as they are soft but also dense.</li>

            <li> Some companies blend some of the tips to give you the best of both worlds (i.e. synthetic with real), so I am not closed minded to those either.</li>

            <li> When I got this set in the mail it was love at first sight!</li>
            <li> I honestly did not expect much from this brush set by Xtava.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have had free ones sent by cosmetic companies, brushes I bought a la carte, to full sets I purchased at Costco and let us not forget the make-up counter at department stores.</li>
            <li> High quality, superb resilience, and outstanding for everyday use, Xtava 7 piece makeup set is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Aside from the right makeup, there is one thing that is just as important to have when getting ready each day, nice makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> It is beautifully designed, I love the look of the case, and I love the overall set up as well as extra side compartment.</li>
            <li> Plus they&#x27;re super comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on cleanly</li>
            <li> The brushes have strategic blends of both natural and synthetic bristles - which makes it perfect for use with different cosmetic products.</li>
            <li> The blusher is great for application but feels soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and will be replacing a frayed one of the same kind that needs to go to brush</li>

            <li> The blending one was also good at applying concealer and highlighter to the upper arch area of my eye.</li>
            <li> and these were truly great like my other mac brushes.</li>
            <li> Featuring an extra zipper close pocket perfectly sized for your daily essentials, you might just be tempted to leave your purse at home!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> When it came to my bottom lashes, I used a shimmery shadow and opted to not wet the product, again the brush blotted nicely to where I wanted the shadow with zero flecks jumping onto my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know that Xtava does not believe in bleeding the pocket book like so many other companies do.</li>

            <li> Recently, I had a chance to try the 7 Piece Makeup Brushes Set with Stylish Case by Xtava</li>
            <li> It comes in a stylish carrying case that makes organizing, storage and grabbing it for travel, such a breeze.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> The bb cream brush fell apart the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I do not use face powder with tint, but more of a finishing and setting powder that goes over my foundation and only in my T-zone areas.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure with all the above products</li>
            <li> and I only mind that when it&#x27;s a lot and thankfully with Xtava, it&#x27;s not. :)</li>

            <li> and I only mind that when it&#x27;s a lot and thankfully with Xtava, it&#x27;s not. :)</li>
            <li> Using the right makeup brushes and tools will not only help give you a flawless makeup look, but you&#x27;ll actually save money in the long run.</li>
            <li> This kit also has 2 different types of foundation brushes that are dense and are great for applying loose powder foundation or blush.</li>
            <li> The various types of bristles are nice for certain tasks - natural bristles for powder, synthetic for liquid.</li>
            <li> They really feel amazing on your face and not even rough at all!</li>
            <li> Finally a great lip brush that will stay clean and not collect random partials of stuff sticking to it, but also a cap</li>
            <li> Finally a great lip brush that will stay clean and not collect random partials of stuff sticking to it, but also a cap</li>
            <li> I love this brush set - every single brush in this set!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them that often because none of my brushes really seemed to get a good solid line with them because they were not stiff enough and gave to much</li>
            <li> They hold makeup on the bristles well without absorbing the makeup.</li>
            <li> not so much so that you feel like your scratching at your skin.</li>
            <li> but I it  also works really well with my tubs of eyeliner gel/creams that I have.</li>
            <li> so I would wind up with more of a wide band.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> It would not take up much needed product space in my kit either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I got so much into my make-up,</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Xtava.  </li>

            <li> other favorite brush in the group</li>
            <li> The tips of the brushes always went back to their original shape each time after use and wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has the companies name embossed on the front and when you snap it open each brush has a pocket/slot that it fits into and there is fabric both under the brushes and a piece that you can keep over the brushes to help keep both them and your bag clean.</li>
            <li> and I have full coverage, especially for my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The zipper pocket is handy to work as a clutch and toss in a small item.</li>
            <li> My 2 personal favorites are the full size blusher tool and the lip brush .</li>
            <li> I love that they come with a carry bag to keep them all together and also have a plastic cover to kepp them from making a mess.</li>
            <li> The brushes are made of high quality fibers that did not fall out when applying the makeup.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these brushes.  </li>
            <li> but not least, the lip brush.</li>
            <li> but not least, the lip brush.</li>
            <li> I found that they were all just the right amount of stiffness and softness necessary for each brush to do their job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 7 Piece Makeup Brushes Set with Stylish Case by Xtava is a great and complete set of brushes made from natural and synthetic bristles and ultra-lightweight wood that includes 1 Powder Brush, 1 Foundation Brush, 1 Contour Brush, 1 Blending Brush, 1 Eye Shadow Base Brush, 1 Angle Brush, and 1 Lip</li>
            <li> that all I know is I washed it when I finished and then realized, &amp;#34;oh, I was using the new brush&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> the brushes arrived, I quickly washed them and set them out to air dry.</li>
            <li> The blusher is large, natural feeling, soft, and fluffy with strong bristles.</li>
            <li> The next day I sat down with more of a brain and figured out it came apart...</li>
            <li> The next day I sat down with more of a brain and figured out it came apart...</li>
            <li> The brushes are extremely soft and didn&#x27;t streak my makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different brushes throughout the years from the cheap to the more expensive</li>
            <li> The angler is by far the stiffest of all of them, but</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well the bristles held up to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s economical and 4 of the brushes performed as well as my expensive branded ones and even my favorite ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s economical and 4 of the brushes performed as well as my expensive branded ones and even my favorite ones.</li>
            <li> You get the the best of the basics with this set: 1 Powder Brush, 1 Foundation Brush, 1 Kabuki Brush, 1 Precision Eyebrow Definer Brush, 1 Eye Shadow Base Brush, 1 Eye Shader Brush, and 1 Lip Brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I really loved is the soft, black carrying/storage case with magnetic snaps the brushes come in that also has a zip pocket for storing small items.</li>
            <li> large powder brush dropped a few bristles (3 whole and one sectioned) but I attribute it to being new.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll use less product and your makeup will last longer and remain germ free.  </li>
            <li> Protection all the way around, though it is a bit bulky and won&#x27;t fit in a small purse so that is why I keep referring to a &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love the soft but sturdy clutch case makes midday or late night touch ups a breeze, and provides ultimate protection for your tools with fitted brush slots and a canvas cover flap to preserve the bristles.</li>
            <li> I have a large assortment of cosmetic brushes and price point does not guarantee a brush will perform well or even last with proper care.</li>
            <li> I love the precision I can get with the small brushes and the buff of the long kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , is a set I purchased at Costco that was being cleared out by a major brand.</li>

            <li> Really nice storage case for the brushes and an extra zip pocket for storing other small items.</li>
            <li> of the brushes are lightweight, easy to hold and use, very soft bristles and do not leave any streaks or poor makeup application appearance after use.</li>
            <li> Lightweight but substantial, this brush set comes in a variety of sizes to complete the basic tricks.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought it , and I loved it so much so good</li>
            <li> This 7 piece makeup brush set is wonderful and high quality! It comes with a beautiful carrying case so you don&#x27;t lose the brushes and it makes a nice travel bag or just a bag to keep in your purse with a few little makeup samples in the zippered compartment. The brushes are extremely soft and didn&#x27;t streak my makeup. They hold makeup on the bristles well without absorbing the makeup. Plus they&#x27;re super comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved how soft the eyeshadow brush is. It held made my eye makeup look ten times better than it does when I use the applicators the eyeshadow comes with. My favorite brush is the lip brush. You have to use the lid to get the brush to open up by putting the lid on the end like a pen cap and it pushes the brush up. It holds a lot of lip color on it, but is thin so you can line your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this set. I&#x27;ve attached pictures to show what I looked like before I applied my makeup and after I applied my makeup using these brushes for EVERYTHING (except mascara)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a promotional period I had the opportunity to try this 7 piece makeup brush set in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I am super excited to have received and tried these brushes and so happy to have reviewed them. They are perfect to create an everyday look and or to spice it up and try bold smokey eyes and ext... Let your inner makeup guru shine threw ! I also love the soft but sturdy clutch case makes midday or late night touch ups a breeze, and provides ultimate protection for your tools with fitted brush slots and a canvas cover flap to preserve the bristles. Featuring an extra zipper close pocket perfectly sized for your daily essentials, you might just be tempted to leave your purse at home! The brushes are each handcrafted from ultra-lightweight wood, allowing for optimal ease of use without compromising on flawless application. Xtava brushes are truly featherweight champions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer I received this product for testing and review purposes my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> These were sent to me to test then share my opinion on-&lt;br /&gt;These were my first good set of brushes and now I am hooked.  For the price they are charging compared to the quality you are getting - you come out a winner.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference these brushes have made in the results of my makeup.  If you don&#x27;t own any- you might want to consider these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different brushes throughout the years from the cheap to the more expensive and I found this is one of my favorite sets that I am super excited to add to my collection! I received this brush set for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So first off the very first thing you would notice pulling it out of the box is the really sturdy well made case that it comes in. It reminds you a bit of a long wallet that is all black and snapped shut. It has the companies name embossed on the front and when you snap it open each brush has a pocket/slot that it fits into and there is fabric both under the brushes and a piece that you can keep over the brushes to help keep both them and your bag clean. It&#x27;s not a perfect seal so if you spilled something in your bag they could still get dirty or damaged, but just basic shuffling around and hanging about they will stay clean, and if not in a bag sitting on the counter or on a shelf the case will get dusty but it will keep the brushes from getting dusty. Likewise if you didn&#x27;t have a chance to clean and let our brushes dry and they have a bit of makeup on them they will not be rubbing up against other things in you bag getting them dirty. Protection all the way around, though it is a bit bulky and won&#x27;t fit in a small purse so that is why I keep referring to a &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so now for the brushes. I found that they were all just the right amount of stiffness and softness necessary for each brush to do their job. The angler is by far the stiffest of all of them, but not so much so that you feel like your scratching at your skin. This is meant for eyebrows but I it  also works really well with my tubs of eyeliner gel/creams that I have. I don&#x27;t use them that often because none of my brushes really seemed to get a good solid line with them because they were not stiff enough and gave to much so I would wind up with more of a wide band. This brush helps me get more of the sleek line you are going for with eye liners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other favorite brush in the group and I think is an absolute must have, if you can&#x27;t afford to buy the whole set at least purchase the lip brush by itself!!! Lip brushes piss me off because they never come with any type of cover yet tend to be the gooiest and messiest brush that you use! Once in awhile they come packaged with the thin tube to protect them while in shipping, but once you take it off it&#x27;s hard to keep putting back on without getting brush hairs caught and bending them backwards and ruining the brush slowly. Well they figured out an ingenious way to help keep your brush safe. When this arrived I was all what is this weird thing they put in my case. I was tired, it was late and night and it didn&#x27;t dawn on me I could pull the thing apart. The next day I sat down with more of a brain and figured out it came apart...but again no brush did I get a faulty one? I went back on here and read other peoples reviews and figured out I needed to put the cap back on the opposite end of the brush and that the brush would pop out! It not only has a cap, but it&#x27;s also retractable!!!! Finally a great lip brush that will stay clean and not collect random partials of stuff sticking to it, but also a cap so it&#x27;s not getting it&#x27;s goo on other stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now just because I really favor those two brushes doesn&#x27;t mean the rest are not great, they all worked fabulous for me needs and those two are just my favorites that stood out the most. If you can get the whole set do! If not at least get that amazing little lip brush! I have used the brushes for a couple of days, and I also put them through the wash and dry test and so far they are holding up just fine and I haven&#x27;t found them losing any hairs like some other cheap ones I have used in the past that start shedding immediately.of the sleek line you are going for with eye liners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other favorite brush in the group and I think is an absolute must have, if you can&#x27;t afford to buy the whole set at least purchase the lip brush by itself!!!

            <li> Obsessed with this set! These are truly amazing. I&#x27;m a huge mac person and when I got these I was amazed about how true/great quality they are! They should be sold at nordstroms, because they are that great and look like something I would pick up if they were sold there. I&#x27;m so glad they are sold on amazon or on their website. I was putting on my make up and these were truly great like my other mac brushes. I really love the foundation brush, the bristles stay in place and are superb when putting on any kind of foundation. They really feel amazing on your face and not even rough at all!</li>
            <li> The smell makes you feel uncomfortable. And I regret buying cheap brushes while the powder is expensive...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the powder contour and blush brushes for about 2 weeks everyday. No complaints. No shedding. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Using the right makeup brushes and tools will not only help give you a flawless makeup look, but you&#x27;ll actually save money in the long run. You&#x27;ll use less product and your makeup will last longer and remain germ free.  Flawless application will not be achieved with sub par tools.  As a makeup artist, I am a very critical of brush sets.  I honestly did not expect much from this brush set by Xtava.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a sucker for great packaging.  The carrying case did not disappoint.  It is very chic and small enough to be carried in your purse.  It would not take up much needed product space in my kit either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the bells and whistles are included here. Full face. Full eye set. And lips.  I was surprised how well the bristles held up to use.  They did not shed, even while cleaning.  You wont go wrong with this brush set.  I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product as a sample free of charge for testing and reviewing purposes.  I was not compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Great quality, both brushes and the case they come in, the retractable lip brush is amazing for on the go work. The brushes pick up product well and work great for blending as they are soft but also dense. The handles are nice and smooth, overall they are nice to look at, have good weight, and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Aside from the right makeup, there is one thing that is just as important to have when getting ready each day, nice makeup brushes. With the wrong brushes, you might as well not even waste your time applying makeup. Recently, I had a chance to try the 7 Piece Makeup Brushes Set with Stylish Case by Xtava and I was really happy with all of the items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7 Piece Makeup Brushes Set with Stylish Case by Xtava is a great and complete set of brushes made from natural and synthetic bristles and ultra-lightweight wood that includes 1 Powder Brush, 1 Foundation Brush, 1 Contour Brush, 1 Blending Brush, 1 Eye Shadow Base Brush, 1 Angle Brush, and 1 Lip Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the brushes are lightweight, easy to hold and use, very soft bristles and do not leave any streaks or poor makeup application appearance after use. My makeup goes on cleanly and I have full coverage, especially for my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I really loved is the soft, black carrying/storage case with magnetic snaps the brushes come in that also has a zip pocket for storing small items. This makes it very handy to take with me on a trip or anywhere I need my makeup brushes to come with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• Really nice storage case for the brushes and an extra zip pocket for storing other small items. Works great when taking them on a trip, to the gym, etc.&lt;br /&gt;• 7 piece makeup brush set covers many bases for applying makeup with the 1 Powder Brush, 1 Foundation Brush, 1 Contour Brush, 1 Blending Brush, 1 Eye Shadow Base Brush, 1 Angle Brush, and 1 Lip Brush.&lt;br /&gt;• Brushes are lightweight and comfortable to hold while using.&lt;br /&gt;• No makeup streaks or issues with applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• The only con, the brushes that came in my set are not the same types as listed on the website. They were a different combination. Regardless, I still have enjoyed using the brushes each day while applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am really happy with the 7 Piece Makeup Brushes Set with Stylish Case by Xtava and look forward to continued use each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion based upon my personal experiences</li>
            <li> I am a big makeup junkie and I love my makeup brushes. When I got this set in the mail it was love at first sight! I love this brush set - every single brush in this set! You get the the best of the basics with this set: 1 Powder Brush, 1 Foundation Brush, 1 Kabuki Brush, 1 Precision Eyebrow Definer Brush, 1 Eye Shadow Base Brush, 1 Eye Shader Brush, and 1 Lip Brush. I specifically love the fact that I get all the brushes that I need to &amp;#34;put my face on&amp;#34; and walk out of the door when using XTAVA&#x27;s Makeup Brushes Set Kit. It comes in a stylish carrying case that makes organizing, storage and grabbing it for travel, such a breeze. It is well priced, well made and the concept is well thought of. The brushes have strategic blends of both natural and synthetic bristles - which makes it perfect for use with different cosmetic products. The brushes with natural fibers work perfectly with powder products and the ones with synthetic bristles work wonderfully for my liquid foundations. I love the results I get every time I use these brushes. I am indeed a happy camper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, you can never go wrong with Eco-tools in my opinion...but I decided to try something else, and they were flimsy. The bb cream brush fell apart the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Lightweight but substantial, this brush set comes in a variety of sizes to complete the basic tricks. The various types of bristles are nice for certain tasks - natural bristles for powder, synthetic for liquid. Pros probably know that but it was news to me to read it in the listing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They blend well and work their magic; each in it&#x27;s own way. I love the precision I can get with the small brushes and the buff of the long kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a great case for travel. The zipper pocket is handy to work as a clutch and toss in a small item. I look forward to trying more products from this brand, I have had a few and each has been impressively professional in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great starter set, so it would be an excellent gift of choice for a budding beauty lover. I received a promotional discount for reviewing purposes and all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Make-up brushes seem to be all the rage these days, so I was excited to find a great set at an even better price. This kit comes with everything you need to achieve the perfect make-up look and is made for everyday use. The brushes are made of high quality fibers that did not fall out when applying the makeup. You will be able to achieve a smooth, blended finish without breaking the back in what you pay. The brushes are also easy to clean and that is also a must to keep your face looking good. I love that they come with a carry bag to keep them all together and also have a plastic cover to kepp them from making a mess. The brushes are sleek and stylish and would be great for the seasoned make-up user or even a beginner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A disclaimer and disclosure: * I received this product in exchange for a review. I was not compensated for my review and all my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product.

            <li> Makeup and I have a love hate relationship. I love the way it looks but hate having to put it on and the way it feels on my skin. If I can feel it, it&#x27;s gone! Some suggested that I try applying the makeup with brushes and using the powder based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes arrived at the perfect time for my experiment. Of course I had to snag them back from the teens that call &amp;#34;dibbs&amp;#34; on anything beauty related that arrives here for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes have made a nice difference in how I feel about wearing makeup. The set contains seven different styles and types of brushes including a Powder Brush, a Foundation Brush, a Kabuki Brush, a Precision Eyebrow Definer Brush, a Eye Shadow Base Brush, a Eye Shader Brush, and a Lip Brush.&lt;br /&gt;A nice case protects the brushes between uses and keeps them all together. With teens in the house, anything beauty related seems to end up in their dressing room. I placed a bright stripe of polish on each of the brushes declaring they were mine! LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that it took some time to learn to use the various brushes. I do have my favorites and those are the blusher and the lip brush. The blusher is great for application but feels soft and gentle. The lip brush has made a big difference in how long the lip color stays on with it being applied correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit would be a great gift for a young lady learning to use makeup. It would also be a nice addition to a gift basket for mom along with a gift certificate to her favorite store for new makeup or make over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> I have a large assortment of cosmetic brushes and price point does not guarantee a brush will perform well or even last with proper care. I have had free ones sent by cosmetic companies, brushes I bought a la carte, to full sets I purchased at Costco and let us not forget the make-up counter at department stores. This taught me a lot about how a brush is made matters and where a synthetic one is needed for such application and where a &amp;#34;real hair&amp;#34; one will only do. Some companies blend some of the tips to give you the best of both worlds (i.e. synthetic with real), so I am not closed minded to those either. My motto is to always have two of each style I can count on and if one does not work, it gets used in an art project or if it has no hope (drops every bristle ever put on it&#x27;s pretty little head), it gets sent into the trash can. The last thing I want is looking like a cat lady with bristles all over me when I don&#x27;t even own a cat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xtava is a company I have reviewed for in the past, so when they offered their make-up brushes for review, this was a new territory for me. I have reviewed hair tools but not cosmetic ones and you bet I was eager to see what they were all about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the box arrived from Xtava, I loved the carrying case because each brush has a home. I have 3 carrying cases and learned this is the best way to keep the bristles from getting damaged or picking up anything that may be looming in your cosmetic bag, train case or even drawer. It also ends the hunting game in finding the one you need, like that eye-liner (slanted one) that likes to hide because sticks on brushes look all alike when you woke up late in the morning to get ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xtava supplied me with seven gorgeous brushes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large Powder Brush- for foundation powders to setting/finishing powders&lt;br /&gt;Medium Foundation Brush- that I use for my wet foundation and to blend out any concealer I went to heavy on&lt;br /&gt;Contour Brush- that can be used as a blush one too and/or with bronzers and luminizers&lt;br /&gt;Eye-shadow Brush- which is the perfect width to apply shadows, both wet and dry&lt;br /&gt;Blending Brush- that I use to define the arch above my eye to blending out creases and let us not forget the perfect smokey eye look&lt;br /&gt;Angle Brush- that saves me money and creates a better look when you use your eye-shadow to create your own eyeliner and/or can be used to set powder/wax on your eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;Lip Brush- which collapses so if need be and is perfect in size to carry in your purse&lt;br /&gt;When the brushes arrived, I quickly washed them and set them out to air dry. The following day, I began playing and applying a variety of versions of the same cosmetics I have. I used baked eye-shadows, loose powder to the type you just dab and don&#x27;t blend. The eye-shadow brush did well with all, as did the blending one. The blending one was also good at applying concealer and highlighter to the upper arch area of my eye. Both brushes I washed in between uses and after use, and I only saw one shed one bristle onto a towel when I dried it. The tips of the brushes always went back to their original shape each time after use and wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came to the foundation brush, I tend to blend best with my fingers but always touch up under my eyes with a foundation brush. The Xtava one performed just as well as my $50 one from Prescriptives. I could not tell the difference between the side I used one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large powder brush dropped a few bristles (3 whole and one sectioned) but I attribute it to being new. I do not use face powder with tint, but more of a finishing and setting powder that goes over my foundation and only in my T-zone areas. I was happy with the application but this was the only brush out of the entire set that I was luke-warm about. I did not dislike it or love it, but it gets kept just in case my favorite one fails me one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contour brush, I used to apply bronzer tomy cheeks and a little on my nose, chin and forehead. I just like to slightly warm up my face but never to achieve any fake-o tan look. The brush picked up each time the proper amount of powder and distributed it evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angle brush, I used to apply a wet baked shadow to create both a &amp;#34;cat&#x27;s eye&amp;#34; and to apply half way to the bottom lashes using dry eye-shadow. The brush did what I told it to do and that is a plus in my book. I know I can always correct using q-tips but I aim when doing my own line, to never need it. I slightly arched the ends and the liner applied beautifully on top. When it came to my bottom lashes, I used a shimmery shadow and opted to not wet the product, again the brush blotted nicely to where I wanted the shadow with zero flecks jumping onto my cheeks. This is my favorite and will be replacing a frayed one of the same kind that needs to go to brush heaven!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, the lip brush. I use lipsticks, tints and glosses and sometimes even powder to create the look I want. Half the time I only know I start with a lip balm first to hydrate my lips while I do my make-up and then I throw everything (blotting in between a few times) until I create the look I want. I used the brush and I&#x27;m sure with all the above products but I got so much into my make-up, that all I know is I washed it when I finished and then realized, &amp;#34;oh, I was using the new brush&amp;#34;. That is a good thing because it means it did not disrupt &amp;#34;the process&amp;#34; and did what I wanted it to, when I need it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;For $20 the only other set that surprised me and I still have brushes from years later, is a set I purchased at Costco that was being cleared out by a major brand. It&#x27;s one of those things I had to grab then because that chance and price point would never come to fruition ever again. It&#x27;s nice to know that Xtava does not believe in bleeding the pocket book like so many other companies do. It&#x27;s economical and 4 of the brushes performed as well as my expensive branded ones and even my favorite ones. There was no difference other than the price point and I only mind that when it&#x27;s a lot and thankfully with Xtava, it&#x27;s not. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Xtava.

            <li> Quick delivery.  Excellent quality brushes.  I would highly recommend these brushes.  After all these years these are my first brushes I have ever owned and they were well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> High quality, superb resilience, and outstanding for everyday use, Xtava 7 piece makeup set is fantastic. I usually end up losing makeup brushes or they simply get worn out over time. Having 2 teenage daughters that &amp;#34;share&amp;#34; my stuff doesn&#x27;t help at all either lol. The sleek carrying case that holds the 7 piece set is absolutely perfect for keeping up with my brushes. They stay organized and in one place. This is a great asset to me. It is beautifully designed, I love the look of the case, and I love the overall set up as well as extra side compartment. The case is very light, easy to use, and would be excellent for traveling or overnight stays with friends.&lt;br /&gt;There are 7 different styles and types of brushes here. The kit really has a lot to offer. The wide variety is a great motivating factor for wanting to try this set. My 2 personal favorites are the full size blusher tool and the lip brush . The blusher is large, natural feeling, soft, and fluffy with strong bristles. And the lip brush is just the right size to dunk in my lip gloss and apply with precision. I like the fact that it is retractable as well. The kit also includes brushes for the eye area. 2 different eye shadow/shader brushes and 1 for well defined eyebrows. This kit also has 2 different types of foundation brushes that are dense and are great for applying loose powder foundation or blush. I am very thrilled with this makeup brush set. It is extremely nice, has superior quality, and works super well for me. I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review. All opinions expressed are truly my own.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect for someone who wants a complete set of brushes to do a full face makeup! The quality is pretty good and the fibers of the brushes do not shed upon application. I love that this kit covers every brush from contouring your face makeup to eye shadow to your lips. The case even has a zipper compartment that could fit eyeliner and mascara. Definitely the perfect kit to bring for traveling and on the go makeup.</li>
