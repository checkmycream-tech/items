            <li> I use it for my hair, I think is working but need more time to see, I don&#x27;t expect much of it, just to make my hair to look softer and stop the breakage from the iron and a year of taking some meds that made my hair weak and thin.</li>

            <li> Not as smelly as some other brands i have tried.</li>
            <li> It kept the itching from happening and the dried skin came off every time I used it.  </li>

            <li> I am using this product with a mixture of other products to help with a foot injury.  It works great.</li>
            <li> I have used many oils for my hair, advocado, coconut, apricot kernel. I originally bought this for my skin but I decided to try it only hair when dry and then roll it up with satin covered sponge rollers. My hair has never been more shiny. Mustard oil is everything! My hair loves it.</li>
            <li> Quick response from seller and it is a great product.  Even though it is yellow it does not smell like mustard.  I used on my sunburn for about two weeks and it was amazing.  It kept the itching from happening and the dried skin came off every time I used it.  My leg feels and looks 100% better.  H&amp;B Oils you rock!</li>
            <li> Mustard oil is used in Indian cooking to add the smoky flavor to dishes especially dishes from Bengal and its surrounding region. You can buy cheaper varieties of mustard oil at the Asian market but most of these products are blended with other vegetable oils.&lt;br /&gt;This product is 100 percent mustard oil. When using this oil make sure the oil turns smoky because that makes it lose all its pungency while adding a deep flavor.&lt;br /&gt;There are also other uses for this oil for moisturizing, hair oil and as a massage oil. I have not tried it for these uses other than cooking.</li>
            <li> It appears to be meeting my needs</li>
            <li> Have not seen any difference with use.</li>
