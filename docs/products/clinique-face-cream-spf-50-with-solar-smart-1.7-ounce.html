            <li> I love it .....This product is great for my skin....It works great.....</li>
            <li> So far so good!  But it is too small for the price!</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive &amp; I&#x27;m also outdoors a lot. So I&#x27;ve tried many brands. Almost all sunblocks run into my eyes after a while. Plus, they tend to fade after an hour or so, especially in high altitude, and I get burned anyway. Or, there&#x27;s junk in them so my face breaks out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clinique product does none of those things - it&#x27;s perfect! The other day I was outdoors for 5-6 hours, and I have a nice tan on my face now. No breakouts, and no stinging eyes. It&#x27;s worth the money, this is the best sunblock for sensitive skin around.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and I luv it!</li>
            <li> Hace lo que deberia hacer. Protege del sol muy bien. Para mi, no se necesita otra de mayor SPF ya que esta funciona perfectamente.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product labeled for sensitive skin...After 24 hours of the initial use.....My entire clear skin broke into a rash. My face was literally covered in rashes. I stopped using this product and after a month my rash dissapeared. Please do a 24 hours patch test before applying on face!</li>
            <li> love this as much as any clinique product&lt;br /&gt;easy to carry&lt;br /&gt;two things in one:  daytime moisture and sunscreen</li>
            <li> A little thick for every day use in southern heat. But works well</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister in law and loved it!</li>
            <li> excellent I am very satisfied God bless you</li>
            <li> pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;it is pretty good&lt;br /&gt;deliever so fast&lt;br /&gt;i use this now pretty good cover my body feel moist</li>
            <li> Got this specifically so I wouldn&#x27;t break out and it broke me out worse than any other ones did!!!! So disappointed. My other Clinique products are good...but this wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My skin is fair and I use sunscreen every day, rain or shine.  With age, I&#x27;m looking for something more moisturising and this stuff is perfect.  It has high SPF, ingrediants that are good for the skin and it absorbs nicely without leaving a chalky look.  Pricey perhaps but I have read that the SPF 50 body cream is the same and more cost effective.</li>
            <li> This product is very good for my pregnancy&lt;br /&gt;I been looking for something like this very tinkle I love it</li>
            <li> This  product applies very smoothly. It&#x27;s not gressy and non fragrant.  I use it as a sunscreen and a facial&lt;br /&gt;cream . It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy under my foundation either.. I love this product,</li>
