            <li>Wonderful design for both straightening and waving hair</li>
            <li>I say it is very good.  </li>
            <li>However this product is great if you are on a college student budget. :D</li>
            <li>, I am one happy camper since this can be the best styling tool for home and travel...</li>
            <li>is a very nice product, u don&#x27;t feel like is burning your hair when u use it, also very good price</li>
            <li>Found it on Amazon and am really happy.</li>
            <li>I use the curling iron 365 days a year, and am perfectly happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these before and have been happy.  </li>
            <li>i thought hey thats a great gift idea.</li>
            <li>Very handy cause</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase :)</li>
            <li>from people who see the gorgeous results of this item;</li>
            <li>But I have decided to go on with purchasing it because money-wise, it is a good deal to try out.   </li>
            <li>This works good as a straightener.</li>
            <li>As a curling iron not so good.</li>
            <li>This item is a good product because its 2 in 1.  </li>
            <li>When it was functional, it worked fairly well on my wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair tends not to hold a style well, but the straightening held up fairly well throughout a day at school.  </li>
            <li>&amp; the straightener is good but curler is not, they both pull your hair.</li>
            <li>I loved the 2 in 1 curler and iron.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved this curling iron.</li>
            <li>good iron for the price.</li>
            <li>was a good buy.</li>
            <li>On special occasions, I will use the curling function and it works great!</li>
            <li>My Hair Has Never Looked More Beautiful Than After Using This Product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my daughters and they are very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has it because I cannot find it in stores anymore!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing combination for layered hair styles.</li>
            <li>but for this reason it would be nice if it had dual voltage functionality.  </li>
            <li>It also has dual voltage which comes in handy if you like to travel.  </li>
            <li>The curling iron did not always work that well, often, when I arrived at school the curls kind of died.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s the best out there for both straightening and curling when it&#x27;s a brand new device.</li>
            <li>i am so happy i got it , great value, works perfectly: fast and makes me look like i just stepped from Hair Salon; you will be not disappointed at all; i use it every day, no complains</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with its temperature, since I need something REALLY hot to get the job done for my curls.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s also do a good job on my hair with both functions, it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s not as convenient as if you use one tool for each function, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>like many reviews have mentioned, the straightening works.</li>
            <li>You will get better results straightening with a dedicated-purpose ceramic straightener .. but won&#x27;t have the curling iron function too.  </li>
            <li>I like the convenience of the 2-in-1 product but wish it was better made.</li>
            <li>i love you curling iron</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>This has happened more than once.    </li>
            <li>This is great for shoulder length hair to longer hair and is a very versatile styling tool.  </li>
            <li>With a proper adapter plug this worked great!</li>
            <li>I love mine.</li>
            <li>I love the concept of this product and it does get the job done of straightening the hair, while giving it bend on the ends.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with the price of this product and the reviews were promising.</li>
            <li>purchased one of these at Kmart and just fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Creative design.</li>
            <li>many heating settings to prevent burning your hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Perfect combination of flat iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li>I use a Conair flat iron that I&#x27;m very happy with.</li>
            <li>I always liked conair&#x27;s product, this time, honestly, it&#x27;s not bad, at all.</li>
            <li>It heats very quickly</li>
            <li>I figured with all the reviews being so high it would be a good one, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li>Great for travel when you only have room to pack one ..</li>
            <li>Heat light and turbo lights let you know when on.</li>
            <li>Great product, at least good for the money.</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine, and I found that when I tried to straighten it, my hair would just slip right through the iron!  </li>
            <li>I had to get used to the need to hold it shut to straighten but now prefer it as it is more exact and precise on what I want to do.</li>
            <li>Nicely straightens hair but also enables you to create a soft curl vey easily.  </li>
            <li>I placed a woogie to hold it together and have been happily married with it since until october 2011 when the clack covering to the top broke off</li>
            <li>So, originally buying this product, I hoped to use it for the dual function of straightening and curling.</li>
            <li>this does the job of a flat iron and curling iron so - 2 products in 1.  love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>With the multiple heat settings, I always get good results.    </li>
            <li>However, the magic of this appliance really comes into play when traveling.</li>
            <li>The only thing that was good is that it arrived in 2 days.</li>
            <li>I like that the tips stay cool and has a resting arm for the countertop.</li>
            <li>Handle grip is comfortable and a good length (considerate for those with larger hands), its also stylish and professional looking.</li>
            <li>I am so Happy about amazon right now I owned one of this and the handle broke, I searched Hi and Low and coudlnt find a replacement, I looked in Amazon and sure enough its where I found it</li>
            <li>I have unruly hair and this makes getting ready easy.</li>
            <li>The higher than &#x27;average&#x27; heat level is great.</li>
            <li>but it gets the job done and is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it was probably worth what it cost.  </li>
            <li>overall, if you don&#x27;t have a high expectation and want a more natural feel of the effect it brings, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>Also the thing to choose what temperature you  want is right underneath the hand</li>
            <li>Product literally broke right after the return period was over.</li>
            <li>I usually spend about 5-10 minutes with this product in the morning, and its great because I dont have to heat up two irons.</li>
            <li>It really does heat up quickly and performs well.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly; by the time I&#x27;m done with washing my face and brushing my teeth, its ready to go.</li>
            <li>I decided to keep it because I liked the curls, but this weekend, the whole gizmo popped apart; the tiny screw on one side came out, fell into the oblivion of my tile, and now, the unit is inoperable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stays hot and works great on thick curly hair and is able to go from curling iron to straightener in one simple step.</li>
            <li>First one lasted almost three years until I dropped it</li>
            <li>Highly recommended - I will buy again if/when this one breaks!!</li>
            <li>This is my first curling/straightening iron.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine several years, many trips with no problems.</li>
            <li>My first one still works after many years of daily use.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can straighten my hair and curl it too all with the same tool.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>Luv this curling iron and continue to hope that I will be able to purchase another in the future.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of not having to have two appliances going at the same time.</li>
            <li>A week after my family member received the gift, they made me aware that it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Not even the seller of this item is willing to help me now.</li>
            <li>Quick heat up and cool down, and easy to adjust the temperature.  </li>
            <li>After a good solid 5 years of use, the latch that you use to lock the plates together to make it into a curling iron broke, so now I&#x27;ll instantly buy another.</li>
            <li>This one wasn&#x27;t good and more expensive than all others.</li>
            <li>It works fast and really does make their hair feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I had good past experience with a conair iron/straigtener.</li>
            <li>The large barrel is great for turning the end of hair under, or adding a subtle wave (not tight curls) and the straightener is adequate.  </li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t expect to get any great curls out of the barrel, because it&#x27;s too awkward to work with easily.</li>
            <li>it was so hard because I wasn&#x27;t sure how to hold it comfortably.</li>
            <li>But still a very neat idea.</li>
            <li>She loves it so much she does not want anything else.  </li>
            <li>and I really wanted something to do my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very wavy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as a fast way to get ready in the morning...</li>
            <li>I have straight across bangs, so I would use the curler to curl my bangs and the straightener for the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>FAST EFFIEICENT SERVICE.  </li>
            <li>I am really intrested on why I havent received this product yet???</li>
            <li>I need a curling iron to give my hair volume, but I like the bottom to be straight.  </li>
            <li>Thus, I really don&#x27;t use it anymore.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like my hair is being really damaged.  </li>
            <li>I have attempted to contact the seller and received no reponse regarding the price--I just wanted to know if this was really the price, or if it was a typo.</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>I bought this iron to replace my previous Conair heat iron/straightener after at least 5 great years of service!</li>
            <li>It does not heat as fast as I thought it would be, but still quick enough.</li>
            <li>When using it as a straightener, hair gets caught under the hot plates and has to be ripped out before it completely burns off.</li>
            <li>but the curl is a little two big for me, and the straightener doesn&#x27;t work as good as the curler.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this!</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace one that I had previously (but had dropped too many times and it eventually quit working).</li>
            <li>I have older products used for longer that do not have this problem.</li>
            <li>If you have decent hair to begin with, go for it.</li>
            <li>This item comes with a high recommendation from both of them.</li>
            <li>Multiple heat settings and it will get hot!</li>
            <li>However, in my opinion it takes a super long time to heat up.  </li>
            <li>my daughter loves, your new fancy hair</li>
            <li>I expected this to last more than 3 years.  </li>
            <li>I love this product arrived very quickly, earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>My hair is very brittle so this is a major plus for me.</li>
            <li>I have to say that while this curling iron/flat iron product does some of both - being a curling iron and a flat iron, it really doesn&#x27;t do either very well for my hair.</li>
            <li>The hot outside plates often created a hazard for me while I straightened.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I felt compelled to write a review on this specific product because in no lifetime should this curler/straightener cost over $200.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough positive things about this flat/curling iron.</li>
            <li>Love the versatility of a two-in-one flat iron and curling iron, but this is a little clunky and doesn&#x27;t quite get hot enough,</li>
            <li>I got really long hair, so this is nice cuz it has a larger diameter than other product.</li>
            <li>I have frizzy and thick hair, so sometimes it is hard to straighten, but definitely works excellently for the price paid.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that you have to be very careful when you try to do your hair bangs, it easily burn your forehead since there&#x27;s no plastic protection around the straighter.</li>
            <li>just wow, wow, wow</li>
            <li>I have owned this duel purpose curling iron/flat iron for years, and really appreciated it especially when I travel.</li>
            <li>(By the way, my hair is medium/fine, I&#x27;m white, and my hair is mostly straight except for going-to-bed-with-wet-hair bumps and the dying effects of a perm)     </li>
            <li>/&gt;I bought this back in March when I found a seller who had one for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The grip is easy to hold and use even with small hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea, and might work better for people with thicker hair, but I found it to be a waste. :(</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t nearly as &#x27;friendly&#x27; as the CD99, the switch to use the flat iron is really hard to use at the end of the iron as opposed to the CD99, which is right on the handle.  </li>
            <li>The outside and inside of the iron gets hot so even if you just want to straighten your hair, the outside is hot and you cannot touch it without getting burned, this made it hard to get to the scalp too because it couldn&#x27;t get the right angle.</li>
            <li>You have to be extremely careful with it because it gets really hot.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dirt cheap, though, so if you&#x27;re only going to use it a few times a year (or less), it might be worth it.</li>
            <li>So I would normally have to use a curling iron, and then a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider this to be a major loss.</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommended this product if you regularly straighten your hair and add a bit of volume by curling it afterwards.</li>
            <li>and of course, you need to be careful where you hold it because the whole barrel heats up.  </li>
            <li>The locking switch to change from curl to straight is changed with a flick of a switch, you don&#x27;t have to hold it closed as someone else reported.</li>
            <li>The curling iron is certainly an innovative idea, but poorly executed.  </li>
            <li>It heats well but isn&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>Black tips aren&#x27;t too hot to hold when curling.</li>
            <li>Was a little strange getting use to having both in one, but overcame that quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to find this at all the local stores and apparently Conair has discontinued this model.</li>
            <li>When she first started using it she dropped it a few times.  </li>
            <li>There is a black piece that you push with your thumb to clamp the hair, but it can be very straining after awhile.</li>
            <li>She was young and clumsy when we first got it.  </li>
            <li>It is super easy to switch from curling iron to flat iron and is way less expensive than a flat iron.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love the product!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has it because I cannot find it in stores anymore!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing combination for layered hair styles.</li>
            <li> but for this reason it would be nice if it had dual voltage functionality.  </li>
            <li> It also has dual voltage which comes in handy if you like to travel.  </li>
            <li> The curling iron did not always work that well, often, when I arrived at school the curls kind of died.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s the best out there for both straightening and curling when it&#x27;s a brand new device.</li>
            <li> i am so happy i got it , great value, works perfectly: fast and makes me look like i just stepped from Hair Salon; you will be not disappointed at all; i use it every day, no complains</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with its temperature, since I need something REALLY hot to get the job done for my curls.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s also do a good job on my hair with both functions, it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s not as convenient as if you use one tool for each function, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> like many reviews have mentioned, the straightening works.</li>
            <li> You will get better results straightening with a dedicated-purpose ceramic straightener .. but won&#x27;t have the curling iron function too.  </li>
            <li> I like the convenience of the 2-in-1 product but wish it was better made.</li>
            <li> i love you curling iron</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  </li>
            <li> This has happened more than once.    </li>
            <li> This is great for shoulder length hair to longer hair and is a very versatile styling tool.  </li>
            <li> With a proper adapter plug this worked great!</li>
            <li> I love mine.</li>
            <li> I love the concept of this product and it does get the job done of straightening the hair, while giving it bend on the ends.  </li>
            <li> I was happy with the price of this product and the reviews were promising.</li>
            <li> purchased one of these at Kmart and just fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> Creative design.</li>
            <li> many heating settings to prevent burning your hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect combination of flat iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li> I use a Conair flat iron that I&#x27;m very happy with.</li>
            <li> I always liked conair&#x27;s product, this time, honestly, it&#x27;s not bad, at all.</li>
            <li> It heats very quickly</li>
            <li> I figured with all the reviews being so high it would be a good one, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> Great for travel when you only have room to pack one ..</li>
            <li> Heat light and turbo lights let you know when on.</li>
            <li> Great product, at least good for the money.</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine, and I found that when I tried to straighten it, my hair would just slip right through the iron!  </li>
            <li> I had to get used to the need to hold it shut to straighten but now prefer it as it is more exact and precise on what I want to do.</li>
            <li> Nicely straightens hair but also enables you to create a soft curl vey easily.  </li>
            <li> I placed a woogie to hold it together and have been happily married with it since until october 2011 when the clack covering to the top broke off</li>
            <li> So, originally buying this product, I hoped to use it for the dual function of straightening and curling.</li>
            <li> this does the job of a flat iron and curling iron so - 2 products in 1.  love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> With the multiple heat settings, I always get good results.    </li>
            <li> However, the magic of this appliance really comes into play when traveling.</li>
            <li> The only thing that was good is that it arrived in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I like that the tips stay cool and has a resting arm for the countertop.</li>
            <li> Handle grip is comfortable and a good length (considerate for those with larger hands), its also stylish and professional looking.</li>
            <li> I am so Happy about amazon right now I owned one of this and the handle broke, I searched Hi and Low and coudlnt find a replacement, I looked in Amazon and sure enough its where I found it</li>
            <li> I have unruly hair and this makes getting ready easy.</li>
            <li> The higher than &#x27;average&#x27; heat level is great.</li>
            <li> but it gets the job done and is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it was probably worth what it cost.  </li>
            <li> overall, if you don&#x27;t have a high expectation and want a more natural feel of the effect it brings, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Also the thing to choose what temperature you  want is right underneath the hand</li>
            <li> Product literally broke right after the return period was over.</li>
            <li> I usually spend about 5-10 minutes with this product in the morning, and its great because I dont have to heat up two irons.</li>
            <li> It really does heat up quickly and performs well.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly; by the time I&#x27;m done with washing my face and brushing my teeth, its ready to go.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep it because I liked the curls, but this weekend, the whole gizmo popped apart; the tiny screw on one side came out, fell into the oblivion of my tile, and now, the unit is inoperable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stays hot and works great on thick curly hair and is able to go from curling iron to straightener in one simple step.</li>
            <li> First one lasted almost three years until I dropped it</li>
            <li> Highly recommended - I will buy again if/when this one breaks!!</li>
            <li> This is my first curling/straightening iron.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine several years, many trips with no problems.</li>
            <li> My first one still works after many years of daily use.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can straighten my hair and curl it too all with the same tool.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> Luv this curling iron and continue to hope that I will be able to purchase another in the future.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li> EXACTLY</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of not having to have two appliances going at the same time.</li>
            <li> A week after my family member received the gift, they made me aware that it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Not even the seller of this item is willing to help me now.</li>
            <li> Quick heat up and cool down, and easy to adjust the temperature.  </li>
            <li> After a good solid 5 years of use, the latch that you use to lock the plates together to make it into a curling iron broke, so now I&#x27;ll instantly buy another.</li>
            <li> This one wasn&#x27;t good and more expensive than all others.</li>
            <li> It works fast and really does make their hair feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I had good past experience with a conair iron/straigtener.</li>
            <li> The large barrel is great for turning the end of hair under, or adding a subtle wave (not tight curls) and the straightener is adequate.  </li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t expect to get any great curls out of the barrel, because it&#x27;s too awkward to work with easily.</li>
            <li> it was so hard because I wasn&#x27;t sure how to hold it comfortably.</li>
            <li> But still a very neat idea.</li>
            <li> She loves it so much she does not want anything else.  </li>
            <li> and I really wanted something to do my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very wavy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a fast way to get ready in the morning...</li>
            <li> I have straight across bangs, so I would use the curler to curl my bangs and the straightener for the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> FAST EFFIEICENT SERVICE.  </li>
            <li> I am really intrested on why I havent received this product yet???</li>
            <li> I need a curling iron to give my hair volume, but I like the bottom to be straight.  </li>
            <li> Thus, I really don&#x27;t use it anymore.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like my hair is being really damaged.  </li>
            <li> I have attempted to contact the seller and received no reponse regarding the price--I just wanted to know if this was really the price, or if it was a typo.</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron to replace my previous Conair heat iron/straightener after at least 5 great years of service!</li>
            <li> It does not heat as fast as I thought it would be, but still quick enough.</li>
            <li> When using it as a straightener, hair gets caught under the hot plates and has to be ripped out before it completely burns off.</li>
            <li> but the curl is a little two big for me, and the straightener doesn&#x27;t work as good as the curler.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one that I had previously (but had dropped too many times and it eventually quit working).</li>
            <li> I have older products used for longer that do not have this problem.</li>
            <li> If you have decent hair to begin with, go for it.</li>
            <li> This item comes with a high recommendation from both of them.</li>
            <li> Multiple heat settings and it will get hot!</li>
            <li> However, in my opinion it takes a super long time to heat up.  </li>
            <li> my daughter loves, your new fancy hair</li>
            <li> I expected this to last more than 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I love this product arrived very quickly, earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> My hair is very brittle so this is a major plus for me.</li>
            <li> I have to say that while this curling iron/flat iron product does some of both - being a curling iron and a flat iron, it really doesn&#x27;t do either very well for my hair.</li>
            <li> The hot outside plates often created a hazard for me while I straightened.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I felt compelled to write a review on this specific product because in no lifetime should this curler/straightener cost over $200.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough positive things about this flat/curling iron.</li>
            <li> Love the versatility of a two-in-one flat iron and curling iron, but this is a little clunky and doesn&#x27;t quite get hot enough,</li>
            <li> I got really long hair, so this is nice cuz it has a larger diameter than other product.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy and thick hair, so sometimes it is hard to straighten, but definitely works excellently for the price paid.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that you have to be very careful when you try to do your hair bangs, it easily burn your forehead since there&#x27;s no plastic protection around the straighter.</li>
            <li> just wow, wow, wow</li>
            <li> I have owned this duel purpose curling iron/flat iron for years, and really appreciated it especially when I travel.</li>
            <li> (By the way, my hair is medium/fine, I&#x27;m white, and my hair is mostly straight except for going-to-bed-with-wet-hair bumps and the dying effects of a perm)     </li>
            <li> /&gt;I bought this back in March when I found a seller who had one for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The grip is easy to hold and use even with small hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea, and might work better for people with thicker hair, but I found it to be a waste. :(</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t nearly as &#x27;friendly&#x27; as the CD99, the switch to use the flat iron is really hard to use at the end of the iron as opposed to the CD99, which is right on the handle.  </li>
            <li> The outside and inside of the iron gets hot so even if you just want to straighten your hair, the outside is hot and you cannot touch it without getting burned, this made it hard to get to the scalp too because it couldn&#x27;t get the right angle.</li>
            <li> You have to be extremely careful with it because it gets really hot.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dirt cheap, though, so if you&#x27;re only going to use it a few times a year (or less), it might be worth it.</li>
            <li> So I would normally have to use a curling iron, and then a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider this to be a major loss.</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommended this product if you regularly straighten your hair and add a bit of volume by curling it afterwards.</li>
            <li> and of course, you need to be careful where you hold it because the whole barrel heats up.  </li>
            <li> The locking switch to change from curl to straight is changed with a flick of a switch, you don&#x27;t have to hold it closed as someone else reported.</li>
            <li> The curling iron is certainly an innovative idea, but poorly executed.  </li>
            <li> It heats well but isn&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Black tips aren&#x27;t too hot to hold when curling.</li>
            <li> Was a little strange getting use to having both in one, but overcame that quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to find this at all the local stores and apparently Conair has discontinued this model.</li>
            <li> When she first started using it she dropped it a few times.  </li>
            <li> There is a black piece that you push with your thumb to clamp the hair, but it can be very straining after awhile.</li>
            <li> She was young and clumsy when we first got it.  </li>
            <li> It is super easy to switch from curling iron to flat iron and is way less expensive than a flat iron.</li>
            <li> so she can get smaller curls and the smaller, lighter flat iron</li>
            <li> This works as your basic, bottom-line flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use the flat iron part to straighten, but I also use it to curl as well as opposed to the actual curling function.</li>
            <li> I bought this when i started working in 2007 and the clip thingy to switch from curling to flat ironing broke some time after.</li>
            <li> so when i saw this curling and flat iron dual</li>
            <li> I can curl and flat iron and a hve my desired look door the day!</li>
            <li> I have owned one of these iron/straighteners previously and was looking to replace my old one because the locking mechanism broke.</li>
            <li> Is The \\&quot;First\\&quot; Hair Straightener/Curler That Has Done Everything That All Other Products Much More Expensive Have Boasted Of Doing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted me a long time with no breaks or anything, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.   </li>
            <li> did like size of the plates for long hair.</li>
            <li> After two failed attempts in the past year, and paying good money for them, it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> The roller is smaller than her other</li>
            <li> It works ok but have had a few things wrong.</li>
            <li> The barrell is almost 2&#x27;&#x27; wide and it does not hold curls the same way, its almost like a very loose waive.</li>
            <li> This does the job if you want a single device that is both a curler and straightener.  </li>
            <li> The curl barrel is a medium size and a little smaller than what I was used to, but I like it and it curls my hair well.</li>
            <li> But I just don&#x27;t think it does either function as well as other single use products.</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair well, and have no problems with it slipping as others report.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend a more expensive straightener for someone serious about her hair.</li>
            <li> We have other Conair irons and they all came with longer cords.  </li>
            <li> However, for anything other than that use, its just \\&quot;OK\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too big or small.</li>
            <li> If you want this iron primarily for a flat iron, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since bought 3 in a row, each lasting me at least 2 years.</li>
            <li> There was one I bought that was glitchy and would shut off by itself, but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair, so it may just be me.</li>
            <li> Another annoyance was that there is no way to rest your iron down on something like a table because the plates would hit the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not worth giving it anything less than a 5 star fort though.</li>
            <li> This is not to say I do not find the actual curling function useless, its just that I do not regularly add \\&quot;corkscrew\\&quot; types of curls to my hairstyle.</li>
            <li> and I tell people it takes so much less time than they would think with this tool.</li>
            <li> I Have Extremely Long Thick Hair &amp; This</li>
            <li> Difficult to find...but cannot live without the dual feature.</li>
            <li> Less than a year later, it has broken.  </li>
            <li> We bought one 3 years ago, and my daughter uses it almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> do not fit well together.</li>
            <li> Also, the dial for the heat setting broke off after just a few months.     </li>
            <li> DONT waste your money ladies</li>
            <li> I have had mine for over two years, use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Not only that, when I requested a refund, they tried to make me pay shipping to return a broken product.  </li>
            <li> In all honesty, I find the flat iron a bit tedious to use because you have to hold the handle down and it strains your hands a bit, and when I&#x27;m at home</li>
            <li> small complaint is after a year and a half the numbers on the dial have started to wear off.</li>
            <li> This went with me to Thailand, Bhutan and India and took up very little room in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> I used it solely as a straighter, and it hurt my hand after a while because the way you have to press it together gets hard to do.</li>
            <li> Getting hard to turn on.  </li>
            <li> But overall I was disappointed and wish I had a chance to try other Conair Products instead of this one.</li>
            <li> Expect to buy something that can heat to at least 400 degrees and costs aprox $80.</li>
            <li> As clumsy as I am, it has survived being dropped from a table over 50 times!</li>
            <li> It is a little awkward to use</li>
            <li> The company had sent me a curling iron that was broken.</li>
            <li> However, when I tried to use it as a round iron, it was very difficult to get the two halves to latch together, and even when I succeeded, they didn&#x27;t stay that way.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because my expensive one broke and didnt have the money to buy another one.  </li>
            <li> This product does straighten my hair if nothing else goes wrong.    </li>
            <li> Ill be returning mine.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these randomly when I was in highschool years ago.</li>
            <li> How disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time finding it in the community, however, Amazon has EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> Not something I would tell friends to buy but for the price it isnt tooooo bad..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what I hoped for, one instrument that can straighten or curl hair.  Just a flick of a switch converts the straightener to a curling iron.  With the multiple heat settings, I always get good results.    *Update* 9/12/14  This item has died.  I went to use it, pressed the on button, and nothing.  I expected this to last more than 3 years.  How disappointing. I am lowering my rating from 5 to 4 stars for lack of longevity.</li>
            <li> i am so happy i got it , great value, works perfectly: fast and makes me look like i just stepped from Hair Salon; you will be not disappointed at all; i use it every day, no complains just wow, wow, wow from people who see the gorgeous results of this item;</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever used. Stays hot and works great on thick curly hair and is able to go from curling iron to straightener in one simple step.</li>
            <li> This is the THIRD Conair Heat Iron and Straitener I have purchased -- because I have worn the others out! I love, love, love this product. I have a difficult time finding it in the community, however, Amazon has EVERYTHING! I use this every day. Also, I have recommended this product to others. I cannot say enough positive things about this flat/curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this item.  First one lasted almost three years until I dropped it and it stopped working! I use it almost every day. Perfect combination of flat iron or curling iron. The higher than &#x27;average&#x27; heat level is great. Black tips aren&#x27;t too hot to hold when curling. Handle grip is comfortable and a good length (considerate for those with larger hands), its also stylish and professional looking. Excellent quality for the price too. Highly recommended - I will buy again if/when this one breaks!!</li>
            <li> This is my first curling/straightening iron.   I have read the reviews before buying it. But I have decided to go on with purchasing it because money-wise, it is a good deal to try out.   This is nor perfect. like many reviews have mentioned, the straightening works. but the curling part, don&#x27;t expect it to curl a lot like what the saloon does. instead, it can provide some wave at the bottom end of your hair.   Since I just want to curl the bottom-end of my hair inwards and create some loose-wave, it works for me.   However if I&#x27;d like to create any proper curl, i&#x27;d buy a separate curling iron.  overall, if you don&#x27;t have a high expectation and want a more natural feel of the effect it brings, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> You have to be extremely careful with it because it gets really hot.  However, in my opinion it takes a super long time to heat up.  However this product is great if you are on a college student budget. :D</li>
            <li> Like others who reviewed this product, I bought this curling iron combo to take on a trip to Europe. I needed something with dual voltage. I have to say that while this curling iron/flat iron product does some of both - being a curling iron and a flat iron, it really doesn&#x27;t do either very well for my hair. It is a little awkward to use but you get used to it. But I just don&#x27;t think it does either function as well as other single use products. I have thick, coarse hair, so it may just be me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a couple years back as soon as I saw it. I have never had problems with the product. I have unruly hair and this makes getting ready easy. I can straighten then curl immediately following without having to heat two products. The grip is easy to hold and use even with small hands. I had to get used to the need to hold it shut to straighten but now prefer it as it is more exact and precise on what I want to do. The curling barrel is wonderful, I have never had a snag, pull or rip from my iron. My hair is very brittle so this is a major plus for me. I have purchased the one on amazon for my mother as a mothers day gift as she always uses mine when she can. She loves it as well.&lt;br /&gt;One small complaint is after a year and a half the numbers on the dial have started to wear off. I have older products used for longer that do not have this problem. This is not worth giving it anything less than a 5 star fort though.</li>
            <li> Great product, at least good for the money. I&#x27;m from Europe so I had do do some modifications because of the different voltages but this iron works in 100-240V range, so no problems here. My girlfriend is very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This does the job if you want a single device that is both a curler and straightener.  The large barrel is great for turning the end of hair under, or adding a subtle wave (not tight curls) and the straightener is adequate.  You will get better results straightening with a dedicated-purpose ceramic straightener .. but won&#x27;t have the curling iron function too.  The latch works well, but sometimes pops up and can catch on hair when straightening, and of course, you need to be careful where you hold it because the whole barrel heats up.  Quick heat up and cool down, and easy to adjust the temperature.  Great for travel when you only have room to pack one .. but for this reason it would be nice if it had dual voltage functionality.  I&#x27;ve had mine several years, many trips with no problems.</li>
            <li> I have owned one of these iron/straighteners previously and was looking to replace my old one because the locking mechanism broke. I like the convenience of the 2-in-1 product but wish it was better made.</li>
            <li> is a very nice product, u don&#x27;t feel like is burning your hair when u use it, also very good price</li>
            <li> This works good as a straightener. As a curling iron not so good. But still a very neat idea.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this dual purpose iron since it can to the job of 2 different devices without the clutter. It also has dual voltage which comes in handy if you like to travel.  Amazon definately had the best value so we went ahead and ordered it.  It arrived in a timely manner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She tried it out and was very happy with it.  It really does heat up quickly and performs well.  The only problem I saw with it is the short cord. We have other Conair irons and they all came with longer cords.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my mom for Christmas and she loves it. The roller is smaller than her other so she can get smaller curls and the smaller, lighter flat iron is easier for her to handle.</li>
            <li> I bought this when i started working in 2007 and the clip thingy to switch from curling to flat ironing broke some time after. I placed a woogie to hold it together and have been happily married with it since until october 2011 when the clack covering to the top broke off and it could not stay together. otherwise it would still be functioning... *tear* i love you curling iron and i recommend you to anyone! gonna buy another one!</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine, and I found that when I tried to straighten it, my hair would just slip right through the iron!  It doesn&#x27;t curl well either.  It&#x27;s a great idea, and might work better for people with thicker hair, but I found it to be a waste. :(</li>
            <li> I Have Extremely Long Thick Hair &amp; This Is The \\&quot;First\\&quot; Hair Straightener/Curler That Has Done Everything That All Other Products Much More Expensive Have Boasted Of Doing.  My Hair Has Never Looked More Beautiful Than After Using This Product.  It&#x27;s Definitely A KEEPER !!!</li>
            <li> It heats very quickly, it&#x27;s also do a good job on my hair with both functions, it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s not as convenient as if you use one tool for each function, but it&#x27;s okay. I recommend this tool.</li>
            <li> This works as your basic, bottom-line flat iron. If you have decent hair to begin with, go for it. But don&#x27;t expect to get any great curls out of the barrel, because it&#x27;s too awkward to work with easily. I wasn&#x27;t happy with its temperature, since I need something REALLY hot to get the job done for my curls. I used it solely as a straighter, and it hurt my hand after a while because the way you have to press it together gets hard to do. It&#x27;s lasted me a long time with no breaks or anything, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.   If you have difficult-to-manage hair like me, invest in something that&#x27;s of quality (ask your stylist; I&#x27;m going to buy a TS-2). Expect to buy something that can heat to at least 400 degrees and costs aprox $80. If you&#x27;re up for it.</li>
            <li> This is my second iron of this model and I love it.  My first one still works after many years of daily use.  I purchased a second one to keep at my vacation home.</li>
            <li> This item is a good product because its 2 in 1.  I love the fact that I can straighten my hair and curl it too all with the same tool.  It does take a while to heat up and its not the best but it gets the job done and is well worth the price.  I bought it because my expensive one broke and didnt have the money to buy another one.  I like this product but I am planning on buying another more expensive iron.  But for now, it does the job.  I would recomned this product to a friend but not someone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I recieved this straightener as a Christmas present.  Less than a year later, it has broken.  The hinge mechanism came apart and I couldn&#x27;t gigure out how to put it back together.  When it was functional, it worked fairly well on my wavy hair.  My hair tends not to hold a style well, but the straightening held up fairly well throughout a day at school.  The curling iron did not always work that well, often, when I arrived at school the curls kind of died.  Another issue is the clip that keeps the plates together when using it as a curling iron.  The clip did not always keep the plates together, causing me to burn myself.  The clip area also somethimes snagged my hair while straightening.  The curling iron is certainly an innovative idea, but poorly executed.  The hot outside plates often created a hazard for me while I straightened.  All in all, it was probably worth what it cost.  I would reccomend a more expensive straightener for someone serious about her hair.</li>
            <li> It works ok but have had a few things wrong. The screws fell out. &amp; the straightener is good but curler is not, they both pull your hair. Not something I would tell friends to buy but for the price it isnt tooooo bad..</li>
            <li> I bought this product becuase I had good past experience with a conair iron/straigtener. This one however makes it necessary to hold the straightener shut while opening and closing the iron. It heats well but isn&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron to replace my previous Conair heat iron/straightener after at least 5 great years of service! Love the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to find this at all the local stores and apparently Conair has discontinued this model. Found it on Amazon and am really happy.</li>
            <li> I have owned this duel purpose curling iron/flat iron for years, and really appreciated it especially when I travel. In all honesty, I find the flat iron a bit tedious to use because you have to hold the handle down and it strains your hands a bit, and when I&#x27;m at home I use a Conair flat iron that I&#x27;m very happy with. I use the curling iron 365 days a year, and am perfectly happy with it. However, the magic of this appliance really comes into play when traveling. So as not to have to travel with two appliances, this combo is PERFECT for the job. After a good solid 5 years of use, the latch that you use to lock the plates together to make it into a curling iron broke, so now I&#x27;ll instantly buy another. I cannot live without this!</li>
            <li> I loved the 2 in 1 curler and iron. This went with me to Thailand, Bhutan and India and took up very little room in my suitcase. It works so well it will permanently be replacing the one I have at home.</li>
            <li> Very handy cause it&#x27;s 2-in-1,  but the curl is a little two big for me, and the straightener doesn&#x27;t work as good as the curler.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughters and they are very pleased with it.  It works fast and really does make their hair feel soft and smooth.  This item comes with a high recommendation from both of them.</li>
            <li> Love the versatility of a two-in-one flat iron and curling iron, but this is a little clunky and doesn&#x27;t quite get hot enough,</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  We bought one 3 years ago, and my daughter uses it almost everyday.  When she first started using it she dropped it a few times.  It kept on working.  But now is time to replace it.  Getting hard to turn on.  She was young and clumsy when we first got it.  She loves it so much she does not want anything else.  I say it is very good.  straighten and curl and you can control the temp.  It does not damage your hair either.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I want. I got really long hair, so this is nice cuz it has a larger diameter than other product.</li>
            <li> This product does straighten my hair if nothing else goes wrong.    However, it does not work as a curling iron -- the barrel and the arm that hold the hair to the iron do not fit well together. Hair does not stay \\&quot;clamped\\&quot; in the iron when I try to curl it around the barrel.     When using it as a straightener, hair gets caught under the hot plates and has to be ripped out before it completely burns off. I&#x27;m not exaggerating. This has happened more than once.    Also, the dial for the heat setting broke off after just a few months.     It&#x27;s dirt cheap, though, so if you&#x27;re only going to use it a few times a year (or less), it might be worth it. Maybe.</li>
            <li> I use to had this tool like 2 years ago, and its deffenetly not what i remember. The barrell is almost 2&#x27;&#x27; wide and it does not hold curls the same way, its almost like a very loose waive.The only thing that was good is that it arrived in 2 days. But now it do not matter since i cant use it as i would have before.</li>
            <li> Luv this curling iron and continue to hope that I will be able to purchase another in the future.  This is great for shoulder length hair to longer hair and is a very versatile styling tool.  Nicely straightens hair but also enables you to create a soft curl vey easily.  Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li> I bought this product over four years ago, and to this day it works perfectly.  As clumsy as I am, it has survived being dropped from a table over 50 times! I have frizzy and thick hair, so sometimes it is hard to straighten, but definitely works excellently for the price paid.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this last year and it broke after 2 weeks. i will never buy it again. DONT waste your money ladies</li>
            <li> I was recently in Spain and Greece and I really wanted something to do my hair. My hair is very wavy and course so I wanted something that could straighten the kinky parts and curl the rest. With a proper adapter plug this worked great! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> I am so Happy about amazon right now I owned one of this and the handle broke, I searched Hi and Low and coudlnt find a replacement, I looked in Amazon and sure enough its where I found it, I am one happy camper since this can be the best styling tool for home and travel...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a fast way to get ready in the morning...I have straight across bangs, so I would use the curler to curl my bangs and the straightener for the rest of my hair. I usually spend about 5-10 minutes with this product in the morning, and its great because I dont have to heat up two irons. (By the way, my hair is medium/fine, I&#x27;m white, and my hair is mostly straight except for going-to-bed-with-wet-hair bumps and the dying effects of a perm)     However, for anything other than that use, its just \\&quot;OK\\&quot;. The curler doesnt have enough length to do a lot of hair. The straightener will sometimes \\&quot;grab\\&quot; at the hair, even if I comb it out as I put it on the iron.     I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it breaking. It heats up quickly; by the time I&#x27;m done with washing my face and brushing my teeth, its ready to go.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for over two years, use it everyday. Never had a problem. Was a little strange getting use to having both in one, but overcame that quickly. Cleaned up the countertops. I like the turbo boost heating, and the auto shutoff in case I forget to unplug. It straightens my hair well, and have no problems with it slipping as others report. The curl barrel is a medium size and a little smaller than what I was used to, but I like it and it curls my hair well. The locking switch to change from curl to straight is changed with a flick of a switch, you don&#x27;t have to hold it closed as someone else reported. I like that the tips stay cool and has a resting arm for the countertop. Multiple heat settings and it will get hot! Heat light and turbo lights let you know when on. I love mine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing combination for layered hair styles. I can curl and flat iron and a hve my desired look door the day!</li>
            <li> PERFECT HAIRSTYLER.  EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. FAST EFFIEICENT SERVICE.  ARRIVED IN RECORD TIME. WOULD USE THIS SHIPPER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I am really intrested on why I havent received this product yet??? Gonna cancel if I dont receive by march 28. Alsoo will never use amazon again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the concept of this product and it does get the job done of straightening the hair, while giving it bend on the ends.  But it pulled my hair and both through the plates and then by tangling it up during curling.  Also, the switch on the end to either open it up as a straightener or closing it to become a curling iron, is flimsy and doesn&#x27;t always catch.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one that I had previously (but had dropped too many times and it eventually quit working). It is super easy to switch from curling iron to flat iron and is way less expensive than a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the price of this product and the reviews were promising. When I tried to straighten my hair it was so hard because I wasn&#x27;t sure how to hold it comfortably. There is a black piece that you push with your thumb to clamp the hair, but it can be very straining after awhile. Also the thing to choose what temperature you  want is right underneath the hand so it constantly is changing by accident. The outside and inside of the iron gets hot so even if you just want to straighten your hair, the outside is hot and you cannot touch it without getting burned, this made it hard to get to the scalp too because it couldn&#x27;t get the right angle. Another annoyance was that there is no way to rest your iron down on something like a table because the plates would hit the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like size of the plates for long hair. It isn&#x27;t too big or small. The frizz was gone after straightening my hair too. But overall I was disappointed and wish I had a chance to try other Conair Products instead of this one.</li>
            <li> I need a curling iron to give my hair volume, but I like the bottom to be straight.  So I would normally have to use a curling iron, and then a flat iron.  I love the convenience of not having to have two appliances going at the same time.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this curling iron. trhis is what she asked for as a Christmas gift. good iron for the price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up!  Plan on returning it.  Need to know where and to get a replacement.  I&#x27;ve ordered these before and have been happy.  This one wasn&#x27;t good and more expensive than all others.</li>
            <li> I love this! It was awesome and after 4 years, I am still using it!</li>
            <li> i bought this iron for a niece of mine. she asked for a curling iron for her bday. so when i saw this curling and flat iron dual i thought hey thats a great gift idea. she loves it and still uses it.it leaves her hair silky and shiny and she has lots of hair. i would have never seen this iron if it wasnt for amazon.thanx amazon, again.</li>
            <li> So, originally buying this product, I hoped to use it for the dual function of straightening and curling. I use the flat iron part to straighten, but I also use it to curl as well as opposed to the actual curling function. I usually only curl the ends of my hair once over, so I just turn the iron physically. This is not to say I do not find the actual curling function useless, its just that I do not regularly add \\&quot;corkscrew\\&quot; types of curls to my hairstyle. Just my personal preference I suppose. On special occasions, I will use the curling function and it works great! Overall, I highly recommended this product if you regularly straighten your hair and add a bit of volume by curling it afterwards. Great product!</li>
            <li> If you want this iron primarily for a flat iron, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.  However, when I tried to use it as a round iron, it was very difficult to get the two halves to latch together, and even when I succeeded, they didn&#x27;t stay that way.  Thus, I really don&#x27;t use it anymore.  It was inexpensive, so I don&#x27;t consider this to be a major loss.</li>
            <li> purchased one of these at Kmart and just fell in love with it.  needed an additional one for our motorhome (so i wouldn&#x27;t have to keep carrying it back and forth) and FINALLY found it here after looking at all the local stores and online.  i am so happy!  this does the job of a flat iron and curling iron so - 2 products in 1.  love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> I always liked conair&#x27;s product, this time, honestly, it&#x27;s not bad, at all. There&#x27;s a switch where you can lock the clip so you will be using the curler only, and when you unlock it, you can use the sraighter. Creative design. It does not heat as fast as I thought it would be, but still quick enough. The only thing is that you have to be very careful when you try to do your hair bangs, it easily burn your forehead since there&#x27;s no plastic protection around the straighter.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a gift.  They did not offer prime 2 day shipping so it took over a week to receive it.  A week after my family member received the gift, they made me aware that it didn&#x27;t work.  The company had sent me a curling iron that was broken. Not only that, when I requested a refund, they tried to make me pay shipping to return a broken product.  I had to complain a second time in order for them to mail me a return label.  So, then it took another week for me to receive the label and a second week for them to receive it.  So, basically, in conclusion - it took a ludicrous amount of time to get this settled when it could have just been solved with a quality product.</li>
            <li> I figured with all the reviews being so high it would be a good one, but it&#x27;s not.  Everytime I straighten my hair, the hair gets caught in the bulky screws and the plates are not smoothe.  I thurts and I feel like my hair is being really damaged.  The curling iron part has such a big lip that it put a crimp in your hair every time you roll it around teh barrel. Ill be returning mine.</li>
            <li> Product literally broke right after the return period was over.</li>
            <li> First of all, I felt compelled to write a review on this specific product because in no lifetime should this curler/straightener cost over $200. I have attempted to contact the seller and received no reponse regarding the price--I just wanted to know if this was really the price, or if it was a typo. But no response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the reason I titled the review as I did is because I&#x27;ve used this product for ten years or so, off and on. And it&#x27;s the best out there for both straightening and curling when it&#x27;s a brand new device. The last time I ordered from Amazon, it was a refurbished model, and it was falling apart within a year. I didn&#x27;t notice in the product description any mention of it being refurbished, so wherever you get this product, be mindful of this possibility, especially now that it has been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***06/10/2013 EDIT***&lt;br /&gt;I bought this back in March when I found a seller who had one for a reasonable price. I bought it and was immediately dismayed. The quality simply wasn&#x27;t what I was accustomed to from Conair. My hair would snag between the straightening plates, which is something that never happened before. I decided to keep it because I liked the curls, but this weekend, the whole gizmo popped apart; the tiny screw on one side came out, fell into the oblivion of my tile, and now, the unit is inoperable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend buying this product again. After two failed attempts in the past year, and paying good money for them, it&#x27;s just not worth it. I don&#x27;t know what happened to the quality but save your money. Not even the seller of this item is willing to help me now.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find...but cannot live without the dual feature.</li>
            <li> Wonderful design for both straightening and waving hair only one out there.&lt;br /&gt;Has many heating settings to prevent burning your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product arrived very quickly, earlier than expected. was a good buy. my daughter loves, your new fancy hair</li>
            <li> I have the Conair CD99, and wanted another one to travel with.  I ran across this, so I purchased it.  It isn&#x27;t nearly as &#x27;friendly&#x27; as the CD99, the switch to use the flat iron is really hard to use at the end of the iron as opposed to the CD99, which is right on the handle.  Like it?  Not so much.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these randomly when I was in highschool years ago. It has become the only hair styling tool I swear by. I can&#x27;t imagine trying to straighten sections, then have to plug in a separate curler to curl. It takes seconds to switch between the two on this. I&#x27;ve since bought 3 in a row, each lasting me at least 2 years. There was one I bought that was glitchy and would shut off by itself, but that&#x27;s my only complaint. I always get compliments on my hair and I tell people it takes so much less time than they would think with this tool. Love it. I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has it because I cannot find it in stores anymore!</li>
