            <li>I don&#x27;t know why the company thinks it is a good idea to put food dye in a product you are going to be putting on your skin (nor do I understand why food manufacturers add it to food that we are going to consume).  </li>

            <li>I would give it a 1, but it seems to be working better than proactive.</li>
            <li>I would have to buy one from my dermatologist to find out for sure, but don&#x27;t think that will happen.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?  </li>
            <li>Product is outstanding</li>
            <li>Great product and does not irritate my sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>Far and away the best and most gentle cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is a great product or sensitive or acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Extremely good product cleans face gently and thoroughly</li>
            <li>Removes all make-up,including eye make-up easily</li>
            <li>Cleanses well and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li>We are familiar with the product</li>
            <li>I really like being able to get such a wonderful professional product at such a good price.</li>
            <li>In full disclosure, I returned this item.  </li>
            <li>I love this gentle cleanser...</li>
            <li>It is gentle, does get the grime off and is price competitive to the more visible higher end face cleansing products.</li>
            <li>Fresh and ready to use !!</li>
            <li>Very nice gentle cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This is probably a good product other than un-natural coloring.</li>
            <li>I started using this cleanser and noticed a difference in the softness of my skin right away.  </li>
            <li>This product not only cleans well, but rinses off easily (unlike some of the others), and my face feels clean without any residue.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product tho&#x27; expensive.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wash away all my makeup even though I use the wipes first.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser especially after using another cleanser I had to buy when traveling.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin soft, clean and moist.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product; does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>It is gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>This cleanser leaves no residue, it gently cleans my face and leaves it looking and feeling supple.  </li>
            <li>Not the real thing.</li>
            <li>but what was delivered to me is light yellow in color....</li>
            <li>I wanted the foaming gel cleanser and didn&#x27;t realize i ordered the gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is the real obagi.</li>
            <li>Since I am trying to fade some brown spots on my face, my doctor recommended a gentle cleanser while using some heavy-duty prescription products.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very clean without that &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; sensation that some other cleansers leave.</li>
            <li>the Glytone Gel Wash.  And, the Obaji Luxe moisturizer is fantastic for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Clear liquid, adequate lather, use only a small amount, cleans sweat and oil off skin pronto and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I normally use Glytone Gel Wash</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time and brand new.</li>
            <li>Disappointed, obagi is a great product!</li>
            <li>Not sure it is authentic .</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and suffer from dry skin and Rosacea on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I have been using simple face wash and it&#x27;s worked better than any other product so far.</li>
            <li>The real facial cleanser (obagi) colors light pink</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Amazingly gentle cleanser that actually cleans my skin well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; cleansers and my face doesn&#x27;t feel clean with any of these other products.  </li>
            <li>Delivered on time and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Have used it for the past 5 years and my skin feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I used it for years, first was introduced to it by my dermatologist at Kaiser together with other Obagi products.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the pink and they don&#x27;t identify them very well</li>
            <li>I have always used the Obagi gentle cleanser and prefer it to any other cleansers.</li>

            <li> It is also the least expensive and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face as much, but leaves it smooth like obagi did.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> This produce is a fake - it does not smell like the authentic Obagi cleanser that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past and does not come in the Obagi box</li>
            <li> Everything that was expected.</li>
            <li> Does not live up to their other products plus I don&#x27;t like the smell!</li>
            <li> Then I discovered it is sold online for much less money, so now I order everything I use online.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money</li>
            <li> People need to try it at least once to appreciate the product.</li>
            <li> It was expensive at Kaiser, not a lot cheaper on Amazon, but I do like it a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure!!!!</li>
            <li> so I am unable to use this product.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

I can&#x27;t say enough about this cleanser..I have super sensitive skin and suffer from dry skin and Rosacea on my cheeks.

            <li> I used it for years, first was introduced to it by my dermatologist at Kaiser together with other Obagi products.  It was expensive at Kaiser, not a lot cheaper on Amazon, but I do like it a lot</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. I was introduced to this product by a dermatologist about 6 years ago and have used only this product since.</li>
            <li> Came quickly very happy!!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and brand new.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, obagi is a great product! But this one I bought. I&#x27;m not sure!!!! The real facial cleanser (obagi) colors light pink but what was delivered to me is light yellow in color.... What a waste of money</li>
            <li> Fabulous product; does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi products for a couple of years, and I love it. I am in my 60&#x27;s, and it definitely helps with wrinkles and age spots. I used to purchase my products from a skin care doctor&#x27;s office. Then I discovered it is sold online for much less money, so now I order everything I use online. I would definitely recommend using Obagi products.</li>
            <li> Amazingly gentle cleanser that actually cleans my skin well. Love it!</li>
            <li> Very nice gentle cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.  I had been using a foaming gel but had to retreat to&lt;br /&gt;an OTC gentler product.  I was very pleased with the Cleanser and have been using it well.</li>
            <li> Love all of their products!</li>
            <li> In full disclosure, I returned this item.  I normally use Glytone Gel Wash but after starting to use the Obaji Luxe moisturizer I thought I would give this a try.  I suspect this is a great product for most people.  However, I couldn&#x27;t find an ingredient list before purchasing.  Once it arrived, I saw that it is pink and upon checking the ingredients saw that it has Red #40 in it.  I am allergic to red #40 so I am unable to use this product.  I don&#x27;t know why the company thinks it is a good idea to put food dye in a product you are going to be putting on your skin (nor do I understand why food manufacturers add it to food that we are going to consume).  I continue to be happy with the Glytone Gel Wash.  And, the Obaji Luxe moisturizer is fantastic for dry skin.  This is probably a good product other than un-natural coloring.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanse. Removes all make-up,including eye make-up easily</li>
            <li> I wanted the foaming gel cleanser and didn&#x27;t realize i ordered the gentle cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t wash away all my makeup even though I use the wipes first. Won&#x27;t order this again</li>
            <li> Great product and does not irritate my sensitive skin!  Cleanses well and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Product was watery and smelled much different than the bottle I got at Dr.&#x27;s office. Not sure it is authentic . Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does not live up to their other products plus I don&#x27;t like the smell!</li>
            <li> Great cleaner, great price</li>
            <li> Great product. It leaves my skin very clean without that &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; sensation that some other cleansers leave.</li>
            <li> Extremely good product cleans face gently and thoroughly</li>
            <li> I would give it a 1, but it seems to be working better than proactive. I don&#x27;t believe this is the real obagi. I would have to buy one from my dermatologist to find out for sure, but don&#x27;t think that will happen. I have been using simple face wash and it&#x27;s worked better than any other product so far. It is also the least expensive and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face as much, but leaves it smooth like obagi did. I still had a lot of breakouts with this obagi so stopped using it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! I have dry skin and this removes all makeup without drying me ou!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser especially after using another cleanser I had to buy when traveling. No comparison!</li>
            <li> Excellent product... Leaves the skin soft, clean and moist.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have used it for the past 5 years and my skin feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Was a different scented solution than I had been using.  I prefer the pink and they don&#x27;t identify them very well</li>
            <li> I love this gentle cleanser... it&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin and I love it!!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and exactly what I expected. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Rcvd. On time. Excellent</li>
            <li> Since I am trying to fade some brown spots on my face, my doctor recommended a gentle cleanser while using some heavy-duty prescription products.  I&#x27;ve tried several &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; cleansers and my face doesn&#x27;t feel clean with any of these other products.  This product not only cleans well, but rinses off easily (unlike some of the others), and my face feels clean without any residue.  I&#x27;ll use up the ones I can&#x27;t return but this is the only one I&#x27;ll be buying in the future.</li>
            <li> Excellent item and quality !! Fresh and ready to use !!</li>
            <li> Have been using for years. Used to get from dermatologist but now save quite a bit</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?  The perfect makeup remover.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I use all the Obagi Nu-Derm products so this was just a refill for me. It is Step 1 of a series of steps in a specific regime that Obagi has. It is gentle, does get the grime off and is price competitive to the more visible higher end face cleansing products.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as always. Product is outstanding</li>
