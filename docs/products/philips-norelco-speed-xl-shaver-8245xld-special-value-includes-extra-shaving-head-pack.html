    <ol>
            <li>I have been using Remington razors for 30 years and this gives the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with a Remington.  </li>
            <li>Ith tho great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing I was done shaving!  </li>
            <li>I bought this at Costco at a great price to try it.  </li>
            <li>but in any event I&#x27;m happy with the way its working.  </li>
            <li>I loved using it</li>
            <li>I figured it was a good deal, as the set of replacement heads runs between $30-$35 on its own.  </li>
            <li>That is the best selling model right now on Amazon</li>
            <li>it gave a great shave and the speed was fine, it just sounded</li>
            <li>As compared to the 7310, the shaver heads on the 8245 have a lot more holes to cut hair, which I guess has to be a good thing.  </li>
            <li>GOOD SHAVER,EASY TO CLEAN</li>
            <li>I wonder if this is another formerly reputable company being bitten be the \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; bug?</li>
            <li>So i looked at a many shavers before pulling the trigger on this one.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>However, it feels slightly more abrasive on the face.  </li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t want to wait 12 hours.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco&#x27;s three floating heads do an excellent job following the contours of my face.</li>
            <li>so much more quite then the Braun.    </li>
            <li>So I get two days shave at most from the razor.  </li>
            <li>My Norelco that died was a much better shaver than this one.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks I could get a pretty good shave in about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>First the good --</li>
            <li>The 8245 seemed weaker than my old 8175, taking many more passes to get a good, close shave.  </li>
            <li>The 8250 gives a great shave with far fewer passes.  </li>
            <li>I like the easy wash feature since I can run it under the faucet.  </li>
            <li>Good morning the day yesterday started to load my new machine Philips Norelco Speed XL Shaver 8245XLD, to my surprise after 12 hours of charge as indicated in the manual does not work does not indicate that this loading, please I require an answer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quick, close, comfortable shave, and with more holes and slots</li>
            <li>This one does a great job, it&#x27;s quiet and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li>What is relevant is the type of head and the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bizarre that Norelco also has a shaver that sells for $150...</li>
            <li>The light flashes when charged.  </li>
            <li>Today, the shaver wouldn&#x27;t work at all even when it was plugged in the light wouldn&#x27;t light up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very useful when you are in a hurry</li>
            <li>problem I see is you need to run it through repeatedly in some of the areas to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>we just not acceptable even after a full 3 weeks of exclusive</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to leave my Norelco rotary shaving system and always considered Norelco a reputable company.</li>
            <li>a 2+ year old Norelco 7310 which I thought was a nice razor for the money, but</li>
            <li>, I dont see whole lot of meaningful difference between this and the cheaper 7310.  </li>
            <li>I have owned a number of Norelco shavers over the last 25 years and loved them all -- until this one.  </li>
            <li>true--</li>
            <li>It is only good for a quick clean-up.</li>
            <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that if Norelco shavers works for you and you are okay with the pricey head replacements do NOT waste your time trying a foil shaver!  </li>
            <li>I liked it enough that I would have been able to live with it but for below/</li>
            <li>, is a close shave and nice and quiet.     </li>
            <li>Good value for the money spent.</li>
            <li>Another nice thing about this razor is that you can flip open the shaving head without removing it and wash it with tap water--</li>
            <li>Seems like the quality just isnt there anymore, but the extra set of cutters kind of makes up for it.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as what I expected.  </li>
            <li>This shaver would be tough to clean with a brush so being able to rinse it clean really was good and needed.  </li>
            <li>LOVED using it as the shave was amazing comfortable and so quiet it was hard to believe it was working.  </li>
            <li>New razor is very quiet and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>Recently, I came across a great \\&quot;clearance\\&quot; sale at a local retailer, and picked up the 8250 to compare to the 8245.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as previous Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Only objection was the packaging; the box is huge!</li>
            <li>If you find, like me, needing a touch up shave before 5 using this, then a foil shaver likely will work better for you as they shave closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a third week it was even a bit better shaver in about 3 to 4 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It comes with the manual for the 8240 and looks exactly like the 8240.  </li>
            <li>The better ones only 1 hour.  </li>
            <li>This is the first one to die electronically.</li>
            <li>Takes a long time to shave as it is not the most powerful shaver out there.  </li>
            <li>I never cared about a shaver being loud until I found how nice it is to use a quiet one.  </li>
            <li>However, with lithium you really need an indicator to tell you when say 5 or so minutes of shaving power is left so you are sure to charge it as well as when it is fully changed.  </li>
            <li>A foil shaver must move one or more cutters back and forth at high speed versus simply spinning and spinning gears so a foil shaver inherently will make a lot more</li>
            <li>In other words, Ithink your better off buying a cheap one like the 7310 or maybe the 8340, using it into the ground, and just getting a new razor without buying any extras.  </li>
            <li>My last one is still going strong after 7 years.  </li>
            <li>Or, the large number of model nos. is to make it harder for consumers to compare prices and features, and for Norelco to sell more shavers at a higher price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not paying to change the heads given that the battery isnt easily replaceable and the whole razor only cost $40.  </li>
            <li>Plus you get the extra set of blades free.</li>
            <li>and you could pick that one up if you want to save real dollars over this one, and it has 4 stars over 700 reviews.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and use, and does not cause razor burn because it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough.</li>
            <li>The only relevant difference I can find is that some of the cheaper models take 12 hours to charge the battery.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;A person can compare models on the Norelco web site, but they don&#x27;t list much in the way of differences.  </li>
            <li>I would remove one star for not having a low battery light and no travel storage for the charger.</li>
            <li>but in case it isnt I&#x27;m replacing the whole razor with a cheaper one for now.</li>
            <li>The new one appeared to be running at a much slower rotary speed than the old one but did a fine job, at least for about a bit more than a month.</li>
            <li>first couple of times of using it took a LONG time to get only an okay shave.  </li>
            <li>was surprised by the cavalier attitude of the (courteous) person who simply said, \\&quot;Send it back to Amazon.\\</li>
            <li>Ok, now to this razor, I assume that this razor is the same as the 8240, except that it comes with the extra heads.  </li>
            <li>However, it finally gave up the ghost and on October 13, 2010 I purchased a new razor from a Rite Aid Pharmacy for $67.40, including tax (don&#x27;t know the model number because it was returned for a full refund).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>I have used it for over 2 years and find it to do a marginal job with new blades and old, and I clean it regularly and thoroughly, and lube it as directed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quicker than my old 8000 series shaver.</li>
            <li>Whether any of this is a real difference or just the fact that my 7310 is two years old, I dont know,</li>
            <li>The remaining charge indicator on my old Norelco 7886XL was no longer working well -- it showed 44 minutes of full charge remaining after recharging, but when it was used and later showed 31 minutes remaining when I began shaving, the shaver would stop after about a couple of minutes of use and show \\&quot;0\\&quot; minutes remaining before I finished shaving -- so having no indicator on the Norelco</li>
            <li>This time I called the 800 number listed on the razor to speak to a live person and thinking they might have an answer for me</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a new electric razor in a while.</li>
            <li>It has not shaved well since new</li>
            <li>I usually buy the cheapest Norelco rotary razor every couple of years becuase the razor is about 30 dollars and the replacement blades are a couple of dollars more.  </li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the razor and would choose the same one next time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that is longer than when I first got it or if I hadn&#x27;t timed it when I left my review.  </li>
            <li>It does seem like it runs slow, when I finished using it the first time I was surprised how smooth  my face felt.  </li>
            <li>It does not come with a case that is large enough to hold the cord.  </li>
            <li>After trying this now I understand why people complain about how loud some shavers like Remington are.  </li>
            <li>The triple heads will not turn, even though the battery shows a complete charge, and even rapping the side of the shaver produces no movement.  </li>
            <li>I have to use another one to cut closer, and use an old corded one at the office that has worked well for over 20 years.</li>
            <li>My old one makes a rattling, scraping type of noise.  </li>
            <li>but I hope my loyalty is not misplaced.</li>
            <li>The 8240XL is about 1 ounce lighter than my old shaver and is quieter.  </li>
            <li>I personally wouldnt get this one (got it as a gift) since I dont see why its worth the extra money over the 7310.  </li>
            <li>It shaved OK but the motor ran slow.  </li>
            <li>Not quite believing that the identical same thing could occur to two different models purchased from two different stores, I still returned the shaver for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a Norelco with \\&quot;shaving time</li>
            <li>Once again I followed the instructions to get a new razor up and running, and once again the same thing occurred.  </li>
            <li>It is virtually identical to the new one and uses the same HQ9 heads.  </li>
            <li>The new one was about $75 and included an extra set of heads.  </li>
            <li>Some have a charging stand which only clutters the bathroom counter and prevents the shaver from being plugged direct into the electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would have been nice to include a 12v cord for the car, but at least the attachment is the same from previous shavers so I can re-use the old one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike my prior foil shavers all hairs were inside leaving no mess in and around the sink.  </li>
            <li>Following the instructions, I began using it and noticed it sounded much different than my old one.</li>
            <li>I had a ten year old 8000 series Norelco shaver that simply stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li>I personally like the Norelco 3 head razors as compared to the Braun-type razors, but your going to have to try both since opinions differ widely on this issue and there doesnt seem to be any real way to tell who is going to like which razor type.</li>
            <li>I give the 8245 two stars in comparison to the 8250; it still gives a decent shave compared to other single-track electrics.</li>
            <li>It runs a bit quieter, and possibly at lower RPM (speculation based on the noise) which would be a negative if true.  </li>
            <li>But the shaving heads with three rows of cutters did seem to shave faster than my old shaver with the heads with a single row of cutters.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> was surprised by the cavalier attitude of the (courteous) person who simply said, \\&quot;Send it back to Amazon.\\</li>
            <li> Ok, now to this razor, I assume that this razor is the same as the 8240, except that it comes with the extra heads.  </li>
            <li> However, it finally gave up the ghost and on October 13, 2010 I purchased a new razor from a Rite Aid Pharmacy for $67.40, including tax (don&#x27;t know the model number because it was returned for a full refund).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used it for over 2 years and find it to do a marginal job with new blades and old, and I clean it regularly and thoroughly, and lube it as directed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quicker than my old 8000 series shaver.</li>
            <li> Whether any of this is a real difference or just the fact that my 7310 is two years old, I dont know,</li>
            <li> The remaining charge indicator on my old Norelco 7886XL was no longer working well -- it showed 44 minutes of full charge remaining after recharging, but when it was used and later showed 31 minutes remaining when I began shaving, the shaver would stop after about a couple of minutes of use and show \\&quot;0\\&quot; minutes remaining before I finished shaving -- so having no indicator on the Norelco</li>
            <li> This time I called the 800 number listed on the razor to speak to a live person and thinking they might have an answer for me</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a new electric razor in a while.</li>
            <li> It has not shaved well since new</li>
            <li> I usually buy the cheapest Norelco rotary razor every couple of years becuase the razor is about 30 dollars and the replacement blades are a couple of dollars more.  </li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the razor and would choose the same one next time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that is longer than when I first got it or if I hadn&#x27;t timed it when I left my review.  </li>
            <li> It does seem like it runs slow, when I finished using it the first time I was surprised how smooth  my face felt.  </li>
            <li> It does not come with a case that is large enough to hold the cord.  </li>
            <li> After trying this now I understand why people complain about how loud some shavers like Remington are.  </li>
            <li> The triple heads will not turn, even though the battery shows a complete charge, and even rapping the side of the shaver produces no movement.  </li>
            <li> I have to use another one to cut closer, and use an old corded one at the office that has worked well for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> My old one makes a rattling, scraping type of noise.  </li>
            <li> but I hope my loyalty is not misplaced.</li>
            <li> The 8240XL is about 1 ounce lighter than my old shaver and is quieter.  </li>
            <li> I personally wouldnt get this one (got it as a gift) since I dont see why its worth the extra money over the 7310.  </li>
            <li> It shaved OK but the motor ran slow.  </li>
            <li> Not quite believing that the identical same thing could occur to two different models purchased from two different stores, I still returned the shaver for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a Norelco with \\&quot;shaving time</li>
            <li> Once again I followed the instructions to get a new razor up and running, and once again the same thing occurred.  </li>
            <li> It is virtually identical to the new one and uses the same HQ9 heads.  </li>
            <li> The new one was about $75 and included an extra set of heads.  </li>
            <li> Some have a charging stand which only clutters the bathroom counter and prevents the shaver from being plugged direct into the electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would have been nice to include a 12v cord for the car, but at least the attachment is the same from previous shavers so I can re-use the old one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike my prior foil shavers all hairs were inside leaving no mess in and around the sink.  </li>
            <li> Following the instructions, I began using it and noticed it sounded much different than my old one.</li>
            <li> I had a ten year old 8000 series Norelco shaver that simply stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li> I personally like the Norelco 3 head razors as compared to the Braun-type razors, but your going to have to try both since opinions differ widely on this issue and there doesnt seem to be any real way to tell who is going to like which razor type.</li>
            <li> I give the 8245 two stars in comparison to the 8250; it still gives a decent shave compared to other single-track electrics.</li>
            <li> It runs a bit quieter, and possibly at lower RPM (speculation based on the noise) which would be a negative if true.  </li>
            <li> But the shaving heads with three rows of cutters did seem to shave faster than my old shaver with the heads with a single row of cutters.  </li>
            <li> This model is missing that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The impression it gave me was it is a well built high quality not make in China machine.</li>
            <li> the top metal cap &amp;#34;pops&amp;#34; open about once a week, either spewing your cut &amp;#34;whiskers&amp;#34; on the counter (and the motor keeps spinning); or dumping the 3 cutting heads, cutters, and internal plastic cutter frame onto the counter, floor, or into the sink.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, my goodneth!&lt;br /&gt;I could shave all day long if the battery would last!</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for a 10 year old razor with Ni-Cad batteries that have trouble recharging.</li>
            <li> seems an iffy proposition to me given that norelco batteries are not really user replaceable without a big hassle.  </li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco after shaving for a long time with a Norelco 8175.  </li>
            <li> My last Remington only lasted a coupe years ,the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, previous ones lasted many years and it was cost efficient to replace the cutting heads.  </li>
            <li> This is the 4th Norelco I&#x27;ve owned, and each one appears to be lighter, less robust, and much more expensive than its predacessors.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> It has a lithium ion battery that in theory ought to out last other types of batteries.  </li>
            <li> the suggestion being that manufacturers were creating lower quality versions of their products specifically for discounters (such as by using weaker motors or other components of lower quality than those used in versions sold in retail stores).  </li>
            <li> The cut is smoother and faster but the battery only lasts for less than 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> My old one merely needed new heads, so I now have two working shavers.  </li>
            <li> There should be little differences between shavers which use the same HQ9 heads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days</li>
            <li> No thanks.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare it to the other brands.  </li>
            <li> I asked if he had heard of any other complaints</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> When I first turned on the razor after fully charging it I thought there was something wrong with it, it was so quite</li>
            <li> Usually they last for 2-5 years.</li>
            <li> Maybe the brushes on the motor are wearing down (assuming there still are brushes).  </li>
            <li> Because the Norelco has rotary blades that travel in just one direction they can incorporate complex double blade cutting wheels that first lifts the whisker then cuts it below the skin line providing a closer shave then vibrating foil razors can.</li>
            <li> I checked the price and comments on Amazon.com and found the price at Costco to be less at that time -- $89.99 less $18 coupon equaled $71.99 --</li>
            <li> It takes about a half hour to charge and you are supposed to unplug it once charged.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that the improved blades would help, but not with such a weak motor.  </li>
            <li> Unit runs out of power with little or no warning after 6 uses, and you need the wall transformer to use it from the wall at that time...or wait until the batteries are recharged.  </li>
            <li> It takes about a little over an hour to charge.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco rotary shavers for nearly 50 years and my last one has been with me for at least 10 years, by replacing the cutting heads.</li>
            <li> this one is missing.  </li>
            <li> and there is no comparison with the Braun, even though the Braun was tops in the Consumers Report a few years ago.</li>
            <li> The set contains a Norelco 8240XL shaver that has no indicator of the remaining charge, that came with a shaver pouch that was too small for anything but the shaver and the brush, that did not come with a stand, and that has a quiet motor that seems a bit weak --</li>
            <li> This *is* cutting hair a lot better/quicker than my 2+ year old 7310.  </li>
            <li> and I was just not satisfied with the closeness of shaves.</li>
            <li> no big docking station and expensive cleaning baths.    </li>
            <li> A little irritating for the shaver to stop w/o warning on my way to work.  </li>
            <li> The razor holds a charge for over two weeks at least, I just recharge it at two week intervals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed the batteries didn&#x27;t last two weeks as advertised</li>
            <li> Sounds like a poor quality system.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco fan for 40+ years but find this XL model to be lousy.</li>
            <li> are irrelevant.  </li>
            <li> I tried to find the specifications for the motors used in both the 8145 and 8250, but was unable to, in either the manuals or at the Norelco website.  </li>
            <li> The motor was running but was unable to turn the blades.  </li>
            <li> Every so often, the 8245 plucks whiskers instead of cutting them, something that never happened with the 8175.  </li>
            <li> The bad -- the head tended to fall off during cleaning, there is no indicator to show battery charge status so shaver stops without notice, no space in case for the brush, power cord, instruction book, etc.</li>
            <li> 8240XL was not that bad.  </li>
            <li> Still no battery life indicator, which is a bit annoying given the increased price on this model.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst model I have ever had from Norelco.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Gave to my husband as a Christmas gift.  He says it works well, is a close shave and nice and quiet.     Only objection was the packaging; the box is huge!</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for a 10 year old razor with Ni-Cad batteries that have trouble recharging. New razor is very quiet and gives a good shave. Good value for the money spent.</li>
            <li> I have been using Remington razors for 30 years and this gives the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with a Remington.  It does seem like it runs slow, when I finished using it the first time I was surprised how smooth  my face felt.  My last Remington only lasted a coupe years ,the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, previous ones lasted many years and it was cost efficient to replace the cutting heads.  I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s life span. Must admit I have only used Remingtons so I can&#x27;t compare it to the other brands.  Got it @ Costco for $59.99 , 79.99 with an instant $20 rebate.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco at a great price to try it.  I loved using it but I never could get a close enough shave with it.  I liked it enough that I would have been able to live with it but for below/around my chin and my upper lip areas we just not acceptable even after a full 3 weeks of exclusive use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that if Norelco shavers works for you and you are okay with the pricey head replacements do NOT waste your time trying a foil shaver!  If you find, like me, needing a touch up shave before 5 using this, then a foil shaver likely will work better for you as they shave closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times of using it took a LONG time to get only an okay shave.  After a couple of weeks I could get a pretty good shave in about 3 minutes.  After a third week it was even a bit better shaver in about 3 to 4 minutes.  I&#x27;ve always used foil shavers prior so it took me a while to get used to it and for my face and hairs to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED using it as the shave was amazing comfortable and so quiet it was hard to believe it was working.  After trying this now I understand why people complain about how loud some shavers like Remington are.  I never cared about a shaver being loud until I found how nice it is to use a quiet one.  A foil shaver must move one or more cutters back and forth at high speed versus simply spinning and spinning gears so a foil shaver inherently will make a lot more noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike my prior foil shavers all hairs were inside leaving no mess in and around the sink.  This shaver would be tough to clean with a brush so being able to rinse it clean really was good and needed.  It has a lithium ion battery that in theory ought to out last other types of batteries.  However, with lithium you really need an indicator to tell you when say 5 or so minutes of shaving power is left so you are sure to charge it as well as when it is fully changed.  This model is missing that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The impression it gave me was it is a well built high quality not make in China machine.</li>
            <li> Another iteration of a reliable shaver.  My last one is still going strong after 7 years.  Would have been nice to include a 12v cord for the car, but at least the attachment is the same from previous shavers so I can re-use the old one.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco rotary shavers for nearly 50 years and my last one has been with me for at least 10 years, by replacing the cutting heads. However, it finally gave up the ghost and on October 13, 2010 I purchased a new razor from a Rite Aid Pharmacy for $67.40, including tax (don&#x27;t know the model number because it was returned for a full refund). Following the instructions, I began using it and noticed it sounded much different than my old one. The new one appeared to be running at a much slower rotary speed than the old one but did a fine job, at least for about a bit more than a month. It stopped working and although the battery indicated it was fully charged it struggled to work.....until it finally gave up the ghost. To get the heads to turn on at all you had to rap it with your knuckles......until finally it wouldn&#x27;t run at all. Taking it back to Rite Aid, they refunded my money.   On December 1st, I purchased another Norelco razor, this time from Target. Once again I followed the instructions to get a new razor up and running, and once again the same thing occurred.  Not quite believing that the identical same thing could occur to two different models purchased from two different stores, I still returned the shaver for a full refund.  This time I used the internet and ordered a (Philips) Norelco razor model 8240XL for $102.80 plus tax and shipping, from Amazon.com receiving it on Dec.24th,2010.  ASIN: B002E7HED8  * UPC: 075020004093 * Item model number: 8245XLD    Today is January 7, 2011, and the razor just quit with the same symptoms. The triple heads will not turn, even though the battery shows a complete charge, and even rapping the side of the shaver produces no movement.  This time I called the 800 number listed on the razor to speak to a live person and thinking they might have an answer for me was surprised by the cavalier attitude of the (courteous) person who simply said, \\&quot;Send it back to Amazon.\\&quot;  I asked if he had heard of any other complaints and he said, \\&quot;no.\\&quot; I did mention that all three of my razors were made in China but that didn&#x27;t seem to be a concern to him either.   Frankly, I don&#x27;t know what to do and wonder if any one else has reported any such problem?   I really don&#x27;t want to leave my Norelco rotary shaving system and always considered Norelco a reputable company. To have three shavers exhibit the same symptoms appears to me to be a systemic problem.   I wonder if this is another formerly reputable company being bitten be the \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; bug?</li>
            <li> Looks like I also got suckered at Costco.  The motor is obviously weaker than a model I bought 5+ years ago, making it more difficult to shave.  You&#x27;d think that the improved blades would help, but not with such a weak motor.  I searched high and low for a Norelco with \\&quot;shaving time remaining\\&quot;, but the only one is now well over $200 and looks like it just came from outer space.  No thanks.  A little irritating for the shaver to stop w/o warning on my way to work.  It&#x27;s a good thing I was done shaving!  I will be returning this one to Costco.  Norelco is forcing me back to my blade.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a new electric razor in a while. This one does a great job, it&#x27;s quiet and gives a close shave. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I had a ten year old 8000 series Norelco shaver that simply stopped holding a charge. So i looked at a many shavers before pulling the trigger on this one. I love it. It&#x27;s a quick, close, comfortable shave, and with more holes and slots It&#x27;s much quicker than my old 8000 series shaver. Plus you get the extra set of blades free. (It&#x27;s a 38 dollar value, that&#x27;s what they sell them for at Walmart) I&#x27;ve only charged it once since I got it three weeks ago. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Just for comparison, and so you know what I&#x27;m coming from, I have a 2+ year old Norelco 7310 which I thought was a nice razor for the money, but I&#x27;m not paying to change the heads given that the battery isnt easily replaceable and the whole razor only cost $40.  That is the best selling model right now on Amazon and you could pick that one up if you want to save real dollars over this one, and it has 4 stars over 700 reviews.  Ok, now to this razor, I assume that this razor is the same as the 8240, except that it comes with the extra heads.  It comes with the manual for the 8240 and looks exactly like the 8240.  8240 has 4 stars over hundreds of reviews.   As compared to the 7310, the shaver heads on the 8245 have a lot more holes to cut hair, which I guess has to be a good thing.  It runs a bit quieter, and possibly at lower RPM (speculation based on the noise) which would be a negative if true.  Other than that, I dont see whole lot of meaningful difference between this and the cheaper 7310.  Still no battery life indicator, which is a bit annoying given the increased price on this model.  The battery is not meant to be replaced by the user, just like, I believe, all the Norelco models.  It does not come with a case that is large enough to hold the cord.  Other than that, it looks and works like basically every Norelco I&#x27;ve ever had.  This *is* cutting hair a lot better/quicker than my 2+ year old 7310.  However, it feels slightly more abrasive on the face.  Whether any of this is a real difference or just the fact that my 7310 is two years old, I dont know, but in any event I&#x27;m happy with the way its working.  I personally wouldnt get this one (got it as a gift) since I dont see why its worth the extra money over the 7310.  I would also get the 8340 over this one unless they are the same price, as paying for extra replacement heads seems an iffy proposition to me given that norelco batteries are not really user replaceable without a big hassle.  In other words, Ithink your better off buying a cheap one like the 7310 or maybe the 8340, using it into the ground, and just getting a new razor without buying any extras.  I personally like the Norelco 3 head razors as compared to the Braun-type razors, but your going to have to try both since opinions differ widely on this issue and there doesnt seem to be any real way to tell who is going to like which razor type.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco fan for 40+ years but find this XL model to be lousy. It is comfortable to hold and use, and does not cause razor burn because it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough. I have to use another one to cut closer, and use an old corded one at the office that has worked well for over 20 years. I recommend avoiding this XL model.  1 star because I do not like it.  I have used it for over 2 years and find it to do a marginal job with new blades and old, and I clean it regularly and thoroughly, and lube it as directed. It has not shaved well since new but it is the only Norelco I have had that I do not like; I keep waiting for it to break in or break and it doesn&#x27;t.  It is only good for a quick clean-up.</li>
            <li> After 2+ years, I&#x27;m still using this without changing the rotary blades.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this every morning with a shaving mousse.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very useful when you are in a hurry and you don&#x27;t want to cut yourself with a shaving blade.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I see is you need to run it through repeatedly in some of the areas to get a clean shave. But gets the job done.</li>
            <li> According to an email from amazon.com, I ordered a model no. 8245XL with an extra set of HQ9 heads.  What I received was a model no. 8240XL.  The booklet with the shaver was for model nos. 8240XL, 8250XL and 8251XL.  I have no idea what the differences are, if any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my research, the model nos. are irrelevant.  What is relevant is the type of head and the price.  There should be little differences between shavers which use the same HQ9 heads.  The only relevant difference I can find is that some of the cheaper models take 12 hours to charge the battery.  The better ones only 1 hour.  Most people don&#x27;t want to wait 12 hours.  Some have a charging stand which only clutters the bathroom counter and prevents the shaver from being plugged direct into the electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a model no. 8270XL which I had bought at Costco for $99.  It is virtually identical to the new one and uses the same HQ9 heads.  The new one was about $75 and included an extra set of heads.  My old one merely needed new heads, so I now have two working shavers.  My old one makes a rattling, scraping type of noise.  Maybe the brushes on the motor are wearing down (assuming there still are brushes).  They used to be replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A person can compare models on the Norelco web site, but they don&#x27;t list much in the way of differences.  It looks to me that every store gets a different model number.  Or, the large number of model nos. is to make it harder for consumers to compare prices and features, and for Norelco to sell more shavers at a higher price.  Some shavers have shiny paint or plastic, and some have a rubber type of grip.  But the prices vary substantially.  Is the quality that much different between a $60 shaver and one priced at $120?  I doubt it. I suspect that a $1 or $2 manufacturing cost different translates into a $60 price increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to shop price, type of heads and charging time.</li>
            <li> Good morning the day yesterday started to load my new machine Philips Norelco Speed XL Shaver 8245XLD, to my surprise after 12 hours of charge as indicated in the manual does not work does not indicate that this loading, please I require an answer.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th Norelco I&#x27;ve owned, and each one appears to be lighter, less robust, and much more expensive than its predacessors.&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping this would finally have Lithium Ion Batteries...nope they stayed with the old-school Nickel Cadmium cells.  Unit runs out of power with little or no warning after 6 uses, and you need the wall transformer to use it from the wall at that time...or wait until the batteries are recharged.  Big downside...the top metal cap &amp;#34;pops&amp;#34; open about once a week, either spewing your cut &amp;#34;whiskers&amp;#34; on the counter (and the motor keeps spinning); or dumping the 3 cutting heads, cutters, and internal plastic cutter frame onto the counter, floor, or into the sink.  Takes about 3 minutes to put it back together when this happens (and the cutters then don&#x27;t match the mated heads).&lt;br /&gt;The Remington (competitor) has a look-a-like to the Norelco, which is where I will look next time.  It&#x27;s bizarre that Norelco also has a shaver that sells for $150...not this one... it&#x27;s a lot of marketing vs need.  Maybe that one has LI cells and the cutters stay in place???</li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco after shaving for a long time with a Norelco 8175.  The 8245 came in a bundle similar to the one advertised here for about $80, except with a set of replacement heads instead of the charging stand.  I figured it was a good deal, as the set of replacement heads runs between $30-$35 on its own.  The 8245 seemed weaker than my old 8175, taking many more passes to get a good, close shave.  Every so often, the 8245 plucks whiskers instead of cutting them, something that never happened with the 8175.  I heard or read somewhere that I should beware of \\&quot;gray market\\&quot; items at discount stores; the suggestion being that manufacturers were creating lower quality versions of their products specifically for discounters (such as by using weaker motors or other components of lower quality than those used in versions sold in retail stores).  I kept my eyes open for the 8245 at local retail stores, but never saw it anywhere but at Costco.  Recently, I came across a great \\&quot;clearance\\&quot; sale at a local retailer, and picked up the 8250 to compare to the 8245.  It seems to me that the 8245 simply gives a weaker shave than the 8250.  The 8250 gives a great shave with far fewer passes.  I tried to find the specifications for the motors used in both the 8145 and 8250, but was unable to, in either the manuals or at the Norelco website.  I give the 8245 two stars in comparison to the 8250; it still gives a decent shave compared to other single-track electrics.</li>
            <li> I have owned a number of Norelco shavers over the last 25 years and loved them all -- until this one.  First the good -- It shaved OK but the motor ran slow.  The bad -- the head tended to fall off during cleaning, there is no indicator to show battery charge status so shaver stops without notice, no space in case for the brush, power cord, instruction book, etc. so the accessories had to be packed in a plastic sandwich bag when I traveled.  I&#x27;ve used the shaver for a month but I&#x27;m returning it and will look for a model with the features this one is missing.  I&#x27;m still a Norelco fan but I hope my loyalty is not misplaced.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up on my Braun razor when the trimmer broke and I was just not satisfied with the closeness of shaves. I have had the Norelco8245XLD now for about a month and there is no comparison with the Braun, even though the Braun was tops in the Consumers Report a few years ago. Because the Norelco has rotary blades that travel in just one direction they can incorporate complex double blade cutting wheels that first lifts the whisker then cuts it below the skin line providing a closer shave then vibrating foil razors can. The Norelco&#x27;s three floating heads do an excellent job following the contours of my face. There were whiskers on my neck that the foil razor could never seem to cut and I would occasionally have to cut them with a blade, the Norelco cuts them without a problem.     When I first turned on the razor after fully charging it I thought there was something wrong with it, it was so quite and it sounded like it wasn&#x27;t up to speed-- not true-- it gave a great shave and the speed was fine, it just sounded so much more quite then the Braun.    Another nice thing about this razor is that you can flip open the shaving head without removing it and wash it with tap water-- no big docking station and expensive cleaning baths.    The razor holds a charge for over two weeks at least, I just recharge it at two week intervals. I would remove one star for not having a low battery light and no travel storage for the charger.</li>
            <li> My Norelco 7886XL shaver&#x27;s battery was losing its capacity after six years of use, so the Costco coupon offer for the Norelco 8245XLD with the extra set of shaving heads caught my eye.  I checked the price and comments on Amazon.com and found the price at Costco to be less at that time -- $89.99 less $18 coupon equaled $71.99 -- so I bought the Norelco 8245XLD set from Costco.  The set contains a Norelco 8240XL shaver that has no indicator of the remaining charge, that came with a shaver pouch that was too small for anything but the shaver and the brush, that did not come with a stand, and that has a quiet motor that seems a bit weak -- all pointed out by the comments, so I knew what I was getting.  The remaining charge indicator on my old Norelco 7886XL was no longer working well -- it showed 44 minutes of full charge remaining after recharging, but when it was used and later showed 31 minutes remaining when I began shaving, the shaver would stop after about a couple of minutes of use and show \\&quot;0\\&quot; minutes remaining before I finished shaving -- so having no indicator on the Norelco 8240XL was not that bad.  The 8240XL is about 1 ounce lighter than my old shaver and is quieter.  But the shaving heads with three rows of cutters did seem to shave faster than my old shaver with the heads with a single row of cutters.  The only time that the shaver heads pulled hair was when I got too close to my mustache.  After the initial twelve-hour charge, I used the shaver from September 26, 2010, to November 16, 2010, when it stopped toward the end of my shave and I had to plug in the cord in order to finish shaving and then recharge the shaver.  For my use, the battery charge is satisfactory and the lack of the battery status is not a big concern.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the cheapest Norelco rotary razor every couple of years becuase the razor is about 30 dollars and the replacement blades are a couple of dollars more.  This time when it came time to replace the blades I stepped up to a 8200 series.  The cut is smoother and faster but the battery only lasts for less than 2 hours.  I shave while multitasking and it takes about an hour each day.  So I get two days shave at most from the razor.  Then I charge up the battery again.  It takes about a half hour to charge and you are supposed to unplug it once charged.  The light flashes when charged.  I&#x27;m disappointed the batteries didn&#x27;t last two weeks as advertised but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the razor and would choose the same one next time. Update 17 March 2012.  Razor is still working well.  It takes about a little over an hour to charge.  I don&#x27;t know if that is longer than when I first got it or if I hadn&#x27;t timed it when I left my review.  This razor does not take me any longer to shave than another razor.  It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m surfing the internet and stuff like that while shaving.  Update 8 Dec 2012.  The razor quit working tonight.  The motor was running but was unable to turn the blades.  Taking the front blade out allows it to run with only two blades.  I never did replace the blades so maybe that&#x27;s the problem but in case it isnt I&#x27;m replacing the whole razor with a cheaper one for now.</li>
            <li> Ith tho great! I just wuv it!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, my goodneth!&lt;br /&gt;I could shave all day long if the battery would last!</li>
            <li> Norelco shaver has moved our relationship to the next level...suddenly we take the time for romance and closeness! I recommend Norelco Speed XL shaver to men of all ages. I already purchased 2 for the men in my family.</li>
            <li> Not as good as previous Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve owned. Seems like the quality just isnt there anymore, but the extra set of cutters kind of makes up for it.</li>
            <li> GOOD SHAVER,EASY TO CLEAN</li>
            <li> It is not as good as what I expected.  My Norelco that died was a much better shaver than this one.</li>
            <li> Today, the shaver wouldn&#x27;t work at all even when it was plugged in the light wouldn&#x27;t light up. This is the worst model I have ever had from Norelco. Usually they last for 2-5 years. This one lasted maybe 5 months. The others died mechanically. This is the first one to die electronically. Sounds like a poor quality system.</li>
            <li> I like the easy wash feature since I can run it under the faucet.  Takes a long time to shave as it is not the most powerful shaver out there.  It is value for money though.</li>
