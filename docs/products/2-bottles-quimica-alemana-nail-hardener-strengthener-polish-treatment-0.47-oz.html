            <li> I have to constantly cut my nails since they grow so long!</li>
            <li> This was definitely instrumental in getting my nails back to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; after a few years of acrylics.  </li>
            <li> Will last up to two weeks if I am not in the field or the cow lot.</li>
            <li> After a few months of diligent use my nails are much improved and I continue to use it as base &amp; top coat.  </li>
            <li> My mother has weak brittle nails and this polish really seems to work.  </li>
            <li> One coat and a few days later my nails are stronger and visibly growing!  </li>
            <li> It strengthens my nails and keeps the polish on better than other base coats.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and my nail color lasts longer if I use it as a top and base coat.</li>
            <li> It resists chipping a peeling for about 10 days if I am doing heavy work.</li>
            <li> I then tried to return the in opened bottle since it didn&#x27;t work worth a crap.</li>
            <li> No more peeling, cracking, or breaking.  </li>
            <li> It truly makes your nails hard and thick.</li>
            <li> This is the only base coat I use.</li>
            <li> After YEARS of artificial tips, my nails were paper thin and see through.  </li>
            <li> If you have very thin bending nails that split and break, this is not the product for you!</li>

            <li> Only product that really &amp; truly makes your nails harder thereby allowing them to grow. But use sparingly &amp; with caution.</li>
            <li> This stuffs really works. If anyone is going through acrylic nail rehab, this is right for you. There is healing in every stroke!!!</li>
            <li> I am a cleveland area manicurist! This stuff works !!!</li>
            <li> This is the best, longest lasting nail hardener I have ever used.  I have all of my friends using it.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for my nails. I used it many years ago and recently found it on Amazon, ordered 2 bottles and I&#x27;m in love. My nails are so long and pretty.</li>
            <li> My nails have grown and are strong since using this polish.  Amazon shouldn&#x27;t force the numbers of words for a review.</li>
            <li> If you have very thin bending nails that split and break, this is not the product for you! I bought 2 bottles used maybe three times just to give it a shot. It turned my nails brown at the tips and burned like a bitch! I then tried to return the in opened bottle since it didn&#x27;t work worth a crap. And they refused even though it was unopened. Not to mention it made my nails split and break more. I have since found a product it is by Mavala. It is incredible!</li>
            <li> The best this nail polish really works it keeps your nails hard and they grow</li>
            <li> My nails are much stronger now. I&#x27;d recommend this product  without any hesitation. I started noticing a difference right away.</li>

            <li> This was definitely instrumental in getting my nails back to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; after a few years of acrylics.  After a few months of diligent use my nails are much improved and I continue to use it as base &amp; top coat.  Even my manicurist has ordered it for her clients.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, I have great nails now. However this product does hurt my nail beds sometimes...But not always.</li>
            <li> I live on a farm. we feed livestock, I help work on machinery, fix fence, load and unload 50 lb. bags of seed and feed. I also cook for 4 men every day. The rest of me may be a mess, but my nails always look great. I actually have to be careful to cut them because with this nail hardeners they grow long very quick, often to long to type comfortably! I use this as a base coat, then my regular cheap nail polish and then Alemana as a top coat. It resists chipping a peeling for about 10 days if I am doing heavy work. Will last up to two weeks if I am not in the field or the cow lot.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. I can&#x27;t live without it. Great to strengthen your nails.</li>

            <li> One coat and a few days later my nails are stronger and visibly growing!  I&#x27;ve got soft nails - always been that way. This product works wonders! Have bought for others and they have same/great results.  Working on my 3 bottle!</li>
            <li> I always used to buy it in latin american countries because there is where they normally sell it and it was awesome! It truly makes your nails hard and thick.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite product!!!  Thank you for shipping so quickly!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problem growing my nails. They would chip and peel. As soon as i started using this polish almost immediately i noticed a difference. This makes your nails grow fast, long and strong. I have to constantly cut my nails since they grow so long! It did cause a slight disconfort the first couple of times i used it, which i was told by my friend who recomended this product, that it was normal. It felt like my nails were &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; .  Its been three years that i use this and i&#x27;ve never felt anything again.</li>
            <li> The best nail product in the world! I had short chipped nails my entire life, now my nails are long and strong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this nail hardner in the past and it&#x27;s AMAZING</li>
            <li> This is the only base coat I use. It strengthens my nails and keeps the polish on better than other base coats. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After YEARS of artificial tips, my nails were paper thin and see through.  I noticed a difference in the strength and look of my nails in 2 weeks.  No more peeling, cracking, or breaking.  I am on my 2nd order!  I never write reviews, but I had to for Quimica Alemana.  A++</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time playing with my race cars and do a lot of the work myself.  Consequently, my nails take a beating.  My wife found the Quimica Nail Hardener product, finally got me to use it, and for the first time in years, I have nails that look descent and don&#x27;t get stared at during corporate meetings. I no longer have to explain that I didn&#x27;t have a flat tire on the way to the office.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve used it for years and my nail color lasts longer if I use it as a top and base coat.</li>
            <li> Great Price, Lightning Fast Delivery, High Recommended Seller-thank you again !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> fair price and fast delivery! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT product! You see it as soon as you start to use. THANKS a lot.</li>
