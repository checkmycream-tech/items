    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>In practice we weren&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
            <li>The Phillips HP6376/10 Bikini Perfect battery operated shaver is perfect for eyebrows, your bikini line, and even those determined chin hairs women don&#x27;t like to talk about.  </li>
            <li>Simply excellent.</li>
            <li>The Bikini perfect can stay charged for up to 60 minutes and does not need to be oiled, so there is no maintenance involved.</li>
            <li>What a great product!</li>
            <li>Additionally, the wet-dry option is a great convenience: use it in the tub or out!</li>
            <li>contacted Philips and they said the best they could do was a discount in their online store.</li>
            <li>this trimmer is great!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not looking for after wax results from a shaver, Bikini Perfect is a great model.</li>
            <li>Very nice portable compact trimmer with excellent accessories.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good choice!</li>
            <li>This grooming system is great for anybody.</li>
            <li>One is the Precision trimmer, which is  great for touch ups.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Bikini Perfect trimmer is seriously amazing.</li>
            <li>Bikini Perfect Deluxe Trimmer,</li>
            <li>This concerned me a great deal, considering the areas this trimmer is meant to trim.  </li>
            <li>Happy</li>
            <li>Also great that it charges and isn&#x27;t battery powered.</li>
            <li>It was a great trimmer...</li>
            <li>Works great per my wife</li>
            <li>Its great for swimsuit weather.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>If it breaks, I&#x27;ll be buying her another one for sure!!</li>
            <li>and i recommend this since it is very handy to use it...</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>best part was the pen trimmer; I&#x27;ve never used one, and love this model.  </li>
            <li>It is also so good at removal you won&#x27;t have to use it too often and the price is great.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I love the Philips Bikini Perfect, which works on rechargeable battery,</li>
            <li>Ladeis, you will love  the ease of this and best of all?</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s good about this model?</li>
            <li>The exfoliating glove wasn&#x27;t so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never before used an electric razor, specifically because I didn&#x27;t think it could be as good as manually shaving.</li>
            <li>Opal / Aqua]]The product was what I was looking good.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a handy eyebrow trimmer that works great.  </li>
            <li>, this is a good option to consider.  </li>
            <li>This thing is awesome, from the contoured shape of the head (perfect for getting around folds and creases) to the fact that it&#x27;s freaking RECHARGEABLE, so I can finally stop tossing batteries out.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still very pleased.</li>
            <li>The trimmer feels perfect in my hand -- just the right shape, and grippy-ness.</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute and meant to please the ladies!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Dual heads are great and easy to change.</li>
            <li>But when I razor-shave after using the trimmer, my legs feel amazing.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s really nice is</li>
            <li>So a bonus one is a nice touch, but not needed for us.  </li>
            <li>liked the weight of it and</li>
            <li>It does not snag hairs and it trims nice and evenly.</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>two things that were very important to me.</li>
            <li>It charges super fast, holds a charge well, and is the perfect size for bikini area.  </li>
            <li>An exfoliating lotion, even one made for a guy&#x27;s beard is so much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok trimmer and designer.  </li>
            <li>in all I wouldn&#x27;t put this at the top of my list for bikini shavers.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer that leaves a smooth shave - look beyond this one!</li>
            <li>Most of the time when I go to use it, it lasts 3 seconds then has to be on the charger...</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping for a more durable replacement for the inexpensive \\&quot;beard and neck hair</li>
            <li>The Philips Bikini Perfect is much smaller than most trimmers but fits neatly in my hand.  </li>
            <li>so I was able to try it out immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a more compact trimmer, maybe to keep in your travel bag or as a spare</li>
            <li>This works great as a trimmer for bikini area, but it is very noisy.</li>
            <li>They work best with eyebrows, especially to stave off the unibrow if you don&#x27;t feel like plucking all the time</li>
            <li>Better than waxing - saves time and money.</li>
            <li>lots of attachment options, which I love.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The foil shaver attachment is just ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t pinched my skin yet either like most trimmers to.</li>
            <li>Also, LOVE that it is waterproof so you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The battery life could be better.</li>
            <li>Tried so many they all seem to suck.</li>
            <li>Anything I can do to avoid razor-burn and irritation while being able to wear skirts and dresses all-year around I will try.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it about 5 times before it died on me.  </li>
            <li>It works ok, but you have to charge it often.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s basically a comfortable level that shouldn&#x27;t itch and be very easy to control.</li>
            <li>The blade is the perfect size for covering a good amount of area while getting into those &#x27;hard to reach&#x27; areas.</li>
            <li>I find they get a better, more precise shave.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not &#x60;error proof&#x27; and will nick if you are not careful, but if you are cautious while using, you get excellent results ~ a handy item to have around, especially with so many extras included: would recommend!</li>
            <li>but glad they&#x27;re available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have found that using it wet in the shower with a soap or shaving creme produces the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shape isn&#x27;t easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Keeps everything tidy without too much pain or fuss!</li>
            <li>but once I got used to the sensation and how to best handle the appliance and be VERY careful with its use, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li>They always work fine for a year or so then fall apart.</li>
            <li>The other is the Micro shaver, and that gives a flawless super smooth finish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The charger doesn&#x27;t fit snugly into the razor.</li>
            <li>The charge light came on, but it never worked again.  </li>
            <li>The light indicating that the trimmer is charging is not coming on, and still had no charge even after leaving it plugged in for 12 hours.</li>
            <li>By no means is it completely smooth.</li>
            <li>suspiscious it&#x27;d work well in the shower, but it really does, and it holds a charge nicely.</li>
            <li>It is designed to cut hair at three lengths so you can trim, cut fairly close, or completely shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is very effective, I only need to go over a section once and every hair is trimmed to</li>
            <li>If you and your partner like to maintain a clean area or enjoy this activity as part of your adult fun, it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li>have contacted the company and at the moment, they were very friendly and willing to work with me on resolving the problem.</li>
            <li>Waxing is not an option for my sensitive skin, best not to go into further detail.</li>
            <li>It will NOT give you a clean shave like a razor</li>
            <li>after you clean up (basically all gone)</li>
            <li>...2) Doesn&#x27;t cut worth a darn, even stray or fine hairs, no matter which attachment you used.  </li>
            <li>It also does really work in the shower or bath, so if you have the luxury of taking more than a two minute shower, have at it.  </li>
            <li>pleased with this product, and would absolutely purchase.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this trimmer as I already had a trimmer I really like but can&#x27;t find the charger for it.  </li>
            <li>If your intention is to be totally smooth, you&#x27;ll have to use a fresh razor and lotion or pay for a full bikini wax.</li>
            <li>The rechargeable battery is excellent - it juices up quick, and each charge lasts at least an hour.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very careful about what I put around my pockeybook (LOL)</li>
            <li>And trims well, not close but quickly and without frustration.  </li>
            <li>It just dies quickly.</li>
            <li>because I like to shave in the shower, but sometimes, we need a quick \\&quot;polish\\&quot; and dont have time to jump in the shower.</li>
            <li>When my last electric razor broke, I thought I would it would be best to just buy a trimmer as that is the only function I use.</li>
            <li>Very functional and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The bonus pen trimmer actually worked better than the bikini trimmer itself!  </li>
            <li>Philips has this great little bikini trimmer now.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH IT</li>
            <li>My wife is completely satisfied with the product and has replaced her old trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also a rare case where the travel bag is useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The attachements are also really nice for trimming up any unwanted hair on the face like upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I certainly won&#x27;t be using the Bikini Perfect long enough to find out if it falls apart or not.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a very close &amp; knick-free shave, you&#x27;re going to have to be very careful with this one - it might be best to have this one for more precise trimming (facial hair) and the the other type for the \\&quot;bigger jobs\\&quot; :)be best to have this one for more precise trimming (facial hair) and the the other type for the \\&quot;bigger jobs\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li>So let&#x27;s get this right out.</li>
            <li>price is just right.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a small battery operated razor that I find works great for things like shaping eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I myself have had laser hair removal, but being a redhead, cannot get rid of any blonde hair on my body, so this is perfect for my little touch-ups once in a while.</li>
            <li>This device is a trimmer first.  </li>
            <li>I was put off by it at first</li>
            <li>I can happily report that my skin has not retaliated in the least.</li>
            <li>The Schick trimmer is small, battery operated and safe for water; the Panasonic, also battery-operated, isn&#x27;t water safe, but it&#x27;s larger and works better.</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations for this.</li>
            <li>product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>, this is a useful gadget at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Philips!</li>
            <li>I really, really like this shaver!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned two Remington personal shavers before, and neither one of them lasted more than a year...</li>
            <li>The first one lasted almost 3 years.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic was cheaper and actually worked better.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for in a bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li>first impression of this product is that it felt heavy-duty and substantial.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the gift that keeps on giving ;-)  </li>
            <li>I found by using the electric first it prevents any irritation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful for ladies who always like a maintained look down there but don&#x27;t want everyone to LOOK down there in order to receive it.</li>
            <li>I keep my bikini area totally hair-free, and the Philips Bikini Perfect is the third trimmer I&#x27;ve added to my arsenal (the other two being [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>( I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet!), and I love the fact that it can be used inside the shower as well as dry.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for the bikini area and it works very well, much better than some of the other brands that have bigger, wider, and bulkier clippers.</li>
            <li>, it holds a charge for several days with light use, it stores neatly in the included, zippered bag and includes an exfoliating scrub glove, something that really helps keep the ingrown hair issue at bay if you use it before</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve lived this much of my life without one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The straight trimmer, without the comb, works and got her almost fully shaved</li>
            <li>so you really have to plan ahead &amp; get it charged before you can use it.</li>
            <li>(so you can adjust how much you want to clip off), and a charging adapter.</li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;third&amp;#34; head is really just a plastic cover that fits one of the two real razor heads, to assist with areas with longer hair.  </li>
            <li>This razor saves me so much time.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer attachment works very well.</li>
            <li>It holds it&#x27;s charge very well</li>
            <li>use this as a trimmer to get my bikini line hairs short, and then I go in with a razor to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>i expected much more from this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it cleans you up very well &amp;</li>
            <li>It comes with a small pen trimmer which is very useful in fine tuning.   </li>
            <li>I have had the most success using the \\&quot;bikini trimmer\\&quot; on women&#x27;s electric razors in the past.</li>
            <li>: it works great &#x60;down there&#x27;, but definitely be careful when using...</li>
            <li>But for those of us who have turned to electric razors in the past for \\&quot;the preliminaries\\&quot;, it&#x27;s nice to have a dedicated device.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s very reliable!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend if you don&#x27;t want to go the route of waxes-- which I never will.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>It is worth noting that it does take quite a bit of time to get the job done, even after you get used to it, but likely under an hour for most users (even less if you have a friend to help!).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this little trimmer.</li>
            <li>But I can safely say it doesn&#x27;t give out after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>little trimmer, which fits comfortably in one&#x27;s hand, worked very well and three days after shaving</li>
            <li>We are always looking for new options in this &#x27;genre.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>We have a couple of touch up shavers and that new mini one from Braun.</li>
            <li>And it just so happened that I was in the market for a new shaver when this popped up in my Vine newsletter.</li>
            <li>The two real heads allow for a &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;close shave,&amp;#34; but they are really just two different levels of trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the instructions warn that the razor will require 10 hours of charging time for 60 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li>Really upset I paid this much for only four uses!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver&#x27;s clippers are a good width, small enough to easily use in that area, yet wide enough to get the job done well.</li>
            <li>This is a handy trimmer to have, with various attachments for length, and even comes with a little pen trimmer!  </li>
            <li>Most likely it works, and would be recommended if you have a lot of hair there and want to bring down the length.  </li>
            <li>I will likely never (ever) use a manual razor again, not when i can get a better, smoother and less stressful shave with this.</li>
            <li>The head to shave bare works ok, but only if the hair is very short to begin with and the regular trimming head does not have any mechanism to prevent nicking.</li>
            <li>I actually have to tape it in a certain way to get it to connect and charge.</li>
            <li>Power feels very weak compared to my Panasonic ES246AC Bikini Shaper and Trimmer, which also has a wider head, and with which I&#x27;ve had superior results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes with several attachments (comb, straight cut, mini touch-up shaver, exfoliating glove, etc.).  </li>
            <li>I tried epilating earlier this year, but again, had to apply too much pressure for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I hadn&#x27;t thrown out my old battery-powered one.</li>
            <li>Whether you want just a trim or complete removal.</li>
            <li>I like to buy directly from amazon, the distribution is faster</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave and didn&#x27;t hurt (only snagged on a hair once) to use.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a Panasonic rechargeable that was getting old.  </li>
            <li>This one can pull hair or cut you in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>But it will easy get your trimmed down to a very short level for everyday, or for prepping the area to be fully smooth with a blade or wet/dry shaver</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot pink and easily takes out stray eyebrows and other facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use in or out of the shower with very few instances of ripping a hair out from the root.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>I purchased this girls&#x27; personal shaver several weeks ago and purposely waited before writing a review, so that I could first see how I like it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I have no complaints at all and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for this for personal trimming/grooming.  </li>
            <li>This thing helps so much because, if it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve gone to the beach, I don&#x27;t need to fight 1/2 inch long bikini hair with a razor.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking of buying a new personal shaver, check out this one....</li>
            <li>I think the battery powered ones are less powerful.</li>
            <li>Shaves it right off down to the skin so there is no stubble.</li>
            <li>this is my second time purchasing as the first one I purchased several years ago finally died on me.</li>
            <li>There are some negative reviews on here from people who were looking for a shaver and a smooth finish, which this is not.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and simply cannot tolerate salon or home bikini waxing, so I shave.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that Philips offers a 45-day money back guarantee ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the battery holds the charge for the full 60 minutes</li>
            <li>Still looking for the right little shaver.</li>
            <li>it was so loud that if anyone else was in your house they&#x27;d think you were using a different device entirely</li>
            <li>This trimmer barely touches the hair, let alone actually trim it.</li>
            <li>Included, too, is a small eyebrow shaper (it&#x27;s about the size of a pencil and includes a small blade-guard) and an exfoliating glove: nice bonuses to throw in, and they complement the actual shaving unit itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the first one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after a while, and on the second one, the little part that you plug the cord into in order to recharge it, broke...</li>
            <li>Other than that, you really do need to keep using your tweezers and facial creams on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve returned or thrown away other bikini razors rated highly on Amazon.</li>
            <li>you just have to use a real razor a little bit.</li>
            <li>: waterproof, small, comes with interchangeable heads and a bonus eyebrow trimmer (which is also useful on very delicate skin and is better than the last one I had), is sharp and delivers a close shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> In practice we weren&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
            <li> The Phillips HP6376/10 Bikini Perfect battery operated shaver is perfect for eyebrows, your bikini line, and even those determined chin hairs women don&#x27;t like to talk about.  </li>
            <li> Simply excellent.</li>
            <li> The Bikini perfect can stay charged for up to 60 minutes and does not need to be oiled, so there is no maintenance involved.</li>
            <li> What a great product!</li>
            <li> Additionally, the wet-dry option is a great convenience: use it in the tub or out!</li>
            <li> contacted Philips and they said the best they could do was a discount in their online store.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is great!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not looking for after wax results from a shaver, Bikini Perfect is a great model.</li>
            <li> Very nice portable compact trimmer with excellent accessories.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good choice!</li>
            <li> This grooming system is great for anybody.</li>
            <li> One is the Precision trimmer, which is  great for touch ups.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Bikini Perfect trimmer is seriously amazing.</li>
            <li> Bikini Perfect Deluxe Trimmer,</li>
            <li> This concerned me a great deal, considering the areas this trimmer is meant to trim.  </li>
            <li> Happy</li>
            <li> Also great that it charges and isn&#x27;t battery powered.</li>
            <li> It was a great trimmer...</li>
            <li> Works great per my wife</li>
            <li> Its great for swimsuit weather.</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> If it breaks, I&#x27;ll be buying her another one for sure!!</li>
            <li> and i recommend this since it is very handy to use it...</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> best part was the pen trimmer; I&#x27;ve never used one, and love this model.  </li>
            <li> It is also so good at removal you won&#x27;t have to use it too often and the price is great.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I love the Philips Bikini Perfect, which works on rechargeable battery,</li>
            <li> Ladeis, you will love  the ease of this and best of all?</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s good about this model?</li>
            <li> The exfoliating glove wasn&#x27;t so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never before used an electric razor, specifically because I didn&#x27;t think it could be as good as manually shaving.</li>
            <li> Opal / Aqua]]The product was what I was looking good.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a handy eyebrow trimmer that works great.  </li>
            <li> , this is a good option to consider.  </li>
            <li> This thing is awesome, from the contoured shape of the head (perfect for getting around folds and creases) to the fact that it&#x27;s freaking RECHARGEABLE, so I can finally stop tossing batteries out.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still very pleased.</li>
            <li> The trimmer feels perfect in my hand -- just the right shape, and grippy-ness.</li>
            <li> The packaging is cute and meant to please the ladies!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Dual heads are great and easy to change.</li>
            <li> But when I razor-shave after using the trimmer, my legs feel amazing.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s really nice is</li>
            <li> So a bonus one is a nice touch, but not needed for us.  </li>
            <li> liked the weight of it and</li>
            <li> It does not snag hairs and it trims nice and evenly.</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> two things that were very important to me.</li>
            <li> It charges super fast, holds a charge well, and is the perfect size for bikini area.  </li>
            <li> An exfoliating lotion, even one made for a guy&#x27;s beard is so much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok trimmer and designer.  </li>
            <li> in all I wouldn&#x27;t put this at the top of my list for bikini shavers.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer that leaves a smooth shave - look beyond this one!</li>
            <li> Most of the time when I go to use it, it lasts 3 seconds then has to be on the charger...</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for a more durable replacement for the inexpensive \\&quot;beard and neck hair</li>
            <li> The Philips Bikini Perfect is much smaller than most trimmers but fits neatly in my hand.  </li>
            <li> so I was able to try it out immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a more compact trimmer, maybe to keep in your travel bag or as a spare</li>
            <li> This works great as a trimmer for bikini area, but it is very noisy.</li>
            <li> They work best with eyebrows, especially to stave off the unibrow if you don&#x27;t feel like plucking all the time</li>
            <li> Better than waxing - saves time and money.</li>
            <li> lots of attachment options, which I love.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The foil shaver attachment is just ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t pinched my skin yet either like most trimmers to.</li>
            <li> Also, LOVE that it is waterproof so you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The battery life could be better.</li>
            <li> Tried so many they all seem to suck.</li>
            <li> Anything I can do to avoid razor-burn and irritation while being able to wear skirts and dresses all-year around I will try.</li>
            <li> I was able to use it about 5 times before it died on me.  </li>
            <li> It works ok, but you have to charge it often.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s basically a comfortable level that shouldn&#x27;t itch and be very easy to control.</li>
            <li> The blade is the perfect size for covering a good amount of area while getting into those &#x27;hard to reach&#x27; areas.</li>
            <li> I find they get a better, more precise shave.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not &#x60;error proof&#x27; and will nick if you are not careful, but if you are cautious while using, you get excellent results ~ a handy item to have around, especially with so many extras included: would recommend!</li>
            <li> but glad they&#x27;re available.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have found that using it wet in the shower with a soap or shaving creme produces the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shape isn&#x27;t easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Keeps everything tidy without too much pain or fuss!</li>
            <li> but once I got used to the sensation and how to best handle the appliance and be VERY careful with its use, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> They always work fine for a year or so then fall apart.</li>
            <li> The other is the Micro shaver, and that gives a flawless super smooth finish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The charger doesn&#x27;t fit snugly into the razor.</li>
            <li> The charge light came on, but it never worked again.  </li>
            <li> The light indicating that the trimmer is charging is not coming on, and still had no charge even after leaving it plugged in for 12 hours.</li>
            <li> By no means is it completely smooth.</li>
            <li> suspiscious it&#x27;d work well in the shower, but it really does, and it holds a charge nicely.</li>
            <li> It is designed to cut hair at three lengths so you can trim, cut fairly close, or completely shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is very effective, I only need to go over a section once and every hair is trimmed to</li>
            <li> If you and your partner like to maintain a clean area or enjoy this activity as part of your adult fun, it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li> have contacted the company and at the moment, they were very friendly and willing to work with me on resolving the problem.</li>
            <li> Waxing is not an option for my sensitive skin, best not to go into further detail.</li>
            <li> It will NOT give you a clean shave like a razor</li>
            <li> after you clean up (basically all gone)</li>
            <li> ...2) Doesn&#x27;t cut worth a darn, even stray or fine hairs, no matter which attachment you used.  </li>
            <li> It also does really work in the shower or bath, so if you have the luxury of taking more than a two minute shower, have at it.  </li>
            <li> pleased with this product, and would absolutely purchase.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this trimmer as I already had a trimmer I really like but can&#x27;t find the charger for it.  </li>
            <li> If your intention is to be totally smooth, you&#x27;ll have to use a fresh razor and lotion or pay for a full bikini wax.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery is excellent - it juices up quick, and each charge lasts at least an hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very careful about what I put around my pockeybook (LOL)</li>
            <li> And trims well, not close but quickly and without frustration.  </li>
            <li> It just dies quickly.</li>
            <li> because I like to shave in the shower, but sometimes, we need a quick \\&quot;polish\\&quot; and dont have time to jump in the shower.</li>
            <li> When my last electric razor broke, I thought I would it would be best to just buy a trimmer as that is the only function I use.</li>
            <li> Very functional and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The bonus pen trimmer actually worked better than the bikini trimmer itself!  </li>
            <li> Philips has this great little bikini trimmer now.</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH IT</li>
            <li> My wife is completely satisfied with the product and has replaced her old trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also a rare case where the travel bag is useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The attachements are also really nice for trimming up any unwanted hair on the face like upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I certainly won&#x27;t be using the Bikini Perfect long enough to find out if it falls apart or not.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a very close &amp; knick-free shave, you&#x27;re going to have to be very careful with this one - it might be best to have this one for more precise trimming (facial hair) and the the other type for the \\&quot;bigger jobs\\&quot; :)be best to have this one for more precise trimming (facial hair) and the the other type for the \\&quot;bigger jobs\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li> So let&#x27;s get this right out.</li>
            <li> price is just right.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a small battery operated razor that I find works great for things like shaping eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I myself have had laser hair removal, but being a redhead, cannot get rid of any blonde hair on my body, so this is perfect for my little touch-ups once in a while.</li>
            <li> This device is a trimmer first.  </li>
            <li> I was put off by it at first</li>
            <li> I can happily report that my skin has not retaliated in the least.</li>
            <li> The Schick trimmer is small, battery operated and safe for water; the Panasonic, also battery-operated, isn&#x27;t water safe, but it&#x27;s larger and works better.</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations for this.</li>
            <li> product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> , this is a useful gadget at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Philips!</li>
            <li> I really, really like this shaver!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two Remington personal shavers before, and neither one of them lasted more than a year...</li>
            <li> The first one lasted almost 3 years.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic was cheaper and actually worked better.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for in a bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li> first impression of this product is that it felt heavy-duty and substantial.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the gift that keeps on giving ;-)  </li>
            <li> I found by using the electric first it prevents any irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful for ladies who always like a maintained look down there but don&#x27;t want everyone to LOOK down there in order to receive it.</li>
            <li> I keep my bikini area totally hair-free, and the Philips Bikini Perfect is the third trimmer I&#x27;ve added to my arsenal (the other two being [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> ( I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet!), and I love the fact that it can be used inside the shower as well as dry.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it for the bikini area and it works very well, much better than some of the other brands that have bigger, wider, and bulkier clippers.</li>
            <li> , it holds a charge for several days with light use, it stores neatly in the included, zippered bag and includes an exfoliating scrub glove, something that really helps keep the ingrown hair issue at bay if you use it before</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve lived this much of my life without one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The straight trimmer, without the comb, works and got her almost fully shaved</li>
            <li> so you really have to plan ahead &amp; get it charged before you can use it.</li>
            <li> (so you can adjust how much you want to clip off), and a charging adapter.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;third&amp;#34; head is really just a plastic cover that fits one of the two real razor heads, to assist with areas with longer hair.  </li>
            <li> This razor saves me so much time.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer attachment works very well.</li>
            <li> It holds it&#x27;s charge very well</li>
            <li> use this as a trimmer to get my bikini line hairs short, and then I go in with a razor to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> i expected much more from this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it cleans you up very well &amp;</li>
            <li> It comes with a small pen trimmer which is very useful in fine tuning.   </li>
            <li> I have had the most success using the \\&quot;bikini trimmer\\&quot; on women&#x27;s electric razors in the past.</li>
            <li> : it works great &#x60;down there&#x27;, but definitely be careful when using...</li>
            <li> But for those of us who have turned to electric razors in the past for \\&quot;the preliminaries\\&quot;, it&#x27;s nice to have a dedicated device.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s very reliable!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend if you don&#x27;t want to go the route of waxes-- which I never will.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> It is worth noting that it does take quite a bit of time to get the job done, even after you get used to it, but likely under an hour for most users (even less if you have a friend to help!).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this little trimmer.</li>
            <li> But I can safely say it doesn&#x27;t give out after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> little trimmer, which fits comfortably in one&#x27;s hand, worked very well and three days after shaving</li>
            <li> We are always looking for new options in this &#x27;genre.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> We have a couple of touch up shavers and that new mini one from Braun.</li>
            <li> And it just so happened that I was in the market for a new shaver when this popped up in my Vine newsletter.</li>
            <li> The two real heads allow for a &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;close shave,&amp;#34; but they are really just two different levels of trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the instructions warn that the razor will require 10 hours of charging time for 60 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> Really upset I paid this much for only four uses!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver&#x27;s clippers are a good width, small enough to easily use in that area, yet wide enough to get the job done well.</li>
            <li> This is a handy trimmer to have, with various attachments for length, and even comes with a little pen trimmer!  </li>
            <li> Most likely it works, and would be recommended if you have a lot of hair there and want to bring down the length.  </li>
            <li> I will likely never (ever) use a manual razor again, not when i can get a better, smoother and less stressful shave with this.</li>
            <li> The head to shave bare works ok, but only if the hair is very short to begin with and the regular trimming head does not have any mechanism to prevent nicking.</li>
            <li> I actually have to tape it in a certain way to get it to connect and charge.</li>
            <li> Power feels very weak compared to my Panasonic ES246AC Bikini Shaper and Trimmer, which also has a wider head, and with which I&#x27;ve had superior results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes with several attachments (comb, straight cut, mini touch-up shaver, exfoliating glove, etc.).  </li>
            <li> I tried epilating earlier this year, but again, had to apply too much pressure for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t thrown out my old battery-powered one.</li>
            <li> Whether you want just a trim or complete removal.</li>
            <li> I like to buy directly from amazon, the distribution is faster</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave and didn&#x27;t hurt (only snagged on a hair once) to use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Panasonic rechargeable that was getting old.  </li>
            <li> This one can pull hair or cut you in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> But it will easy get your trimmed down to a very short level for everyday, or for prepping the area to be fully smooth with a blade or wet/dry shaver</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot pink and easily takes out stray eyebrows and other facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use in or out of the shower with very few instances of ripping a hair out from the root.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> I purchased this girls&#x27; personal shaver several weeks ago and purposely waited before writing a review, so that I could first see how I like it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have no complaints at all and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this for personal trimming/grooming.  </li>
            <li> This thing helps so much because, if it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve gone to the beach, I don&#x27;t need to fight 1/2 inch long bikini hair with a razor.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of buying a new personal shaver, check out this one....</li>
            <li> I think the battery powered ones are less powerful.</li>
            <li> Shaves it right off down to the skin so there is no stubble.</li>
            <li> this is my second time purchasing as the first one I purchased several years ago finally died on me.</li>
            <li> There are some negative reviews on here from people who were looking for a shaver and a smooth finish, which this is not.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and simply cannot tolerate salon or home bikini waxing, so I shave.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that Philips offers a 45-day money back guarantee ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the battery holds the charge for the full 60 minutes</li>
            <li> Still looking for the right little shaver.</li>
            <li> it was so loud that if anyone else was in your house they&#x27;d think you were using a different device entirely</li>
            <li> This trimmer barely touches the hair, let alone actually trim it.</li>
            <li> Included, too, is a small eyebrow shaper (it&#x27;s about the size of a pencil and includes a small blade-guard) and an exfoliating glove: nice bonuses to throw in, and they complement the actual shaving unit itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the first one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after a while, and on the second one, the little part that you plug the cord into in order to recharge it, broke...</li>
            <li> Other than that, you really do need to keep using your tweezers and facial creams on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve returned or thrown away other bikini razors rated highly on Amazon.</li>
            <li> you just have to use a real razor a little bit.</li>
            <li> : waterproof, small, comes with interchangeable heads and a bonus eyebrow trimmer (which is also useful on very delicate skin and is better than the last one I had), is sharp and delivers a close shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Based on the other reviews here and on their site, it doesn&#x27;t look like they have fixed the battery problem on any of their similar products.</li>
            <li> After a year, it requires a full charge (overnight/a few hours) before every  use, and even then it only lasts a few minutes at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They usually work very well, regardless of the brand.</li>
            <li> It is small but hefty and does the job very well.</li>
            <li> My wife never lets the grass grow long enough where she would need the adjustable comb attachment.  </li>
            <li> The battery life in this product is long lasting</li>
            <li> The battery holds up long enough for me.</li>
            <li> the exact same length.&lt;br /&gt;the head is small enough that you can go around corners without fear of slicing other things off with your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thus</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had similar products and find they have limited use.  </li>
            <li> but it really doesnt cut at all.. as another reviewer said  &amp;#34;trimmer barely touches the hair, let alone actually trim it&amp;#34; waste of money its just been in the back of my bathroom vanity.. too late to return in now.</li>
            <li> The attachments included were a precision comb (very odd, you would have to be shaving some sort of field for that to be useful) and a micro shaver, which looks similar to the trimmer I already have, but doesn&#x27;t work the same way, at least not for me....</li>
            <li> The blade itself is also thicker, like one for cutting the hair on your head, not small &amp; precise like I would have expected.  </li>
            <li> take long to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so when I read the first two ambivalent reviews I was afraid but after a disaster with some bikini cream that tore my behind UPPPPPPPPP, I knew there had to be a better way than bikini waxing.</li>
            <li> I really only use one head, the guard and other attachments</li>
            <li> Liked the idea that it was designed for &amp;#34;the hair down there&amp;#34; as clippers for the hair on your head are often too harsh and result in uncomfortable cuts.  </li>
            <li> I also regularly trim the rest of the hair down there to keep things</li>
            <li> It is rechargable and can be used wet or dry, which is a plus</li>
            <li> It is rechargeable and can be used wet and dry.</li>
            <li> I did see some cheaper shavers, but chose this one because it&#x27;s rechargeable and can be used dry or wet...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these in the past that went straight into the trash after one use, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months</li>
            <li> The micro-shaver has left a rash/razor burn each time yet has little effect on hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, but I will say that the little pen trimmer that&#x27;s included is a total bust: just throw it away.</li>
            <li> Must be for trimming thin arm hair?&lt;br /&gt;You do need to take the head apart every once in a while to clean excessive hairs out.</li>
            <li> I got a Panasonic bikini trimmer over a decade, and despite trying a few different trimmers, nothing else could stand up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It no longer works and I&#x27;ve only had for a few months.  </li>
            <li> I tried the \\&quot;micro shaver\\&quot; foil and it left far worse razor burn than I ever got using a razor.</li>
            <li> far I have not cut or nicked myself by accident, and I consider myself a clumsy person when it comes to sharp objects.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> If you are tired of the pain associated with shaving and waxing (e.g., the occasional horror show (ladies, and some men, you know what I mean!), along with more common bumps, redness, itching, etc...)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used razors most of my life and because more pressure must be applied with a manual shaver, I&#x27;m always borderline fearful of cutting myself.</li>
            <li> it did not give the same close shave, maybe because it is too small?  </li>
            <li> In the day and age where airlines frown upon weight, we need such small performers.   </li>
            <li> If you are getting this for extremely close shaves, I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I use this product the other days if I am wearing a dress or a skirt, which is year-around.</li>
            <li> If you are expecting razor-like results you will be disappointed, but for my use I am satisfied with the product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I find it be kind of painful to use in delicate areas.</li>
            <li> There are lots of extras included, such as an exfoliation glove for in the shower, a Precision comb attachment if you just want to trim down, but not remove all the hair, a travel bag, which I use as a storage case, and a pen trimmer, which can be used to touch up the bikini line or even for small areas like the face.</li>
            <li> I have tried several electric razors/trimmers; I have coarse, thick leg hair and sensitive skin, which makes shaving difficult.</li>
            <li> I only replaced because the blade seemed a bit dull.</li>
            <li> AND THE TROUBLE (*initial trouble)!</li>
            <li> Every time I have used it I end up bleeding in at least one place, usually several.  </li>
            <li> (remember it&#x27;s a trimmer) down to almost stubble.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use this product as it requires a step down transformer or adapter which will entail another cost.</li>
            <li> It does not get everything down to the skin</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;nick free\\&quot; guard that my other trimmer has - you know, the type that you can run over ANY hair without worrying about it cutting you.</li>
            <li> And the bonus pen trimmer was difficult to use and also left red bumps.</li>
            <li> Maybe my expectations were too high, but I found this to be a totally useless investment of $40.</li>
            <li> Forgive me for not posting a video here to prove that this little trimmer/razor works, but trust me, it does and painlessly</li>
            <li> The little thing lasted about a year.</li>
            <li> It is a little hair to get every hair out.tle hair to get every hair out.</li>
            <li> But she did report that the blade scratched and nicked her a few times.</li>
            <li> After unpacking our stuff, I tried to use it and battery was dead, so I charged it.  </li>
            <li> I took care of it and always completely dried it off after each use.</li>
            <li> Not too expensive, but not cheap enough where I wonder if I&#x27;m getting some horrid thing that will die in one use.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I really have nothing bad to say about this electric razor.  </li>
            <li> The mini foil shaver to shave small parts you missed didn&#x27;t work that well, but may improve over time.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The razor has already broken down once.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to change out the attachments and get the guard placed correctly.</li>
            <li> The trimmer (the attachment I intended to use most) leaves behind horrible nicks.</li>
            <li> This guy is a biter, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive, although you&#x27;ll sacrifice on rechargable and wet/dry.</li>
            <li> I got frustrated and ended up just using a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I have tried other razors similar to this and had a horrible time with ingrown hairs, but for whatever reason, that hasn&#x27;t been a problem with this item.  </li>
            <li> The cutting was also uneven.</li>
            <li> Comes with a lot of seemingly unnecessary attachments and accessories that I ended up throwing out.</li>
            <li> This however was useless.  </li>
            <li> is useless.</li>
            <li> - I hate using batteries  for small electronics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> This was a terrible waste of money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Idk if i just got a bad one</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you are like me, you absolutely HATE shaving your bikini line.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a wonder razor that will produce the smoothness of mechanical razor or a wax.  But for those of us who have turned to electric razors in the past for \\&quot;the preliminaries\\&quot;, it&#x27;s nice to have a dedicated device.  It also does really work in the shower or bath, so if you have the luxury of taking more than a two minute shower, have at it.  And trims well, not close but quickly and without frustration.  I&#x27;m not sure if the battery holds the charge for the full 60 minutes, I haven&#x27;t yet been that inspired...  But I can safely say it doesn&#x27;t give out after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part was the pen trimmer; I&#x27;ve never used one, and love this model.  It&#x27;s hot pink and easily takes out stray eyebrows and other facial hair.  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve lived this much of my life without one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not looking for after wax results from a shaver, Bikini Perfect is a great model.</li>
            <li> So let&#x27;s get this right out. This device is a trimmer first.  If your intention is to be totally smooth, you&#x27;ll have to use a fresh razor and lotion or pay for a full bikini wax. My wife has a variety of different models that she has accumulated over the years. We are always looking for new options in this &#x27;genre.&#x27;  What&#x27;s good about this model? It&#x27;s construction is solid.  It&#x27;s rechargable.  It comes with several attachments (comb, straight cut, mini touch-up shaver, exfoliating glove, etc.).  What&#x27;s really nice is it says you can use it in the shower, which we tried and does work.  In practice we weren&#x27;t that impressed. We have a couple of touch up shavers and that new mini one from Braun. So a bonus one is a nice touch, but not needed for us.  The exfoliating glove wasn&#x27;t so good. An exfoliating lotion, even one made for a guy&#x27;s beard is so much better. That is if you feel the need to exfoliate here.   My wife never lets the grass grow long enough where she would need the adjustable comb attachment.  Most likely it works, and would be recommended if you have a lot of hair there and want to bring down the length.  I know I use a comb attachment on my corderless beard trimmer and shaper to keep my goatee in check. They usually work very well, regardless of the brand. The mini foil shaver to shave small parts you missed didn&#x27;t work that well, but may improve over time.  The straight trimmer, without the comb, works and got her almost fully shaved (remember it&#x27;s a trimmer) down to almost stubble.  That&#x27;s basically a comfortable level that shouldn&#x27;t itch and be very easy to control. But she did report that the blade scratched and nicked her a few times. That&#x27;s why this is a 3 star, and we&#x27;re being generous.  The verdict: It&#x27;s an ok trimmer and designer.  If you and your partner like to maintain a clean area or enjoy this activity as part of your adult fun, it&#x27;s a good choice. However, we still like the Panasonic battery operated trimmer for women. It comes with a combfor those who want hair, just not a jungle.  The blade with no attachment doesn&#x27;t nick you.  It&#x27;s less expensive, although you&#x27;ll sacrifice on rechargable and wet/dry. But it will easy get your trimmed down to a very short level for everyday, or for prepping the area to be fully smooth with a blade or wet/dry shaver</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and simply cannot tolerate salon or home bikini waxing, so I shave. And it just so happened that I was in the market for a new shaver when this popped up in my Vine newsletter. I wish that it was a servicable replacement for my Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: waterproof, small, comes with interchangeable heads and a bonus eyebrow trimmer (which is also useful on very delicate skin and is better than the last one I had), is sharp and delivers a close shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: no guide for the razor head, which is crucial and which led to some nicks and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I wouldn&#x27;t put this at the top of my list for bikini shavers. I&#x27;m still in the market.</li>
            <li> The Phillips HP6376/10 Bikini Perfect battery operated shaver is perfect for eyebrows, your bikini line, and even those determined chin hairs women don&#x27;t like to talk about.  The battery life in this product is long lasting and I can&#x27;t see myself shaving with anything else.  The price of this product makes it affordable and I plan to buy and gift these to the women in my family.    Thumbs up!  Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very careful about what I put around my pockeybook (LOL) so when I read the first two ambivalent reviews I was afraid but after a disaster with some bikini cream that tore my behind UPPPPPPPPP, I knew there had to be a better way than bikini waxing. I was put off by it at first but once I got used to the sensation and how to best handle the appliance and be VERY careful with its use, I couldn&#x27;t be happier! It is also so good at removal you won&#x27;t have to use it too often and the price is great. It&#x27;s wonderful for ladies who always like a maintained look down there but don&#x27;t want everyone to LOOK down there in order to receive it. WELL WORTH IT AND THE TROUBLE (*initial trouble)!</li>
            <li> Maybe my expectations were too high, but I found this to be a totally useless investment of $40. All I can say is that Philips offers a 45-day money back guarantee ... and I&#x27;m using it! This trimmer barely touches the hair, let alone actually trim it. If you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer that leaves a smooth shave - look beyond this one!</li>
            <li> Forgive me for not posting a video here to prove that this little trimmer/razor works, but trust me, it does and painlessly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used razors most of my life and because more pressure must be applied with a manual shaver, I&#x27;m always borderline fearful of cutting myself. Waxing is not an option for my sensitive skin, best not to go into further detail. I tried epilating earlier this year, but again, had to apply too much pressure for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little trimmer, which fits comfortably in one&#x27;s hand, worked very well and three days after shaving I can happily report that my skin has not retaliated in the least. There are lots of attachments for trim length and options for battery or electrical power. I will likely never (ever) use a manual razor again, not when i can get a better, smoother and less stressful shave with this. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I keep my bikini area totally hair-free, and the Philips Bikini Perfect is the third trimmer I&#x27;ve added to my arsenal (the other two being [[ASIN:B00005JS5C Panasonic ES246AC Bikini Shaper and Trimmer]] and the [[ASIN:B001TH8Q72 Schick Quattro For Women Trimstyle Razor &amp; Bikini Trimmer]]). The Schick trimmer is small, battery operated and safe for water; the Panasonic, also battery-operated, isn&#x27;t water safe, but it&#x27;s larger and works better. However, it&#x27;s a one-trick pony. That&#x27;s why I love the Philips Bikini Perfect, which works on rechargeable battery, comes with three different attachments and some extras (a personal \\&quot;pen\\&quot; trimmer, some brushes, an exfoliation glove and a carrying case that fits everything).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to keep things short or totally hairless, this is the trimmer for you. Simply excellent.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I couldn&#x27;t get this thing to cut close enough to my skin even with no guard on it. The cutting was also uneven. I got frustrated and ended up just using a regular razor. Can&#x27;t say that I recommend.</li>
            <li> Comes with a lot of seemingly unnecessary attachments and accessories that I ended up throwing out. The charging cord seems mismatched, like it doesn&#x27;t belong with the shaver. It seems like it&#x27;s a poor fit. There&#x27;s no light to indicate charging or how much battery is left. Most of the time when I go to use it, it lasts 3 seconds then has to be on the charger... so you really have to plan ahead &amp; get it charged before you can use it. It just dies quickly. I wish I hadn&#x27;t thrown out my old battery-powered one. I had higher expectations for this.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for a more durable replacement for the inexpensive \\&quot;beard and neck hair trimmers\\&quot; I&#x27;ve used for years to trim my bikini area. They always work fine for a year or so then fall apart. I certainly won&#x27;t be using the Bikini Perfect long enough to find out if it falls apart or not. The trimmer (the attachment I intended to use most) leaves behind horrible nicks. Every time I have used it I end up bleeding in at least one place, usually several.  I tried the \\&quot;micro shaver\\&quot; foil and it left far worse razor burn than I ever got using a razor. And the bonus pen trimmer was difficult to use and also left red bumps. This was a terrible waste of money!</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you are like me, you absolutely HATE shaving your bikini line. But now there is some help. Philips has this great little bikini trimmer now. It is rechargable and can be used wet or dry, which is a plus because I like to shave in the shower, but sometimes, we need a quick \\&quot;polish\\&quot; and dont have time to jump in the shower. This grooming system is great for anybody. Whether you want just a trim or complete removal. It comes with 2 different styles of trimmer head. One is the Precision trimmer, which is  great for touch ups.  The other is the Micro shaver, and that gives a flawless super smooth finish. There are lots of extras included, such as an exfoliation glove for in the shower, a Precision comb attachment if you just want to trim down, but not remove all the hair, a travel bag, which I use as a storage case, and a pen trimmer, which can be used to touch up the bikini line or even for small areas like the face. The Bikini perfect can stay charged for up to 60 minutes and does not need to be oiled, so there is no maintenance involved. I myself have had laser hair removal, but being a redhead, cannot get rid of any blonde hair on my body, so this is perfect for my little touch-ups once in a while. What a great product! Ladeis, you will love  the ease of this and best of all? NO RAZOR BUMPS OR BURN!!!</li>
            <li> This product is a total piece of garbage. I literally used it ONCE. I go to use it again and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, so I connected it to the charger. The charger lit up but after an entire day of \\&quot;charging\\&quot; the trimmer would not turn on. GARBAGE. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The Philips Bikini Perfect trimmer is seriously amazing. I&#x27;ve never before used an electric razor, specifically because I didn&#x27;t think it could be as good as manually shaving. However, I&#x27;m now a total convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with the trimmer, a microshaver, a length guard (so you can adjust how much you want to clip off), and a charging adapter. Included, too, is a small eyebrow shaper (it&#x27;s about the size of a pencil and includes a small blade-guard) and an exfoliating glove: nice bonuses to throw in, and they complement the actual shaving unit itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The rechargeable battery is excellent - it juices up quick, and each charge lasts at least an hour. Additionally, the wet-dry option is a great convenience: use it in the tub or out! (What convenience!). Without the blade-guard, the trimmer will clip hair very short, and the microshaver will essentially remove all hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this product, and would absolutely purchase.</li>
            <li> I really have nothing bad to say about this electric razor.  It charges super fast, holds a charge well, and is the perfect size for bikini area.  It is designed to cut hair at three lengths so you can trim, cut fairly close, or completely shave.  I have tried other razors similar to this and had a horrible time with ingrown hairs, but for whatever reason, that hasn&#x27;t been a problem with this item.  It also comes with a small battery operated razor that I find works great for things like shaping eyebrows.  Overall, I have no complaints at all and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a handy trimmer to have, with various attachments for length, and even comes with a little pen trimmer!  I really like this trimmer: it works great &#x60;down there&#x27;, but definitely be careful when using...it&#x27;s not &#x60;error proof&#x27; and will nick if you are not careful, but if you are cautious while using, you get excellent results ~ a handy item to have around, especially with so many extras included: would recommend!</li>
            <li> i like this product and i recommend this since it is very handy to use it...so you can trust this product</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00440F3GS Philips Hp6378/10 Bikini Perfect Deluxe Trimmer, Opal / Aqua]]The product was what I was looking good. I like to buy directly from amazon, the distribution is faster</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this trimmer as I already had a trimmer I really like but can&#x27;t find the charger for it.  The Philips Bikini Perfect is much smaller than most trimmers but fits neatly in my hand.  It has several different attachments (similar to the Wahl Hair trimmer kits) so you can not only trim the bikini area, but men can use it to trim beards, moustaches, chest hair, etc.  It also comes with a handy eyebrow trimmer that works great.  It was already charged so I was able to try it out immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;nick free\\&quot; guard that my other trimmer has - you know, the type that you can run over ANY hair without worrying about it cutting you. This concerned me a great deal, considering the areas this trimmer is meant to trim.  The blade itself is also thicker, like one for cutting the hair on your head, not small &amp; precise like I would have expected.  The attachments included were a precision comb (very odd, you would have to be shaving some sort of field for that to be useful) and a micro shaver, which looks similar to the trimmer I already have, but doesn&#x27;t work the same way, at least not for me....it did not give the same close shave, maybe because it is too small?  But all in all, it did trim what needed to be trimmed and works both in and out of the shower, something that is an extra bonus when you don&#x27;t want to be sweeping up hair off of your bathroom floor for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the weight of it and the way it felt in my hand, it holds a charge for several days with light use, it stores neatly in the included, zippered bag and includes an exfoliating scrub glove, something that really helps keep the ingrown hair issue at bay if you use it before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a more compact trimmer, maybe to keep in your travel bag or as a spare, this is a good option to consider.  If you&#x27;re looking for a very close &amp; knick-free shave, you&#x27;re going to have to be very careful with this one - it might be best to have this one for more precise trimming (facial hair) and the the other type for the \\&quot;bigger jobs\\&quot; :)be best to have this one for more precise trimming (facial hair) and the the other type for the \\&quot;bigger jobs\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li> This works great as a trimmer for bikini area, but it is very noisy. It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Until now only used the trimer section and it works well. It does not snag hairs and it trims nice and evenly. The shaving tool is not for me. The battery holds up long enough for me.</li>
            <li> It was never mentioned in the product specs/description that the item will need only 120v to charge (we use 220v - 240v) I cannot use this product as it requires a step down transformer or adapter which will entail another cost.</li>
            <li> This product works well, but note that it&#x27;s a TRIMMER.  It will NOT give you a clean shave like a razor will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is exactly what I was looking for.  If you are tired of the pain associated with shaving and waxing (e.g., the occasional horror show (ladies, and some men, you know what I mean!), along with more common bumps, redness, itching, etc...), this product keeps you neat and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facts: The razor comes with two heads, not three, as the product descriptions say.  The &amp;#34;third&amp;#34; head is really just a plastic cover that fits one of the two real razor heads, to assist with areas with longer hair.  The two real heads allow for a &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;close shave,&amp;#34; but they are really just two different levels of trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the instructions warn that the razor will require 10 hours of charging time for 60 minutes of use.  So prepare for that, especially when you&#x27;re learning to use the razor at the beginning.  It is worth noting that it does take quite a bit of time to get the job done, even after you get used to it, but likely under an hour for most users (even less if you have a friend to help!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also comes with a &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; hair remover, which is for your FACE ONLY.  I&#x27;ve had similar products and find they have limited use.  They work best with eyebrows, especially to stave off the unibrow if you don&#x27;t feel like plucking all the time (I have to pluck daily to keep my unibrow at bay).  You can also use it to get rid of any stray facial hairs that might grow in.  Other than that, you really do need to keep using your tweezers and facial creams on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this is a useful gadget at a reasonable price.  Just note that it will keep you trimmed, not shaved.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Does not &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34;. Easy to clean.  Happy my Remington broke. I use it in a the shower with out any problems.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> This coming from my wife. Very nice portable compact trimmer with excellent accessories. It is small but hefty and does the job very well. It comes with a small pen trimmer which is very useful in fine tuning.   It is rechargeable and can be used wet and dry. It comes with three precision attachments for adjusting as needed for the bikini area. It comes with a travel bag as well as exfoliation gloves.   The compactness helps when slinging it onto outdoors. In the day and age where airlines frown upon weight, we need such small performers.   The packaging is cute and meant to please the ladies! My wife is completely satisfied with the product and has replaced her old trimmer.</li>
            <li> The shape isn&#x27;t easy to hold. It&#x27;s hard to change out the attachments and get the guard placed correctly. The micro-shaver has left a rash/razor burn each time yet has little effect on hair. Power feels very weak compared to my Panasonic ES246AC Bikini Shaper and Trimmer, which also has a wider head, and with which I&#x27;ve had superior results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JS5C/ref&#x3D;oh_o05_s00_i01_details</li>
            <li> I got a Panasonic bikini trimmer over a decade, and despite trying a few different trimmers, nothing else could stand up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNTIL NOW. This thing is awesome, from the contoured shape of the head (perfect for getting around folds and creases) to the fact that it&#x27;s freaking RECHARGEABLE, so I can finally stop tossing batteries out. The trimmer feels perfect in my hand -- just the right shape, and grippy-ness. I don&#x27;t use the comb or the microshaver, so I can&#x27;t vouch for those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, but I will say that the little pen trimmer that&#x27;s included is a total bust: just throw it away. I tried using it on my husbands ears and it was a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a rare case where the travel bag is useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after 10 years, this one convinced me to get rid of my dingy old pink Panasonic. Thanks, Philips!</li>
            <li> I like this shaver a lot.  It gives a very close shave and didn&#x27;t hurt (only snagged on a hair once) to use.  I would highly recommend if you don&#x27;t want to go the route of waxes-- which I never will.</li>
            <li> The battery started to deplete severely after ~6 months of use. After a year, it requires a full charge (overnight/a few hours) before every  use, and even then it only lasts a few minutes at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Philips and they said the best they could do was a discount in their online store. Based on the other reviews here and on their site, it doesn&#x27;t look like they have fixed the battery problem on any of their similar products.</li>
            <li> If you are getting this for extremely close shaves, I would look elsewhere. This guy is a biter, if you know what I mean. The head to shave bare works ok, but only if the hair is very short to begin with and the regular trimming head does not have any mechanism to prevent nicking. I find it be kind of painful to use in delicate areas.</li>
            <li> Very functional and easy to use. Better than waxing - saves time and money. Came with a bunch of bonus items in the kit, including a bag and mini trimmer for facial hair.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is great! this is my second time purchasing as the first one I purchased several years ago finally died on me. lots of attachment options, which I love.</li>
            <li> This razor saves me so much time.  I don&#x27;t have to tweeze hair on my upper lip, waxing breaks me out. The razor saves me 20 minutes of time.  Love it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer attachment works very well. The foil shaver attachment is just ok. The charger doesn&#x27;t fit snugly into the razor. I actually have to tape it in a certain way to get it to connect and charge.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this for personal trimming/grooming.  Liked the idea that it was designed for &amp;#34;the hair down there&amp;#34; as clippers for the hair on your head are often too harsh and result in uncomfortable cuts.  This however was useless.  1) it was so loud that if anyone else was in your house they&#x27;d think you were using a different device entirely...2) Doesn&#x27;t cut worth a darn, even stray or fine hairs, no matter which attachment you used.  The bonus pen trimmer actually worked better than the bikini trimmer itself!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I purchased this girls&#x27; personal shaver several weeks ago and purposely waited before writing a review, so that I could first see how I like it. Well, after several weeks of owning it and using it several times, I must say that I do not regret this purchase. I really, really like this shaver! It holds it&#x27;s charge very well ( I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet!), and I love the fact that it can be used inside the shower as well as dry. I mostly use it for the bikini area and it works very well, much better than some of the other brands that have bigger, wider, and bulkier clippers. This shaver&#x27;s clippers are a good width, small enough to easily use in that area, yet wide enough to get the job done well. I&#x27;ve owned two Remington personal shavers before, and neither one of them lasted more than a year...the first one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after a while, and on the second one, the little part that you plug the cord into in order to recharge it, broke...so I couldn&#x27;t recharge it anymore, plus it also wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. So this time I decided to go with a different brand and after a lot of on-line comparing and reading of people&#x27;s reviews, I opted to get this one. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it. So far it&#x27;s very reliable! I did see some cheaper shavers, but chose this one because it&#x27;s rechargeable and can be used dry or wet...two things that were very important to me. If you&#x27;re thinking of buying a new personal shaver, check out this one....it&#x27;s a good choice!</li>
            <li> I was still getting used to the shape and style of this razor.  Bought in March and used four times before I moved in May.  After unpacking our stuff, I tried to use it and battery was dead, so I charged it.  The charge light came on, but it never worked again.  Really upset I paid this much for only four uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted the company and at the moment, they were very friendly and willing to work with me on resolving the problem.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this electic razor. The first one lasted almost 3 years. I only replaced because the blade seemed a bit dull. I really only use one head, the guard and other attachments aren&#x27;t my thing but glad they&#x27;re available.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Panasonic rechargeable that was getting old.  The Panasonic was cheaper and actually worked better.  This one manages to pull hair and just doesn&#x27;t work well - you can go over an area several times and it looks like you didn&#x27;t shave.</li>
            <li> I love this little trimmer. The blade is the perfect size for covering a good amount of area while getting into those &#x27;hard to reach&#x27; areas. It hasn&#x27;t pinched my skin yet either like most trimmers to. Also, LOVE that it is waterproof so you can use it in the shower. Also great that it charges and isn&#x27;t battery powered. I think the battery powered ones are less powerful. The attachements are also really nice for trimming up any unwanted hair on the face like upper lip and chin. Shaves it right off down to the skin so there is no stubble. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for in a bikini trimmer. And that&#x27;s what it is, a TRIMMER. There are some negative reviews on here from people who were looking for a shaver and a smooth finish, which this is not. It does come with a shave attachment, but if you are looking for a shaved finish, this is not the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a trimmer to get my bikini line hairs short, and then I go in with a razor to get a smooth shave. This thing helps so much because, if it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve gone to the beach, I don&#x27;t need to fight 1/2 inch long bikini hair with a razor. I also regularly trim the rest of the hair down there to keep things tidy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: August 2015: - Welp, it died. The little thing lasted about a year. I took care of it and always completely dried it off after each use. This week it stopped charging. The light indicating that the trimmer is charging is not coming on, and still had no charge even after leaving it plugged in for 12 hours. It was a great trimmer... while it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is very effective, I only need to go over a section once and every hair is trimmed to the exact same length.&lt;br /&gt;the head is small enough that you can go around corners without fear of slicing other things off with your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thus far I have not cut or nicked myself by accident, and I consider myself a clumsy person when it comes to sharp objects.&lt;br /&gt;The price is just right. Not too expensive, but not cheap enough where I wonder if I&#x27;m getting some horrid thing that will die in one use.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t take long to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The battery life could be better. I leave this in my shower and I can get about 5-8 trims before it needs to be charged.&lt;br /&gt;The mini pen trimmer that comes with this is useless. Not enough power to trim even one bikini hair. Must be for trimming thin arm hair?&lt;br /&gt;You do need to take the head apart every once in a while to clean excessive hairs out. It is a little hair to get every hair out.tle hair to get every hair out.</li>
            <li> Still looking for the right little shaver. Tried so many they all seem to suck. This one can pull hair or cut you in sensitive areas. Battery doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> Works great per my wife</li>
            <li> I have tried several electric razors/trimmers; I have coarse, thick leg hair and sensitive skin, which makes shaving difficult. Anything I can do to avoid razor-burn and irritation while being able to wear skirts and dresses all-year around I will try. I have had the most success using the \\&quot;bikini trimmer\\&quot; on women&#x27;s electric razors in the past. I find they get a better, more precise shave. When my last electric razor broke, I thought I would it would be best to just buy a trimmer as that is the only function I use. I use the same motion, as I would with a standard razor. This one was tops on my list because it was rechargeable - I hate using batteries  for small electronics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of this product is that it felt heavy-duty and substantial. I can only razor shave my legs every 10-14 days without irritation or razor burn. I use this product the other days if I am wearing a dress or a skirt, which is year-around. With this product, I can keep my leg hair manageable. By no means is it completely smooth. But when I razor-shave after using the trimmer, my legs feel amazing. They are smoother and easier to shave with no irritation. I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that using it wet in the shower with a soap or shaving creme produces the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This electric razor works marginally well compared to a standard razor and performs comparable to a standard electric razor/trimmer with the added benefit of it being rechargeable. If you are expecting razor-like results you will be disappointed, but for my use I am satisfied with the product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Easy to use in or out of the shower with very few instances of ripping a hair out from the root.&lt;br /&gt;Was suspiscious it&#x27;d work well in the shower, but it really does, and it holds a charge nicely. Its great for swimsuit weather. I&#x27;ve had a few of these in the past that went straight into the trash after one use, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months and I&#x27;m still very pleased. Dual heads are great and easy to change. Keeps everything tidy without too much pain or fuss!</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas present so I haven&#x27;t used it yet. After Christmas I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Rick</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for her birthday because she asked for it.  Let me tell you, it&#x27;s the gift that keeps on giving ;-)  If it breaks, I&#x27;ll be buying her another one for sure!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve returned or thrown away other bikini razors rated highly on Amazon. They sucked. This one is by far the best. The listing doesn&#x27;t even tell you everything you get. You get a number of accessories and add-ons, a bag, a brush, an exfoliator glove, and multiple shaver heads. This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My coworker raved about this so i decided to give it a try... ehhhh i expected much more from this.&lt;br /&gt;Idk if i just got a bad one but it really doesnt cut at all.. as another reviewer said  &amp;#34;trimmer barely touches the hair, let alone actually trim it&amp;#34; waste of money its just been in the back of my bathroom vanity.. too late to return in now. DONT SPEND your MONEY on this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor. It does not get everything down to the skin but it cleans you up very well &amp; after you clean up (basically all gone) you just have to use a real razor a little bit. I found by using the electric first it prevents any irritation.</li>
            <li> The razor has already broken down once. The razor did not meet my expectations. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Received this item at the end of April.  It no longer works and I&#x27;ve only had for a few months.  I was able to use it about 5 times before it died on me.  It is fully charged, but will not turn on.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after using it just two times!</li>
            <li> It works ok, but you have to charge it often.  Also, the charger is supposed to indicate when it is done charging (flashing vs. not flashing) but mine never did.  It&#x27;s just always not flashing.</li>
