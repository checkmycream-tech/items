            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>good luck.</li>
            <li>Good deal buying here.</li>
            <li>If this product is so good alone</li>
            <li>This works as a good alternative.</li>
            <li>I found out that this is one good acne product to combine with Acne.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more!</li>
            <li>since I LOVE this mask!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff !</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This product works AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether or not they changed the formula of this product, but it&#x27;s just not as effective as I remember it being.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a good reason why this product sells, has celebrity endorsements, is costly, and is offered in so many Kiosks and infomercials.</li>
            <li>The refining mask is a nice addition to my acne fighting routine.  </li>
            <li>Liked my service with seller</li>
            <li>nice product helps my skin.</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s not as effective now (as a spot corrector) as it was in the beginning.</li>
            <li>I mainly use this product for spot-treatment, and it does an excellent job of shrinking if not eliminating acne overnight.</li>
            <li>I received 2 and came very quick which was exciting because this is the best stuff around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for my skin - makes it feel clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products for the face.  </li>
            <li>I love Proactivs Refining Mask.</li>
            <li>Also a refreshing mask.  </li>
            <li>I really love it</li>
            <li>I all so love the toner</li>
            <li>I love sulfur based products.</li>
            <li>I purchase this product quit often on AMAZON, the price is great, and the product really works.  </li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning the problem area is significantly better sometimes gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a villain and love to stray off course with products.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;ve ripped me and MANY MANY others off.</li>
            <li>but it works like magic</li>
            <li>was much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Queen Helene mask but have not been as satisfied as I have with this product.</li>
            <li>So glad i started using</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a better acne vanish-er or prevent-</li>
            <li>I love the price, love the product.</li>
            <li>Well this stuff seems to suck all the junk out leaving my skin all smooth and purdy!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite Proactiv products.</li>
            <li>My favorite acne remedy.</li>
            <li>works better to me.  </li>
            <li>the price was okay for the product</li>
            <li>I love this mask.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the magic ingredient is, but it works like a charm for me.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe it&#x27;s just my skin since it seems to work for many others but</li>
            <li>But I admit the set is better</li>
            <li>love proactive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and gives me a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>ideally you can put it as a mask and leave it on for a long time.</li>
            <li>and I can see my pores looking a whole lot better!</li>
            <li>huge bummer</li>
            <li>was free shipping is a plus.</li>
            <li>I need to use something that is both effective but gentle.</li>
            <li>This is great to put on indivdual acne spots just as they start or to use as an all over facial treatment.  </li>
            <li>I had heard from several people that Proactiv was great</li>
            <li>It was also really cheap compared to Proactivs&#x27; catalog which sold me from the start.</li>
            <li>I try to eat healthy and use good facial products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s right around the corner, but I still do get a blemish or two once in a while.</li>
            <li>Still, it does make a huge difference on spots, just not a crazy amount!</li>
            <li>Its larger than pictured great price and the real deal!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the complete proactiv kit, but this little mask works great :P</li>
            <li>It was just what I expected and works great.</li>
            <li>I was beginning to start breaking out), and it caused me to have a full blown allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and this product dries my skin out big time over the areas that I have applied it, but that is a good thing for zits.</li>
            <li>Works great, love it, will dry out your skin if you use too often, but clears up spots, highly recommend</li>
            <li>it retracts my pores, smooths my skin and drys up acne QUICK.</li>
            <li>Received the product quickly.  </li>
            <li>It always clears my face but it seems to lighten it a bit which may be good if you want to clear some darker blemishes but really itches.</li>
            <li>This product was shipped quickly and was what it was suppose to be -</li>
            <li>I use until I find something better Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>I and my son actually use this and love it!</li>
            <li>They are amazing and will definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li>This mask is cheap and really affective.</li>
            <li>Using it as an overnight spot corrector really cleared up a huge problem area on my cheek.</li>
            <li>It will give you the fresh feeling your looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 years old and assumed that entering my 30&#x27;s would be more about age defying products.</li>
            <li>By morning, it&#x27;s 90% gone---but most of the time it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
            <li>This one truly lives up to my skins expectations and my own personal expectations.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>Put it on to spot treat over night and it dries acne right up.</li>
            <li>It can be kind of drying to the skin, this is why I don&#x27;t use it as often as a total face mask, but it definitely leaves a smooth, clean feeling after using it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have a much younger brother who is entering that Great Awkwardness Phase, I decided to come back and order him one, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LOL, ended up with red cheeks since I left it on for over an hour..</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This mask is hard to find anymore, though it works great on acne.</li>
            <li>(To the point where i feel very uneasy when i dont have it around the house)!</li>
            <li>If you are looking to purchase as a first timer, you will not be disapointed in comparaison to most products on the market that are of not medical grade.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Plus my pores weren&#x27;t pretty</li>
            <li>Plus this is my first time with a proactive</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine using it all over my face, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li>I will be reordering very soon!</li>
            <li>This is teh first product that has had any impact on my impact and overnight.  </li>
            <li>I dot it on my face or put it under my makeup and pretty close to 98% of the time it takes care of the problem overnight.</li>
            <li>Been using this since Proactive first came out.</li>
            <li>The sulfur really pulls the grime out of my face and lightens my complexion a lot!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it very often but when I do it always works wonders!</li>
            <li>The sulfur does stink, but washes off pretty well.</li>
            <li>Wow I always loved this measure because it does dry the pimple up over night&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I get a blemish, I literally dab on a bit of this cream right on top of the pimple, and allow it to dry.</li>
            <li>seeing possible results will need more time to see the real effects.</li>
            <li>Its not drying for me and pores pretty much just vanish after a week.</li>
            <li>as well I get super clear skin from both products.</li>
            <li>This product was good for acne but hard on skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I hope this really works for him.</li>
            <li>Works really well for my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this product because it works but is gently on my skin.</li>
            <li>I use this mask and it clears up my skin and really fast.  </li>
            <li>really helps texture of skin and reduces acne.  </li>
            <li>I really like the feeling after washing it off -</li>
            <li>It really works for me.  </li>
            <li>I wonder what the whole proactiv system is like.</li>
            <li>it really, REALLY works</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my daughter and she is very please with the product.</li>
            <li>but it makes my skin look fresh, young  and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I purchased from this seller on March 2nd and started using it just 3 days ago because that&#x27;s when I ran out of my original Proactiv.</li>
            <li>(again ,that was my own fault but figured I would write it down for the people who have sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell and it works really well - highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to any one that wants blemishes to disappear.</li>
            <li>At first, my spot would be pretty much gone the next morning.</li>
            <li>I sometimes will get bumps on my forehead that potentially turn into full on acne...</li>
            <li>The utility of the product appears to be greater than the typical utility of $4.45.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it only twice... for the price, clean and clear</li>
            <li>Very much worth an add on to a bigger order.</li>
            <li>This product has visibly shrunken these pores to a normal size.</li>
            <li>normally use this product as a spot treatment and leave it on overnight on my emerging pimples.</li>
            <li>Totally normal.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just plain refreshing.</li>
            <li>and I compared this product with the same proactiv mask brought from my local mall and there is a huge difference this mask doesn&#x27;t contain sulfur like the seller advertised.</li>
            <li>Been a year this month after christmas when first using it iam on my second kit I normally buy it at the mall</li>
            <li>It really clears things up in a hurry and was much cheaper on Amazon than at my local mall.</li>
            <li>my face has been very clear since using proactive.</li>
            <li>I ordered this based on the other reviews, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Not only did they contact me back asap about my concerned about my package, they resolved it quickly and I came to find the sweetest hand written note inside.</li>
            <li>but this stuff helps clear my skin faster than anything ive ever used.  </li>
            <li>x week to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>everything is clear in the morning.  </li>
            <li>My son has used this twice so far</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li>I had always used it a couple times a week on my whole face and since I workout 5 days a week my skin needed it, however,  I recently started using it overnight if I had a zit.  </li>
            <li>i refuse to buy from proactive directly.</li>
            <li>It is drying and requires you to moisturize your face immediately after washing it off, but it leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Adult?</li>
            <li>It has helped her acne considerably,.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try ordering directly from Proactive and see if there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
            <li>, I believe its why I look so young at 43</li>
            <li>I actually used the product right before I went to sleep and left it on overnight.</li>
            <li>I often will just put a little dab on problem areas and they will have significantly improved by morning.  </li>
            <li>This particular version of a sulfur product has proven gentle enough for me to use regularly.</li>
            <li>Love it as when you have a blemish you can literally put in on abit heavy in the trouble spot and go to sleep and 99.9% of the time you wake up wash off and its just dried skin that remains and is easily removed with a pair of tweezers!</li>
            <li>I will also use this occasionally as a mask (no more than once a week) and have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This particular product out of that system was the only thing I ever noticed an improvement on my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually leave for more than 1 hour or during night only on my T-zone.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product in a daily routine of getting rid of blemishes/acne.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>The product arrived earlier than predicted and in new condition.  </li>
            <li>but i still get brakouts,,,nothing like major acne</li>
            <li>I kid you not: when I woke up, I not only had an acne clear face, but my pores were visibly smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I use it regularly (once a week), it will keep my face completely clear.  </li>
            <li>I used it several years ago but had not re-purchased until now, and I&#x27;m finding it completely  ineffective.</li>
            <li>I suppose I have sensitive to moderate skin and this product works like a charm, without doing damage!!!!!</li>
            <li>After I was my face, the blemish is diminished and barely noticable.</li>
            <li>Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to benzyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>Salcyclic acid- and benzoyl peroxide-based products have not achieved nearly the same results for me.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that can completely cure a breakout in 1 night.</li>
            <li>I have an allergy to a couple of the products in the regular and sensitive persons of the skin care set.</li>
            <li>If I catch a blemish early enough it&#x27;ll be gone the next day.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that this dried out my skin and irritated my skin even more!:</li>
            <li>(  I have dry sensitive skin and this did not work well with it!</li>
            <li>The quality of the product is very high (for me fights acne overnight), especially if combined with other Proactiv Solutions products.</li>
            <li>When I remove it, I can tell a big difference in how my face feels and looks right then; and my skin continues to improve over the next few days.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the proactiv refining mask if other products aren&#x27;t working for you.</li>
            <li>Typically in bad cases of acne, it takes sixty days of consistently using the products before the results are drastically better, however; you will notice change well before that.</li>
            <li>Leave it on overnight on a stubborn pimple and it will be nearly gone, if not completely gone the next morning.</li>
            <li>It did not excessively dry out my face, but left it feeling clean.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to go through the whole auto delivery mess and all that...</li>

            <li> I LOVE THIS!!!</li>
            <li> I found very good results using the mask and the body lotion by Proactiv.</li>
            <li> The mask is incredible.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I think this is a really great mask for spot treatment.</li>
            <li> Great for spot treatment.</li>
            <li> Great product...</li>
            <li> to whenever I feel a breakout coming on, or I feel I have not been treating my skin great.  </li>
            <li> Once or twice a week for 30 minutes to an hour works great.</li>
            <li> I have recieved my order and happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> but great for spot treating.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff.</li>
            <li> it is a great product and I recommend it to those who deal with skin conditions.</li>
            <li> Very effective at a great price.</li>
            <li> The price point on amazon is fantastic and you don&#x27;t have to go to the mall!!!</li>
            <li> I recieved the mask very quickly so I was impressed with the delivery time.  </li>
            <li> My sister recommended this product, and I&#x27;ve loved it ever since.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, Maynard.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> good luck.</li>
            <li> Good deal buying here.</li>
            <li> If this product is so good alone</li>
            <li> This works as a good alternative.</li>
            <li> I found out that this is one good acne product to combine with Acne.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> since I LOVE this mask!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff !</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This product works AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether or not they changed the formula of this product, but it&#x27;s just not as effective as I remember it being.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a good reason why this product sells, has celebrity endorsements, is costly, and is offered in so many Kiosks and infomercials.</li>
            <li> The refining mask is a nice addition to my acne fighting routine.  </li>
            <li> Liked my service with seller</li>
            <li> nice product helps my skin.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s not as effective now (as a spot corrector) as it was in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I mainly use this product for spot-treatment, and it does an excellent job of shrinking if not eliminating acne overnight.</li>
            <li> I received 2 and came very quick which was exciting because this is the best stuff around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for my skin - makes it feel clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products for the face.  </li>
            <li> I love Proactivs Refining Mask.</li>
            <li> Also a refreshing mask.  </li>
            <li> I really love it</li>
            <li> I all so love the toner</li>
            <li> I love sulfur based products.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product quit often on AMAZON, the price is great, and the product really works.  </li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning the problem area is significantly better sometimes gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a villain and love to stray off course with products.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;ve ripped me and MANY MANY others off.</li>
            <li> but it works like magic</li>
            <li> was much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Queen Helene mask but have not been as satisfied as I have with this product.</li>
            <li> So glad i started using</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a better acne vanish-er or prevent-</li>
            <li> I love the price, love the product.</li>
            <li> Well this stuff seems to suck all the junk out leaving my skin all smooth and purdy!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite Proactiv products.</li>
            <li> My favorite acne remedy.</li>
            <li> works better to me.  </li>
            <li> the price was okay for the product</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the magic ingredient is, but it works like a charm for me.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe it&#x27;s just my skin since it seems to work for many others but</li>
            <li> But I admit the set is better</li>
            <li> love proactive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing and gives me a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> ideally you can put it as a mask and leave it on for a long time.</li>
            <li> and I can see my pores looking a whole lot better!</li>
            <li> huge bummer</li>
            <li> was free shipping is a plus.</li>
            <li> I need to use something that is both effective but gentle.</li>
            <li> This is great to put on indivdual acne spots just as they start or to use as an all over facial treatment.  </li>
            <li> I had heard from several people that Proactiv was great</li>
            <li> It was also really cheap compared to Proactivs&#x27; catalog which sold me from the start.</li>
            <li> I try to eat healthy and use good facial products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s right around the corner, but I still do get a blemish or two once in a while.</li>
            <li> Still, it does make a huge difference on spots, just not a crazy amount!</li>
            <li> Its larger than pictured great price and the real deal!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the complete proactiv kit, but this little mask works great :P</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected and works great.</li>
            <li> I was beginning to start breaking out), and it caused me to have a full blown allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and this product dries my skin out big time over the areas that I have applied it, but that is a good thing for zits.</li>
            <li> Works great, love it, will dry out your skin if you use too often, but clears up spots, highly recommend</li>
            <li> it retracts my pores, smooths my skin and drys up acne QUICK.</li>
            <li> Received the product quickly.  </li>
            <li> It always clears my face but it seems to lighten it a bit which may be good if you want to clear some darker blemishes but really itches.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped quickly and was what it was suppose to be -</li>
            <li> I use until I find something better Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> I and my son actually use this and love it!</li>
            <li> They are amazing and will definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li> This mask is cheap and really affective.</li>
            <li> Using it as an overnight spot corrector really cleared up a huge problem area on my cheek.</li>
            <li> It will give you the fresh feeling your looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old and assumed that entering my 30&#x27;s would be more about age defying products.</li>
            <li> By morning, it&#x27;s 90% gone---but most of the time it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
            <li> This one truly lives up to my skins expectations and my own personal expectations.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Put it on to spot treat over night and it dries acne right up.</li>
            <li> It can be kind of drying to the skin, this is why I don&#x27;t use it as often as a total face mask, but it definitely leaves a smooth, clean feeling after using it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have a much younger brother who is entering that Great Awkwardness Phase, I decided to come back and order him one, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> LOL, ended up with red cheeks since I left it on for over an hour..</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This mask is hard to find anymore, though it works great on acne.</li>
            <li> (To the point where i feel very uneasy when i dont have it around the house)!</li>
            <li> If you are looking to purchase as a first timer, you will not be disapointed in comparaison to most products on the market that are of not medical grade.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Plus my pores weren&#x27;t pretty</li>
            <li> Plus this is my first time with a proactive</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using it all over my face, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li> I will be reordering very soon!</li>
            <li> This is teh first product that has had any impact on my impact and overnight.  </li>
            <li> I dot it on my face or put it under my makeup and pretty close to 98% of the time it takes care of the problem overnight.</li>
            <li> Been using this since Proactive first came out.</li>
            <li> The sulfur really pulls the grime out of my face and lightens my complexion a lot!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very often but when I do it always works wonders!</li>
            <li> The sulfur does stink, but washes off pretty well.</li>
            <li> Wow I always loved this measure because it does dry the pimple up over night&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I get a blemish, I literally dab on a bit of this cream right on top of the pimple, and allow it to dry.</li>
            <li> seeing possible results will need more time to see the real effects.</li>
            <li> Its not drying for me and pores pretty much just vanish after a week.</li>
            <li> as well I get super clear skin from both products.</li>
            <li> This product was good for acne but hard on skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I hope this really works for him.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this product because it works but is gently on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this mask and it clears up my skin and really fast.  </li>
            <li> really helps texture of skin and reduces acne.  </li>
            <li> I really like the feeling after washing it off -</li>
            <li> It really works for me.  </li>
            <li> I wonder what the whole proactiv system is like.</li>
            <li> it really, REALLY works</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she is very please with the product.</li>
            <li> but it makes my skin look fresh, young  and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I purchased from this seller on March 2nd and started using it just 3 days ago because that&#x27;s when I ran out of my original Proactiv.</li>
            <li> (again ,that was my own fault but figured I would write it down for the people who have sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell and it works really well - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to any one that wants blemishes to disappear.</li>
            <li> At first, my spot would be pretty much gone the next morning.</li>
            <li> I sometimes will get bumps on my forehead that potentially turn into full on acne...</li>
            <li> The utility of the product appears to be greater than the typical utility of $4.45.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it only twice... for the price, clean and clear</li>
            <li> Very much worth an add on to a bigger order.</li>
            <li> This product has visibly shrunken these pores to a normal size.</li>
            <li> normally use this product as a spot treatment and leave it on overnight on my emerging pimples.</li>
            <li> Totally normal.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just plain refreshing.</li>
            <li> and I compared this product with the same proactiv mask brought from my local mall and there is a huge difference this mask doesn&#x27;t contain sulfur like the seller advertised.</li>
            <li> Been a year this month after christmas when first using it iam on my second kit I normally buy it at the mall</li>
            <li> It really clears things up in a hurry and was much cheaper on Amazon than at my local mall.</li>
            <li> my face has been very clear since using proactive.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the other reviews, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not only did they contact me back asap about my concerned about my package, they resolved it quickly and I came to find the sweetest hand written note inside.</li>
            <li> but this stuff helps clear my skin faster than anything ive ever used.  </li>
            <li> x week to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> everything is clear in the morning.  </li>
            <li> My son has used this twice so far</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li> I had always used it a couple times a week on my whole face and since I workout 5 days a week my skin needed it, however,  I recently started using it overnight if I had a zit.  </li>
            <li> i refuse to buy from proactive directly.</li>
            <li> It is drying and requires you to moisturize your face immediately after washing it off, but it leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Adult?</li>
            <li> It has helped her acne considerably,.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll try ordering directly from Proactive and see if there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
            <li> , I believe its why I look so young at 43</li>
            <li> I actually used the product right before I went to sleep and left it on overnight.</li>
            <li> I often will just put a little dab on problem areas and they will have significantly improved by morning.  </li>
            <li> This particular version of a sulfur product has proven gentle enough for me to use regularly.</li>
            <li> Love it as when you have a blemish you can literally put in on abit heavy in the trouble spot and go to sleep and 99.9% of the time you wake up wash off and its just dried skin that remains and is easily removed with a pair of tweezers!</li>
            <li> I will also use this occasionally as a mask (no more than once a week) and have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This particular product out of that system was the only thing I ever noticed an improvement on my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually leave for more than 1 hour or during night only on my T-zone.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product in a daily routine of getting rid of blemishes/acne.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> The product arrived earlier than predicted and in new condition.  </li>
            <li> but i still get brakouts,,,nothing like major acne</li>
            <li> I kid you not: when I woke up, I not only had an acne clear face, but my pores were visibly smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I use it regularly (once a week), it will keep my face completely clear.  </li>
            <li> I used it several years ago but had not re-purchased until now, and I&#x27;m finding it completely  ineffective.</li>
            <li> I suppose I have sensitive to moderate skin and this product works like a charm, without doing damage!!!!!</li>
            <li> After I was my face, the blemish is diminished and barely noticable.</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to benzyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> Salcyclic acid- and benzoyl peroxide-based products have not achieved nearly the same results for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that can completely cure a breakout in 1 night.</li>
            <li> I have an allergy to a couple of the products in the regular and sensitive persons of the skin care set.</li>
            <li> If I catch a blemish early enough it&#x27;ll be gone the next day.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that this dried out my skin and irritated my skin even more!:</li>
            <li> (  I have dry sensitive skin and this did not work well with it!</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is very high (for me fights acne overnight), especially if combined with other Proactiv Solutions products.</li>
            <li> When I remove it, I can tell a big difference in how my face feels and looks right then; and my skin continues to improve over the next few days.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the proactiv refining mask if other products aren&#x27;t working for you.</li>
            <li> Typically in bad cases of acne, it takes sixty days of consistently using the products before the results are drastically better, however; you will notice change well before that.</li>
            <li> Leave it on overnight on a stubborn pimple and it will be nearly gone, if not completely gone the next morning.</li>
            <li> It did not excessively dry out my face, but left it feeling clean.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to go through the whole auto delivery mess and all that...</li>
            <li> And this let my skin a little bit more dry than usual.</li>
            <li> most the time i put it on very thinly and wear it during the day or night.</li>
            <li> When my skin is being extremely oily, I&#x27;ll use this as a mask to freshen my skin and clear out my pores.</li>
            <li> its very thick and very light green colored so it does show.</li>
            <li> Long story short these people are crooks..</li>
            <li> The only down side is it can dry out the skin if you use too much, but I find the new formula is less harsh.</li>
            <li> my skin is very dry now,, the acne still the same,,, doesn&#x27;t work to us.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I developed braille-like breakouts on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time - order directly from proactiv.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry, it doesn&#x27;t get on clothes or linens, and it doesn&#x27;t stain stuff.</li>
            <li> Also, doesn&#x27;t over dry.  </li>
            <li> causes my skin to dry out.</li>
            <li> : I have neither oily nor dry skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying a moisturizer to go along with it since it may dry skin.</li>
            <li> WIll also bring that cystic acne to the surface and help dry it out.  </li>
            <li> I looked like Hitch going into work to next day which was no fun at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in the past and it was directly ordered from proactive and it did wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was doubtful because I know a lot of people who it didn&#x27;t work for, but I am very glad it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Typically less redness and smaller size of acne in a day or two.  </li>
            <li> I had gotten a sudden case of small red blotches under my skin that over time came to the surface in little red pimples, Of course, I PANICKED...</li>
            <li> It makes my skin itch after several uses because it seems to dry it out and have alot of chemicals that are harsh I believe.</li>
            <li> I use this a few times per week to keep my pores tight and my face clear and it works well.</li>
            <li> Teenager with really bad acne &#x3D; love this stuff &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I was in my mid-30&#x27;s at the time and couldn&#x27;t believe I was having worse acne than I did in high school!  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s not much out there</li>
            <li> I have to be careful what products I use on my skin.</li>
            <li> so much be careful.</li>
            <li> If my face is going through a &#x27;rough patch&#x27;, I put this mask on for about a 1/2 an hour to 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It works as well as I expected it should.</li>
            <li> So far, this has been the only thing to make a dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> I believe this product is a fake especially due to the cheap price and the fact that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> i hate that it has SUCH a strong sulfer smell.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not using their other products so that may be why as well.</li>
            <li> They usually turn white when they start to &amp;#34;ripen&amp;#34;, but this product prevents that from happening.</li>
            <li> I have had some crazy large pores which in consequence has given me countless blackheads.</li>
            <li> I had a really bad breakout and within a few days my face was pretty much clear.</li>
            <li> His face is clearer and the dark spots are going away already.</li>
            <li> Seems that when you get a pimple, this product, when left on overnight,  dries it out and within 2-4 days the pimple is gone or at least close to it.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the face mask which was 85% watered down.</li>
            <li> It is slightly drying, or I would have rated it a 5.</li>
            <li> Typically it is used once a week by a number of family members varying in age.  </li>
            <li> What I typically do is put it on before I go to sleep and wake up and depending on the severity of the acne</li>
            <li> I put a little on my pimples at night and the swelling is less by morning</li>
            <li> , I have slightly oily, incredibly pale skin).</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need to fix this issue fast.</li>
            <li> , I still get acne and have tried a few things to reduce the pimples from showing.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend it because it does get rid of acne but has harsh skin irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed at all with the quick results</li>
            <li> I dabbed a little on my pimples today and they are almost gone!</li>
            <li> I have been a Proactiv user for the past 2 years</li>
            <li> If I notice that I have a blemish on my face, I apply a small amount and leave it on for about 20 mins then wash it off.</li>
            <li> but it is too small.  </li>
            <li> its usually gone.  </li>
            <li> (gross, I know, sorry)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a crazy amount, though when I do get it, its pretty red and painful</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it for those who have irritable skin or dry skin, as it can become extremely uncomfortable, and may even cause your skin to peel.</li>
            <li> We have used this product for at least eight years.  </li>
            <li> I do not think it prevents acne however(at least in my opinion it doesn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> No more breakouts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had serious acne (not even when I was a teenager).</li>
            <li> My face has broken out to the fullest and I will be filing a complaint.</li>
            <li> Not good to use as a mask...</li>
            <li> If i use all of the Proactiv Solutions products as directed on the starter kit, my skin gets really dry, cracked, and painful.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product along with the rest of the proactiv system when I was a teenage and had horrible acne.</li>
            <li> some peoples reviews said this product was a fake.</li>
            <li> it stinks and bleaches whatever it touches.</li>
            <li> and it no longer comes with the package deal from manufacturer either :(</li>
            <li> I disappointed I was devastated at the after effects.</li>
            <li> Had to throw it away because it was so bad for my face!</li>
            <li> Never had an issue with breakouts, but changes in my body have now included zits rearing their ugly head!  </li>
            <li> and i feel like its probably very bad for you</li>
            <li> It looks horrible on my darker complexion, so thank goodness for this</li>
            <li> I find my chin to be the worst for itching.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A few years ago, I developed braille-like breakouts on my forehead.  I was in my mid-30&#x27;s at the time and couldn&#x27;t believe I was having worse acne than I did in high school!  My sister recommended this product, and I&#x27;ve loved it ever since.  I only need to use it about once a week, and it keeps my oil under control without drying me out.  Good stuff, Maynard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether or not they changed the formula of this product, but it&#x27;s just not as effective as I remember it being. I used it several years ago but had not re-purchased until now, and I&#x27;m finding it completely  ineffective. Will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> So i have been using proactive on occasional zits for years.  I try to eat healthy and use good facial products but i still get brakouts,,,nothing like major acne but this stuff helps clear my skin faster than anything ive ever used.  I gave 4 stars because its sulphur and dries out the skin immensely and i feel like its probably very bad for you but it works.  (To the point where i feel very uneasy when i dont have it around the house)! If you are looking to purchase as a first timer, you will not be disapointed in comparaison to most products on the market that are of not medical grade.</li>
            <li> A couple months ago I ran out of my korres milk protein wash and didn&#x27;t have the money to restock so I just borrowed some proactive from a friend(because I was beginning to start breaking out), and it caused me to have a full blown allergic reaction. I looked like Hitch going into work to next day which was no fun at all. This is the ONLY product of proactiv I will use!!! If I get any signs of break outs I use this before bed and it clears up over night!!! I suppose I have sensitive to moderate skin and this product works like a charm, without doing damage!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products for the face.  I often will just put a little dab on problem areas and they will have significantly improved by morning.  Typically less redness and smaller size of acne in a day or two.  It can be kind of drying to the skin, this is why I don&#x27;t use it as often as a total face mask, but it definitely leaves a smooth, clean feeling after using it.  I would definitely recommend this product, especially for overnight spot treatments!</li>
            <li> This product is the best product i have ever used for my skin....i get cystic zits all the time and ive been using this every night and i have not broke out since this stuff is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. This product always works wonders. Leave it on overnight on a stubborn pimple and it will be nearly gone, if not completely gone the next morning.</li>
            <li> I love Proactivs Refining Mask. It&#x27;s refreshing and gives me a clean feeling. &amp;lt;3. I recommend this product 100%. It will give you the fresh feeling your looking for.</li>
            <li> Only been using this item for a short time. seeing possible results will need more time to see the real effects.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. My son has used this twice so far and we both have noticed a big improvement with his acne. His face is clearer and the dark spots are going away already. I hope this really works for him. Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! It is slightly drying, or I would have rated it a 5. I had a really bad breakout and within a few days my face was pretty much clear. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been a Proactiv user for the past 2 years but when I realized I could get it cheaper on here I started to make all of my Proactiv purchases on amazon. I purchased from this seller on March 2nd and started using it just 3 days ago because that&#x27;s when I ran out of my original Proactiv. Long story short these people are crooks.. The bottle arrived with Chinese writing on it and I know for a fact that the originals are in English.. I also purchased the face mask which was 85% watered down. My face has broken out to the fullest and I will be filing a complaint.</li>
            <li> Product just as described.  Zaps zits overnight as advertised on TV -or gets the ball rolling!  Also a refreshing mask.  Great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I recieved the mask very quickly so I was impressed with the delivery time.  It didn&#x27;t seem to shrink my nodul zits but I understand they are one of the hardest to treat and I&#x27;m not using their other products so that may be why as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for occasional breakouts as a &amp;#34;spot-treatment&amp;#34;.  It works great!  I leave it over night. Once it&#x27;s dry, it doesn&#x27;t get on clothes or linens, and it doesn&#x27;t stain stuff. Also, doesn&#x27;t over dry.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!!! I have been through every type of acne cream out there. I don&#x27;t have a crazy amount, though when I do get it, its pretty red and painful if you try to pop it. Plus my pores weren&#x27;t pretty either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for about a week now, I am sooo happy! This makes everything just vanish overnight to two days max. Its not drying for me and pores pretty much just vanish after a week. This is the best thing I have ever used. Plus this is my first time with a proactive product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was doubtful because I know a lot of people who it didn&#x27;t work for, but I am very glad it worked for me. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I use this after I was my face and use the Proactiv toner. If I notice that I have a blemish on my face, I apply a small amount and leave it on for about 20 mins then wash it off. Sometimes I have left it on all day while sitting at home and washed it off before I went to bed and the blemish was almost gone the next day. It does help with clearing up blemishes/acne. There are times where I just apply it and rub it in as a lotion like product when I have a blemish that is stubborn and then apply my Proactiv sheer tint moisturizer over it so that it is covered so it can do its job of getting rid of the blemish so I can go about my day. After I was my face, the blemish is diminished and barely noticable. I would highly recommend this product in a daily routine of getting rid of blemishes/acne.</li>
            <li> Proactive mask been using it for a year know I really love it there&#x27;s not much out there I can use but I can use this I all so love the toner it  does it sting or burn like others do my face has been very clear since using proactive. Been a year this month after christmas when first using it iam on my second kit I normally buy it at the mall but on here I like the prices and the mask was free shipping is a plus.Another thing I use biore then the proactive toner it works wonders as well I get super clear skin from both products.</li>
            <li> I think this is a really great mask for spot treatment. I can&#x27;t imagine using it all over my face, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible. Great for spot treatment. Very much worth an add on to a bigger order.</li>
            <li> Great! I love sulfur based products. Works really well for my skin. Highly recommend this product! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive, combination skin. I have to be careful what products I use on my skin. With Proactiv, I can only use the Deep Cleansing wash. The basic was (white cleanser) causes my skin to dry out. The Deep Cleansing Wash (blue cleanser, meant for entire body also), includes added moisturizers that my skin tolerates. I need to use something that is both effective but gentle. I use this specific product to get rid of problem breakouts. I&#x27;m 32 years old and assumed that entering my 30&#x27;s would be more about age defying products. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s right around the corner, but I still do get a blemish or two once in a while. When I get a blemish, I literally dab on a bit of this cream right on top of the pimple, and allow it to dry. I leave it on overnight. By morning, it&#x27;s 90% gone---but most of the time it&#x27;s completely gone. This is a terrific product. There&#x27;s a good reason why this product sells, has celebrity endorsements, is costly, and is offered in so many Kiosks and infomercials. This one truly lives up to my skins expectations and my own personal expectations. I will be reordering very soon!</li>
            <li> I purchase this product quit often on AMAZON, the price is great, and the product really works.  I even purchase for gifts.  One of the best acne products that has ever been created.  Use an overnight spot treatment,  it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> The refining mask is a nice addition to my acne fighting routine.  I had always used it a couple times a week on my whole face and since I workout 5 days a week my skin needed it, however,  I recently started using it overnight if I had a zit.  When I wake up in the morning the problem area is significantly better sometimes gone. I will continue to purchase this product because it works but is gently on my skin.</li>
            <li> Never had an issue with breakouts, but changes in my body have now included zits rearing their ugly head!  Tried everything but nothing did the trick until I purchased this refining mask.  I put on before I I go to bed, and when I wake up, the blemish is all but gone.  I use daily as a preventative measure as I can&#x27;t seem to keep one step ahead of the breakouts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had serious acne (not even when I was a teenager). However, once I upped the ante on the aerobics exercises, my face started breaking out like a pubescent, oily faced tween. I was in desperate need to fix this issue fast. I ordered this based on the other reviews, and I was not disappointed. I actually used the product right before I went to sleep and left it on overnight. I kid you not: when I woke up, I not only had an acne clear face, but my pores were visibly smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Sidenote: I have neither oily nor dry skin. It did not excessively dry out my face, but left it feeling clean.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have a much younger brother who is entering that Great Awkwardness Phase, I decided to come back and order him one, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Not only did they contact me back asap about my concerned about my package, they resolved it quickly and I came to find the sweetest hand written note inside. They are amazing and will definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a villain and love to stray off course with products.  I found very good results using the mask and the body lotion by Proactiv. I use it twice a week and I can see my pores looking a whole lot better! Great product...</li>
            <li> I have had some crazy large pores which in consequence has given me countless blackheads. This product has visibly shrunken these pores to a normal size. I highy recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If i use all of the Proactiv Solutions products as directed on the starter kit, my skin gets really dry, cracked, and painful. If I just use the Proactiv refining mask however, I don&#x27;t break out and my skin doesn&#x27;t flake off (for reference, I have slightly oily, incredibly pale skin). I wish this product was sold in a larger quantity tube.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. i refuse to buy from proactive directly. they&#x27;ve ripped me and MANY MANY others off. but they still have some awesome products, this being one of them. i hate that it has SUCH a strong sulfer smell. but it works like magic so what can u do. it retracts my pores, smooths my skin and drys up acne QUICK. ideally you can put it as a mask and leave it on for a long time. most the time i put it on very thinly and wear it during the day or night. its very thick and very light green colored so it does show. it stinks and bleaches whatever it touches. so much be careful. can use as a spot treatment too.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot. It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell and it works really well - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I notice an immediate, visible difference in the size of my pores after using this mask. It is drying and requires you to moisturize your face immediately after washing it off, but it leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft. I use it a couple of times a week and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The product arrived earlier than predicted and in new condition.  This product works AMAZING.  I&#x27;m 24 and only recently started having issues with acne again.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from salicylic acid to hydrogen peroxide products.  This is teh first product that has had any impact on my impact and overnight.  I highly recommend the proactiv refining mask if other products aren&#x27;t working for you.</li>
            <li> I am a big big fan of this product. While the 3 step treatment did NOT work for me, the mask DID.  The mask is incredible. It&#x27;s my go-to whenever I feel a breakout coming on, or I feel I have not been treating my skin great.  I try to use this once x week to keep my skin clear.  This mask is cheap and really affective.</li>
            <li> Teenager with really bad acne &#x3D; love this stuff &amp;#60;3 I don&#x27;t like the complete proactiv kit, but this little mask works great :P</li>
            <li> I like the product but the earlier version of it was much better. I put a little on my pimples at night and the swelling is less by morning</li>
            <li> This product definitely does what it says it will do. If you have visible pores like I do, this mask will noticeably minimize them. Once or twice a week for 30 minutes to an hour works great.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and use it every time I think I feel something starting on my face.  I dot it on my face or put it under my makeup and pretty close to 98% of the time it takes care of the problem overnight.</li>
            <li> my skin is very dry now,, the acne still the same,,, doesn&#x27;t work to us. By the way , u need soap to get rid of the mask after applying on ur face.</li>
            <li> Been using this since Proactive first came out. Its the only product that worked for me. Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to benzyl peroxide. This creme is the only thing that gets rid of my acne when I apply as a spot treatment overnight.</li>
            <li> This mask is hard to find anymore, though it works great on acne. Put it on to spot treat over night and it dries acne right up. Can&#x27;t purchase by itself from manufacturer, so had to purchase on here and it no longer comes with the package deal from manufacturer either :( huge bummer since I LOVE this mask!</li>
            <li> Ive used this product for years for spot breakouts.  It really clears things up in a hurry and was much cheaper on Amazon than at my local mall.</li>
            <li> I have recieved my order and happy with my purchase. I received 2 and came very quick which was exciting because this is the best stuff around. Just need to wash face with any face wash and then apply as a mask and go to bed and wake up with the best results. Liked my service with seller</li>
            <li> I mainly use this product for spot-treatment, and it does an excellent job of shrinking if not eliminating acne overnight. Salcyclic acid- and benzoyl peroxide-based products have not achieved nearly the same results for me. I will also use this occasionally as a mask (no more than once a week) and have been pleased with the results. I&#x27;ve used the Queen Helene mask but have not been as satisfied as I have with this product.</li>
            <li> We have used this product for at least eight years.  Typically it is used once a week by a number of family members varying in age.  This is great to put on indivdual acne spots just as they start or to use as an all over facial treatment.  I leave it on overnight when targeting individual spots.  The Proactive line of products is the best acne treatment I have ever used. Typically in bad cases of acne, it takes sixty days of consistently using the products before the results are drastically better, however; you will notice change well before that.</li>
            <li> This works well on Cystic Acne!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product.  I use this mask and it clears up my skin and really fast.  So glad i started using will continue to use.</li>
            <li> nice product helps my skin. just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes it burns like hell</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and he seemed to feel that it would do what he wanted but it is too small.  I located the number to the company and they said to return it and send my phone number and they would call me to help with getting the proper size.  As of yet I have not heard from them and this was done quite a while ago.</li>
            <li> I use this a few times per week to keep my pores tight and my face clear and it works well.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product if you already  have an acne blemish on your face.  What I typically do is put it on before I go to sleep and wake up and depending on the severity of the acne its usually gone.  I am always looking for a better acne vanish-er or prevent-er, so this is definitely a must have for...besides the 10% Benzoyl Peroxide...this is definitely been helping.  I use until I find something better Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use this as both a spot corrector and as a mask. It&#x27;s not too drying if you remember to put on moisturizer after using the mask. I prefer it as a mask. The sulfur really pulls the grime out of my face and lightens my complexion a lot! Using it as an overnight spot corrector really cleared up a huge problem area on my cheek. I feel like it&#x27;s not as effective now (as a spot corrector) as it was in the beginning. At first, my spot would be pretty much gone the next morning. Still, it does make a huge difference on spots, just not a crazy amount!</li>
            <li> I love the price, love the product. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> this beauty proactiv mask does not contain sulfur. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 years and I compared this product with the same proactiv mask brought from my local mall and there is a huge difference this mask doesn&#x27;t contain sulfur like the seller advertised.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I used proactive for over a year and then stopped. This is the only product I still buy from them. It is well worth the price.  really helps texture of skin and reduces acne.  I recommend buying a moisturizer to go along with it since it may dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works great, love it, will dry out your skin if you use too often, but clears up spots, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that this dried out my skin and irritated my skin even more!:(  I have dry sensitive skin and this did not work well with it! Had to throw it away because it was so bad for my face! Didn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
            <li> Very effective at a great price. Highly recommend this product to any one that wants blemishes to disappear. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Not good to use as a mask...but great for spot treating.  Just a dab and everything is clear in the morning.  WIll also bring that cystic acne to the surface and help dry it out.  (gross, I know, sorry)  I don&#x27;t want to go through the whole auto delivery mess and all that...so I just buy a tube here, lasts forever.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This product works when used on a regular basis. I do not think it prevents acne however(at least in my opinion it doesn&#x27;t). Seems that when you get a pimple, this product, when left on overnight,  dries it out and within 2-4 days the pimple is gone or at least close to it. Also, you can not beat the price it is sold for on amazon!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very often but when I do it always works wonders! I sometimes will get bumps on my forehead that potentially turn into full on acne... Well this stuff seems to suck all the junk out leaving my skin all smooth and purdy! I like to leave it on overnight. The price point on amazon is fantastic and you don&#x27;t have to go to the mall!!! Wahoo!!</li>
            <li> I lie th way my face feels after using this mask !!! Its a must have it give your face a bright lift !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for my skin - makes it feel clean and healthy. I really like the feeling after washing it off - it&#x27;s just plain refreshing.</li>
            <li> the best, what can i say. It really works for me.  I just can&#x27;t say it works for everyone. good luck.</li>
            <li> This stuff still works great!  nothing beats it!</li>
            <li> Got blemishes? Adult? Teen? It doesn&#x27;t matter because this stuff works great on both! Great for facials too! The only down side is it can dry out the skin if you use too much, but I find the new formula is less harsh.</li>
            <li> This is for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a sudden case of small red blotches under my skin that over time came to the surface in little red pimples, Of course, I PANICKED...I had heard from several people that Proactiv was great so I searched amazon and found this product. It says spot treatment but I didn&#x27;t listen..LOL, ended up with red cheeks since I left it on for over an hour..BUT I rubbed some Eucerin lotion on afterwards and it was gone. (again ,that was my own fault but figured I would write it down for the people who have sensitive skin) I dabbed a little on my pimples today and they are almost gone! yup, I would buy this again. Hopefully i don&#x27;t break out like this ever again..</li>
            <li> I use only as a spot treatment. Works beautifully. When I feel a blemish coming on I put some on the spot at bedtime. If I catch a blemish early enough it&#x27;ll be gone the next day. If not 2 to 3 days will do the job. Love this stuff. Good deal buying here.</li>
            <li> Dab on pimples at night &amp; they are gone in 2 days. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast. It was also really cheap compared to Proactivs&#x27; catalog which sold me from the start. One of my favorite Proactiv products.</li>
            <li> It does minimize pores.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product along with the rest of the proactiv system when I was a teenage and had horrible acne. This particular product out of that system was the only thing I ever noticed an improvement on my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m in my mid twenties, I still get acne and have tried a few things to reduce the pimples from showing. So far, this has been the only thing to make a dramatic effect. My acne has been borderline cystic recently, and it helps heal them from when they start to emerge. They usually turn white when they start to &amp;#34;ripen&amp;#34;, but this product prevents that from happening. It looks horrible on my darker complexion, so thank goodness for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use this product as a spot treatment and leave it on overnight on my emerging pimples. I have oily skin, and this product dries my skin out big time over the areas that I have applied it, but that is a good thing for zits. I don&#x27;t recommend it for those who have irritable skin or dry skin, as it can become extremely uncomfortable, and may even cause your skin to peel. When my skin is being extremely oily, I&#x27;ll use this as a mask to freshen my skin and clear out my pores.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time. Was cheaper then ordering from company. This is the best all around mask ever. Getting a pimple, put this on it comes  to head and gone or just goes away. Makes dirt come out of pores. Makes pores tiny. Makes skin tighter and smoither. Makes you look younger.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that can completely cure a breakout in 1 night. It all depends on your skin type, but this one works for me.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is very high (for me fights acne overnight), especially if combined with other Proactiv Solutions products. The utility of the product appears to be greater than the typical utility of $4.45. It is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! If this product is so good alone I wonder what the whole proactiv system is like.</li>
            <li> My favorite acne remedy. It works.</li>
            <li> Proactive can be trusted. I have an allergy to a couple of the products in the regular and sensitive persons of the skin care set. This works as a good alternative. The sulfur does stink, but washes off pretty well. This particular version of a sulfur product has proven gentle enough for me to use regularly.</li>
            <li> I tried finding this mask everywhere!! Its larger than pictured great price and the real deal!! Love it as when you have a blemish you can literally put in on abit heavy in the trouble spot and go to sleep and 99.9% of the time you wake up wash off and its just dried skin that remains and is easily removed with a pair of tweezers! I and my son actually use this and love it! Will use seller again!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my daughter&#x27;s acne.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff ! it really, REALLY works</li>
            <li> Received the product quickly.  I&#x27;ve used it only twice... for the price, clean and clear works better to me.  the price was okay for the product</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected and works great. Was here in a timely matter , and was here when they said</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  If my face is going through a &#x27;rough patch&#x27;, I put this mask on for about a 1/2 an hour to 45 minutes.  When I remove it, I can tell a big difference in how my face feels and looks right then; and my skin continues to improve over the next few days.  When I use it regularly (once a week), it will keep my face completely clear.  I don&#x27;t know what the magic ingredient is, but it works like a charm for me.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> It works as well as I expected it should.</li>
            <li> This product was good for acne but hard on skin. It makes my skin itch after several uses because it seems to dry it out and have alot of chemicals that are harsh I believe. It always clears my face but it seems to lighten it a bit which may be good if you want to clear some darker blemishes but really itches. I find my chin to be the worst for itching. It&#x27;s prefereable to use as a spot treatment and not all over face use. I would reccomend it because it does get rid of acne but has harsh skin irritation.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped quickly and was what it was suppose to be - it is a great product and I recommend it to those who deal with skin conditions.</li>
            <li> OMG!! y face broke out into boils after using this product, not only was I disappointed I was devastated at the after effects.</li>
            <li> Smells perfect to me... like a soap made of sulfur. Totally normal. I usually leave for more than 1 hour or during night only on my T-zone. I found out that this is one good acne product to combine with Acne.Org&#x27;s treatment. And this let my skin a little bit more dry than usual.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she is very please with the product. It has helped her acne considerably,.</li>
            <li> I used it on the same spot three nights in a row and it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I thought maybe it&#x27;s just my skin since it seems to work for many others but some peoples reviews said this product was a fake. Maybe I&#x27;ll try ordering directly from Proactive and see if there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this for overnight spot treatment! Works wonders!</li>
            <li> No more breakouts! Wow I always loved this measure because it does dry the pimple up over night&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed at all with the quick results</li>
            <li> I like this I use it now and again, I believe its why I look so young at 43 But I admit the set is better I use it and I don&#x27;t have acne but it makes my skin look fresh, young  and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I love proactive.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I&#x27;ve used it in the past and it was directly ordered from proactive and it did wonders for my skin. I believe this product is a fake especially due to the cheap price and the fact that it didn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your time - order directly from proactiv.</li>
