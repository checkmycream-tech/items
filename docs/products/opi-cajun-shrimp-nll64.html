            <li>Fast shipping is great, too, always:)</li>
            <li>Cajun Shrimp is her favorite shade and the nail salon we go to doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The seller was outstanding by shipping immediately</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect shade of red with a hint of orange/mandarin.</li>
            <li>My favorite color in the OPI collection.</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with OPI products.  </li>
            <li>Love the contrast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>I love OPI polish.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 years or more now</li>
            <li>This nail polish is the one used at my favorite nail boutique.  </li>
            <li>I have used this color for years and it is one of the original OPI colors that has lasted the test of time and popular use.  </li>
            <li>HOT HOT HOT!!!!!!</li>
            <li>its a timeless classic that looks great on anyone.</li>
            <li>Very easy and smooth application.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty and bright Summer color.</li>
            <li>Wonderful color and lasts a long time without chipping.</li>
            <li>It applies really smoothly, and I only needed two coats for perfect coverage.</li>
            <li>&quot; a very bright red.  </li>
            <li>Definitely in my top 10 of colors, its a beautiful orange red!</li>
            <li>On occasion you might have to do a touch up but other than that it is great!</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s not that easy to find it in all salons</li>
            <li>Have liked this OPI color for several years because of its festive not-orange-and-not-red hue and was delighted to find it again.</li>
            <li>A really beautiful color is a mix of orange and red  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump and dries quickly!</li>
            <li>color is fine for anytime of year looks great on and last along time without chipping.</li>
            <li>Besides loving the color, it applies really well.  </li>
            <li>The Cajun Shrimp is fabulous against my complexion.  </li>
            <li>It is a fairly shiny lacquer, so the top coat isn&#x27;t essential, but it does help protect your manicure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pink-based red, and in strong light you have the bright, screaming pinkness out in full force.</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li>Great color and lasts so long after getting nails done.</li>
            <li>Not quite red, not quite orange, it inspires beachy, warm and sunny days!</li>
            <li>and it is by far my most favorite brand and color.</li>
            <li>Frequent compliments on this color after manicures made me find my own on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I tried this nail polish for the first time last year and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as seller described!</li>
            <li>This looks a fabulous bright orangy-red in my opinion, deeper reds tend to look odd on me.</li>
            <li>It is such a popular color that the salons are out of stock sometimes.</li>
            <li>This is a fun, summer color.  </li>
            <li>one has become the favorite red polish among all the brands</li>
            <li>I first tried this nail polish when I purchased nail polish minis for my daughters for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>FAST shipping!</li>
            <li>Exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li>so that is how I justify the higher price for it.</li>
            <li>I love this polish and the OPI Red---</li>
            <li>Finally was able to find this color.</li>
            <li>This one worked well and,of course is quality that is consistent with OPI.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I love this color especially in the summer!</li>
            <li>While OPI lists this in their orange color range, it&#x27;s definitely more red with a tinge of coral.</li>
            <li>Side-by-side with the Coca-Cola red, this color is more coral by a two</li>
            <li>It reminds me of more of a poppy red.</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite nail color!</li>
            <li>Pretty thin formula, which takes a bit of building up to get great coverage, although it does go on well.     </li>
            <li>love the colour, however not what i expected, i was expecting a vibrant strong red and this one is more orange red</li>
            <li>I could have only used one coat and it would have been fine.  </li>
            <li>I know because sometimes I get busy and it will take me 3 weeks ( or a little more) and my hands and feet are fine.  </li>
            <li>It is sometimes hard to find this color which is good in the summer months in Texas on the Gulf Coast.</li>
            <li>Item as described, fast postage.</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>is a very electric summery colour.</li>
            <li>My absolute FAV color.</li>
            <li>They are real OPI.</li>
            <li>The color really stands out and goes well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like the staying power of OPI.  </li>
            <li>is the New Black as my favorite OPI color!  </li>
            <li>but it is such a powerful color!   </li>
            <li>Such a fun color for summer!</li>
            <li>My Chihuahua Bites a little more because it has more pink.</li>
            <li>the picture looked like true red to me on the monitor.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty, creamy shade with complete coverage in two coats, but it&#x27;s not quite as shrimp colored as The OPI website led me to believe.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI and this color is bright and fun for summer.</li>
            <li>The polish was rapped tight and neat along with I was pleased with the color.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a nice summer red polish, not too dark.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just about time to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find it on Amazon, considering this color is very hard to find where I live.</li>
            <li>I usually pick this color when I go to the salon, but it&#x27;s so much more convenient to have it on hand.</li>
            <li>Love it on my nails and is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great color for a bikini or to brighten your spirits during a cold winter.</li>
            <li>Indicates, I would guess, that it&#x27;s an old bottle.</li>
            <li>I use the OPI natural basecoat on my nails to prevent any color staining, followed by two coats of color and then a topcoat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really vibrant red with just a hint of a mandarin orange color.  </li>
            <li>It is  vibrant red with a hint of orange.</li>
            <li>This is a vibrant must have red!</li>
            <li>It took forever to get to me, which I was surprised, since it&#x27;s just a tiny bottle of polish - perhaps it grew old on the way - ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll be able to use this bottle for long unless I find a way to thin it out, which I should not have to do to a brand new</li>
            <li>and you really can&#x27;t even get nervous and pick at it and have it peel away like other polishes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I applied this with my usual base coat, two coats of this polish and a good layer of top coat.</li>
            <li>I love OPI, but not easy to find in my small Southern town.</li>

            <li> Cajun Shrimp is her favorite shade and the nail salon we go to doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The seller was outstanding by shipping immediately</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect shade of red with a hint of orange/mandarin.</li>
            <li> My favorite color in the OPI collection.</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with OPI products.  </li>
            <li> Love the contrast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the color.</li>
            <li> I love OPI polish.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 years or more now</li>
            <li> This nail polish is the one used at my favorite nail boutique.  </li>
            <li> I have used this color for years and it is one of the original OPI colors that has lasted the test of time and popular use.  </li>
            <li> HOT HOT HOT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> its a timeless classic that looks great on anyone.</li>
            <li> Very easy and smooth application.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty and bright Summer color.</li>
            <li> Wonderful color and lasts a long time without chipping.</li>
            <li> It applies really smoothly, and I only needed two coats for perfect coverage.</li>
            <li> &quot; a very bright red.  </li>
            <li> Definitely in my top 10 of colors, its a beautiful orange red!</li>
            <li> On occasion you might have to do a touch up but other than that it is great!</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s not that easy to find it in all salons</li>
            <li> Have liked this OPI color for several years because of its festive not-orange-and-not-red hue and was delighted to find it again.</li>
            <li> A really beautiful color is a mix of orange and red  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump and dries quickly!</li>
            <li> color is fine for anytime of year looks great on and last along time without chipping.</li>
            <li> Besides loving the color, it applies really well.  </li>
            <li> The Cajun Shrimp is fabulous against my complexion.  </li>
            <li> It is a fairly shiny lacquer, so the top coat isn&#x27;t essential, but it does help protect your manicure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pink-based red, and in strong light you have the bright, screaming pinkness out in full force.</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> Great color and lasts so long after getting nails done.</li>
            <li> Not quite red, not quite orange, it inspires beachy, warm and sunny days!</li>
            <li> and it is by far my most favorite brand and color.</li>
            <li> Frequent compliments on this color after manicures made me find my own on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I tried this nail polish for the first time last year and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as seller described!</li>
            <li> This looks a fabulous bright orangy-red in my opinion, deeper reds tend to look odd on me.</li>
            <li> It is such a popular color that the salons are out of stock sometimes.</li>
            <li> This is a fun, summer color.  </li>
            <li> one has become the favorite red polish among all the brands</li>
            <li> I first tried this nail polish when I purchased nail polish minis for my daughters for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> FAST shipping!</li>
            <li> Exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li> so that is how I justify the higher price for it.</li>
            <li> I love this polish and the OPI Red---</li>
            <li> Finally was able to find this color.</li>
            <li> This one worked well and,of course is quality that is consistent with OPI.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I love this color especially in the summer!</li>
            <li> While OPI lists this in their orange color range, it&#x27;s definitely more red with a tinge of coral.</li>
            <li> Side-by-side with the Coca-Cola red, this color is more coral by a two</li>
            <li> It reminds me of more of a poppy red.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite nail color!</li>
            <li> Pretty thin formula, which takes a bit of building up to get great coverage, although it does go on well.     </li>
            <li> love the colour, however not what i expected, i was expecting a vibrant strong red and this one is more orange red</li>
            <li> I could have only used one coat and it would have been fine.  </li>
            <li> I know because sometimes I get busy and it will take me 3 weeks ( or a little more) and my hands and feet are fine.  </li>
            <li> It is sometimes hard to find this color which is good in the summer months in Texas on the Gulf Coast.</li>
            <li> Item as described, fast postage.</li>
            <li> fast delivery</li>
            <li> is a very electric summery colour.</li>
            <li> My absolute FAV color.</li>
            <li> They are real OPI.</li>
            <li> The color really stands out and goes well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like the staying power of OPI.  </li>
            <li> is the New Black as my favorite OPI color!  </li>
            <li> but it is such a powerful color!   </li>
            <li> Such a fun color for summer!</li>
            <li> My Chihuahua Bites a little more because it has more pink.</li>
            <li> the picture looked like true red to me on the monitor.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty, creamy shade with complete coverage in two coats, but it&#x27;s not quite as shrimp colored as The OPI website led me to believe.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI and this color is bright and fun for summer.</li>
            <li> The polish was rapped tight and neat along with I was pleased with the color.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice summer red polish, not too dark.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just about time to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find it on Amazon, considering this color is very hard to find where I live.</li>
            <li> I usually pick this color when I go to the salon, but it&#x27;s so much more convenient to have it on hand.</li>
            <li> Love it on my nails and is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great color for a bikini or to brighten your spirits during a cold winter.</li>
            <li> Indicates, I would guess, that it&#x27;s an old bottle.</li>
            <li> I use the OPI natural basecoat on my nails to prevent any color staining, followed by two coats of color and then a topcoat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really vibrant red with just a hint of a mandarin orange color.  </li>
            <li> It is  vibrant red with a hint of orange.</li>
            <li> This is a vibrant must have red!</li>
            <li> It took forever to get to me, which I was surprised, since it&#x27;s just a tiny bottle of polish - perhaps it grew old on the way - ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll be able to use this bottle for long unless I find a way to thin it out, which I should not have to do to a brand new</li>
            <li> and you really can&#x27;t even get nervous and pick at it and have it peel away like other polishes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I applied this with my usual base coat, two coats of this polish and a good layer of top coat.</li>
            <li> I love OPI, but not easy to find in my small Southern town.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear red/orange colors, but I really like this color.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a long time!</li>
            <li> so I received 4 days earlier than expected by using standard shipping.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and stays on longer than any other brand I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I try other colors but always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely try other colors.</li>
            <li> Opi also seems to last longer than other polishes</li>
            <li> If you love red or coral polish, you will not be disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> Not a true red.  </li>
            <li> This item also arrived sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> Came on time with careful packaging.</li>
            <li> I would not trade it for any other color.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with a classic OPI color!</li>
            <li> so I had to break down and order it for myself.</li>
            <li> wear it all summer every year...stands out with a slight tan...</li>
            <li> I have worn it a couple times since I bought it less then a month ago.</li>
            <li> I wear this color year round</li>
            <li> I saved a few dollars ordering the product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Dress it up or wear it plain.</li>
            <li> Had i been lazy</li>
            <li> but it is hard to find in the store.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find now.</li>
            <li> I always use a base coat when applying polish, especially anything with a red base (helps prevent yellowing of the natural nail.)</li>
            <li> This bottle of polish contained polish that was too thick.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that said these were fake.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s orange red which I personally hate!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI</li>
            <li> i like ording it online because it saves me a trip to the mall(i hate shopping).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have worn this color for years!  I try other colors but always come back to this one.  It&#x27;s a really vibrant red with just a hint of a mandarin orange color.  It looks great on toes (I&#x27;m sure it does on fingers too, but I just do toes).  The quality of OPI is amazing, and this is a great price.  This bottle will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Item as described, fast postage.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toenail polish color of all time.  It looks great even after a couple of weeks.  On occasion you might have to do a touch up but other than that it is great!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful shade of a deep coral/red nailpolish which looks great on fingers or toes.</li>
            <li> EVERYBODY asks me what this color is because they want it themselves.  It was my staple summer color for last summer, and I think that might just have to happen again this year!</li>
            <li> Bright! Really very bright. If you&#x27;re a fan of colours that are bold and eye-catching, as I am, then this shade is perfect. It&#x27;s a pink-based red, and in strong light you have the bright, screaming pinkness out in full force. Pretty thin formula, which takes a bit of building up to get great coverage, although it does go on well.     Again, if you&#x27;re a fan of bright, crimson-tastic reds, you&#x27;ll probably love this one.</li>
            <li> I tried this nail polish for the first time last year and I loved it.  So far, the best nail polish I&#x27;ve tried.  I got it in \\&quot;Cajun Shrimp,\\&quot; a very bright red.  Bright, bold colors are in this year so this is perfect.  Besides loving the color, it applies really well.  Very easy and smooth application.  Dries quickly.  I will definitely try other colors.</li>
            <li> This polish is absolutely beautiful. It is red with just a touch of orange in it. I always use a base coat when applying polish, especially anything with a red base (helps prevent yellowing of the natural nail.) I applied this with my usual base coat, two coats of this polish and a good layer of top coat. The manicure lasted me almost 10 days. It is a fairly shiny lacquer, so the top coat isn&#x27;t essential, but it does help protect your manicure. If you love red or coral polish, you will not be disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this color but it is hard to find in the store.  I love that I ordered it and it came to my door even cheaper than if I had bought it in the store.</li>
            <li> great color... fast delivery</li>
            <li> this is a no brainer for summer or for anytime you want a sexy notice me but not to trendy look. its a timeless classic that looks great on anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty and bright Summer color. I also purchased OPI My Chihuahua Bites and it looks similar to this one but Cajun Shrimp has more of an orange undertone to it. I like My Chihuahua Bites a little more because it has more pink.</li>
            <li> Great transaction!! Beautiful color!!</li>
            <li> This is the only OPI shade that I buy repeatedly. Wonderful color and lasts a long time without chipping.</li>
            <li> Cajun Shrimp is my all-time favorite OPI color. This looks a fabulous bright orangy-red in my opinion, deeper reds tend to look odd on me. I&#x27;ll cry if they discontinue this shade.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a great color. I usually pick this color when I go to the salon, but it&#x27;s so much more convenient to have it on hand.</li>
            <li> the picture looked like true red to me on the monitor.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointd to find out it&#x27;s orange red which I personally hate! 5/12/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 7/30/2013.&lt;br /&gt;This one has become the favorite red polish among all the brands I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m changing it to 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I love it. What a great color.</li>
            <li> I first tried this nail polish when I purchased nail polish minis for my daughters for Christmas.  I had one extra and kept this one for myself.  I truly love this nail polish and the color is the best. I had to buy this larger size.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> OPI is a great polish and this color really delivers.  I got so many compliments the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite nail color ever! Thank you!</li>
            <li> FAST shipping! When I placed my order, it was delivered to my home in 3 days. It was packaged well protecting the item from breaking. Exactly as seller described! I wear this color year round and it is by far my most favorite brand and color. I was very pleased to find it on Amazon, considering this color is very hard to find where I live. I was so happy to get it for a great price and free shipping. SO happy! Love my Cajun Shrimp nail polish!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colors of OPI that they make,this is one of my go to colors in the fall and in the midst of summer.</li>
            <li> I get the oxxium gel color from opi for my hands when I go get my manicures.  They didn&#x27;t have Cajun shrimp  for my feet so I decided to purchase it.  I love love love the color!!!! It matches my hands perfectly and last 3 weeks.  I know because sometimes I get busy and it will take me 3 weeks ( or a little more) and my hands and feet are fine.  This item also arrived sooner than expected.  I am very pleased and will purchase from n-pix again:-).</li>
            <li> Great product! Great color! Good to wear with all colors.</li>
            <li> Have liked this OPI color for several years because of its festive not-orange-and-not-red hue and was delighted to find it again.</li>
            <li> This Polish was AWESOME going into my second week with this manicure  and no chips!</li>
            <li> Frequent compliments on this color after manicures made me find my own on Amazon.  Love it.</li>
            <li> A really beautiful color is a mix of orange and red  looks like the picture .This color is fine for anytime of year looks great on and last along time without chipping.</li>
            <li> Great color for the summer. Can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI</li>
            <li> My summer favorite coIor.</li>
            <li> This bottle of polish contained polish that was too thick. Indicates, I would guess, that it&#x27;s an old bottle. It took forever to get to me, which I was surprised, since it&#x27;s just a tiny bottle of polish - perhaps it grew old on the way - ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll be able to use this bottle for long unless I find a way to thin it out, which I should not have to do to a brand new bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, OPI products are usually wonderful, and this color is perfect for summer! A nice orangey-red.</li>
            <li> Love it. It is such a popular color that the salons are out of stock sometimes. I decided to get my own and carry it with me.</li>
            <li> I have used this color for years and it is one of the original OPI colors that has lasted the test of time and popular use.  I would not trade it for any other color.  Long lasting and stays on longer than any other brand I have tried.  Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I am in love with this color. I think it just replaced Jade is the New Black as my favorite OPI color!  It is  vibrant red with a hint of orange. It is not a neon but it is such a powerful color!   It applies really smoothly, and I only needed two coats for perfect coverage. Had i been lazy I could have only used one coat and it would have been fine.  The best part: 0 chipping in 5 days!    I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Perfect color.(Google it) Exactly what you would expect. Opi also seems to last longer than other polishes so that is how I justify the higher price for it.</li>
            <li> OPI as far as I&#x27;m concerned is the best nail polish you can buy and this color is my favorite. Cajun Shrimp</li>

            <li> I love OPI, but not easy to find in my small Southern town. This color came out on Pinterest, and I had to have it! No problem. Amazon to the rescue!

            <li> Arrived right on time with great packaging so it wasn&#x27;t damaged! I bought this for a mani/pedi kit for my stepmom. Cajun Shrimp is her favorite shade and the nail salon we go to doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say anything about the quality yet since it&#x27;s a Christmas gift, but as it&#x27;s OPI I expect it to be great!&lt;br /&gt;I will update once she uses it.</li>
            <li> Love this color and love to have my own bottle at home.</li>
            <li> Such a fun color for summer! Doesn&#x27;t clump and dries quickly!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI and this color is bright and fun for summer. Love them on my toes!</li>
            <li> The perfect color. Arrived on time also. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a vibrant must have red! The happy color will compliment all skin tones. The seller was outstanding by shipping immediately so I received 4 days earlier than expected by using standard shipping.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite nail color! It&#x27;s the perfect shade of red with a hint of orange/mandarin. I get complemented regularly when I wear it. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> My favorite color in the OPI collection. I carry the bottle with me to my mani and pedi just in case they don&#x27;t have it on hand. It&#x27;s a great color for a bikini or to brighten your spirits during a cold winter.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear red/orange colors, but I really like this color. I&#x27;m currently wearing it on my nails and toes.</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with OPI products.  I wear my natural nails, so I&#x27;ve had trouble with nail polish peeling after 24 hours, even when done professionally. I noticed a customer at the hair salon and asked her about her nail polish.  She told me OPI Cajun Shrimp.  As soon as I got home I went to Amazon to order.  I really like the staying power of OPI.  The Cajun Shrimp is fabulous against my complexion.  I am African American, with pecan complexion, plus I get a kiss of color from the sun.  Love the contrast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> This color is a beautiful!  Cajun shrimp is bright red/orange color that brightens my day when I wear it. Takes me back to Nawlins!</li>
            <li> I love the color. Only color I wore all summer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with a classic OPI color!</li>
            <li> It is my favorite polish ever!</li>
            <li> Best nail polish in the world! Doesn&#x27;t chip and you really can&#x27;t even get nervous and pick at it and have it peel away like other polishes I&#x27;ve used. Great product, great dealer.</li>
            <li> I randomly used this color polish when I got a pedicure at a nail salon and fell in love with it. I finally got the name of it and found it on Amazon and bought it. I have worn it a couple times since I bought it less then a month ago. So happy.</li>
            <li> I love OPI polish. I saved a few dollars ordering the product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.  I love this color especially in the summer!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color. I wear it in the summer and I wear it in the winter. It&#x27;s the perfect red/orange/coral color and compliments any skin tone. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 years or more now and it&#x27;s just about time to purchase a new one. I&#x27;ve never repurchased a nail polish before but I can see myself wearing this color forever!! A must have.</li>
            <li> This is a fun, summer color.  While OPI lists this in their orange color range, it&#x27;s definitely more red with a tinge of coral. Side-by-side with the Coca-Cola red, this color is more coral by a two, maybe three shades. It reminds me of more of a poppy red. It&#x27;s a pretty, creamy shade with complete coverage in two coats, but it&#x27;s not quite as shrimp colored as The OPI website led me to believe. I use the OPI natural basecoat on my nails to prevent any color staining, followed by two coats of color and then a topcoat.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this color on my chocolate skin!</li>
            <li> I recently had a pedicure at a salon using this color, and I just knew that i had to buy it!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is the one used at my favorite nail boutique.  It lasts longer than any of the garbage sold in the stores.</li>
