            <li> Its a little pricey for me, I live out side the USA and where I live</li>
            <li> If your skin dries out really easily or is dry by nature</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling to dry or itchy.</li>
            <li> these are smaller bars than the ones you typically see on a retail shelf.</li>
            <li> , only complaint that I have is that I wish it came in bigger bars and that they lasted longer.</li>
            <li> RECEIVED PRODUCT IN A TIMELY MANNER, AND IT IS WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE.</li>
            <li> I guess I have to look harder in my area to find them</li>
            <li> This product although small is a concentrated soap compared to the other Us detol soaps, the color alone stands out.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to lather up</li>
            <li> It does have the Dettol scent but too small.</li>
            <li> I am really not satisfied</li>
            <li> These bars are so small...</li>
            <li> This &amp; the Other soap from the same company smelled so bad we had to put them in the garage till we could return them</li>
            <li> In turn, I grew up on Dettol for all my scrapes and bruises, although it is hard to find here in the US.</li>
            <li> Now I understand the other reviewer&#x27;s complaint that the bars were expensive.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with it.</li>
            <li> we can afford to buy wholesale product, its so expensive.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The package says Original, however this is not the original. The original did not include an orange scent or colour. It does have the Dettol scent but too small. I was going through the soap at record speed.</li>
            <li> Dettol soap is great for acne. Recommend for teens. After several trips to dermatologist for teen ,this was recommended by a friend and works very well. Have introduced it to many friends over 15yyrs.</li>
            <li> This &amp; the Other soap from the same company smelled so bad we had to put them in the garage till we could return them</li>
            <li> This soap is the one to take swimming!  It is the only one I have found that cuts swimming pool chlorine.  Not a beauty bar but it does the job!</li>
            <li> Bought the soaps for my sister and she is very pleased with them..</li>
            <li> It definitely is the Dettol soap my husband loves (more orange color and stronger scent than the Middle Eastern version). However, I expected full-size bars and these were a bit larger than travel size, making them go from being a great deal to expensive. Now I understand the other reviewer&#x27;s complaint that the bars were expensive. Hence, the 3 stars. The bars do last longer than American deodorant soaps, though. I lined up the Dettol bar next to an American bar of Safeguard, which is longer and thicker for comparison.</li>
            <li> It is a fairly good product, but does not compare to DETTOL itself.  I can fully understand why it is made in India rather than the United Kingdom, as it just not in the same category as the antiseptic.</li>
            <li> Its a little pricey for me, I live out side the USA and where I live we can afford to buy wholesale product, its so expensive.  But I better get this Dettol Soap were I live instead of amazon.  Amazon price actually 0.30Cent more then where I live plus I have to pay to get it ship, no I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> These are the real deal from what I purchased on the shelf in South Africa which is exactly what I was looking for.  They are the size stated however from a perspective these are smaller bars than the ones you typically see on a retail shelf.</li>
            <li> If your skin dries out really easily or is dry by nature I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this soap, but if not then this a very great everyday soap that will keep your skin squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this one until my husband kept talking about it.Although it does have an anseptic smell it works wonders and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling to dry or itchy. I use this everyday and I&#x27;ve gotten used to the smell now, only complaint that I have is that I wish it came in bigger bars and that they lasted longer. THis is a truly great product and happy to have found it!</li>
            <li> Jx perfect ...fast delivey</li>
            <li> My mother was born and raised in a former British colony, so she grew up on Dettol. In turn, I grew up on Dettol for all my scrapes and bruises, although it is hard to find here in the US. I still keep a bottle of the liquid antseptic on hand for cleaning and such, but I wanted a gentler version to use at bath time. The soap is great!</li>
            <li> Mostly island ppl will understand. .this soap is fantastic...especially for use after menstrual cycle...very good anti bacterial soap</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this soap everywhere, I am glad i finally found it and for a great price</li>
            <li> Great soap! I love it so much. I&#x27;ve always used it I&#x27;m Tanzania nut I never knew it was available online. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the purchase that I made.</li>
            <li> RECEIVED PRODUCT IN A TIMELY MANNER, AND IT IS WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE. GREAT ANTI BACTERIAL SOAP SENSITIVE ENOUGH FOR SKIN, BUT ALSO FIGHTS BACTERIA.</li>
            <li> You send me expired soup which was pretty small. I was not happy with it. I am really not satisfied</li>
            <li> Amazing I really like it</li>
            <li> Let me tell u that i have acne problems and this baby is sooooooo great in helping me tame them. For me i use it after i wake up to scrub my face and before i sleep and holla my acne has gone down great deal. But i have to keep the routine up it&#x27;s like a controller for it. I love this product n is an essential to my life.</li>
            <li> The best antibacterial soap on the Market today!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my and my pubescent son&#x27;s skin!</li>
            <li> My husband always talked about this soap. I had never heard of it, but when I saw it online I decided to surprise my husband with it. Out of curiosity I decided to use it myself. My skin feels cleaner and clear. Did I mention that the product arrived in two days? Definitely a purchase worth making.</li>
            <li> This Dettol product is okay, it does smell good and it is refreshing  however,  It was a little hard to lather up</li>
            <li> It takes a while to finish this soap..&lt;br /&gt;It good. Only issue is the smell, not so good.&lt;br /&gt;Well, thats normal coz its dettol</li>
            <li> These bars are so small...These are like hotel bars..I guess I have to look harder in my area to find them</li>
            <li> This product although small is a concentrated soap compared to the other Us detol soaps, the color alone stands out.  It disinfects and cleans the body really well, especially great for females during that time of the month.</li>
