            <li> Small...does not fit my adult size head.</li>
            <li> Very small- fits my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> stark white also took it out of the package and immediately came unknotted, its an unusable mess.</li>
            <li> Although, it does run a little small so order the next size up.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little tight and can ache after prolonged wear.</li>
            <li> but then when I put it on it was kinda of tight</li>
            <li> The material is a bit slick and it fits tight, so it has a tendency to slip off and not stay in place.</li>
            <li> Additionally the lace is so thin it&#x27;s falling apart.</li>
            <li> Practically impossible to adjust to make like the picture.</li>
            <li> It was crap when it came out of the mail.</li>
