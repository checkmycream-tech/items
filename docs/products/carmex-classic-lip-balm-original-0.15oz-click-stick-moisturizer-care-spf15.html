            <li>Super duper, works great!</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else on the market, 3 pack is great for having one in the car, in the house and in the office.</li>

            <li>l love this product!</li>
            <li>this is truly an AMAZING product.  </li>
            <li>I heard someone mention how nice this chap stick is for chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>At this point, you&#x27;re on your own my friend.  </li>
            <li>I heard so many good things about it</li>
            <li>Carmex seems to work the best in conjunction with a good cream (for above the lips).</li>
            <li>Excellent product one of the best for dry chapped lips and highly recommend the brand and its products</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have tried it this winter and love it.  </li>
            <li>and/or even better</li>
            <li>just couldn&#x27;t find it at Target any more.  </li>
            <li>Glad you have it</li>
            <li>Carmex sticks make my lips feel more hydrated than the competitors while protecting from sun damage.</li>
            <li>the stick is 100% better than the squeeze tube.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve had a better lip balm.</li>
            <li>Try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li>Make sure your package says &amp;#34;original lip balm&amp;#34; on it or it isn&#x27;t the one</li>
            <li>Simply put Carmex is the best lip balm on the market for me !</li>
            <li>A 6, 9, or 12-pack would be a better investment for me.</li>
            <li>We love Carmex.  </li>
            <li>Always my favorite.</li>
            <li>Arrived.it was ok</li>
            <li>I have never had so many form at once before.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm.  </li>
            <li>One of the ingredients is salicylic acid which just drys out your lips even more.  </li>
            <li>you guys have better luck, ending up with the version that&#x27;s made with the formula you prefer.</li>
            <li>I love Carmex and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>Love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>I like Carmex better because of the more convenient packaging size and the smell.</li>
            <li>Anyway I am glad I tried this one.</li>
            <li>Now they are always smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>and i LOVE applying it before i go to sleep</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there is some kind of medication in this chap stick that helps the lips heal quickly and stops pain.</li>
            <li>but then you need to keep using it more and more often because the smooth lips just don&#x27;t stay.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Smell can be a bit strong, but protects lips</li>
            <li>I grew up in New England using this product and always had good results.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite lip balm ever and has best performance on healing those dry chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>There is no smell or taste, and it glides on really smoothly and instantly my lips feel great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She&#x27;s a huge lip balm person.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips really smooth and prevents them from chapping.</li>
            <li>is it contains ingredients that degrade into free radicals when exposed to sunlight</li>
            <li>do these companies feel the need to use ingredients that create free radicals?</li>
            <li>Unless you enjoy chapt lips then do not buy.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, stays on and has sun screen.</li>
            <li>The rotating stick style is my favorite because it is much thicker than the tube version and has easy application.  </li>
            <li>i have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees original for years, but it did not work as well as Carmex.  </li>
            <li>The original for a reason.</li>
            <li>B001KYTQ8W Carmex - Lip Moisturizing Tube, Original Balm - 0.35 Oz (3-Pack)]]</li>
            <li>Based on the picture for this product, I thought I was going to get the ORIGINAL Carmex formula in stick form.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find the original formula (Camphor 1.7% Menthol 0.7% Phenol 0.4%)in stores, which is why I tried to find it online.</li>
            <li>So at first you use it and the lips get better</li>
            <li>As I entered my teenage years I loved how well Carmex worked, but was kind of irked by the sticking my finger in this sticky stuff repeatedly, most of the time not even had washed my hands recently...</li>
            <li>Plus, y&#x27;know, it&#x27;s from Wisconsin so far superior than the other brands. :p</li>
            <li>i tried many others but none gives this warm sensations and keeps the lips well hydrated for so long</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about Carmex lip balm.  </li>
            <li>If you want a great long lasting cheap product Carmex is for you,it has this amazing smell of vanilla</li>
            <li>Fast delivery of new product in good condition.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t regularly use chap stick, but this kind seems to work great for healing chapped and sore lips that would have taken a long time without it.  </li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer to use in a dry climate and especially during winter months.</li>
            <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t care less about the sunscreen part of it, I&#x27;m just glad that my lips don&#x27;t look like a bleeding, molting lizard.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find the sticks in stores near me, so glad to see them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the mediciny feel and taste</li>
            <li>Whenever I smiled my lips actually cracked and bled.</li>
            <li>It has SPF 15+ for those summer months, and great healing power for both the summer and harsh Wisconsin winters!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s already tons of healthy alternatives but companies still use the free radical creating chemicals which are harder to produce.</li>
            <li>-so when i wake up its smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>The new formula (Avobenzone 2.5% Octisalate 3% Homosalate 5% Octocrylene 4%) is all sunscreen and is nothing like the original formula.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted and what I ordered</li>
            <li>(so it has the same problem as most sunblocks on the market).</li>
            <li>Exact.</li>
            <li>I was returning home on a flight recently and noticed that two blisters were forming on my top lip</li>
            <li>But she said her current tube of the stuff was about to run out, so she needed more.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling of Carmex on my chapped lips, but have recently been warned about this product.</li>
            <li>However, the evaluation is lower due to the fact that the mouth does not taste very pleasant (bitter).</li>
            <li>They have all consistently suggested NOT using products that contain menthol or camphor as Carmex does since they can actually dry out your lips even more.</li>
            <li>Glad we only bought a 3-pack instead of a much bigger box (which I almost did, just to make sure she was well-stocked on her new favorite).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps lift soft &amp; protected,  and doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there is some product specifically for chapped hands, but I&#x27;ll certainly be using this when I have chapped hands until I find</li>
            <li>I would certainly switch to a healthier lip balm if it was for sale.</li>
            <li>This little stick is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing and it does the job.</li>
            <li>lips get absolutely destroyed in winter from the lack of humidity.</li>
            <li>but the waxy taste has really started to bother me.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to find in stores near me so find it here has made me very happy.</li>
            <li>Works much better for me than other lip balms I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love these lip balms, every other brand dries out my lips</li>
            <li>You definitely want the original formula.  </li>
            <li>I once thought that all lip balms are pretty much the same, but this one definitely stands above the rest - and for a nice price.</li>
            <li>This item is great, but its so damn hard to find in a physical store location.</li>
            <li>I read the description up top, which says it&#x27;s for athletes, but it definitely fits my laid back lifestyle, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the cheap sticks, the expensive sticks, the trendy sticks and the girly-girl stuff.</li>
            <li>Hard to find sometimes, so I love stocking up!</li>
            <li>I assume it can be some individual feeling (many times chip lipsticks do same for me).</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I found it in Dollar Tree store after I ordered it from Amazon which means I spent more.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Not bad but very very strange.</li>
            <li>She announced one day she had found a new favorite, and this plain Carmex was it.</li>
            <li>My lips used to be super dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been to hell, but I imagine that it&#x27;s a pretty similar experience.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, while my lips felt great when I first used it, they would never really heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the only one that stays on for more than a half hour.  </li>
            <li>Love this lip balm, hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since switched to it completely.</li>
            <li>The closest so far would have to be the Banana Boat</li>
            <li>/&gt;Carmex lip balm keeps my lips feels moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>Lips soft.</li>
            <li>No mess</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t take long for her to announce that she doesn&#x27;t like it as much as the other tube she&#x27;d had when she previously decided Carmex was her new favorite.</li>
            <li>I put some on last night where my lips were chapped and they feel perfectly normal today.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple days use of Carmex, my lips were almost completely back to normal.</li>
            <li>I have really dry lips all the time, and find this chapstick really helps  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently on Accutane (really dries out lips) and this is the ONLY thing that works!</li>
            <li>It is cracked right in the center and very deep.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic that&#x27;s been around a long time....</li>
            <li>By chance a found this old friend at CVS and had instant relief and healed lips within 24 hours thank goodness.</li>
            <li>First off, it has camphor and methanol, which is not only toxic for you, they leave your lips extremely chapped.</li>
            <li>Soon you&#x27;ll find yourself doing dirty favors in back alleys just so you can afford some narcotics so you can drift off and dream that you still have the sweet smooth lips of your youth.  </li>
            <li>I live in Saudi Arabia and always suffered with dry lips.</li>
            <li>For the first time in over ten years, the deep crack in the center of his lower lip is actually HEALING!!!!!  </li>
            <li>also used this chap stick on hands they had very bad cracks from washing dishes, the next morning they felt much better and the cracks were visibly better.  </li>
            <li>Where I live, it&#x27;s generally warm and humid, but during the winter months the weather gets particularly cold and dry.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t bother some people, but my lips are very dry and sensitive to start with</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t imagine living without Carmex, and the sticks are much easier and cleaner to use than the little tubs or tubes.</li>
            <li>The new version of this lip balm also has the same problem, since they basically decided to copy the same recipe that all the other lip balm manufacturers are using (which is a damn shame).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In retrospect it was a bad deal price wise.</li>

            <li> The original for a reason.</li>
            <li> B001KYTQ8W Carmex - Lip Moisturizing Tube, Original Balm - 0.35 Oz (3-Pack)]]</li>
            <li> Based on the picture for this product, I thought I was going to get the ORIGINAL Carmex formula in stick form.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find the original formula (Camphor 1.7% Menthol 0.7% Phenol 0.4%)in stores, which is why I tried to find it online.</li>
            <li> So at first you use it and the lips get better</li>
            <li> As I entered my teenage years I loved how well Carmex worked, but was kind of irked by the sticking my finger in this sticky stuff repeatedly, most of the time not even had washed my hands recently...</li>
            <li> Plus, y&#x27;know, it&#x27;s from Wisconsin so far superior than the other brands. :p</li>
            <li> i tried many others but none gives this warm sensations and keeps the lips well hydrated for so long</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about Carmex lip balm.  </li>
            <li> If you want a great long lasting cheap product Carmex is for you,it has this amazing smell of vanilla</li>
            <li> Fast delivery of new product in good condition.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regularly use chap stick, but this kind seems to work great for healing chapped and sore lips that would have taken a long time without it.  </li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer to use in a dry climate and especially during winter months.</li>
            <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t care less about the sunscreen part of it, I&#x27;m just glad that my lips don&#x27;t look like a bleeding, molting lizard.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find the sticks in stores near me, so glad to see them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the mediciny feel and taste</li>
            <li> Whenever I smiled my lips actually cracked and bled.</li>
            <li> It has SPF 15+ for those summer months, and great healing power for both the summer and harsh Wisconsin winters!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s already tons of healthy alternatives but companies still use the free radical creating chemicals which are harder to produce.</li>
            <li> -so when i wake up its smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> The new formula (Avobenzone 2.5% Octisalate 3% Homosalate 5% Octocrylene 4%) is all sunscreen and is nothing like the original formula.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted and what I ordered</li>
            <li> (so it has the same problem as most sunblocks on the market).</li>
            <li> Exact.</li>
            <li> I was returning home on a flight recently and noticed that two blisters were forming on my top lip</li>
            <li> But she said her current tube of the stuff was about to run out, so she needed more.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of Carmex on my chapped lips, but have recently been warned about this product.</li>
            <li> However, the evaluation is lower due to the fact that the mouth does not taste very pleasant (bitter).</li>
            <li> They have all consistently suggested NOT using products that contain menthol or camphor as Carmex does since they can actually dry out your lips even more.</li>
            <li> Glad we only bought a 3-pack instead of a much bigger box (which I almost did, just to make sure she was well-stocked on her new favorite).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps lift soft &amp; protected,  and doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there is some product specifically for chapped hands, but I&#x27;ll certainly be using this when I have chapped hands until I find</li>
            <li> I would certainly switch to a healthier lip balm if it was for sale.</li>
            <li> This little stick is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing and it does the job.</li>
            <li> lips get absolutely destroyed in winter from the lack of humidity.</li>
            <li> but the waxy taste has really started to bother me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find in stores near me so find it here has made me very happy.</li>
            <li> Works much better for me than other lip balms I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love these lip balms, every other brand dries out my lips</li>
            <li> You definitely want the original formula.  </li>
            <li> I once thought that all lip balms are pretty much the same, but this one definitely stands above the rest - and for a nice price.</li>
            <li> This item is great, but its so damn hard to find in a physical store location.</li>
            <li> I read the description up top, which says it&#x27;s for athletes, but it definitely fits my laid back lifestyle, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the cheap sticks, the expensive sticks, the trendy sticks and the girly-girl stuff.</li>
            <li> Hard to find sometimes, so I love stocking up!</li>
            <li> I assume it can be some individual feeling (many times chip lipsticks do same for me).</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I found it in Dollar Tree store after I ordered it from Amazon which means I spent more.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not bad but very very strange.</li>
            <li> She announced one day she had found a new favorite, and this plain Carmex was it.</li>
            <li> My lips used to be super dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been to hell, but I imagine that it&#x27;s a pretty similar experience.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, while my lips felt great when I first used it, they would never really heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the only one that stays on for more than a half hour.  </li>
            <li> Love this lip balm, hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since switched to it completely.</li>
            <li> The closest so far would have to be the Banana Boat</li>
            <li> /&gt;Carmex lip balm keeps my lips feels moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> Lips soft.</li>
            <li> No mess</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take long for her to announce that she doesn&#x27;t like it as much as the other tube she&#x27;d had when she previously decided Carmex was her new favorite.</li>
            <li> I put some on last night where my lips were chapped and they feel perfectly normal today.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple days use of Carmex, my lips were almost completely back to normal.</li>
            <li> I have really dry lips all the time, and find this chapstick really helps  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently on Accutane (really dries out lips) and this is the ONLY thing that works!</li>
            <li> It is cracked right in the center and very deep.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic that&#x27;s been around a long time....</li>
            <li> By chance a found this old friend at CVS and had instant relief and healed lips within 24 hours thank goodness.</li>
            <li> First off, it has camphor and methanol, which is not only toxic for you, they leave your lips extremely chapped.</li>
            <li> Soon you&#x27;ll find yourself doing dirty favors in back alleys just so you can afford some narcotics so you can drift off and dream that you still have the sweet smooth lips of your youth.  </li>
            <li> I live in Saudi Arabia and always suffered with dry lips.</li>
            <li> For the first time in over ten years, the deep crack in the center of his lower lip is actually HEALING!!!!!  </li>
            <li> also used this chap stick on hands they had very bad cracks from washing dishes, the next morning they felt much better and the cracks were visibly better.  </li>
            <li> Where I live, it&#x27;s generally warm and humid, but during the winter months the weather gets particularly cold and dry.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t bother some people, but my lips are very dry and sensitive to start with</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t imagine living without Carmex, and the sticks are much easier and cleaner to use than the little tubs or tubes.</li>
            <li> The new version of this lip balm also has the same problem, since they basically decided to copy the same recipe that all the other lip balm manufacturers are using (which is a damn shame).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In retrospect it was a bad deal price wise.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon it completely by accident and noticed, compared to the chap-stick brand and other lip balms I was using, only on days when I used this one did my lips not get chapped.</li>
            <li> I only need to apply this lip balm 2-3 times over the course of a few hours before I&#x27;m nearly back to normal.</li>
            <li> You will go into a deep depression and you may choose to go back to the carmex, knowing full well that it will just make it worse.  </li>
            <li> I got the new formula, the \\&quot;everyday protecting lip balm\\&quot; which is NOT what is pictured.</li>
            <li> Pretty bad or as my granddaughter says \\&quot;Yucky.\\&quot; However, lack of taste is a small price to pay for going through a Chicago winter free of chapped lips!</li>
            <li> I use it all year long.  </li>
            <li> Received a tube a long time ago in a care package from the US and forgot about it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it smelled strange.</li>
            <li> Carmex is great, but having to get it all over your finger to apply to the lips gets annoying when using the little cansiter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what makes it different from other products, but whatever it is, it is a miracle.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll finally go back to whatever is left of your friends and family hoping to be treated somewhat similar to how you were treated in the past.  </li>
            <li> It protects, heals, and prevents dry, chapped lips with ease.</li>
            <li> My lips regulary get really dry and chapped and when that happens blisters form on my lips.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ve learned to associate dry lip relief with the smell</li>
            <li> If your lips get easily dry like mine get these and don&#x27;t get the ones in the tube or jar.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is the taste.</li>
            <li> Normally the blisters get pretty large and turn into scabs and are itchy and very painful.  </li>
            <li> Accutane works by drying out skin so that less oil is produced in the future and hence, fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li> Every winter I struggle with very dry cracked lips and have spoken with a number of people about how to treat it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used roughly a dozen lip balms and none of them come close to working as well as this one.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from severe dried lips and this has been the only thing that soothe and moisturize my lips.  </li>
            <li> Does good work, but has very bad smell and taste on your lips, every time I use it I feel like I take a sip of gas at gas station….  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no comparison between this and the other brands--not Chapstik, not Burt&#x27;s Bees, not Blistex.  </li>
            <li> I prefer this over all other competitors on the market (i.e ChapStick, Blistex, EOS, Vaseline, BB, EOS, etc.)</li>
            <li> This product melts like butter, a lot easier than other chapsticks.</li>
            <li> It keeps your lips moist and stays on longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, and I think I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> Especially in dry weather.  </li>
            <li> It is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;However, I wont buy it again from the seller</li>
            <li> In the end, you will find yourself down and out.  </li>
            <li> I will not use any other brands of lip balm !</li>
            <li> Has a weird after taste you do not get from normal Carmex</li>
            <li> I even use it on little paper-cuts and things like that.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the stuff in the little pot that forces you to insert your germy finger into the pot and swoosh it around and then smear your finger across your face in order to apply it, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a few packages to have these on hand in the office, my purse, kitchen, car, etc.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this product a few months ago</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;About less than a month !&lt;</li>
            <li> I took Accutane during the winter, so not only was the air cold and dry, but the medication severely dried my lips.</li>
            <li> I like using this vs the little jar I have to stick my finger in!</li>
            <li> I get lazy and let them get chap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in the past and it&#x27;s worked well</li>
            <li> am not satisfied about this item</li>
            <li> These sticks seem a bit softer than they used to, but I prefer them to the tube because you can barely get it out of the tube when is cold out.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t have that weird smell nearly as much as I expected either.</li>
            <li> sisters complained about how it smells</li>
            <li> This time they hardly surfaced at all, they all stayed very small</li>
            <li> The taste is a small price to pay for relief!</li>
            <li> During the years I try everything chap sticks, water to help peel off the dead skin ( which left my lips bloody).</li>
            <li> Because of my difficult skin, I decided to undergo a round of Accutane.</li>
            <li> it is not what it appears to be and because the new formula is terrible.</li>
            <li> I hate when my lips are dry, so</li>
            <li> for me at least i just hate the fact that it&#x27;s not available in my country</li>
            <li> it did nothing to heal a terrible case of chapped lips that I recently suffered with for a week.</li>
            <li> Just wish is wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> My lips chap like crazy!</li>
            <li> (burt bees is horrible).  </li>
            <li> I have horribly chapped lips and used Burt&#x27;s Bees for years in an attempt to heal them.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Carmex is perfect!  It always works.  Always has, always will!  This is the best moisturizer to use in a dry climate and especially during winter months.</li>
            <li> The best for your lips.  My doctor recommended as I do not do well with regular was products.  This is the best of anytihng I tried.  I highl recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Keeps lift soft &amp; protected,  and doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly.</li>
            <li> I grew up in New England using this product and always had good results.  I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bee and although it works great as a moisturizer...it did nothing to heal a terrible case of chapped lips that I recently suffered with for a week. By chance a found this old friend at CVS and had instant relief and healed lips within 24 hours thank goodness. I have read numerous articles that poo-poo this product and/or glorify others, but find that this a must-have  for my  family in the winter. The taste is a small price to pay for relief!</li>
            <li> My dad always had a tub of Carmex in his truck when I was a kid (and he still does!) As I entered my teenage years I loved how well Carmex worked, but was kind of irked by the sticking my finger in this sticky stuff repeatedly, most of the time not even had washed my hands recently... Well, luckily they came out with the tubes which were awesome, but also gunked up sometimes. Then finalllly hey came out with this click sticks! I love them! I&#x27;ve been using them ever since they came out and have been my lip balm of choice ever since. It has SPF 15+ for those summer months, and great healing power for both the summer and harsh Wisconsin winters! I even use it on little paper-cuts and things like that.  Plus, y&#x27;know, it&#x27;s from Wisconsin so far superior than the other brands. :p</li>
            <li> Where I live, it&#x27;s generally warm and humid, but during the winter months the weather gets particularly cold and dry. My lips chap like crazy! That&#x27;s when I pull out this lip balm. I stumbled upon it completely by accident and noticed, compared to the chap-stick brand and other lip balms I was using, only on days when I used this one did my lips not get chapped. I&#x27;ve since switched to it completely. I once thought that all lip balms are pretty much the same, but this one definitely stands above the rest - and for a nice price. I read the description up top, which says it&#x27;s for athletes, but it definitely fits my laid back lifestyle, too. So now my lips are healthy looking even in the winter! You can find it at your neighborhood pharmacy, too. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps with dem Chappy lips and prevents &#x27;tears&#x27;</li>
            <li> Carmex is great, but having to get it all over your finger to apply to the lips gets annoying when using the little cansiter.</li>
            <li> I heard someone mention how nice this chap stick is for chapped lips.  I have tried it this winter and love it.  I don&#x27;t regularly use chap stick, but this kind seems to work great for healing chapped and sore lips that would have taken a long time without it.  I put some on last night where my lips were chapped and they feel perfectly normal today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this chap stick on hands they had very bad cracks from washing dishes, the next morning they felt much better and the cracks were visibly better.  I don&#x27;t know if there is some product specifically for chapped hands, but I&#x27;ll certainly be using this when I have chapped hands until I find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there is some kind of medication in this chap stick that helps the lips heal quickly and stops pain.</li>
            <li> Has a weird after taste you do not get from normal Carmex</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about Carmex lip balm.  There&#x27;s no comparison between this and the other brands--not Chapstik, not Burt&#x27;s Bees, not Blistex.  This is the only one that stays on for more than a half hour.  Don&#x27;t buy the stuff in the little pot that forces you to insert your germy finger into the pot and swoosh it around and then smear your finger across your face in order to apply it, though. That&#x27;s unsanitary and gross.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite lip balm ever and has best performance on healing those dry chapped lips.  The rotating stick style is my favorite because it is much thicker than the tube version and has easy application.  I prefer this over all other competitors on the market (i.e ChapStick, Blistex, EOS, Vaseline, BB, EOS, etc.)</li>
            <li> This product melts like butter, a lot easier than other chapsticks. It makes my lips really smooth and prevents them from chapping.</li>
            <li> My husband has a severly chapped lower lip.  It is cracked right in the center and very deep.  Nothing he tried would heal it.  It has been like that for over ten years, and he has been in constant pain because of it.  We tried everything we could find on the market.  I never saw this product in any store.  Not even prescription medication worked.  But, when I read that an MD recommended this product and claimed it worked just as well as prescription medication and/or even better, I had my doubts but ordered it anyway.  I cannot believe the results.  For the first time in over ten years, the deep crack in the center of his lower lip is actually HEALING!!!!!  He said the pain is minimal now and continues to use it daily and soon it will be healed completely...this is truly an AMAZING product.  I don&#x27;t know what makes it different from other products, but whatever it is, it is a miracle.  If anyone has severe chapped lips, this product WILL HEAL THEM FOR SURE!</li>
            <li> Excellent product one of the best for dry chapped lips and highly recommend the brand and its products</li>
            <li> Same carmex I&#x27;ve used for years....just couldn&#x27;t find it at Target any more.  Glad you have it and I can still use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the chapstick queen. My granddaughter seems to constantly sport chapped lips. I&#x27;ve tried the cheap sticks, the expensive sticks, the trendy sticks and the girly-girl stuff. Carmex seems to work the best in conjunction with a good cream (for above the lips). I also use it in the winter and find my lips don&#x27;t chap! My main complaint is the taste. Pretty bad or as my granddaughter says \\&quot;Yucky.\\&quot; However, lack of taste is a small price to pay for going through a Chicago winter free of chapped lips!</li>
            <li> I have big luscious lips, that need constant care. I get lazy and let them get chap. During the years I try everything chap sticks, water to help peel off the dead skin ( which left my lips bloody). Till one day I came across this product, gave it a try. And now I&#x27;ll never go back, this stuff gently exfoliates the dead skin off and adds moisture. The dead skin comes off so gently that you can slide it off with your finger with no pain whatsoever. To add to that is moisture&#x27;s to the lips leaving you with great supple lips as well as sun protection. I&#x27;m going to continue to use this product forever.</li>
            <li> This item is great, but its so damn hard to find in a physical store location. Thank you amazon for having this. I got exactly what I wanted and what I ordered (3 packs of 3) and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Carmex sticks make my lips feel more hydrated than the competitors while protecting from sun damage.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery of new product in good condition.  These sticks seem a bit softer than they used to, but I prefer them to the tube because you can barely get it out of the tube when is cold out.</li>
            <li> the stick is 100% better than the squeeze tube. keep it at the perfect temperature and it&#x27;s as if you can actually feel a layer of protection covering your lips.</li>
            <li> Came in a pack of three and it was sealed.  Who doesn&#x27;t love carmex??!! Works the best on my lips to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li> I have really dry lips all the time, and find this chapstick really helps  (burt bees is horrible).  Just wish is wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find the sticks in stores near me, so glad to see them on Amazon. I&#x27;ve ordered a few packages to have these on hand in the office, my purse, kitchen, car, etc. Couldn&#x27;t imagine living without Carmex, and the sticks are much easier and cleaner to use than the little tubs or tubes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve had a better lip balm. This little stick is amazing. Try it, you will love it. You will absolutely love it!!! It&#x27;s very soothing and it does the job. I wear a day and a night.</li>
            <li> I was amazed to find this. It is difficult to find in stores near me so find it here has made me very happy.</li>
            <li> Make sure your package says &amp;#34;original lip balm&amp;#34; on it or it isn&#x27;t the one I&#x27;m reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips get absolutely destroyed in winter from the lack of humidity. I&#x27;ve used roughly a dozen lip balms and none of them come close to working as well as this one. The closest so far would have to be the Banana Boat 45 SPF UVB Aloe Vera w/ Vitamin E lip balm, but the problem with that one is it contains ingredients that degrade into free radicals when exposed to sunlight (so it has the same problem as most sunblocks on the market). The new version of this lip balm also has the same problem, since they basically decided to copy the same recipe that all the other lip balm manufacturers are using (which is a damn shame).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my lips are several chapped I only need to apply this lip balm 2-3 times over the course of a few hours before I&#x27;m nearly back to normal. The Banana Boat balm takes over a day to get me back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do these companies feel the need to use ingredients that create free radicals? Shouldn&#x27;t it be obvious that those chemicals shouldn&#x27;t be used? It boggles my mind. There&#x27;s already tons of healthy alternatives but companies still use the free radical creating chemicals which are harder to produce. I would certainly switch to a healthier lip balm if it was for sale.</li>
            <li> Simply put Carmex is the best lip balm on the market for me ! I will not use any other brands of lip balm !</li>
            <li> Carmex in the tube is the only chapstick my family uses. It protects, heals, and prevents dry, chapped lips with ease. The only problem is that a 3-pack is pretty small. A 6, 9, or 12-pack would be a better investment for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic that&#x27;s been around a long time....Because it works.&lt;br /&gt;I try to keep some on hand for DH, and this 3-pack is a handy&lt;br /&gt;way to do so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in the past and it&#x27;s worked well but the waxy taste has really started to bother me.</li>
            <li> We love Carmex.  It is literally the o my lip balm we use.  I buy the 3 packs at the store. If I could buy in bulk, I would.  My Carmex goes everywhere with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carmex lip balm keeps my lips feels moisturized and soft.  I hate when my lips are dry, so I am always reapplying this!</li>
            <li> Always my favorite. Hard to find sometimes, so I love stocking up!</li>
            <li> l love this product! I have been suffering from severe dried lips and this has been the only thing that soothe and moisturize my lips.  i have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees original for years, but it did not work as well as Carmex.  There is no smell or taste, and it glides on really smoothly and instantly my lips feel great.  I can put it on at night and my lip still feels moisturized in the morning.</li>
            <li> Arrived.it was ok I wanted a 3pk not three singles.not as advertised.unhappy .&lt;br /&gt;But I will use it . I will buy from a drug store next time</li>
            <li> In retrospect it was a bad deal price wise.</li>
            <li> Super duper, works great!</li>
            <li> The original for a reason. Smell can be a bit strong, but protects lips</li>
            <li> Exact. Fast shipping. Chip. perfect</li>
            <li> When I was a patient with Kaiser, they used to have this on the prescription counter for purchase so I always had it on hand.  When I saw this three-pack, I jumped on it.  One is on my desk, one my nighstand, and one in my purse.  Works much better for me than other lip balms I have tried.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is also good, my friend said good use. Not only can protect chapped lips, but also has the effect of beautifying the lips, and inexpensive. The future will often come to buy.</li>
            <li> Arrived on-time for Christmas, and all in good condition. Only thing is that they are all individual packages, not 3-packs as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this product a few months ago so I bought some to try.  My lips regulary get really dry and chapped and when that happens blisters form on my lips.  I was returning home on a flight recently and noticed that two blisters were forming on my top lip then the next day I noticed two on my lower lip.  I have never had so many form at once before.  So, I reached for the carmex I had purchased and regulary kept the carmex on my lips.  Normally the blisters get pretty large and turn into scabs and are itchy and very painful.  This time they hardly surfaced at all, they all stayed very small and then they just went away without scabbing.  I am SOLD on this product!  I&#x27;m not crazy about the mediciny feel and taste but WTH, it works!  I have been suffering with this condition for over 50 years and finally found something that actually works!  [[ASIN:B001KYTQ8W Carmex - Lip Moisturizing Tube, Original Balm - 0.35 Oz (3-Pack)]]</li>
            <li> Does good work, but has very bad smell and taste on your lips, every time I use it I feel like I take a sip of gas at gas station….  I assume it can be some individual feeling (many times chip lipsticks do same for me).</li>
            <li> really good price for the quantity received ...  very happy ...</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm.  I use it all year long.  It keeps your lips moist and stays on longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, and I think I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> Based on the picture for this product, I thought I was going to get the ORIGINAL Carmex formula in stick form. But that is not what I got. I got the new formula, the \\&quot;everyday protecting lip balm\\&quot; which is NOT what is pictured. I can&#x27;t find the original formula (Camphor 1.7% Menthol 0.7% Phenol 0.4%)in stores, which is why I tried to find it online. The new formula (Avobenzone 2.5% Octisalate 3% Homosalate 5% Octocrylene 4%) is all sunscreen and is nothing like the original formula. This is getting a 1 star review b/c it is not what it appears to be and because the new formula is terrible.</li>
            <li> Lips soft. It helps. However, the evaluation is lower due to the fact that the mouth does not taste very pleasant (bitter).</li>
            <li> Unless you enjoy chapt lips then do not buy.  One of the ingredients is salicylic acid which just drys out your lips even more.  So at first you use it and the lips get better but then you need to keep using it more and more often because the smooth lips just don&#x27;t stay.&lt;br /&gt;  And that&#x27;s just when the nightmare begins.  Soon you&#x27;ll find yourself doing dirty favors in back alleys just so you can afford some narcotics so you can drift off and dream that you still have the sweet smooth lips of your youth.  In the end, you will find yourself down and out.  You&#x27;ll finally go back to whatever is left of your friends and family hoping to be treated somewhat similar to how you were treated in the past.  But you&#x27;ll soon find out that not one person will want to kiss those snake skin pieces on your face you used to call lips.  If you thought you&#x27;d hit rock bottom before, you were just getting ahead of yourself.  You will go into a deep depression and you may choose to go back to the carmex, knowing full well that it will just make it worse.  At this point, you&#x27;re on your own my friend.  Good luck to you.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s a huge lip balm person. She announced one day she had found a new favorite, and this plain Carmex was it. But she said her current tube of the stuff was about to run out, so she needed more. However, she said she couldn&#x27;t find them in stores anymore for some reason. (By the way, within a week of buying these online, we&#x27;ve since noticed them in stores like Walmart and Walgreens. I guess the local stores replenished their supply after we bought online.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as soon as they arrived, she tore into the packaging and applied the lip balm. Didn&#x27;t take long for her to announce that she doesn&#x27;t like it as much as the other tube she&#x27;d had when she previously decided Carmex was her new favorite. So it seems like the company has used multiple different formulas for making this product, and we unwittingly bought the version she doesn&#x27;t like as much as a different version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, well. That&#x27;s how it goes sometimes. Glad we only bought a 3-pack instead of a much bigger box (which I almost did, just to make sure she was well-stocked on her new favorite).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you guys have better luck, ending up with the version that&#x27;s made with the formula you prefer.</li>
            <li> Good price for a good product my oldest son has chronic chapped lips and this product works real good for him</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm, hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This picture looked like I would get the stick version of Carmex; however, I received the tube version which is like Vaseline... not what I wanted and not what was pictured.</li>
            <li> Received a tube a long time ago in a care package from the US and forgot about it. My wife went through dozens of types of lip balms until I found this lurking in the bottom of a toiletry kit somewhere. She prefers Carmex sticks to all others now, and we need regular shipments to Saigon.</li>
            <li> I love Carmex and have been using it for years.  I love these lip balms, every other brand dries out my lips and I end up applying every 5 minutes. Carmex I only apply 2-3 times a day and my lips aren&#x27;t cracking and bleeding!  These don&#x27;t have that weird smell nearly as much as I expected either.</li>
            <li> I heard so many good things about it so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;First, it smelled strange. Not bad but very very strange. After checking the exp. Date i discovered it ends 10. 2015&lt;br /&gt;About less than a month !&lt;br /&gt;I guess I cant use all 3 before that.&lt;br /&gt;I am not satisfied about this item but i cant return it as I am out of the States at the moment. It is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;However, I wont buy it again from the seller</li>
            <li> Love, love this product.  Smooth, stays on and has sun screen.</li>
            <li> this chapstick is just superior. i tried many others but none gives this warm sensations and keeps the lips well hydrated for so long</li>
            <li> I have horribly chapped lips and used Burt&#x27;s Bees for years in an attempt to heal them. Unfortunately, while my lips felt great when I first used it, they would never really heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple days use of Carmex, my lips were almost completely back to normal. I will ONLY use this from now on.</li>
            <li> Because of my difficult skin, I decided to undergo a round of Accutane. Accutane works by drying out skin so that less oil is produced in the future and hence, fewer breakouts. I took Accutane during the winter, so not only was the air cold and dry, but the medication severely dried my lips. I&#x27;ve never been to hell, but I imagine that it&#x27;s a pretty similar experience. Whenever I smiled my lips actually cracked and bled. The only things I could find to work are Carmex and Aquaphor. I like Carmex better because of the more convenient packaging size and the smell. Some people don&#x27;t like it, but it smells like cherries to me. Maybe I&#x27;ve learned to associate dry lip relief with the smell, I don&#x27;t know. I honestly couldn&#x27;t care less about the sunscreen part of it, I&#x27;m just glad that my lips don&#x27;t look like a bleeding, molting lizard. And also, the formula lasts for a while. Burt&#x27;s Bees Ultra Conditioning lip balm with the silver cap only lasted like five minutes before my lips were parched, but Carmex lasts for about an hour.</li>
            <li> It is always a great product, the best in its category!!</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of Carmex on my chapped lips, but have recently been warned about this product. Every winter I struggle with very dry cracked lips and have spoken with a number of people about how to treat it. They have all consistently suggested NOT using products that contain menthol or camphor as Carmex does since they can actually dry out your lips even more. This doesn&#x27;t bother some people, but my lips are very dry and sensitive to start with and I suggest trying to avoid products like this if you are in the same boat.</li>
            <li> You definitely want the original formula.  This is the best chapstic I have ever used. If your lips get easily dry like mine get these and don&#x27;t get the ones in the tube or jar. I tried the tube and it didn&#x27;t work as well.  Also get it at your local walmart or target.  This is overpriced on amazon becauae i get the 3 packs at target for $3.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Especially in dry weather.  I live in Saudi Arabia and always suffered with dry lips. I have tried all well known lip palms but this product is the only one that solved the problem. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about is its smell.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I found it in Dollar Tree store after I ordered it from Amazon which means I spent more. Anyway I am glad I tried this one. My lips used to be super dry. Now they are always smooth and nice. I&#x27;m buying it again next time.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else on the market, 3 pack is great for having one in the car, in the house and in the office.</li>
            <li> Once you go to Burts Bee&#x27;s chapstick, you will never buy this chemical stick again. First off, it has camphor and methanol, which is not only toxic for you, they leave your lips extremely chapped. Carmex products smell like they were made at a petroleum plant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently on Accutane (really dries out lips) and this is the ONLY thing that works!</li>
            <li> the best there is!!!!</li>
            <li> I like using this vs the little jar I have to stick my finger in! No mess and it works great!</li>
            <li> If you want a great long lasting cheap product Carmex is for you,it has this amazing smell of vanilla and i LOVE applying it before i go to sleep-so when i wake up its smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> for me at least i just hate the fact that it&#x27;s not available in my country&lt;br /&gt;my sisters complained about how it smells but i had no problem with it what so ever&lt;br /&gt;i love it</li>
