            <li>I have been wanting to switch to a good crystal or glass nail file, as they are supposed to be healthier and gentler on your nails.</li>
            <li>good value</li>
            <li>so that was good.</li>
            <li>They are still a reasonably good value, but don&#x27;t think you are getting a high-quality item for a bargain price.</li>
            <li>they are gorgeous.</li>

            <li>Best value by far as well.</li>
            <li>Love love love them!</li>
            <li>GF was very happy with this as a gift, Says they&#x27;re a little on the aggressive side, but they do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find these when our first one disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Too good to be true.</li>
            <li>They do not &amp;#34;saw&amp;#34; my nails--are very smooth.  </li>
            <li>These nail files are very nice to your nails and also pretty.</li>
            <li>And the price is great for a large set.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a glass or crystal nail file because I have read that they are better for your nails.</li>
            <li>I love the variety of sizes.</li>
            <li>and i love them</li>
            <li>they are really smooth!</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I love the range of sizes and how many come in the box.  </li>
            <li>The smaller ones are perfect for filing my son&#x27;s baby nails though and</li>
            <li>Even while the coating is still on them, the results are not that much better than emery boards.  </li>
            <li>My ceramic nail file does a better job.</li>
            <li>Spend the $ to get a better one.</li>
            <li>It would be more helpful if they were rated on roughness so you didn&#x27;t have to feel each to find the one you want.</li>
            <li>Love these glass nail files ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase, there was many of them on Amazon, from many lovely brands, but since I bought everything from shany, I decide to give it a shot on this buffers too.</li>
            <li>Ok for filing</li>
            <li>Set has many colors and sizes to put everywhere you need them.</li>
            <li>The smaller ones are perfect for my purse.  </li>
            <li>I really thought these would be a great deal</li>
            <li>: I just got in a couple from an Ebay bidding, and they&#x27;re much better than these.</li>
            <li>The best nail files I have ever used and enough in the package to share with friends.</li>
            <li>and they do the job :)</li>
            <li>I love crystal nail files.</li>
            <li>I love these nail files.</li>
            <li>Dear better than the old-fashioned type emery boards.  </li>
            <li>and....... :) nice.&lt;br /&gt;They will break though must remember they are glass.  </li>
            <li>You get so many so share them with your friends.  </li>
            <li>FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I love my crystal nail files.  </li>
            <li>Ok I thought I could wait...</li>
            <li>I ordered one of  these a couple of weeks ago and then ordered 2 more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>These are the best glass files I have ever used, I only use glass files.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product and value.  </li>
            <li>They are so much better for the nails than sand or metal files.</li>
            <li>There were so many in the package that I&#x27;ve stowed them everywhere - purse, every room in the house, work - and</li>
            <li>I thought the different sizes will be perfect for home, hand bag and travel.</li>
            <li>and I love using the glass files.</li>
            <li>Am so glad i bought this item along with their 6-piece manicure Tool Set.</li>
            <li>Could of done that better...</li>
            <li>I love using the crystal glass nail file buffer.</li>
            <li>I got these quickly and was very pleased with them when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>Files are good at first</li>
            <li>The quality is pretty good</li>
            <li>Thought I was doing something nice for my wife who hasn&#x27;t been able to find a quality file of this type.we wont be buying any more files without being able to test one first.</li>
            <li>Thought I was doing something nice for my wife who hasn&#x27;t been able to find a quality file of this type.we wont be buying any more files without being able to test one first.</li>
            <li>Plus they are colorful and cute, and each one comes with its own plastic case.</li>
            <li>Love the smooth edges it gives my nails.</li>
            <li>which were more smooth</li>
            <li>These are durable, long lasting, come in many shapes and sizes and best all of a great price for what you get.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re professional quality and come in great colors and sizes.</li>
            <li>I have use the the medium one with the point tip so far and it has work great.  </li>
            <li>I found one of these at a local fair and they cost $10 each!</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>They are easily cleaned with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>(the fine grit on the emery was finer than the glass).</li>
            <li>These wear out more quickly that cheap emery boards.</li>
            <li>The price was very decent and each size comes with it&#x27;s own plastic sheath.  </li>
            <li>The files are wonderful and I can use them on my little girl and not have to worry about hurting her.</li>
            <li>I get calouses on my heels and big toes and the large pedicure files are great for smoothing them out!</li>
            <li>Everybody liked them and they produced better results than those old cardboard style emery board files.</li>
            <li>My wife has experienced the same with the ones she has used.</li>
            <li>You wind up with smooth grooves on the edges that do nothing.  </li>
            <li>Leave the nail edge smooth.</li>
            <li>It was my understanding crystal glass files shouldn&#x27;t ever become smooth, but these did.</li>
            <li>it is just smooth underneath.</li>
            <li>I wondered what the difference was between that and these cheap ones.  </li>
            <li>Some of the filing surface of these files is smooth.  </li>
            <li>After which point, each stopped having any impact and had morphed into a smooth piece of glass.</li>
            <li>HOW CHEAP.</li>
            <li>however so they are not idiot prooof.</li>
            <li>While I was initially pleased with this product, it is only good for one use before it becomes smooth and unusable.</li>
            <li>They smooth and soften and help me to shake my nails just as I like them in between manicures and pedicures.</li>
            <li>makes nails so smooth</li>
            <li>but the largest one, for use on your feet, is still in fabulous shape and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>You get 9 for this price and free shipping (I got this as an add-on from Amazon store).</li>
            <li>Not to mention to the fact that you don&#x27;t have to worry about bending the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>I known longer have to worry about bending the cheap buffer&#x27;s</li>
            <li>beautifull colors, all sizes have the same thickness but are really beautifull and works perfect</li>
            <li>But if you just want to have a nail that you can keep handy for this small tasks, these are great.</li>
            <li>and they worked ok at first,</li>
            <li>If you file your nails more often, you might want to go with a higher quality nail file set.</li>
            <li>Got these in the mail and was sooooooo excited..</li>
            <li>Each one is unique in color and size.  </li>
            <li>Better off spending a little more for a better brand!</li>
            <li>These files seemed excellent when first used, but after a few uses the abrasive is gone.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good quality and seem like they&#x27;ll definitely last.  </li>
            <li>Spend the extra money to get good quality glass files.</li>
            <li>I would not have bought them if I would have known they were only good for a couple uses.</li>
            <li>Which turned out a good purchase, I actually think I made the best purchase, since I bought them at $10, and it almost cost me a $1 for each, I see all others are costing at least $2 each.</li>
            <li>The good ones last forever (or until I break them).</li>
            <li>However, they are all great, work so nicely, and last forever longer than traditional emery boards.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not disappointed but not jumping up and down on a great buy of any sorts.  </li>
            <li>The other nail files were great.</li>
            <li>Each file has its own little vinyl holder which is nice.</li>
            <li>, shes not half as excited as I am, these things are revolutionary!!</li>
            <li>The abrasion comes off to quickly.  </li>
            <li>Super deal.</li>
            <li>These were great when they arrived, but much like regular cardboard files, they quickly lost their grit.</li>
            <li>They arrived fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only glad I bought these because there are so many</li>
            <li>The variety pack is nice cause the different size files fit in my purse, bookbag, kitchen drawer, pencil cup, and bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li>but they wear out quite quickly.</li>
            <li>You get a lot for the price, but they wear out quick.  </li>
            <li>Glass files work quickly and prevent splitting.</li>
            <li>My original one that broke, was much finer!</li>
            <li>They are not etched -- there is some kind of powder coating on the surface that comes off after only a couple of weeks of mild use.  </li>
            <li>These are the differences:  the cheap ones are much thicker.  </li>
            <li>Each file has its own pouch, all 9 came with a same size pouch.  </li>
            <li>Try them they are worth it.</li>
            <li>They did not last I have just my own nails</li>
            <li>This is by far a better nail file that I have used.  </li>
            <li>I finally decided to get some of my own to keep in various places and made nice gifts to my family.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how many were in the package.</li>
            <li>they are ok not very sharp at all</li>
            <li>exactly as described and SUPER FAST shipping</li>
            <li>Decent product and plenty to choose from, so for work, some for home and purse !!</li>
            <li>The texture wore off of these much quicker than I ever thought they would!  </li>
            <li>They are exactly what I have been looking for...</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the different sizes.</li>
            <li>These files are ten times better  </li>
            <li>They are much like emery boards in their effectiveness, but they never wear out!  </li>
            <li>These may deserve a higher or lower review than I gave them since I have nothing to compare them to.  </li>
            <li>My first 1-Star rating in 5 years.</li>
            <li>My first glass nail files.</li>
            <li>and I received enough in the package that I was able to give friends a file to try.</li>
            <li>I also would have liked for the to state the grain on the files-It was hard to tell how fine they were until you started to file with them.</li>
            <li>In fact, I stoped using other types since I started using the glass ones; I even take my own file with me when I go to do my nails in the saloon!&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to file your nails with smooth glass.</li>
            <li>The first time I used them the roughness came right off so that I was left with  smooth glass.  </li>
            <li>It quickly files down your nail, which I LOVE.</li>
            <li>I thought they were permanent, but they wear out pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Keep one in your purse, at work, by your computer and give some away.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast and are exactly how they are described.</li>
            <li>my nails are very sensitive, I need very fine nail files because coarse files just rip my nails apart.  </li>
            <li>The little ones are definitely handy for in my purse though.</li>
            <li>I love glass files, they grind down too long nails quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find good glass files.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if other glass files are etched into the glass, but this seems to be the sand is glued to a smooth glass surface and rubbed off fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>These nail files work very well and my nails have been healthier since using them.</li>
            <li>And these are my real nails not acrylic</li>
            <li>I really like these,.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Much finer than the paper emery boards that I was using before.  </li>
            <li>You absolutely CANNOT beat this deal...</li>
            <li>Cannot believe you could get so much for this price.</li>
            <li>Canceled the whole thing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect too much for the price</li>
            <li>Work very well on my infant.</li>
            <li>I really like crystal nail files.  </li>
            <li>Same quality as the original at a much easier to swallow price, and now I have one for my purse, and my girls purses, and the bathroom</li>
            <li>So much better than other nail files.</li>
            <li>I had to clip off the damaged ends before using a regular Walmart emery to clean up the damage</li>
            <li>These are nice nail files, but don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>I do not know why these are not more popular</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I prefer a little more roughness.</li>
            <li>Filing with it takes little effort and there is no concern in the file concaving under the pressure like most sponge-filled files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now have a file with a smooth finish, not capable of providing the use it was sold for.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite the file lost filing ablity after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I wish I could get my money back, but it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the time and effort.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t return it because paying for the return shipping of the entire set wasn&#x27;t worth it for replacing just one nail file.</li>
            <li>In fact, they made my deformed toe nails almost look normal.</li>
            <li>I work with yarn and fiber and in the winter, my fingertips get dry and keep catching the yarn, so I use an emery board to keep the tips smooth.  </li>
            <li>Thick and wear smooth rather quickly where nail is filed</li>
            <li>My personal favorites are the tiny ones because they are not as thick, so I can maneuver them more easily than the large ones.  </li>
            <li>I bought an expensive crystal nail file a few years back at a fair and loved it.  </li>
            <li>This type of file is new to me and purchased because a friend uses them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to nail work</li>
            <li>There may even be a chance that you may not need to buy new ones for a while, unless you lost or broke them.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t, however, come marked with how rough or smooth the file is.  </li>
            <li>After I ordered the second ones, I started to see what others are talking about, the glass seems to smooth out after a lot of use but for only 88 cents apiece</li>
            <li>They are all too course for natural nails!  </li>
            <li>Not sure that I love them.</li>
            <li>Okay so I run my nail files down fast, which is strange</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already worn down one of the files on both sides so that it&#x27;s smooth and almost not usable now.  </li>
            <li>and it is worn down to smooth glass.</li>
            <li>and I have managed to make over half of them smooth from filing my nails.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was a little more obvious which were the super rough and</li>
            <li>But these have been returned to us by our customers and are clearly unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li>I got these thinking they would have different textures, but they really don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>They are very inexpensive, but don&#x27;t last at all.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;abrasiveness&amp;#34; is completely gone.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time, find another nail files set.</li>
            <li>They are nice to look at but poor quality.  </li>
            <li>I have weak nails that split and peel very easily.</li>
            <li>So far I have used most of them, the texture is pretty solid, doesn&#x27;t seem like the file need to be replaced soon, I already gave the blue and green of the big one to my mom and sister</li>
            <li>I have owned a true crystal glass nail file before, but accidently broke it in half</li>
            <li>I purchased one nail file similar to these for the same price as this whole set!</li>
            <li>I love that I can have a small one for my purse, a medium one to leave at work and a big size for my nail kit.</li>
            <li>These are much more rough than my previous crystal nail file.</li>
            <li>So I have been looking for real glass nail files for a long time now.  </li>
            <li>Now the file has a smooth finish, and is not able function.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it a 4 is because they seem to dull pretty quickly</li>
            <li>I agree with other users first use on one nail removed all the abrasive coating on one side of the file.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid a much higher price at other websites to purchase them.</li>
            <li>They are a bit fragile and can be broken, but if handled properly, they work great and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d say is&#x27;t safe for normal use as you are unlikely to get cut from an accidental breakage.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve found the big ones are one time use - the &amp;#34;scratchiness&amp;#34; fades as it&#x27;s used</li>
            <li>Very helpful  for  rough spots on feet.</li>
            <li>I have only had to use one medium sized one thus far and am saving the others in case this one breaks.</li>
            <li>They are a little different, but not enough to differentiate between coarse, medium, and fine.  </li>
            <li>The grit wore off quickly and they are also thicker than a Crystal file we had in the past.</li>
            <li>They are much rougher than my other file.  </li>
            <li>They are much nicer on my nails than any other ones (metal or abrasive) I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Glass files should be etched, the are covered in abrasives like any other emery board, but the abrasive falls off these much faster.</li>
            <li>I have had glass nail files before and what troubles me about these is that after the initial use, there is a complete degrading of the file, especially over the area just used.</li>
            <li>only qualm will be that if you choose to file under the nail, they are considerable thicker than the space between your nail and the skin, especially if you already have nails that are shorter.</li>
            <li>The pointy ones don&#x27;t work to clean fingernails because they are too thick.</li>
            <li>These are very pretty and fun, but if you have relatively hard nails, they wear out within just a few uses.</li>
            <li>I have natural nails not at all long.</li>
            <li>I got these on black Friday, assuming to get some random colors or sizes, but I actually got 9 pcs, assorted sizes, the small are great for my purse, but keep in mind each size has 3 different textures, I keep the pink in purse, since its smooth, and I used it a finishing file.</li>
            <li>they wear down too fast.</li>
            <li>When I use my Jamberry&#x27;s I finally have smooth tips and less likely to have the tips peels since they are extremely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sharp enough to file properly.</li>
            <li>Also, my stone nail file is able to file down the hard skin on the edges of my nails.</li>
            <li>These nail files work great the first time you use them, but after only a few uses the file lost all of it&#x27;s grit &amp; became useless!!</li>
            <li>Recommend highly and over ever other ones I have purchased!</li>

            <li> I love the variety of sizes, but I do wish they had some sort of marking on them to indicate the grit numbers or even a chart explaining the best use for each file.</li>
            <li> Great value, good product.</li>
            <li> My daughter is in beauty school and absolutley loved these.  </li>
            <li> These glass files are perfect to keep my nails smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to switch to a good crystal or glass nail file, as they are supposed to be healthier and gentler on your nails.</li>
            <li> good value</li>
            <li> so that was good.</li>
            <li> They are still a reasonably good value, but don&#x27;t think you are getting a high-quality item for a bargain price.</li>
            <li> they are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> these were just as good and cheaper.</li>

            <li> Best value by far as well.</li>
            <li> Love love love them!</li>
            <li> GF was very happy with this as a gift, Says they&#x27;re a little on the aggressive side, but they do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these when our first one disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Too good to be true.</li>
            <li> They do not &amp;#34;saw&amp;#34; my nails--are very smooth.  </li>
            <li> These nail files are very nice to your nails and also pretty.</li>
            <li> And the price is great for a large set.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a glass or crystal nail file because I have read that they are better for your nails.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> and i love them</li>
            <li> they are really smooth!</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I love the range of sizes and how many come in the box.  </li>
            <li> The smaller ones are perfect for filing my son&#x27;s baby nails though and</li>
            <li> Even while the coating is still on them, the results are not that much better than emery boards.  </li>
            <li> My ceramic nail file does a better job.</li>
            <li> Spend the $ to get a better one.</li>
            <li> It would be more helpful if they were rated on roughness so you didn&#x27;t have to feel each to find the one you want.</li>
            <li> Love these glass nail files ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase, there was many of them on Amazon, from many lovely brands, but since I bought everything from shany, I decide to give it a shot on this buffers too.</li>
            <li> Ok for filing</li>
            <li> Set has many colors and sizes to put everywhere you need them.</li>
            <li> The smaller ones are perfect for my purse.  </li>
            <li> I really thought these would be a great deal</li>
            <li> : I just got in a couple from an Ebay bidding, and they&#x27;re much better than these.</li>
            <li> The best nail files I have ever used and enough in the package to share with friends.</li>

            <li> You get so many so share them with your friends.  </li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I love my crystal nail files.  </li>
            <li> Ok I thought I could wait...</li>
            <li> I ordered one of  these a couple of weeks ago and then ordered 2 more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> These are the best glass files I have ever used, I only use glass files.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product and value.  </li>
            <li> They are so much better for the nails than sand or metal files.</li>
            <li> There were so many in the package that I&#x27;ve stowed them everywhere - purse, every room in the house, work - and</li>
            <li> I thought the different sizes will be perfect for home, hand bag and travel.</li>
            <li> and I love using the glass files.</li>
            <li> Am so glad i bought this item along with their 6-piece manicure Tool Set.</li>
            <li> Could of done that better...</li>
            <li> I love using the crystal glass nail file buffer.</li>
            <li> I got these quickly and was very pleased with them when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> Files are good at first</li>
            <li> The quality is pretty good</li>
            <li> Thought I was doing something nice for my wife who hasn&#x27;t been able to find a quality file of this type.we wont be buying any more files without being able to test one first.</li>
            <li> Thought I was doing something nice for my wife who hasn&#x27;t been able to find a quality file of this type.we wont be buying any more files without being able to test one first.</li>
            <li> Plus they are colorful and cute, and each one comes with its own plastic case.</li>
            <li> Love the smooth edges it gives my nails.</li>
            <li> which were more smooth</li>
            <li> These are durable, long lasting, come in many shapes and sizes and best all of a great price for what you get.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re professional quality and come in great colors and sizes.</li>
            <li> I have use the the medium one with the point tip so far and it has work great.  </li>
            <li> I found one of these at a local fair and they cost $10 each!</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> They are easily cleaned with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> (the fine grit on the emery was finer than the glass).</li>
            <li> These wear out more quickly that cheap emery boards.</li>
            <li> The price was very decent and each size comes with it&#x27;s own plastic sheath.  </li>
            <li> The files are wonderful and I can use them on my little girl and not have to worry about hurting her.</li>
            <li> I get calouses on my heels and big toes and the large pedicure files are great for smoothing them out!</li>
            <li> Everybody liked them and they produced better results than those old cardboard style emery board files.</li>
            <li> My wife has experienced the same with the ones she has used.</li>
            <li> You wind up with smooth grooves on the edges that do nothing.  </li>
            <li> Leave the nail edge smooth.</li>
            <li> It was my understanding crystal glass files shouldn&#x27;t ever become smooth, but these did.</li>
            <li> it is just smooth underneath.</li>
            <li> I wondered what the difference was between that and these cheap ones.  </li>
            <li> Some of the filing surface of these files is smooth.  </li>
            <li> After which point, each stopped having any impact and had morphed into a smooth piece of glass.</li>
            <li> HOW CHEAP.</li>
            <li> however so they are not idiot prooof.</li>
            <li> While I was initially pleased with this product, it is only good for one use before it becomes smooth and unusable.</li>
            <li> They smooth and soften and help me to shake my nails just as I like them in between manicures and pedicures.</li>
            <li> makes nails so smooth</li>
            <li> but the largest one, for use on your feet, is still in fabulous shape and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> You get 9 for this price and free shipping (I got this as an add-on from Amazon store).</li>
            <li> Not to mention to the fact that you don&#x27;t have to worry about bending the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> I known longer have to worry about bending the cheap buffer&#x27;s</li>
            <li> beautifull colors, all sizes have the same thickness but are really beautifull and works perfect</li>
            <li> But if you just want to have a nail that you can keep handy for this small tasks, these are great.</li>
            <li> and they worked ok at first,</li>
            <li> If you file your nails more often, you might want to go with a higher quality nail file set.</li>
            <li> Got these in the mail and was sooooooo excited..</li>
            <li> Each one is unique in color and size.  </li>
            <li> Better off spending a little more for a better brand!</li>
            <li> These files seemed excellent when first used, but after a few uses the abrasive is gone.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good quality and seem like they&#x27;ll definitely last.  </li>
            <li> Spend the extra money to get good quality glass files.</li>
            <li> I would not have bought them if I would have known they were only good for a couple uses.</li>
            <li> Which turned out a good purchase, I actually think I made the best purchase, since I bought them at $10, and it almost cost me a $1 for each, I see all others are costing at least $2 each.</li>
            <li> The good ones last forever (or until I break them).</li>
            <li> However, they are all great, work so nicely, and last forever longer than traditional emery boards.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not disappointed but not jumping up and down on a great buy of any sorts.  </li>
            <li> The other nail files were great.</li>
            <li> Each file has its own little vinyl holder which is nice.</li>
            <li> , shes not half as excited as I am, these things are revolutionary!!</li>
            <li> The abrasion comes off to quickly.  </li>
            <li> Super deal.</li>
            <li> These were great when they arrived, but much like regular cardboard files, they quickly lost their grit.</li>
            <li> They arrived fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only glad I bought these because there are so many</li>
            <li> The variety pack is nice cause the different size files fit in my purse, bookbag, kitchen drawer, pencil cup, and bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> but they wear out quite quickly.</li>
            <li> You get a lot for the price, but they wear out quick.  </li>
            <li> Glass files work quickly and prevent splitting.</li>
            <li> My original one that broke, was much finer!</li>
            <li> They are not etched -- there is some kind of powder coating on the surface that comes off after only a couple of weeks of mild use.  </li>
            <li> These are the differences:  the cheap ones are much thicker.  </li>
            <li> Each file has its own pouch, all 9 came with a same size pouch.  </li>
            <li> Try them they are worth it.</li>
            <li> They did not last I have just my own nails</li>
            <li> This is by far a better nail file that I have used.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided to get some of my own to keep in various places and made nice gifts to my family.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how many were in the package.</li>
            <li> they are ok not very sharp at all</li>
            <li> exactly as described and SUPER FAST shipping</li>
            <li> Decent product and plenty to choose from, so for work, some for home and purse !!</li>
            <li> The texture wore off of these much quicker than I ever thought they would!  </li>
            <li> They are exactly what I have been looking for...</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the different sizes.</li>
            <li> These files are ten times better  </li>
            <li> They are much like emery boards in their effectiveness, but they never wear out!  </li>
            <li> These may deserve a higher or lower review than I gave them since I have nothing to compare them to.  </li>
            <li> My first 1-Star rating in 5 years.</li>
            <li> My first glass nail files.</li>
            <li> and I received enough in the package that I was able to give friends a file to try.</li>
            <li> I also would have liked for the to state the grain on the files-It was hard to tell how fine they were until you started to file with them.</li>
            <li> In fact, I stoped using other types since I started using the glass ones; I even take my own file with me when I go to do my nails in the saloon!&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to file your nails with smooth glass.</li>
            <li> The first time I used them the roughness came right off so that I was left with  smooth glass.  </li>
            <li> It quickly files down your nail, which I LOVE.</li>
            <li> I thought they were permanent, but they wear out pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Keep one in your purse, at work, by your computer and give some away.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast and are exactly how they are described.</li>
            <li> my nails are very sensitive, I need very fine nail files because coarse files just rip my nails apart.  </li>
            <li> The little ones are definitely handy for in my purse though.</li>
            <li> I love glass files, they grind down too long nails quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find good glass files.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if other glass files are etched into the glass, but this seems to be the sand is glued to a smooth glass surface and rubbed off fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> These nail files work very well and my nails have been healthier since using them.</li>
            <li> And these are my real nails not acrylic</li>
            <li> I really like these,.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Much finer than the paper emery boards that I was using before.  </li>
            <li> You absolutely CANNOT beat this deal...</li>
            <li> Cannot believe you could get so much for this price.</li>
            <li> Canceled the whole thing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect too much for the price</li>
            <li> Work very well on my infant.</li>
            <li> I really like crystal nail files.  </li>
            <li> Same quality as the original at a much easier to swallow price, and now I have one for my purse, and my girls purses, and the bathroom</li>
            <li> So much better than other nail files.</li>
            <li> I had to clip off the damaged ends before using a regular Walmart emery to clean up the damage</li>
            <li> These are nice nail files, but don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I do not know why these are not more popular</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I prefer a little more roughness.</li>
            <li> Filing with it takes little effort and there is no concern in the file concaving under the pressure like most sponge-filled files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now have a file with a smooth finish, not capable of providing the use it was sold for.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite the file lost filing ablity after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I wish I could get my money back, but it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the time and effort.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t return it because paying for the return shipping of the entire set wasn&#x27;t worth it for replacing just one nail file.</li>
            <li> In fact, they made my deformed toe nails almost look normal.</li>
            <li> I work with yarn and fiber and in the winter, my fingertips get dry and keep catching the yarn, so I use an emery board to keep the tips smooth.  </li>
            <li> Thick and wear smooth rather quickly where nail is filed</li>
            <li> My personal favorites are the tiny ones because they are not as thick, so I can maneuver them more easily than the large ones.  </li>
            <li> I bought an expensive crystal nail file a few years back at a fair and loved it.  </li>
            <li> This type of file is new to me and purchased because a friend uses them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to nail work</li>
            <li> There may even be a chance that you may not need to buy new ones for a while, unless you lost or broke them.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t, however, come marked with how rough or smooth the file is.  </li>
            <li> After I ordered the second ones, I started to see what others are talking about, the glass seems to smooth out after a lot of use but for only 88 cents apiece</li>
            <li> They are all too course for natural nails!  </li>
            <li> Not sure that I love them.</li>
            <li> Okay so I run my nail files down fast, which is strange</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already worn down one of the files on both sides so that it&#x27;s smooth and almost not usable now.  </li>
            <li> and it is worn down to smooth glass.</li>
            <li> and I have managed to make over half of them smooth from filing my nails.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was a little more obvious which were the super rough and</li>
            <li> But these have been returned to us by our customers and are clearly unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li> I got these thinking they would have different textures, but they really don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> They are very inexpensive, but don&#x27;t last at all.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;abrasiveness&amp;#34; is completely gone.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time, find another nail files set.</li>
            <li> They are nice to look at but poor quality.  </li>
            <li> I have weak nails that split and peel very easily.</li>
            <li> So far I have used most of them, the texture is pretty solid, doesn&#x27;t seem like the file need to be replaced soon, I already gave the blue and green of the big one to my mom and sister</li>
            <li> I have owned a true crystal glass nail file before, but accidently broke it in half</li>
            <li> I purchased one nail file similar to these for the same price as this whole set!</li>
            <li> I love that I can have a small one for my purse, a medium one to leave at work and a big size for my nail kit.</li>
            <li> These are much more rough than my previous crystal nail file.</li>
            <li> So I have been looking for real glass nail files for a long time now.  </li>
            <li> Now the file has a smooth finish, and is not able function.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 is because they seem to dull pretty quickly</li>
            <li> I agree with other users first use on one nail removed all the abrasive coating on one side of the file.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid a much higher price at other websites to purchase them.</li>
            <li> They are a bit fragile and can be broken, but if handled properly, they work great and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d say is&#x27;t safe for normal use as you are unlikely to get cut from an accidental breakage.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve found the big ones are one time use - the &amp;#34;scratchiness&amp;#34; fades as it&#x27;s used</li>
            <li> Very helpful  for  rough spots on feet.</li>
            <li> I have only had to use one medium sized one thus far and am saving the others in case this one breaks.</li>
            <li> They are a little different, but not enough to differentiate between coarse, medium, and fine.  </li>
            <li> The grit wore off quickly and they are also thicker than a Crystal file we had in the past.</li>
            <li> They are much rougher than my other file.  </li>
            <li> They are much nicer on my nails than any other ones (metal or abrasive) I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Glass files should be etched, the are covered in abrasives like any other emery board, but the abrasive falls off these much faster.</li>
            <li> I have had glass nail files before and what troubles me about these is that after the initial use, there is a complete degrading of the file, especially over the area just used.</li>
            <li> only qualm will be that if you choose to file under the nail, they are considerable thicker than the space between your nail and the skin, especially if you already have nails that are shorter.</li>
            <li> The pointy ones don&#x27;t work to clean fingernails because they are too thick.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty and fun, but if you have relatively hard nails, they wear out within just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have natural nails not at all long.</li>
            <li> I got these on black Friday, assuming to get some random colors or sizes, but I actually got 9 pcs, assorted sizes, the small are great for my purse, but keep in mind each size has 3 different textures, I keep the pink in purse, since its smooth, and I used it a finishing file.</li>
            <li> they wear down too fast.</li>
            <li> When I use my Jamberry&#x27;s I finally have smooth tips and less likely to have the tips peels since they are extremely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sharp enough to file properly.</li>
            <li> Also, my stone nail file is able to file down the hard skin on the edges of my nails.</li>
            <li> These nail files work great the first time you use them, but after only a few uses the file lost all of it&#x27;s grit &amp; became useless!!</li>
            <li> Recommend highly and over ever other ones I have purchased!</li>
            <li> Not sure how often I will use them, but hey, sometimes you do need a large file for different shapping.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> really only work on one side which adds to them just not lasting long.</li>
            <li> 3 small, 3 medium and 3 large glass nail files for that price?</li>
            <li> Right down to the glass in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I thought these would last a long time</li>
            <li> They are durable and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Emery boards never seem to last all that long.</li>
            <li> They work really well, and you can wash them and forget them because they won´t rust or go dull.</li>
            <li> Within a few swipes my nails were horribly damaged, with chipped/chunky edges and layers showing through (it took off more on top so bottom \\&quot;layer\\&quot; could be seen).</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold up for too long.</li>
            <li> Just Don,t File Too Long or by the Time</li>
            <li> They are not as bad as some of the reviews say, but these for sure won&#x27;t last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have used other files and prefer the glass over regular emery boards.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve used ceramic files you never want to go back to the other kinds.  </li>
            <li> Foam, metal, neither work very long.</li>
            <li> I have started my DIY nails since last year, and the only thing was missing in my drawer</li>
            <li> I only trim down and file my nails probably 2 times a month.  </li>
            <li> Taking into account that there are 9 in this set and that it took 2 months to wear down one file, it should last me about 18 months.  </li>
            <li> They are not the same quality as the previous files I purchased.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they do not last real long with heavy duty usage.  </li>
            <li> After one use the files become dull and don&#x27;t actually have any texture left to file your nails with.</li>
            <li> 4 weeks later ALL 6 are dull and without any further use and now residing in the recycle bin.</li>
            <li> And a few extra to give away.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t even last a few months.</li>
            <li> I need a smoothing file to follow these guys, as my nails are rough after I&#x27;ve filed them.  </li>
            <li> Total waste.</li>
            <li> Not real glass files.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews prior because this item is junk and a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> In other words, they are not high maintenance.</li>
            <li> You use them a few times and the file wears down smooth rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of hope based on other reviews for this item.</li>
            <li> and since they&#x27;re glass I don&#x27;t want to throw them out like I do with other files</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other crystal nail files that have lasted for years; these are poor quality and each lasts only a short time.  </li>
            <li> The airports wouldn&#x27;t allow the little one I forgot to take out and tossed it, so be careful if you are flying.</li>
            <li> I buy about 75 items on average annually from Amazon covering a variety of categories.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the wore down really fast.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s down to feel and remembering which color is which.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like fingernails down a chalkboard to him.  </li>
            <li> Clearly, these are fake glass nail files, not high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Ultimately, these files were actually a rip off because they were so lousy.</li>
            <li> One got stepped on and cracked in half.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for something less abrasive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used glass previously.</li>
            <li> Planning to recycle them which I cannot do with the typical emery board.</li>
            <li> The nail isn&#x27;t rough per say, but I usually have to pull out the underskin (/) of the nail and either break it off or file it down.</li>
            <li> These also came with a little plastic sheath for each file so they won&#x27;t grind down the contents of your purse.</li>
            <li> The large ones are actually larger than usual file sizes (but not in a bad way).</li>
            <li> I have to admit i was a little nervous switch to glass knowing i can get 2 or 3 for a dollar that isn&#x27;t glass at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> I keep a little file in my purse and have shared a few of the others.</li>
            <li> The abrasive rubs off after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, don&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> I have thin brittle nails that constantly chip and brake.</li>
            <li> WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE.</li>
            <li> but then all of the &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; part wore off after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and worthless.</li>
            <li> No more flimsy nail files that fall apart or wear out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The disappointment far outweighs any bargain.</li>
            <li> Small on the go.</li>
            <li> but they start to get dull and basically do nothing.</li>
            <li> Hard to get between nail and skin</li>
            <li> The one I carried in my purse is now so dull it&#x27;s unusable after 5 months.</li>
            <li> (I hardly ever paint my nails) but am trying to get into it</li>
            <li> Glass nail files rock so hard.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s not too bad for $8, but my old nail file broke...</li>
            <li> Being one of those naive customers who still deludes herself into thinking that Amazon still has a beating pulse when it comes to quality control,, I went ahead and purchased these.</li>
            <li> Too thick.</li>
            <li> So thick, that I have to work them between the skin and the nail around the edges.  </li>
            <li> I have, in the past, bought even the smallest of these for $10.00 each!  </li>
            <li> UNBELIEVABLE VALUE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed that they all seem to be the same texture though.</li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> not good product, wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item on July, 7, the estimated delivery date was set as late as by Aug, 24th!</li>
            <li> I worked very hard with my one hand.</li>
            <li> Tough glass, but still glass.</li>
            <li> One of the smallest of the nail files arrived broken.</li>
            <li> I was still upset that one came broken.</li>
            <li> I used each file approximately 1 - 2 times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still disappointed and my &amp;#34;wary&amp;#34; barometer for quality products sold on Amazon just went up a few notches.</li>
            <li> I sorry to say these nail files don&#x27;t hold up.  </li>
            <li> Save your money, you can find this lousy quality file at any dollar store.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product and it is past the time they can be returned.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed.</li>
            <li> But I could be using them wrong.</li>
            <li> Don´t be an idiot.&lt;br /&gt;Bought these for my daughter as I got tired of her stealing mine!</li>
            <li> Save your money, you can find this lousy quality file at any dollar store.</li>
            <li> A month or two into using these files, they&#x27;ve become useless.</li>
            <li> another message from the seller -Makeup &amp; Gift shop- saying they failed to ship the item and are now postponing delivery by \\&quot;September 23, 2013 - October 01, 2013\\</li>
            <li> Fail.</li>
            <li> and I find it difficult to tell which is which.</li>
            <li> And they arent half bad either!</li>
            <li> How disappointing.  </li>
            <li> And now I&#x27;m off to buy an expensive one!</li>
            <li> Once the coating is gone they are useless!</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I opted for this set, but it is fake and horrible.  </li>
            <li> FAIL!!!!!</li>
            <li> These files are terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These nail files work great the first time you use them, but after only a few uses the file lost all of it&#x27;s grit &amp; became useless!! Better off spending a little more for a better brand!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite the file lost filing ablity after a few uses.</li>
            <li> exactly as described and SUPER FAST shipping</li>
            <li> What a great deal! I was looking for a glass or crystal nail file because I have read that they are better for your nails. I have weak nails that split and peel very easily. These nail files work very well and my nails have been healthier since using them. You also get different sizes so now I have one to keep in my office, my purse, my house... etc. And a few extra to give away. Plus they are colorful and cute, and each one comes with its own plastic case.</li>
            <li> Very nice nail files. I love the variety of sizes. The work well.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve found the big ones are one time use - the &amp;#34;scratchiness&amp;#34; fades as it&#x27;s used</li>
            <li> Very very very  effective and a great great great price.</li>
            <li> Files are good at first but they start to get dull and basically do nothing. I prefer a little more roughness.</li>
            <li> The abrasive rubs off after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> These are not high-quality files. The pointy ones don&#x27;t work to clean fingernails because they are too thick.</li>
            <li> Too thick. Hard to get between nail and skin</li>
            <li> These suck.  They are one time use.  The grit comes off and all you are left with is a costly piece of glass.  DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> They are wonderful and never wear out.</li>
            <li> My husband bought them for me and i love them they are really smooth!</li>
            <li> Love the smooth edges it gives my nails. When I use my Jamberry&#x27;s I finally have smooth tips and less likely to have the tips peels since they are extremely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love them. Buying them for my girl friends</li>
            <li> My daughter is in beauty school and absolutley loved these.  Great price too</li>
            <li> Love them. Gave one or two to each of my granddaughters.</li>
            <li> So I have been looking for real glass nail files for a long time now.  I thought that I hit the jackpot, and then I get these home.  They are not glass they are plexi-glass, and that is just a fancy way of saying plastic!&lt;br /&gt;I have had them for about 3 months now and I have managed to make over half of them smooth from filing my nails.  I know that the description says that it will never need to be replaced, but I have had to replace them already.  Don&#x27;t bother ordering.  And these are my real nails not acrylic doing the job of killing these pretend nail files.</li>
            <li> They are all too course for natural nails!  My original one that broke, was much finer!</li>
            <li> love the look and worked great</li>
            <li> pieces of crap...barely file and the friction is gone.  Won&#x27;t purchase again...</li>
            <li> these are very handy, I shared them with my sister, &amp; sheimpressed.</li>
            <li> I sorry to say these nail files don&#x27;t hold up.  The abrasion comes off to quickly.  Do one set of filing and the abrasion is gone.  So in my opinion I would suggest look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Great set and selection!</li>
            <li> I got these thinking they would have different textures, but they really don&#x27;t.  They are a little different, but not enough to differentiate between coarse, medium, and fine.  The writing is coming off on one already.  Edit:  The texture wore off of these much quicker than I ever thought they would!  Will not buy again.  The little ones are definitely handy for in my purse though.</li>
            <li> The item was as described and came on time. I love the files and they do a great job on my nails.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Work and look great.</li>
            <li> I recieved the nail files on time. The price is very good! I purchased one nail file similar to these for the same price as this whole set!</li>
            <li> FAIL!!!!! Save your money! I agree with other users first use on one nail removed all the abrasive coating on one side of the file. Now the file has a smooth finish, and is not able function. Save your money, you can find this lousy quality file at any dollar store.Thought I was doing something nice for my wife who hasn&#x27;t been able to find a quality file of this type.we wont be buying any more files without being able to test one first.</li>
            <li> used fingernail file for a week and the abrasive material is gone. it will not file my fingernails at all. this has happened on 2 of the 3 that i have used. My wife has experienced the same with the ones she has used. will not buy them again. waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> GF was very happy with this as a gift, Says they&#x27;re a little on the aggressive side, but they do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I will say this, It&#x27;s nice that for what you pay you get three of each, and they come with their own personal&lt;br /&gt;file covers.</li>
            <li> These were both a hit and a miss at the same time.  I love the range of sizes and how many come in the box.  They&#x27;re good quality and seem like they&#x27;ll definitely last.  They don&#x27;t, however, come marked with how rough or smooth the file is.  I wish it was a little more obvious which were the super rough and which were more smooth but it&#x27;s down to feel and remembering which color is which.  The smaller ones are perfect for filing my son&#x27;s baby nails though and I like having different sizes so I can slip one in my purse or travel bag.</li>
            <li> I had heard about the supposed durability of glass nail files.  These, however, are junk.  They are not etched -- there is some kind of powder coating on the surface that comes off after only a couple of weeks of mild use.  You wind up with smooth grooves on the edges that do nothing.  Even while the coating is still on them, the results are not that much better than emery boards.  My ceramic nail file does a better job.</li>
            <li> One use and it is done.</li>
            <li> I use glass files all the time, but these do not make the grade.  They are not the same quality as the previous files I purchased.  Spend the extra money to get good quality glass files.</li>
            <li> I love these glass files!  They are exactly what I have been looking for... I would recommend them to others...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other crystal nail files that have lasted for years; these are poor quality and each lasts only a short time.  Too good to be true.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty and fun, but if you have relatively hard nails, they wear out within just a few uses.</li>
            <li> These files are terrible.  They are very inexpensive, but don&#x27;t last at all.  Basically, each speck on the file gets used once or twice on a nail before it won&#x27;t file ever again.</li>
            <li> Even in the cases these broke very easily when I carried them in my purse.  The airports wouldn&#x27;t allow the little one I forgot to take out and tossed it, so be careful if you are flying.</li>
            <li> These are durable, long lasting, come in many shapes and sizes and best all of a great price for what you get.</li>
            <li> Super deal. They are a bit fragile and can be broken, but if handled properly, they work great and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, don&#x27;t last at all. I&#x27;ve had glass files that worked for years. These didn&#x27;t even last a few months. The one I carried in my purse is now so dull it&#x27;s unusable after 5 months. Spend the $ to get a better one.</li>
            <li> These are great files. Leave the nail edge smooth. It would be more helpful if they were rated on roughness so you didn&#x27;t have to feel each to find the one you want. I have used other files and prefer the glass over regular emery boards. Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> These were great when they arrived, but much like regular cardboard files, they quickly lost their grit. It was my understanding crystal glass files shouldn&#x27;t ever become smooth, but these did.</li>
            <li> They arrived fairly quickly. I was pleased with the different sizes. Unfortunately, the wore down really fast. I also would have liked for the to state the grain on the files-It was hard to tell how fine they were until you started to file with them.</li>
            <li> These are nice nail files, but don&#x27;t last very long. Thankfully they come in a big set so you have one to replace each with. They seem well made but really only work on one side which adds to them just not lasting long.</li>
            <li> I have only used them a couple times and the filing edge is already gone and it is just smooth underneath. I would not have bought them if I would have known they were only good for a couple uses. I am disappointed in this product and it is past the time they can be returned. I contacted Shanycosmetics.com and they would not do anything because I bought through amazon. Do not buy these files!</li>
            <li> Thick and wear smooth rather quickly where nail is filed</li>
            <li> I really like these,. They do an exceptional job filing my nails and I like that they come indifferent sizes and grades</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold up for too long.</li>
            <li> After one use the files become dull and don&#x27;t actually have any texture left to file your nails with. Was not impressed.</li>
            <li> The nail files wear out with one use.  I am disappointed.  They are nice to look at but poor quality.  I wish I could get my money back, but it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the time and effort.  Save your money!</li>
            <li> Very helpful  for  rough spots on feet. Have used for two months.</li>
            <li> Love these glass nail files .. they do an effective job of shaping nails &amp; leave a&lt;br /&gt;fine edge.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I had a glass file for years, until I lost it.  I wondered what the difference was between that and these cheap ones.  These are the differences:  the cheap ones are much thicker.  So thick, that I have to work them between the skin and the nail around the edges.  The roughness seems to be wearing off.  They are much rougher than my other file.  I need a smoothing file to follow these guys, as my nails are rough after I&#x27;ve filed them.  I&#x27;m only glad I bought these because there are so many, I leave them everywhere, gym, purse, car, work, etc, so I have one in an emergency.  And now I&#x27;m off to buy an expensive one!</li>
            <li> These wear out more quickly that cheap emery boards. The substrate is glass but the grit material is simply glued to it and comes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can deliberately break one of these files with a medium amount of force. Wrap some paper around one, hold in both hands, thumbs together, and push. &amp;#34;Snap!&amp;#34; The broken edges are straight without much fragmenting. So I&#x27;d say is&#x27;t safe for normal use as you are unlikely to get cut from an accidental breakage. Still, I&#x27;d rather have an emery board -- lighter, longer lasting and safer.</li>
            <li> I got these on black Friday, assuming to get some random colors or sizes, but I actually got 9 pcs, assorted sizes, the small are great for my purse, but keep in mind each size has 3 different textures, I keep the pink in purse, since its smooth, and I used it a finishing file. Each file has its own pouch, all 9 came with a same size pouch.  So far I have used most of them, the texture is pretty solid, doesn&#x27;t seem like the file need to be replaced soon, I already gave the blue and green of the big one to my mom and sister so when I hear from them I will update my post. I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase, there was many of them on Amazon, from many lovely brands, but since I bought everything from shany, I decide to give it a shot on this buffers too. Which turned out a good purchase, I actually think I made the best purchase, since I bought them at $10, and it almost cost me a $1 for each, I see all others are costing at least $2 each. I have started my DIY nails since last year, and the only thing was missing in my drawer was the glass nail file. Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> One of the smallest of the nail files arrived broken. I didn&#x27;t return it because paying for the return shipping of the entire set wasn&#x27;t worth it for replacing just one nail file. I was still upset that one came broken. The other nail files were great.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped they would, none of them have&lt;br /&gt;a course enough file to shape the nails.  Ok for filing</li>
            <li> These glass files are wonderful. I&#x27;ve paid a much higher price at other websites to purchase them. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. So much better than other nail files. I have thin brittle nails that constantly chip and brake. These glass files are perfect to keep my nails smooth. The variety pack is nice cause the different size files fit in my purse, bookbag, kitchen drawer, pencil cup, and bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> These files are great and you can take them in your hand luggage on a plane.  I have bought them for my family for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Best nail files ever, glass files never ruin like the others. Set has many colors and sizes to put everywhere you need them.</li>
            <li> Great set.  I bought two.  The rounded edge ones are perfect for flying.  The smaller ones are perfect for my purse.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat these</li>
            <li> I thought these would last a long time but they wear out quite quickly. Once the coating is gone they are useless!</li>
            <li> 3 sizes, 3 grits.  Much finer than the paper emery boards that I was using before.  I work with yarn and fiber and in the winter, my fingertips get dry and keep catching the yarn, so I use an emery board to keep the tips smooth.  These files are ten times better  The price was very decent and each size comes with it&#x27;s own plastic sheath.  Stick them in your purse or your desk and always have a set handy.</li>
            <li> These very strong files do a great job of keeping nails in good shape.  They do not rip the nail, as regular metal files do.  They are much like emery boards in their effectiveness, but they never wear out!  They are easily cleaned with soap and water.  You&#x27;ll never buy another nail file!</li>
            <li> These may deserve a higher or lower review than I gave them since I have nothing to compare them to.  This type of file is new to me and purchased because a friend uses them.  They do not &amp;#34;saw&amp;#34; my nails--are very smooth.  I wish they had come with directions and explanations of the meanings of the colors--if there are any.</li>
            <li> not good product, wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of sizes, but I do wish they had some sort of marking on them to indicate the grit numbers or even a chart explaining the best use for each file.</li>
            <li> The files are not the quality of more expensive glass files.  Some of the filing surface of these files is smooth.  It should be a uniform sanding surface.</li>
            <li> These files were just what I was looking for and there was enough of them to share with my sister.</li>
            <li> This is one of those situations where 2 purchase philosophies apply.1. Too good to be true. and  2. You get what you pay for. Being one of those naive customers who still deludes herself into thinking that Amazon still has a beating pulse when it comes to quality control,, I went ahead and purchased these. 4 weeks later ALL 6 are dull and without any further use and now residing in the recycle bin. I have natural nails not at all long.I keep them short and manicured on a regular basis. In other words, they are not high maintenance. I used each file approximately 1 - 2 times.  After which point, each stopped having any impact and had morphed into a smooth piece of glass. My first 1-Star rating in 5 years. For context and perspective on my purchase history. I buy about 75 items on average annually from Amazon covering a variety of categories. To date for 2014, I am at 98 orders. Some of course contain multiple items. Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE. REGARDLESS HOW CHEAP. The disappointment far outweighs any bargain. Unless of course you need them for 1 time use only ... maybe they ARE advertised as disposable and I missed that part.&lt;br /&gt;Still disappointed and my &amp;#34;wary&amp;#34; barometer for quality products sold on Amazon just went up a few notches.</li>
            <li> I thought they were permanent, but they wear out pretty fast.</li>
            <li> They worked - for a while. The grit wore off quickly and they are also thicker than a Crystal file we had in the past.</li>
            <li> Decent product and plenty to choose from, so for work, some for home and purse !!</li>
            <li> I really thought these would be a great deal and they worked ok at first, but then all of the &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; part wore off after a few uses.  Ultimately, these files were actually a rip off because they were so lousy.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of hope based on other reviews for this item. I have been wanting to switch to a good crystal or glass nail file, as they are supposed to be healthier and gentler on your nails. This files were not. Within a few swipes my nails were horribly damaged, with chipped/chunky edges and layers showing through (it took off more on top so bottom \\&quot;layer\\&quot; could be seen). I filed in one direction, like I do with my emery boards, and even tried all nine (since it claims they&#x27;re all different textures). Each one was equally damaging, imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from these! I had to clip off the damaged ends before using a regular Walmart emery to clean up the damage (the fine grit on the emery was finer than the glass). Clearly, these are fake glass nail files, not high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I just got in a couple from an Ebay bidding, and they&#x27;re much better than these. They give the real smooth edge you&#x27;re supposed to get from crystal or glass nail files.</li>
            <li> The best nail files I have ever used and enough in the package to share with friends.</li>
            <li> good value and they do the job :)</li>
            <li> I love crystal nail files. The good ones last forever (or until I break them). The filing surface on these wore off quicker than any crystal nail file I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I love these nail files. They&#x27;re professional quality and come in great colors and sizes. I love that I can have a small one for my purse, a medium one to leave at work and a big size for my nail kit. They also each have their own protective cover so they&#x27;re great for traveling. There are so many of them too! The only reason I gave it a 4 is because they seem to dull pretty quickly and since they&#x27;re glass I don&#x27;t want to throw them out like I do with other files so I was hoping they would last a bit longer. But I could be using them wrong. I&#x27;m new to nail work (I hardly ever paint my nails) but am trying to get into it so my hands don&#x27;t look like giant unkempt man hands. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I got these quickly and was very pleased with them when I opened the package. The files are wonderful and I can use them on my little girl and not have to worry about hurting her. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought an expensive crystal nail file a few years back at a fair and loved it.  I saw these on Amazon and figured I would try them out from all of the great reviews.  I should have listened to the bad reviews.  They are not as bad as some of the reviews say, but these for sure won&#x27;t last a long time.  I only trim down and file my nails probably 2 times a month.  I&#x27;ve already worn down one of the files on both sides so that it&#x27;s smooth and almost not usable now.  Taking into account that there are 9 in this set and that it took 2 months to wear down one file, it should last me about 18 months.  I guess that&#x27;s not too bad for $8, but my old nail file broke...it hadn&#x27;t worn out.  So, keep that in mind before buying the set.  If you file your nails more often, you might want to go with a higher quality nail file set.</li>
            <li> I have, in the past, bought even the smallest of these for $10.00 each!  They are perfect and have their own plastic sheaths. Tiny ones to file pinkies to giant ones to file big toes!  I buying sets for all my friends.  You absolutely CANNOT beat this deal...hands down!&lt;br /&gt;And the thing is, these things last forever.  You may never buy another file again....unless you lose them like I do.</li>
            <li> Okay so I run my nail files down fast, which is strange considering I dont actually use them all that often. Foam, metal, neither work very long. So I came across these and I thought &amp;#34;glass huh? That sounds genius &amp;#34; I figured what have I got to lose? I ordered a set and Holy Balls! I got NINE! I will never run out! And they arent half bad either! 3 small, 3 medium and 3 large glass nail files for that price? Yes every time. Im sending one of each size to my best friend, shes not half as excited as I am, these things are revolutionary!! Glass nail files rock so hard. -Eva</li>
            <li> If you´ve never used a glass nail file, you´re in for a treat. They work really well, and you can wash them and forget them because they won´t rust or go dull. They are glass however so they are not idiot prooof. Don´t be an idiot.&lt;br /&gt;Bought these for my daughter as I got tired of her stealing mine! Also gave a set away to a proffesional manicurist. Now I have a friend for life.</li>
            <li> One fund, but does not have the two pieces where why</li>
            <li> Great value, good product. These files were as described and arrived promptly. I would recommend them. The do a great job</li>
            <li> While I was initially pleased with this product, it is only good for one use before it becomes smooth and unusable. I have had glass nail files before and what troubles me about these is that after the initial use, there is a complete degrading of the file, especially over the area just used. It&#x27;s cheap and worthless.</li>
            <li> These are great, great, great!  Dear better than the old-fashioned type emery boards.  And I use them and I have cerebral palsy. I worked very hard with my one hand. They smooth and soften and help me to shake my nails just as I like them in between manicures and pedicures. I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if other glass files are etched into the glass, but this seems to be the sand is glued to a smooth glass surface and rubbed off fairly quickly. I would have rather purchased one glass nail file.</li>
            <li> I found one of these at a local fair and they cost $10 each! I got one though because my husband liked it.  He can&#x27;t STAND to use a metal file on his nails, it&#x27;s like fingernails down a chalkboard to him.  I was so happy to find these when our first one disappeared.  Same quality as the original at a much easier to swallow price, and now I have one for my purse, and my girls purses, and the bathroom and....... :) nice.&lt;br /&gt;They will break though must remember they are glass.  One got stepped on and cracked in half.  Didn&#x27;t cut though so that was good. Tough glass, but still glass.</li>
            <li> This is the only file you will ever use if you try it. does not wear out, you can wash it ,and a great gift.</li>
            <li> These files seemed excellent when first used, but after a few uses the abrasive is gone.  Unlike more expensive glass files, these appear to have abrasive particles glued to the glass.  Four or five uses later and it is worn down to smooth glass. They are still a reasonably good value, but don&#x27;t think you are getting a high-quality item for a bargain price.</li>
            <li> One use on one nail removed all the abrasive coating on one side of the file.Now have a file with a smooth finish, not capable of providing the use it was sold for. Save your money, you can find this lousy quality file at any dollar store.Thought I was doing something nice for my wife who hasn&#x27;t been able to find a quality file of this type.we wont be buying any more files without being able to test one first.</li>
            <li> You get so many so share them with your friends.  Makes a great gift with a bottle of polish.  Keep one in your purse, at work, by your computer and give some away.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast and are exactly how they are described.</li>
            <li> AMAZING VALUE! OMG! FLIPPING OUT! Got these in the mail and was sooooooo excited..they are gorgeous. Cannot believe you could get so much for this price. Must have if you&#x27;re trying to take care of your nails at home. FANTASTIC! UNBELIEVABLE VALUE!</li>
            <li> Not sharp enough to file properly.</li>
            <li> No more flimsy nail files that fall apart or wear out after a few uses. These are made of glass and are standing up to a lot of use without showing any sign of dullness. Would highly recommend. Where have these been all my life!</li>
            <li> I went looking for one crystal nail file, and after looking online...these were just as good and cheaper. I do not know why these are not more popular but they should be. I bought this one pack and I have one for my purse, next to my chair, in my nail case, and then extras to boot. Try them they are worth it.</li>
            <li> We thought we were buying quality, lifetime crystal nail files for our massage school bookstore/supply store! But these have been returned to us by our customers and are clearly unsatisfactory. They wear out immediately. Might as well buy emery boards...</li>
            <li> I get calouses on my heels and big toes and the large pedicure files are great for smoothing them out! I keep a little file in my purse and have shared a few of the others. This is a great set!!</li>
            <li> It seems hte different colores are different finenesses but once I figured out which was which it worked as well as more expensive sets</li>
            <li> A month or two into using these files, they&#x27;ve become useless. The &amp;#34;abrasiveness&amp;#34; is completely gone. Total waste. Wish I could get my money back. Don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li> I love my crystal nail files.  My personal favorites are the tiny ones because they are not as thick, so I can maneuver them more easily than the large ones.  However, they are all great, work so nicely, and last forever longer than traditional emery boards.  And the price is great for a large set.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item on July, 7, the estimated delivery date was set as late as by Aug, 24th! Ok I thought I could wait...then on Aug, 24th I finally got...another message from the seller -Makeup &amp; Gift shop- saying they failed to ship the item and are now postponing delivery by \\&quot;September 23, 2013 - October 01, 2013\\&quot; or even later...Canceled the whole thing. Do not waste your time, find another nail files set.</li>
            <li> very nice. makes nails so smooth</li>
            <li> I ordered one of  these a couple of weeks ago and then ordered 2 more for Christmas gifts. After I ordered the second ones, I started to see what others are talking about, the glass seems to smooth out after a lot of use but for only 88 cents apiece I feel like they are practically disposable. They are much nicer on my nails than any other ones (metal or abrasive) I&#x27;ve ever used. I will look for some longer lasting etched crystal ones once these wear out.</li>
            <li> Bought these for the family. Everybody liked them and they produced better results than those old cardboard style emery board files. In fact, they made my deformed toe nails almost look normal.</li>
            <li> Not real glass files. Glass files should be etched, the are covered in abrasives like any other emery board, but the abrasive falls off these much faster.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews prior because this item is junk and a waste of money.  DO NOT BUY!!  I have owned a true crystal glass nail file before, but accidently broke it in half so I had to buy another.  I opted for this set, but it is fake and horrible.  Consider yourself warned.</li>
            <li> These are the best glass files I have ever used, I only use glass files. They are durable and last a long time. I haven&#x27;t had a need to repurchase because they are still good and it&#x27;s been over a year! Love love love them! Recommend highly and over ever other ones I have purchased!</li>
            <li> I rather get these then the ones that don&#x27;t work after the file start braking. I got two sets of these so I could give them as gifts.</li>
            <li> beautifull colors, all sizes have the same thickness but are really beautifull and works perfect</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect too much for the price so I&#x27;m not disappointed but not jumping up and down on a great buy of any sorts.  Yes, they do not last real long with heavy duty usage.  But if you just want to have a nail that you can keep handy for this small tasks, these are great.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product and value.  Once you&#x27;ve used ceramic files you never want to go back to the other kinds.  Best value by far as well.</li>
            <li> they wear down too fast. You use them a few times and the file wears down smooth rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of Crystal nail files at an art fair about 10 years ago. I dropped two and they broke but the largest one, for use on your feet, is still in fabulous shape and works like a charm. These nail files work maybe three or four times before losing their filing ability. I&#x27;ll look elsewhere next time.</li>
            <li> I have no issue with the color, quality, or selection of the files.  They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do without spending an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> I was looking for ceramic files. They are so much better for the nails than sand or metal files. I&#x27;m a little disappointed that they all seem to be the same texture though.</li>
            <li> These are the only type of files I use on my nails.</li>
            <li> They did not last I have just my own nails and I have worn all the sand off them.</li>
            <li> I love glass files, they grind down too long nails quickly and smoothly.  They last forever, too.  So why nine files in a bunch?  Oh well.  These also came with a little plastic sheath for each file so they won&#x27;t grind down the contents of your purse.</li>
            <li> Great size selection. Work very well on my infant.</li>
            <li> My first glass nail files. Love them!</li>
            <li> They dont work as well as I hoped. Was looking for something less abrasive. And they dont last at all!</li>
            <li> Emery boards never seem to last all that long. I don&#x27;t like it when they shred. Thought I&#x27;d try glass. I&#x27;ve not used glass previously. There were so many in the package that I&#x27;ve stowed them everywhere - purse, every room in the house, work - and given a couple away. Very satisfied with how they perform. Planning to recycle them which I cannot do with the typical emery board.</li>
            <li> You get a lot for the price, but they wear out quick.  Right down to the glass in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Hard to find good glass files.  Now I have one for any place I need one!  Glass files work quickly and prevent splitting.</li>
            <li> my nails are very sensitive, I need very fine nail files because coarse files just rip my nails apart.  These files do NOT rip my nails apart.  They are perfect for me!</li>
            <li> This is by far a better nail file that I have used.  It beats the ones sold in local drug stores where you pay about the same price, but only for one nail file.  Each one is unique in color and size.  There may even be a chance that you may not need to buy new ones for a while, unless you lost or broke them.  I have use the the medium one with the point tip so far and it has work great.  Filing with it takes little effort and there is no concern in the file concaving under the pressure like most sponge-filled files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm will be that if you choose to file under the nail, they are considerable thicker than the space between your nail and the skin, especially if you already have nails that are shorter.</li>
            <li> My husband and I purchased one on a trip we took and were sharing it. I finally decided to get some of my own to keep in various places and made nice gifts to my family. Excellent purchase!</li>
            <li> These Nail Files Are Very Good And Durable When in Pouches and they are in Different Colors and when they are together they look Like A Rainbow  and They Do Work you just have to use the Files Like You Would A Regular File Just Don,t File Too Long or by the Time you Know it you Will have Very Short Nails</li>
            <li> they are ok not very sharp at all</li>
            <li> 1) I got these cus I thought the different sizes will be perfect for home, hand bag and travel. The large ones are actually larger than usual file sizes (but not in a bad way). Not sure how often I will use them, but hey, sometimes you do need a large file for different shapping.&lt;br /&gt;2) The quality is pretty good and I love using the glass files. In fact, I stoped using other types since I started using the glass ones; I even take my own file with me when I go to do my nails in the saloon!&lt;br /&gt;3) The PRICE! You get 9 for this price and free shipping (I got this as an add-on from Amazon store).</li>
            <li> Am so glad i bought this item along with their 6-piece manicure Tool Set.I have to admit i was a little nervous switch to glass knowing i can get 2 or 3 for a dollar that isn&#x27;t glass at the dollar store.Not to mention to the fact that you don&#x27;t have to worry about bending the cheap ones.Which was always one of my big concern hen i purchase from the dollar storeAlthough am happy that i switch not only do i get 9 i also get 3 of each in 3 different sizes and colors.Small on the go.Medium perhaps on the go as well.Then the big one for home use and for toes.I known longer have to worry about bending the cheap buffer&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I only received SIX of the NINE files.  How disappointing.  Fail.</li>
            <li> The first time I used them the roughness came right off so that I was left with  smooth glass.  Kind of hard to file your nails with smooth glass.</li>
            <li> Nice but they&#x27;re not labeled with their grain and I find it difficult to tell which is which. Could of done that better...seriously.</li>
            <li> I love using the crystal glass nail file buffer. My nails are always manicured looking and without jagged edges.</li>
            <li> These are much more rough than my previous crystal nail file. Not sure that I love them.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how many were in the package. I have only had to use one medium sized one thus far and am saving the others in case this one breaks. Each file has its own little vinyl holder which is nice. It quickly files down your nail, which I LOVE. The nail isn&#x27;t rough per say, but I usually have to pull out the underskin (/) of the nail and either break it off or file it down. Also, my stone nail file is able to file down the hard skin on the edges of my nails. This one can&#x27;t. Hence, 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I really like crystal nail files.  These are not the highest quality, but they work well and I received enough in the package that I was able to give friends a file to try.</li>
            <li> These nail files are very nice to your nails and also pretty. I will be giving some of them as gifts.</li>
            <li> Im very pleased!  Great price also.  I will be giving these to my bridesmaids as a thank you gift.  I know they will love them!</li>
