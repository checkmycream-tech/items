            <li>I love the smell of the holiday season but don&#x27;t like candles burning all the time.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s such a pleasant uplifting smell!</li>

            <li>I love the aroma of cinnamon and nutmeg, then adding the sweet orange and ginger essential oils to the blend just takes it to the top, making it an exceptional blend of Holiday Essential Oils, which every home would LOVE!</li>
            <li>I have never smelled a blend of oils so unique in nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They come in a nice glass bottle and would be a lovely addition to your essential oils</li>
            <li>I love this  product, smells like christmas,  a large  bottle,  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a unique and warm blend of very festive essential oils that will smell AMAZING to diffuse throughout your home during the winter months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Orange oil is widely known as a “happy” oil.  </li>
            <li>Sweet Orange Oil is used as an anti-depressant, since it has uplifting properties.</li>
            <li>I was offered this Holiday Season Essential Oils Blend from Plant Therapy Essential Oils for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it.</li>
            <li>It is also believed that nutmeg oil improves the quality of your dreams, making them more intense and colorful.</li>
            <li>, I would recommend buying this  holiday season again, such a wonderful blend of different oils,  plant theraphy  </li>
            <li>Love it, definitely will get more of them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, just not what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>This blend is Sweet Orange, Cinnamon Bark, Nutmeg, and Ginger essential oils and the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li>If Christmas, and your birthday, had a wildly romantic love affair and made a baby puppy that was delivered by fuzzy adorable kitten elves wearing feety pajamas, that tiny puppy still wouldn’t smell as good as this Plant Therapy Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>It is also supportive to the immune system and overall well-being.</li>
            <li>This is not for use on your skin so please be aware that you may have an adverse reaction if you don&#x27;t read the uses first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can use this oil in many different ways.</li>
            <li>If you love the holiday season and the aroma that comes with it, then you should definitely try this because even in August your home can smell like the holidays.</li>
            <li>Each bottle is fairly large (this one is really large!)</li>
            <li>use a few drops in my diffuser, and  wow,  smells great throughout the house</li>
            <li>It is high in antioxidants and supports a healthy immune system for overall well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Imagine a cozy morning by the fireplace, soft, warm clothes on, fuzzy socks and a mug of hot apple cider in hand!</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed in the smell.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice smell but it does not last very long after putting it in the oil burner i.e., once it stops burning you no longer really smell the scent.</li>
            <li>Since Cinnamon Bark is a very strong oil, it should always be diluted if applied to the skin, but always test it on a small area first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ginger is also a very strong oil, it should always be diluted if applied to the skin, but always test it on a small area first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess I have to buy new cones.</li>
            <li>I’ve just started making Christmas gifts, found these gorgeous little spray bottles and am making air fresheners by mixing 1 cup of bottled water, a quarter cup of vodka, and then topping it off with ten drops of Holiday Season Essential Oil (shake before using to reblend the scent).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Plant Therapy Essential oils only makes the most top quality, thick essential oils I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Sweet Orange Oil treats acne, skin irritations, microbial infections, wounds and dermatitis, due to its antiseptic properties.</li>
            <li>This oil blend is 100% certified pure essential oils that has no fillers, additives, fillers, bases or carriers added.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of a cinnamon uplifting scent but its not, its hard to explain</li>
            <li>Since the oils in this mixture are orange, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg, I thought the scent would be very festive and reminiscent of Christmas.  </li>
            <li>It lasted less than one full day.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this essential oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very much of a let down.  </li>
            <li>The ginger is the main component of the aroma, and all other scents take a back seat.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Holiday Season Blend, where have you been all my life? This blend REALLY smells like the holidays, and it&#x27;s potent! I use my essential oils in an electric diffuser and find I only need 3 drops of this stuff to smell an entire room! I will be using this year-round. It&#x27;s such a pleasant uplifting smell!</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed in the smell. It has a strange smell to me and after a short while I cant stand it. I was hoping for more of a cinnamon uplifting scent but its not, its hard to explain but I dont like it.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell for my diffuser!</li>
            <li> It brings the smell of the holiday to my apartment just by using my atomizer. In fact, I use it whether or not it is the holiday!</li>
            <li> Holiday Season is a delightfully uplifting blend of 4 essential oils - sweet orange, cinnamon bark, ginger and nutmeg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our sense of smell is closely tied to the limbic system, the part of our brains that processes emotions and memories. When we breathe in aromas that trigger happy memories from our past, it floods our bodies with feel good hormones that help us experience joy in the present as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is much more than a reminder of happy times. The oils in this blend actually are beneficial for us in several ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orange oil is widely known as a “happy” oil.  It is high in antioxidants and supports a healthy immune system for overall well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traditionally, cinnamon was thought to have a frequency that attracted wealth and abundance. It is so much more than that, though. It is also supportive to the immune system and overall well-being. It is easy to see that a blend that includes cinnamon bark oil, such as Holiday Season, would be an excellent one to diffuse all winter long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ginger oil, being an essential oil, is stimulating and therefore relieves depression, mental stress, exhaustion, dizziness, restlessness and anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nutmeg oil stimulates the brain and therefore removes mental exhaustion and stress. It is also believed that nutmeg oil improves the quality of your dreams, making them more intense and colorful. It is a good remedy for anxiety as well as depression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might only be August but I love the Christmas season and diffusing this blend in my living room brought on some great memories. I almost started baking cookies and shopping for christmas gifts on Amazon! ;o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product at a discount so i could write an honest and unbiased review. I LOVE this blend! Definitely Christmas-y!</li>
            <li> I love this  product, smells like christmas,  a large  bottle,  use a few drops in my diffuser, and  wow,  smells great throughout the house, I would recommend buying this  holiday season again, such a wonderful blend of different oils,  plant theraphy  has out done themselves with this  one,</li>
            <li> Since the oils in this mixture are orange, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg, I thought the scent would be very festive and reminiscent of Christmas.  Ugh.  Nothing could be further from the truth. The ginger is the main component of the aroma, and all other scents take a back seat.  The orange and cinnamon tie for second place and the nutmeg seems non-existent.  This does not smell like Christmas at all.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant, just not what I was expecting.  Very much of a let down.  I cannot recommend this product.</li>

This is another awesome oil to use as a room freshener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use this oil in many different ways. I like using it for aromatherapy, as well as adding it to my homemade soaps, shampoos, conditioners, lotions, detergents and cleaners! I would highly recommend this essential oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discounted price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I have used this for products I&#x27;ve made and to scent my house!! Love it, definitely will get more of them.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time.  I was pleased with the scent, I use it instead of candles with a diffuser.  It&#x27;s great for the winter months.</li>
            <li> I. was trying to revive my scented pine  cones.  It lasted less than one full day. I guess I have to buy new cones.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!  I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t save it for the holidays!  I will have to order more for tat season this year!</li>
            <li> I was offered this Holiday Season Essential Oils Blend from Plant Therapy Essential Oils for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it. I love the smell of the holiday season but don&#x27;t like candles burning all the time. This blend is Sweet Orange, Cinnamon Bark, Nutmeg, and Ginger essential oils and the scent is amazing. If you love the holiday season and the aroma that comes with it, then you should definitely try this because even in August your home can smell like the holidays.</li>
            <li> If Christmas, and your birthday, had a wildly romantic love affair and made a baby puppy that was delivered by fuzzy adorable kitten elves wearing feety pajamas, that tiny puppy still wouldn’t smell as good as this Plant Therapy Essential Oil. I love the warm spiced orange top note and the nutmeg under tone and love the spicy citrus blend presentation. It’s terrific how the cinnamon is present without being overpowering. I’ve just started making Christmas gifts, found these gorgeous little spray bottles and am making air fresheners by mixing 1 cup of bottled water, a quarter cup of vodka, and then topping it off with ten drops of Holiday Season Essential Oil (shake before using to reblend the scent). I received the Plant Therapy Holiday Season Essential Oil at a promotional cost for evaluation and review. Love the quality of this brand and love this festive holiday scent!</li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell but it does not last very long after putting it in the oil burner i.e., once it stops burning you no longer really smell the scent. So if you&#x27;re trying to get that warm-cozy smell that permeates your home you need to look for a stronger product.</li>
