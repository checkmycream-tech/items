            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased :)</li>
            <li>The trimmer is nice as well, trims hair to a good length and thins it out, it works best if you have fairly long hair in that area.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t love it more!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Venus razors, they&#x27;ve always been amazing for me.</li>
            <li>Best thing for the bikini line for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy!  </li>
            <li>I love love love this!  </li>
            <li>IT IS SIMPLY AMAZING, AND SO EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent and keeps my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the venus line</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately it was a &amp;#34;clean bowl&amp;#34;, and I was a able to retrieve without damage to my plumbing.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible quality.</li>
            <li>This has got a trimmer ( use this instaed of scissors, frankly it trims better than scissors) ,</li>
            <li>Love this set.</li>
            <li>so much better to trim and keep things under control.</li>
            <li>I love that it is a razor and a trimmer in one.</li>
            <li>Love these...can&#x27;t wait to use them in the summer evenings</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love the razor to trim around my bikini area.</li>
            <li>I was able to find just the razor at Bed Bath</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love the trimmer -</li>
            <li>Venus razors are OK</li>
            <li>I think this is a better deal though.</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>Like it, but dont love it</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE BIKINI TRIMMER.</li>
            <li>I also love the healing cream that comes with the kit.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This bikini trimmer works pretty good.</li>
            <li>............trimmer given with shaver makes shaving more easy by trimming the hair before.............</li>
            <li>This was a great buy, the razor I thought would be disposable, but it&#x27;s actually a razor handle with replaceable heads which is nice.</li>
            <li>Olay moisturizer make this whole experience more good ........... was waiting this product ....</li>
            <li>This made it extremely easy.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t flex all the time, and don&#x27;t find it important to have every hair in order.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmer works fantastic.</li>
            <li>For health and safety keep that area free of a bacteria growing razor/trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal as it comes with a bikini trimmer, a regular razor with 1 blade, and some hydrating lotion.  </li>
            <li>fantastic &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; , could not find in stores any more, but here it was, and delivered right to my door.  </li>
            <li>i love it because it gives you the just right trimming without bumps...</li>
            <li>It works for folks who have a significant amount of hair and just want a trim.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth giving this a shot!</li>
            <li>Kit comes with a small travel size body lotion which smells real good, a Venus shaver, and the bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li>It works great if you want to trim and not completely remove hair.</li>
            <li>So, nothing special.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Gillette has done it right!</li>
            <li>Trimmer works great, as I expected it should.</li>
            <li>I like the kit, but I don&#x27;t always need the full kit, so</li>
            <li>Probably good for a teen.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Venus shavers are great in general but the bikini trimmer is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried expensive electrical models as well).</li>
            <li>The head off the trimmer razor fell of the very first time I used it- and fell into the commode.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick, easy and so much easier than clipping with scissors.</li>
            <li>Easy, fast, convenient way to trim.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor gave me a very nice shave on all parts, though the moisturizer does get goopy and will leave residue on whatever you set it down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good item for keeping things manageable, not cutting yourself, and not having to be super careful with what you&#x27;re doing.  </li>
            <li>the after shave lotion makes it completely worth it.</li>
            <li>Gillette Venus Bikini Kit is definitely a useful product.</li>
            <li>The razor I really like and the lotion is very useful.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer, really a great item, works great, much less messy then using regular razors and you won&#x27;t clump your razor up with this.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t try to use it right as you step out of the shower.</li>
            <li>This is now available for purchase as just the trimmer, but it would be nice to get some with replaceable heads like the previous poster.  </li>
            <li>when you think about the places they are put, it&#x27;s totally fine to start with a new one.</li>
            <li>earlier I was getting razor bumps with other kind of razor and feels a kind of irritation and itching after shaving ............</li>
            <li>I like to keep things neat and tidy, but I don&#x27;t really have enough vanity in me to spend a bunch of time manscaping.  </li>
            <li>This is okay, not comfortable for you because you don&#x27;t care money, there are much better quality products in the market.</li>
            <li>Its a good shaver, but I was a little dissapointed thinking</li>
            <li>would have been better if it was smaller.</li>
            <li>And its safe to shave public hairs also.</li>
            <li>It works as expected, and is extremely handy.</li>
            <li>This is so much easier!</li>
            <li>the lotion doesn&#x27;t help me at all, i have found that using solid deodorant after shaving helps me more</li>
            <li>I would say it works pretty well at keeping the bikini area trim.</li>
            <li>I used to get Brazilians and was worried, but this has done exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The Venus Embrace razor left my bikini line smooth (no nicks or bumps) and the trimmer is a great little tool!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, I&#x27;ve never shaved the bikini area before and was very nervous to do it with a regular razor!</li>
            <li>They give the perfect trim to a sensitive area that I am not comfortable using a regular razor on.</li>
            <li>by triming first I get a much closer shave and my razor lasts longer.</li>
            <li>There are not a lot of options out there for this type of thing, other than a regular sized mens&#x27; trimmer, so if you are looking for a cheap and effective option</li>
            <li>I also ignored the lotion and used Bikini Zone instead, These don&#x27;t affect the stars though because I bought the kit purely for the bikini razor.</li>
            <li>This works VERY well, keeps it clean and short without having to worry about ingrown hairs or itchiness when it grows back, MUCH better than shaving it 100%.</li>
            <li>The bikini works fine if you want an EXTREMELY SHORT trim.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER used a razor that did not butcher my skin, even the older Gillette Venus brands!</li>
            <li>Nice little set.</li>
            <li>I really like this kit--</li>
            <li>the razor works really well, gives a close shave and is gentle.  </li>
            <li>Does the job very well.</li>
            <li>this is just a razor and another tool that doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone my whole life without it...</li>
            <li>It was much easier that way.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to keep buying the whole kit over.</li>
            <li>tried pairing it with bikini shaving gel, didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a nice kit, and if I can find just the razor, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying that again.</li>
            <li>TRUST me if you like it nice neat and trim without it looking all uneven trying not to cut yourself with scissors</li>
            <li>Its true if your use to being almost bare I would not recommend this trimmer for you.</li>
            <li>Not very sharp went full fast.</li>
            <li>It softens skin very well; at one point I was out of my usual lotion and used this in its place, and it made my legs and skin super smooth!</li>
            <li>Easy enough to maneuver, though a more narrow model would be a tad easier to navigate through tricky areas.</li>
            <li>so I would not have the need to be spending $6 or more at a pop for a shaver that might dull quickly given the area being shaved.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find them in the store anymore and can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li>Will absolutely buy this again when I need a new one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the razor, just by itself.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The razor is great but the bikini razor is weird, it has a comb on the end of the razor with a moveable head</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a normal lotion with &amp;#34;bikini&amp;#34; slapped on it.  </li>
            <li>okay, if you dont waste your time in market&lt;br /&gt;$5 &#x3D;</li>
            <li>Razor did not hold up as well as normally purchased Venus razors.</li>
            <li>These are hard to find as they&#x27;re not typically sold in stores, so I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon sells them!</li>
            <li>The bikini shaver is just &amp;#34;so/so&amp;#34; because it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much and despite the guard on it, if you&#x27;re not careful, you can cut yourself.</li>
            <li>Mine is deadly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Completely overrated.</li>
            <li>, it also doesn&#x27;t do a real close shave and still leaves quite a bit of hair left.</li>
            <li>I have seriously sensitive skin, and completely shaving the bikini area has always caused problems, WIth this razor</li>
            <li>First trimmed my hair, next used a shaving gel on nd around bikini area and shaved it, and finally applied lotion.</li>
            <li>No other complaints and i recommend this for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After using the trimmer, I felt it was effective and preferred for trimming hard to reach areas and longer length hairs compared to other trimmers ive tried.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually let my hair grow long enough for the trimmer to be necessary, but I can assume it would be effective.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer certainly does it&#x27;s job by carefully trimming those pesky, unwanted bikini hairs.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s much easier to shave short hair than to shave long hair,</li>
            <li>Not sure how long the trimmer will last, so I am hoping that it will be able to last for some time before the blade becomes blunt.</li>
            <li>kept getting hair stuck in it and made it hard to clean.</li>
            <li>So you basically use it the same as you would a regular razor, but the comb prevents you from shaving the area completely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my bikini kit for a few months now and with a little cleaning after each use I find my trimmer to still be working just fine.</li>
            <li>Each groomer lasts about four months in our house, but when I was single, it lasted nearly a year, probably because only one person was using it.</li>

            <li> Best thing for the bikini line for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy!  </li>
            <li> I love love love this!  </li>
            <li> IT IS SIMPLY AMAZING, AND SO EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent and keeps my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the venus line</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately it was a &amp;#34;clean bowl&amp;#34;, and I was a able to retrieve without damage to my plumbing.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible quality.</li>
            <li> This has got a trimmer ( use this instaed of scissors, frankly it trims better than scissors) ,</li>
            <li> Love this set.</li>
            <li> so much better to trim and keep things under control.</li>
            <li> I love that it is a razor and a trimmer in one.</li>
            <li> Love these...can&#x27;t wait to use them in the summer evenings</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love the razor to trim around my bikini area.</li>
            <li> I was able to find just the razor at Bed Bath</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the trimmer -</li>
            <li> Venus razors are OK</li>
            <li> I think this is a better deal though.</li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> Like it, but dont love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE BIKINI TRIMMER.</li>
            <li> I also love the healing cream that comes with the kit.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  </li>
            <li> This bikini trimmer works pretty good.</li>
            <li> ............trimmer given with shaver makes shaving more easy by trimming the hair before.............</li>
            <li> This was a great buy, the razor I thought would be disposable, but it&#x27;s actually a razor handle with replaceable heads which is nice.</li>
            <li> Olay moisturizer make this whole experience more good ........... was waiting this product ....</li>
            <li> This made it extremely easy.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t flex all the time, and don&#x27;t find it important to have every hair in order.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fantastic.</li>
            <li> For health and safety keep that area free of a bacteria growing razor/trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal as it comes with a bikini trimmer, a regular razor with 1 blade, and some hydrating lotion.  </li>
            <li> fantastic &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; , could not find in stores any more, but here it was, and delivered right to my door.  </li>
            <li> i love it because it gives you the just right trimming without bumps...</li>
            <li> It works for folks who have a significant amount of hair and just want a trim.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth giving this a shot!</li>
            <li> Kit comes with a small travel size body lotion which smells real good, a Venus shaver, and the bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li> It works great if you want to trim and not completely remove hair.</li>
            <li> So, nothing special.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Gillette has done it right!</li>
            <li> Trimmer works great, as I expected it should.</li>
            <li> I like the kit, but I don&#x27;t always need the full kit, so</li>
            <li> Probably good for a teen.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Venus shavers are great in general but the bikini trimmer is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried expensive electrical models as well).</li>
            <li> The head off the trimmer razor fell of the very first time I used it- and fell into the commode.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick, easy and so much easier than clipping with scissors.</li>
            <li> Easy, fast, convenient way to trim.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor gave me a very nice shave on all parts, though the moisturizer does get goopy and will leave residue on whatever you set it down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good item for keeping things manageable, not cutting yourself, and not having to be super careful with what you&#x27;re doing.  </li>
            <li> the after shave lotion makes it completely worth it.</li>
            <li> Gillette Venus Bikini Kit is definitely a useful product.</li>
            <li> The razor I really like and the lotion is very useful.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer, really a great item, works great, much less messy then using regular razors and you won&#x27;t clump your razor up with this.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t try to use it right as you step out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This is now available for purchase as just the trimmer, but it would be nice to get some with replaceable heads like the previous poster.  </li>
            <li> when you think about the places they are put, it&#x27;s totally fine to start with a new one.</li>
            <li> earlier I was getting razor bumps with other kind of razor and feels a kind of irritation and itching after shaving ............</li>
            <li> I like to keep things neat and tidy, but I don&#x27;t really have enough vanity in me to spend a bunch of time manscaping.  </li>
            <li> This is okay, not comfortable for you because you don&#x27;t care money, there are much better quality products in the market.</li>
            <li> Its a good shaver, but I was a little dissapointed thinking</li>
            <li> would have been better if it was smaller.</li>
            <li> And its safe to shave public hairs also.</li>
            <li> It works as expected, and is extremely handy.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier!</li>
            <li> the lotion doesn&#x27;t help me at all, i have found that using solid deodorant after shaving helps me more</li>
            <li> I would say it works pretty well at keeping the bikini area trim.</li>
            <li> I used to get Brazilians and was worried, but this has done exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The Venus Embrace razor left my bikini line smooth (no nicks or bumps) and the trimmer is a great little tool!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, I&#x27;ve never shaved the bikini area before and was very nervous to do it with a regular razor!</li>
            <li> They give the perfect trim to a sensitive area that I am not comfortable using a regular razor on.</li>
            <li> by triming first I get a much closer shave and my razor lasts longer.</li>
            <li> There are not a lot of options out there for this type of thing, other than a regular sized mens&#x27; trimmer, so if you are looking for a cheap and effective option</li>
            <li> I also ignored the lotion and used Bikini Zone instead, These don&#x27;t affect the stars though because I bought the kit purely for the bikini razor.</li>
            <li> This works VERY well, keeps it clean and short without having to worry about ingrown hairs or itchiness when it grows back, MUCH better than shaving it 100%.</li>
            <li> The bikini works fine if you want an EXTREMELY SHORT trim.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER used a razor that did not butcher my skin, even the older Gillette Venus brands!</li>
            <li> Nice little set.</li>
            <li> I really like this kit--</li>
            <li> the razor works really well, gives a close shave and is gentle.  </li>
            <li> Does the job very well.</li>
            <li> this is just a razor and another tool that doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone my whole life without it...</li>
            <li> It was much easier that way.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to keep buying the whole kit over.</li>
            <li> tried pairing it with bikini shaving gel, didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a nice kit, and if I can find just the razor, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying that again.</li>
            <li> TRUST me if you like it nice neat and trim without it looking all uneven trying not to cut yourself with scissors</li>
            <li> Its true if your use to being almost bare I would not recommend this trimmer for you.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp went full fast.</li>
            <li> It softens skin very well; at one point I was out of my usual lotion and used this in its place, and it made my legs and skin super smooth!</li>
            <li> Easy enough to maneuver, though a more narrow model would be a tad easier to navigate through tricky areas.</li>
            <li> so I would not have the need to be spending $6 or more at a pop for a shaver that might dull quickly given the area being shaved.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find them in the store anymore and can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li> Will absolutely buy this again when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the razor, just by itself.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The razor is great but the bikini razor is weird, it has a comb on the end of the razor with a moveable head</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a normal lotion with &amp;#34;bikini&amp;#34; slapped on it.  </li>
            <li> okay, if you dont waste your time in market&lt;br /&gt;$5 &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Razor did not hold up as well as normally purchased Venus razors.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find as they&#x27;re not typically sold in stores, so I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon sells them!</li>
            <li> The bikini shaver is just &amp;#34;so/so&amp;#34; because it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much and despite the guard on it, if you&#x27;re not careful, you can cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Mine is deadly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Completely overrated.</li>
            <li> , it also doesn&#x27;t do a real close shave and still leaves quite a bit of hair left.</li>
            <li> I have seriously sensitive skin, and completely shaving the bikini area has always caused problems, WIth this razor</li>
            <li> First trimmed my hair, next used a shaving gel on nd around bikini area and shaved it, and finally applied lotion.</li>
            <li> No other complaints and i recommend this for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After using the trimmer, I felt it was effective and preferred for trimming hard to reach areas and longer length hairs compared to other trimmers ive tried.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually let my hair grow long enough for the trimmer to be necessary, but I can assume it would be effective.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer certainly does it&#x27;s job by carefully trimming those pesky, unwanted bikini hairs.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s much easier to shave short hair than to shave long hair,</li>
            <li> Not sure how long the trimmer will last, so I am hoping that it will be able to last for some time before the blade becomes blunt.</li>
            <li> kept getting hair stuck in it and made it hard to clean.</li>
            <li> So you basically use it the same as you would a regular razor, but the comb prevents you from shaving the area completely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my bikini kit for a few months now and with a little cleaning after each use I find my trimmer to still be working just fine.</li>
            <li> Each groomer lasts about four months in our house, but when I was single, it lasted nearly a year, probably because only one person was using it.</li>
            <li> I might have to go over an area a few times to get it exactly trimmed, but it does its job, and it does it without maneuvering a mirror, and scissors, and holding the door closed for an hour while your children try to come stampeding</li>
            <li> So, leave it sitting blade up and flat.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old trimmer, the venus bikini trimmer makes trimming much less of a process as its faster and easier.  </li>
            <li> If you are used to being bare or nearly bare, the razor with a guard is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> i was surprised i only had few nicks with using a razor with 5 blades in that area.</li>
            <li> Quite a pity since the handle is very well made and sturdy, and definitely not as flimsy as the usual disposable ones.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;ve been trying to use a regular, cheapo disposable razor and scissors to achieve a clean bikini line...</li>
            <li> Only 3 stars because I&#x27;m annoyed that you have to buy an entire new kit just to get the trimmer</li>
            <li> The hair has to be dry to work.</li>
            <li> It says to shave wet, but I recommend when dry.</li>
            <li> I use it for the winter months when I don&#x27;t need such a close trim and use Noxzema little shavers for the summer months.</li>
            <li> What took so long?!!!</li>
            <li> The razor works well, as expected.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not afraid ill accidently slice my lady bits off.</li>
            <li> I can buy the trimmer in a few different packages.</li>
            <li> But if you would like a everyday look with a short trim I would recommend this for you.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Personally, the trim was far too short for me, and left hair at a length that was just scratchy and painful for a week until it grew a bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so just keep a couple of razors around for emergencies - shouldn&#x27;t have to buy one to get the other.</li>
            <li> The bikini shaver was kinda big and hard to use.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that couldnt just buy the bikini shaver</li>
            <li> not fun.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is totally not worth having to buy this kit</li>
            <li> product arrived 3 days late actually ...............  </li>
            <li> It cuts the hair down to about 1/4 of an inch with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> , I can get a close cut without taking scissors down there.</li>
            <li> Beyond for half the cost.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit previously at a brick &amp; mortar store but ordered again here as I needed to replace my trimmer.  </li>
            <li> and i get less skin irritation or itching using it then using the lotion..........</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, one day in the shower, this little number showed up on account of my wife.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizing strip is peeling away after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I usually almost always end up nicking myself somewhere, whether it&#x27;s on my bikini line or on my knees, but this is one is careful enough that even I don&#x27;t end up cutting myself with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only sorry I didn&#x27;t discover it sooner.  </li>
            <li> The bikini razor is basically a razor, with a blade, that has a small comb like head.  </li>
            <li> Although, I have to say I am not sure why some reviews are saying the trimmer is for one time use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to say.  </li>
            <li> and it did not give me a close shave at all.. and the lotion that it comes with hardly softened my skin</li>
            <li> I had to buy a kit which forced me into buying a razor and lotion which I will NOT use</li>
            <li> For instance, i have an electric (battery operated) bikini timmer razor combo, and it can be scary when trimming hard to reach areas and longer hairs because if the razor gets clogged or the hair is to long it can pinch you, which has never injured me but is really painful and startling.  </li>
            <li> makes grooming a less painful experience.  </li>
            <li> This was expensive i thought..</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to use and cut myself accidentally.</li>
            <li> No need to fear cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> Also I was shocked in find out</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m a guy.  I like to keep things neat and tidy, but I don&#x27;t really have enough vanity in me to spend a bunch of time manscaping.  I don&#x27;t stare in the mirror for hours, don&#x27;t flex all the time, and don&#x27;t find it important to have every hair in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, one day in the shower, this little number showed up on account of my wife.  I&#x27;m not hung up on gender stereotypes, and despite the obvious female marketing features, I figured, &amp;#34;why not, let&#x27;s see what I can do with this?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth be told, I like it.  I am a man and I like the Venus Bikini shaver.  There, I said it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good item for keeping things manageable, not cutting yourself, and not having to be super careful with what you&#x27;re doing.  You just use it once in a while, and things stay good.  That&#x27;s win.</li>
            <li> i love it because it gives you the just right trimming without bumps...i use it every week ...keeps me preety nice and tidy.</li>
            <li> I really like this kit--the razor works really well, gives a close shave and is gentle.  I usually almost always end up nicking myself somewhere, whether it&#x27;s on my bikini line or on my knees, but this is one is careful enough that even I don&#x27;t end up cutting myself with it. I don&#x27;t usually let my hair grow long enough for the trimmer to be necessary, but I can assume it would be effective.  As for the moisturizer...it&#x27;s hard to say.  It softens skin very well; at one point I was out of my usual lotion and used this in its place, and it made my legs and skin super smooth! But for the bikini line, I don&#x27;t get the point. It&#x27;s just a normal lotion with &amp;#34;bikini&amp;#34; slapped on it.  It doesn&#x27;t help with ingrown hairs, razor burn, any of that. So, nothing special. Overall, it&#x27;s a nice kit, and if I can find just the razor, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying that again.</li>
            <li> Finally a bikini shaver I&#x27;ve had invented in my head for a while! What took so long?!!! This works VERY well, keeps it clean and short without having to worry about ingrown hairs or itchiness when it grows back, MUCH better than shaving it 100%. This keeps it the perfect length. My only complaint is that couldnt just buy the bikini shaver I had to buy a kit which forced me into buying a razor and lotion which I will NOT use (the lotion has PARABENS in it!!!). They need to sell just the bikini shaver by itself. Also I was shocked in find out it was disposible not reuseable with replacement heads. They should make it with replacement heads. All in all this product is AWESOME. TRUST me if you like it nice neat and trim without it looking all uneven trying not to cut yourself with scissors this product is def. for you, I\\&quot;M SOLD!!!!</li>
            <li> The kit comes with a venus embrace razor, a second razor with a guard and some lotion for after the shave. I found the razor with a guard to be ineffective. It works for folks who have a significant amount of hair and just want a trim. If you are used to being bare or nearly bare, the razor with a guard is a waste of money. I love the venus line so I will purchase the embrace razor but I will not purchase the bikini kit or razor with a guard again.</li>
            <li> The bikini shaver was kinda big and hard to use. would have been better if it was smaller. I used the Noxzema bikini shavers instead.</li>
            <li> This was expensive i thought.. and it did not give me a close shave at all.. and the lotion that it comes with hardly softened my skin.. I would have rather bought a walmart generic brand lotion and razors..Thought i would give it a try.</li>
            <li> Love the shaver! Does the job very well. The moisturizing lotion is definitely an added benefit for providing the immediate moisture required to prevent irritation.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer, really a great item, works great, much less messy then using regular razors and you won&#x27;t clump your razor up with this.  This is now available for purchase as just the trimmer, but it would be nice to get some with replaceable heads like the previous poster.  I do not use the Venus Embrace razors, I only use the Venus Breeze so I&#x27;m not overly impressed with this packaging, but the trimmer is fantastic! Definitely would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link to 3 pack of just trimmers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003EMM4P0 Gillette Venus Bikini Trimmer, 1-count Packages (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> Works well. Does the job!</li>
            <li> The razor is great... just wish they would sell ONLY the bikini razor. Not all the extras...</li>
            <li> Gets the job done! Good product</li>
            <li> I love love love this!  It cuts the hair down to about 1/4 of an inch with no irritation.  I just hop into the shower without the water on, shave away, then start the shower.  It&#x27;s so easy!  I DON&#x27;T mind that these are disposable, when you think about the places they are put, it&#x27;s totally fine to start with a new one.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to use and cut myself accidentally.</li>
            <li> The head off the trimmer razor fell of the very first time I used it- and fell into the commode.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately it was a &amp;#34;clean bowl&amp;#34;, and I was a able to retrieve without damage to my plumbing.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible quality.I also wonder if I didn&#x27;t get a &amp;#34;second&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;return&amp;#34; or something.&lt;br /&gt;The outer wrapper on the razor pack arrived unglued, and the pack was already opened a bit.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price! Gets the job done, only downside is cleaning out the bikini trimmer eesh.</li>
            <li> Bought this one recently. This has got a trimmer ( use this instaed of scissors, frankly it trims better than scissors) , an olay moiterizing lotion ( use it after shave ) and a razor ( with 5 blades ). Mine is deadly sensitive skin. First trimmed my hair, next used a shaving gel on nd around bikini area and shaved it, and finally applied lotion. I felt lil itchy but i applied baby powder for a while and its all perfect now. No other complaints and i recommend this for people with sensitive skin. And its safe to shave public hairs also.</li>
            <li> The razor works well, as expected. The bikini shaver is just &amp;#34;so/so&amp;#34; because it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much and despite the guard on it, if you&#x27;re not careful, you can cut yourself.</li>
            <li> This product includes a venus embrace razor with 1 replaceable razor head, the bikini trimmer, and bikini lotion to use after shaving.  My first impression of the kit was that it was a very good value for the price.  After using the trimmer, I felt it was effective and preferred for trimming hard to reach areas and longer length hairs compared to other trimmers ive tried.  For instance, i have an electric (battery operated) bikini timmer razor combo, and it can be scary when trimming hard to reach areas and longer hairs because if the razor gets clogged or the hair is to long it can pinch you, which has never injured me but is really painful and startling.  Compared to my old trimmer, the venus bikini trimmer makes trimming much less of a process as its faster and easier.  Also, I&#x27;m not afraid ill accidently slice my lady bits off.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, can not find in stores</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;m only sorry I didn&#x27;t discover it sooner.  Sadly, I&#x27;ve been trying to use a regular, cheapo disposable razor and scissors to achieve a clean bikini line...not fun.  The Venus Embrace razor left my bikini line smooth (no nicks or bumps) and the trimmer is a great little tool!  The moisturizer is also nice.  I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Great for shortening hair with no burn or irritation.</li>
            <li> The bikini works fine if you want an EXTREMELY SHORT trim. Easy enough to maneuver, though a more narrow model would be a tad easier to navigate through tricky areas. Personally, the trim was far too short for me, and left hair at a length that was just scratchy and painful for a week until it grew a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;bikini lotion&amp;#34; is just Oil of Olay&#x27;s regular intensive moisture lotion repackaged. Nothing special. Did not prevent razor burn, and was a bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor gave me a very nice shave on all parts, though the moisturizer does get goopy and will leave residue on whatever you set it down. It also dries in a funky shape. So, leave it sitting blade up and flat.</li>
            <li> Love this set. The trimmer works fantastic. Am trying to order another one that is just the trimmer itself. Nice little set. I had a coupon so i got it for great deal!</li>
            <li> Good price so I bought it for and she loves it even after yelling about how she didn&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> $3 &#x3D; good&lt;br /&gt;$4 &#x3D; okay, if you dont waste your time in market&lt;br /&gt;$5 &#x3D; if dont see cheaper market&lt;br /&gt;$6 &#x3D; if you dont care the deal&lt;br /&gt;$6 &amp;#62; you should not have to see this. This is okay, not comfortable for you because you don&#x27;t care money, there are much better quality products in the market.</li>
            <li> This bikini trimmer is the best!  I absolutely love it and wish it came in a pack of more than one!!</li>
            <li> Quite a good deal on this kit, since it comes with two items- the bikini one and the olay cream. It works as expected, and is extremely handy. The only issue I have is that the blade for the bikini trimmer is not refillable. Quite a pity since the handle is very well made and sturdy, and definitely not as flimsy as the usual disposable ones. Not sure how long the trimmer will last, so I am hoping that it will be able to last for some time before the blade becomes blunt.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  Kinda are to the corners tho</li>
            <li> Best kit any girl should have. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Great razor set for keeping myself neat and groomed. Love the bikini trimmer! Will absolutely buy this again when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> so much better to trim and keep things under control. Also it&#x27;s much easier to shave short hair than to shave long hair, by triming first I get a much closer shave and my razor lasts longer. Personally though I wouldn&#x27;t keep this in the moist shower unless you use it daily, the moisture and heat &#x3D; bacteria grower. For health and safety keep that area free of a bacteria growing razor/trimmer. I like the kit, but I don&#x27;t always need the full kit, so I like tha I can buy the trimmer in a few different packages.</li>
            <li> I received this item for free as a sample and was so happy it was actually a great product! I love that it is a razor and a trimmer in one. You can replace the blade also which is great! It&#x27;s also waterproof! I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Completely overrated. The trimmer is totally not worth having to buy this kit and I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it if I could buy it alone. Just going to invest in a proper, battery operated trimmer.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I wish the trimmer was sold separately.</li>
            <li> nope. stick with the schick quattro trimmer. this is just a razor and another tool that doesn&#x27;t really work well. the razor also seems like it will knick a lot easier that then shick.</li>
            <li> Love these...can&#x27;t wait to use them in the summer evenings</li>
            <li> Packaged well. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone my whole life without it...trying to trim hair with scissors. This is so much easier! I only have the bikini trimmer, not the rest of the package.</li>
            <li> Comes with regular razor PLUS an additional &amp;#34;bikini&amp;#34; one with length guard.  Since the venus is my fave razor I picked this up so I could have one at home and one for my gym bag.  :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Venus razors, they&#x27;ve always been amazing for me. They are a bit pricey at times, but what razors aren&#x27;t anymore? This was a great buy, the razor I thought would be disposable, but it&#x27;s actually a razor handle with replaceable heads which is nice. The trimmer is nice as well, trims hair to a good length and thins it out, it works best if you have fairly long hair in that area. This kit also comes with a small tube of Olay Bikini Moisturizing Lotion which I wasn&#x27;t aware of at time of purchase. But I&#x27;m glad it was in there because it&#x27;s great for your bikini area after trimming or shaving</li>
            <li> I love the razor to trim around my bikini area. I just wanted the razor, but this was all I could find. This came with lotion that gave me a rash. I was able to find just the razor at Bed Bath Beyond for half the cost. I highly recommend the razor, just by itself.</li>
            <li> its a good product to use... earlier I was getting razor bumps with other kind of razor and feels a kind of irritation and itching after shaving ............but with this product I not faced any such issue ............trimmer given with shaver makes shaving more easy by trimming the hair before.............Olay moisturizer make this whole experience more good ........... was waiting this product ....product arrived 3 days late actually ...............  I don&#x27;t like delivery time........................</li>
            <li> Quick, easy and so much easier than clipping with scissors. Only one length option for the bikini length, but works for me!</li>
            <li> Thought this was going to be like the Shick bikini trimmer but wasn&#x27;t even close. Probably good for a teen.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, I&#x27;ve never shaved the bikini area before and was very nervous to do it with a regular razor! This made it extremely easy. Highly recommend. It says to shave wet, but I recommend when dry. It was much easier that way. The second razor was ineffective- whatever was wrapped around it- lotion, guard or whatever, kept getting hair stuck in it and made it hard to clean. I also ignored the lotion and used Bikini Zone instead, These don&#x27;t affect the stars though because I bought the kit purely for the bikini razor. Though I do wish they had replacement heads or razors by themselves so I don&#x27;t have to keep buying the whole kit over.</li>
            <li> Great product with everything u need. I love it.</li>
            <li> great razors, make your skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does its job and keeps it trimmed. It can even be used close to the skin on the lips. Its true if your use to being almost bare I would not recommend this trimmer for you. But if you would like a everyday look with a short trim I would recommend this for you. The razor I really like and the lotion is very useful. Overall I would get this again.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the trimmer - I purchased this kit previously at a brick &amp; mortar store but ordered again here as I needed to replace my trimmer.  Only 3 stars because I&#x27;m annoyed that you have to buy an entire new kit just to get the trimmer...can&#x27;t find it sold alone.  Venus razors are OK but I&#x27;m a Nair girl so just keep a couple of razors around for emergencies - shouldn&#x27;t have to buy one to get the other.</li>
            <li> I use an epilator for my legs, but prefer the razer for my under arms and bikini areas.  The trimmer and the lotion make it the best item I&#x27;ve used that isn&#x27;t electric for trimming my bikini areas.</li>
            <li> Gillette has done it right! I love all their Venus products and this bikini kit is great! Gotta have it!</li>
            <li> The razor is great but the bikini razor is weird, it has a comb on the end of the razor with a moveable head and I have to hold the head of the razor for it to work properly for me, it also doesn&#x27;t do a real close shave and still leaves quite a bit of hair left.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad. the razor is good. i was surprised i only had few nicks with using a razor with 5 blades in that area. the lotion doesn&#x27;t help me at all, i have found that using solid deodorant after shaving helps me more and i get less skin irritation or itching using it then using the lotion..........but i have a 6 blade razor from cvs (their brand) and the replacements are only $5, i might as well use that if this one is a 5 blade razor and it&#x27;s replacement is $15(online) or up to $25 (in stores)</li>
            <li> Length trimmer worked great. Razor did not hold up as well as normally purchased Venus razors. The moisturizing strip is peeling away after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal as it comes with a bikini trimmer, a regular razor with 1 blade, and some hydrating lotion.  The bikini trimmer is wonderful.  Finally a product that lets me trim the bikini area without getting red and itchy blotches.  They sell packages of just the bikini trimmers too if you don&#x27;t need the razor or lotion.  I think this is a better deal though.</li>
            <li> Does amazing job! Give it a try</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; comes with a regular three blade razor, bikini area moisturizer, as well as the bikini razor.  The bikini razor is basically a razor, with a blade, that has a small comb like head.  So you basically use it the same as you would a regular razor, but the comb prevents you from shaving the area completely.  I would say it works pretty well at keeping the bikini area trim. There are not a lot of options out there for this type of thing, other than a regular sized mens&#x27; trimmer, so if you are looking for a cheap and effective option it&#x27;s worth giving this a shot!</li>
            <li> Best thing for the bikini line for people with sensitive skin.  My favorite.</li>
            <li> Its a good shaver, but I was a little dissapointed thinking it was a guard that could be attached to a regular venus razor so I would not have the need to be spending $6 or more at a pop for a shaver that might dull quickly given the area being shaved. Like it, but dont love it</li>
            <li> WHY DIDN&#x27;T I DISCOVER THIS WAYYYYY EARLIER. This is a life saver. Couldn&#x27;t love it more!</li>
            <li> fantastic &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; , could not find in stores any more, but here it was, and delivered right to my door.  great product.</li>
            <li> This bikini trimmer works pretty good. No need to fear cutting yourself. Great for trimming however if you need a closer shave this is not the trimmer for you. I use it for the winter months when I don&#x27;t need such a close trim and use Noxzema little shavers for the summer months.</li>
            <li> perfect tool for the job.  makes grooming a less painful experience.  would def. recommend it over razor blades any day</li>
            <li> Kit comes with a small travel size body lotion which smells real good, a Venus shaver, and the bikini trimmer. I was looking for only the trimmer but the package was a great deal. Trimmer works great, as I expected it should. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp went full fast.</li>
            <li> I just about panicked when I realized these had disappeared from my local drug store and I am so glad I found them on Amazon! They give the perfect trim to a sensitive area that I am not comfortable using a regular razor on. My husband even uses it and he&#x27;s able to get every surface of his (woo!). I hope Amazon never discontinues this product, but just in case, I&#x27;ve ordered three. Each groomer lasts about four months in our house, but when I was single, it lasted nearly a year, probably because only one person was using it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work that great. Got a lot of cuts, had razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;This is the case for a lot of razors though. So could just be me, but these did nothing to help with the sensitivity in the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;Even tried pairing it with bikini shaving gel, didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> This product is handy, easy to use and yields great results. Great for keeping the bikini area neat and tidy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE BIKINI TRIMMER. IT IS SIMPLY AMAZING, AND SO EASY TO USE. GETTING THE RAZOR AND LOTION ALONG WITH THE TRIMMER IS A GREAT VALUE.</li>
            <li> I love the bikini trimmer as it&#x27;s perfect for when I&#x27;m in between Brazilian waxes and can&#x27;t shave. Venus shavers are great in general but the bikini trimmer is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried expensive electrical models as well). These are hard to find as they&#x27;re not typically sold in stores, so I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon sells them!</li>
            <li> Its a good value for what i paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;and the after shave lotion makes it completely worth it.</li>
            <li> great price for product</li>
            <li> It works great if you want to trim and not completely remove hair. I have seriously sensitive skin, and completely shaving the bikini area has always caused problems, WIth this razor, I can get a close cut without taking scissors down there. Just don&#x27;t try to use it right as you step out of the shower. The hair has to be dry to work. I might have to go over an area a few times to get it exactly trimmed, but it does its job, and it does it without maneuvering a mirror, and scissors, and holding the door closed for an hour while your children try to come stampeding in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Gillette Venus Bikini Kit is definitely a useful product. The trimmer certainly does it&#x27;s job by carefully trimming those pesky, unwanted bikini hairs. Although, I have to say I am not sure why some reviews are saying the trimmer is for one time use. I&#x27;ve had my bikini kit for a few months now and with a little cleaning after each use I find my trimmer to still be working just fine. I also love the healing cream that comes with the kit. It has a nice light scent and keeps my skin very smooth. I recommend to every woman!</li>
            <li> There are many good things about this product, but the highlight for me was the safety. I have NEVER used a razor that did not butcher my skin, even the older Gillette Venus brands! This one broke the spell. I&#x27;m very pleased :)</li>
            <li> I was nervous to use this, but it works great!  Easy, fast, convenient way to trim.  I used to get Brazilians and was worried, but this has done exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love these! Can&#x27;t find them in the store anymore and can&#x27;t live without them! Yeah for Amazon!</li>
            <li> They work amazing, i have them for about 2 years and i have no complaints...&lt;br /&gt;i would definitely recommend them.</li>
