            <li>These are good gel products.</li>
            <li>After a while you need to tip the bottles to get good coverage on the brush.</li>
            <li>These are the superior brand in comparison to gelish nails.</li>

            <li>This way I don&#x27;t need to worry about running out and waiting for another delivery to do my own nails again</li>
            <li>I should have purchased these a year ago when I started doing my own shellac.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails</li>
            <li>My daughter and I do our own nails.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>to use drys fast and the best we have found.</li>
            <li>so I wait until the polish comes off on its own.  </li>
            <li>Ive been doing my own shellac nails for over a year.</li>
            <li>comes in handy</li>
            <li>(normally the sand and the sun ruin your nails faster) and still they were perfect!!!</li>
            <li>Love it price even better!</li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve used for my nails so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that the brush it too big and that gellish is better, but I&#x27;m not the best judge.</li>
            <li>Make sure you shake the bottles well before each use.</li>
            <li>B008LV9C4A 250 Pack CREATIVE NAIL</li>
            <li>Great value and the pair ships out really fast.  </li>
            <li>I like it because I don&#x27;t have to buy them more often.</li>
            <li>top coats since February).....</li>
            <li>I purchased the light and the Shellac top, bottom, and color coats from Amazon and every time I do my own nails</li>
            <li>Love the size and value.</li>
            <li>My nails/hands are beautiful with clear polish.  </li>
            <li>So excited to be able to do this at home now.</li>
            <li>Yes, would strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and makes at home shellac easy.</li>
            <li>Great Big Bottles...</li>
            <li>Fabulous product - fabulous service.  </li>
            <li>Overall, was a good deal, I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Originally, purchased all products suggested including the UV light.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy i bought the bigger size, so i don&#x27;t run out quickly.</li>
            <li>Many thanks</li>
            <li>I can see right now with the color choices available</li>
            <li>Now I actually get compliments on how lovely and healthy my nails look.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I love doing our nails, so I highly recommend this for all women.</li>
            <li>Glossy top coat does not dull and stays glassy.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li>I order this and arrived on time and the product work very very well</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.++++AAAAA</li>
            <li>Both went on very easy and dry very fast.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you use 90% or higher alcohol on your cotton swabs as your last step.</li>
            <li>I love the larger size.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several brands for gel self manicures and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Both of these products are used quite often so I decided the larger size was more ecconomical for me to purchase.  </li>
            <li>I love changing my polish even before I have to do the big size</li>
            <li>very happy with the quality of this base and top coat.  </li>
            <li>Although it was a large expense,</li>
            <li>fast shipping and price</li>
            <li>and I am ready to try the gel.</li>
            <li>Plus, so much time was saved and the nails were done at my convenience.  </li>
            <li>dipping brush are not soft brown hairs, they are clear, plastic pieces that are strong to spread the thicker substance.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>and I would say, perform a little better.</li>
            <li>not a good product it peels off the minute you finish is not a good product i tried Gelish and that one is great and better price</li>
            <li>Well worth buying the larger size.</li>
            <li>Normal nail polish just chips off after hours...</li>
            <li>Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
            <li>Need to Max strength acetone to remove it, but love that I&#x27;m not touching up my nails every 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li>Although this home shellac does not last for weeks I would say it&#x27;s worth it for me because it definitely last for 6 or 7 days of intense hand washing and Purell.  </li>
            <li>Wish this was less expensive but is an excellent product</li>
            <li>so having these larger ones will last me much longer!!</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased the large size top and base coat.  </li>
            <li>Large bottles that will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I have only used these for one manicure so far</li>
            <li>I did not realize that shellac does not dry</li>

            <li> I did not realize that shellac does not dry</li>
            <li> Base and top coat have proven to be the first to go</li>
            <li> I purchased a dryer for $70 at our local beauty supply, noting it will dry any UV product.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take long at all and its helped me grow my nails</li>
            <li> and I am not a professional.</li>
            <li> This is my second set of CND shellac base &amp; topcoat, and I love it!</li>
            <li> I like the larger bottle because the smaller bottle gets a little goopy after 4 or 5 manicures.  </li>
            <li> I do not use a colour, just the clear base and top coats.</li>
            <li> Over time, I learned that changing colors was not worth the extra work.  </li>
            <li> Do not order from here, as theres others for half the price for the same thing.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how the second half of the bottle will go with respect to that.</li>
            <li> This was for a set of base coat and top coat in the larger sizes.</li>
            <li> I ordered CND non shellac base and top coat.</li>
            <li> (Top .5oz and Base .42oz &amp;#</li>
            <li> I purchased the base, top and 3 colors of CND shellac.  </li>
            <li> I have used some others that cost considerably less</li>
            <li> but i waste my money with this one almost 50 dollars down the drain :</li>
            <li> Have been using CND Shellac Base and Top &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; for the past year and a half.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the it stays thin to the very last of the product.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin and poor nails.  </li>
            <li> It is not as difficult to remove as the salon polish.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it price even better!</li>
            <li> Ordered this because it said a set of two, not one of each. The bottles are not any bigger than the one you order seperate.  Do not order from here, as theres others for half the price for the same thing.  RIPOFF</li>
            <li> I have used this before and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This was for a set of base coat and top coat in the larger sizes. Overall, was a good deal, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> not a good product it peels off the minute you finish is not a good product i tried Gelish and that one is great and better price you will have 6 pieces for 42 dollars !!! ,my nails are great now but i waste my money with this one almost 50 dollars down the drain :_(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that the brush it too big and that gellish is better, but I&#x27;m not the best judge. I do this as a hobby so I think they work as I would expect it to.</li>
            <li> Product seems defective.  It slides off in a day.</li>
            <li> Great set. Make sure that you use 90% or higher alcohol on your cotton swabs as your last step. Otherwise, your nails will be sticky and you will think the polish didn&#x27;t work. This polish can be removed by pulling off the polish. It is not as difficult to remove as the salon polish. It does wear well, though.</li>
            <li> Very good product just like what my salon has. So excited to be able to do this at home now. Five stars!</li>
            <li> CND all products are good.</li>
            <li> Stellar product as usual.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best buy! I do my nails at home every 2 weeks, so I do go through a lot of this product. Its a must have.</li>
            <li> These are great products and a must if you are using The CND Shellac Process. I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> This is a must have size for us shellac ladies. I am so happy i bought the bigger size, so i don&#x27;t run out quickly. My daughter and I love doing our nails, so I highly recommend this for all women. Nice size. Wonderful product</li>
            <li> Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used for my nails so far. Only thing that keeps polish on my nails, very lasting</li>
            <li> These are good gel products. I have used some others that cost considerably less and I would say, perform a little better.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that these bottle are bigger and I don&#x27;t have to buy them so often. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I did not realize that shellac does not dry and so it can be use as a basecoat with regular polish.  I lke CND polish, however.  I ordered CND non shellac base and top coat.</li>
            <li> This is my second set of CND shellac base &amp; topcoat, and I love it! It goes on smooth and makes at home shellac easy. Make sure you shake the bottles well before each use. After a while you need to tip the bottles to get good coverage on the brush. I only use CND shellac. I like the soak off pads too. [[ASIN:B008LV9C4A 250 Pack CREATIVE NAIL Shellac CND REMOVER WRAPS Gel UV Polish Manicure Soak Off]]</li>
            <li> Great value and the pair ships out really fast.  I love the larger size.  I&#x27;m hoping the it stays thin to the very last of the product.  I&#x27;m a big fan of CND products!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality! I order this and arrived on time and the product work very very well my nails last for two entire weeks and btw I went to the beach twice (normally the sand and the sun ruin your nails faster) and still they were perfect!!!</li>
            <li> you order this and you will get 2 smaller bottles, both are (.25fl oz) not  (Top .5oz and Base .42oz &amp;#34;Set of 2&amp;#34; Big Size)</li>
            <li> Great Big Bottles...Great Price, good deal...Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Well worth buying the larger size. This way I don&#x27;t need to worry about running out and waiting for another delivery to do my own nails again</li>
            <li> I like it because I don&#x27;t have to buy them more often. It&#x27;s the same quality product just bigger. I just love it!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.++++AAAAA</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased the large size top and base coat.  I can see right now with the color choices available I will not want to run out of this.</li>
            <li> Shellac is the way to go! I bought these for DIY at home. These are the superior brand in comparison to gelish nails. The gel nails last a week, the shellac 2+ weeks for me. Even manual labor doesn&#x27;t phase this polish. This set is a great buy and cannot be bought in stores. Large bottles that will last a long time. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> You will also need to buy a nail curer lamp and shellac REMOVER. it doesn&#x27;t take long at all and its helped me grow my nails out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dipping brush are not soft brown hairs, they are clear, plastic pieces that are strong to spread the thicker substance. Well made.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands for gel self manicures and this is my favorite.  This brand is more expensive that comparable products though.  I like the larger bottle because the smaller bottle gets a little goopy after 4 or 5 manicures.  I have only used these for one manicure so far so I don&#x27;t know how the second half of the bottle will go with respect to that.</li>
            <li> Both of these products are used quite often so I decided the larger size was more ecconomical for me to purchase.  Both went on very easy and dry very fast.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll keep ordering! what a great deal and service.</li>
            <li> These 2 bottles are certainly larger than the standard sizes. Very pleased!! I should have purchased these a year ago when I started doing my own shellac. Base and top coat have proven to be the first to go (I&#x27;ve already purchased 2-.25fl oz. top coats since February).....so having these larger ones will last me much longer!!</li>
            <li> Shipping sluggish, even with prime, but product as described and works excellently.</li>
            <li> Wish this was less expensive but is an excellent product</li>
            <li> very happy with the quality of this base and top coat.  no complaints.  Goes on well and the top coat leaves your nails looking shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it - manicures really do last 2-3 wks.  Need to Max strength acetone to remove it, but love that I&#x27;m not touching up my nails every 3-4 days.  Glossy top coat does not dull and stays glassy.</li>
            <li> I purchased the base, top and 3 colors of CND shellac.  At the time of purchase, I didn&#x27;t realize you must use the CND UV dryer in order to obtain any results.  I purchased a dryer for $70 at our local beauty supply, noting it will dry any UV product.  It doesn&#x27;t!  You must use the CND dryer.  I went back onto Amazon and purchased the CND dryer.  All my shipments from Amazon arrived in a timely fashion, within the timeframe emailed to me and in good shape.  I am very pleased with all the products I received.  Thank  you!</li>
            <li> fast shipping and price</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and I am not a professional.I like this brand but it is too runny.If you are not carefull you will get lifting.This product is like a nail polish consistency. I have been useing it for 6 months and I am ready to try the gel.</li>
            <li> Very good product! My daughter and I do our own nails.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use drys fast and the best we have found.</li>
            <li> I have been using shellac polish for about a year now.  I like these larger sizes so that I don&#x27;t have to order as often.  They are both good products.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product - fabulous service.  Many thanks</li>
            <li> Have been using CND Shellac Base and Top &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; for the past year and a half.  Originally, purchased all products suggested including the UV light.  Although it was a large expense, the investment paid for itself in just five (5) months.  Plus, so much time was saved and the nails were done at my convenience.  The remover pads do not work so I wait until the polish comes off on its own.  Over time, I learned that changing colors was not worth the extra work.  My nails/hands are beautiful with clear polish.  Always receive compliments.  Yes, would strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Perfect!!! Now I can do my nails the way I had it done at the nail salon!! Once again, great buy! Great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased the light and the Shellac top, bottom, and color coats from Amazon and every time I do my own nails I say &amp;#34;I just made $35.00!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love the size and value.</li>
            <li> Ive been doing my own shellac nails for over a year. I love changing my polish even before I have to do the big size comes in handy</li>
            <li> Fab product, great delivery</li>
            <li> I have very thin and poor nails.  Normal nail polish just chips off after hours...it seems they are so flexible and bendy that the nail polish just cracks off.  I turned to shellac after hearing people at work (health care) talk about how shellac obtained from the nail salon lasts for weeks.  Although this home shellac does not last for weeks I would say it&#x27;s worth it for me because it definitely last for 6 or 7 days of intense hand washing and Purell.  Now I actually get compliments on how lovely and healthy my nails look.  I do not use a colour, just the clear base and top coats.</li>
