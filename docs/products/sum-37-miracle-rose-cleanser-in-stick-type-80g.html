            <li>The stick is so convenient and easy.</li>
            <li>smells so good and really makes my skin feel dewy fresh!</li>
            <li>I use the Rose stick first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and feel smooth after using it</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s kind of huge.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and clean and the smell is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It takes off my mascara with no problem and leaves my face so  smooth.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt pores are reduced as if you exfoliate it.</li>

            <li>It cleanses gently while being effective.  </li>
            <li>It has a light rose smell, gently exfoliates, and throughly cleanses.</li>
            <li>I also love the packaging -- it&#x27;s perfect for travel and the unique design really sets it apart from other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>felt clean but not tight like when all the good oils are washed away.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin smooth, silky and clean.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s unique packaging</li>
            <li>I already bought two before when the prices were significantly higher ($35 and $25) and now I&#x27;m glad to see that it has dropped.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and moisturized after I use it.</li>
            <li>My face felt so clean.</li>
            <li>Rose petals gently exfoliate skin and leave a fresh scent</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my face feel clean and toned.</li>
            <li>It does cleanse really nicely but more importantly my face did not feel dry and taught after.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s super travel friendly because it&#x27;s not a liquid or gel.</li>
            <li>Cool and seductive idea.</li>
            <li>Overall, if you are looking for a nice, non drying cleanser that is good for sensitive skin, this one may be for you.</li>
            <li>I love that there are real petals in the cleansing stick.</li>
            <li>Whether or not that&#x27;s true, I can&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li>Quickly became my holy grail cleanser.</li>
            <li>It does smell wonderful, I like the portable non messy stick form, and it does a decent job cleansing, however, it really burns if you get it in your eyes!!</li>
            <li>Very gentle and travel friendly.  </li>
            <li>Pretty, has bits of real roses in it and smells lovely if it&#x27;s a fresh batch.  </li>
            <li>Such a lovely product!  </li>
            <li>A fine product that soften your skin, gentle for sensitive skin and smells quite lovely too.</li>
            <li>I bought this cleansing stick on a whim because I&#x27;ve heard such amazing things</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and leaves my face feeling really clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel velvety soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I feel that&#x27;s worth $5 or $7.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait and the price.</li>
            <li>Love the convenience of the hands free method, but worried about the bacteria lingering on the stick after daily use.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The cleansing stick really helps make pores appear smaller and gives skin a really gorgeous glow.</li>
            <li>The intriguing method of packaging this cleanser is half the fun in using it - the other is the delightful and natural rose fragrance.</li>
            <li>I will never be without the Sum37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick as long as it exists!</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the skin and smells pretty.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think this is an ok cleanser but not the miracle it was made out to be.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I can feel the difference.</li>
            <li>It makes washing your face feel like a luxury, it smells so rosey and the lather is very luxurious!  </li>
            <li>You most likely won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>just starting using it - will update review after a while with more details on how it is working.</li>
            <li>Wish I had bought the duo the first time around.</li>
            <li>I use this in the morning as my first step, and in the evening after I&#x27;ve used an oil cleanser to remove all my makeup.</li>
            <li>My assumption with most Korean face cleansing products is that they&#x27;re meant to be used in the multiple step cleanse process and using it otherwise won&#x27;t give the desired results.</li>
            <li>All I know is that using this product has improved my skin and made my evening routine much nicer!</li>
            <li>It looks and works like a giant Elmer&#x27;s gluestick which I thought was cute.</li>
            <li>Absolutely divine and leaves your skin so fresh.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s in this</li>
            <li>First I remove my make up with a cleansing water like Koh Gen Do (mineral spa cleansing water) or an oil cleanser.</li>
            <li>I will most likely get one for my daughter because of the ease of use and the gentleness of this product.</li>
            <li>Other reviews said that the rose petals imbedded in the stick acted as a sort of exfoliant, but I haven&#x27;t found them to be this useful, but they add a kind of romantic aspect to washing your face, as well as some natural essence</li>
            <li>Only used it 3 days but so far I love it!</li>
            <li>Its gentle face wash, does not irritate the skin and has pleasant fragrance..will definitely repurchase once I am finished with the current one</li>
            <li>It has a light, delicate rose scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, with little bits of rose petals that act to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am not yet halfway through with the stick, but already plan to purchase another because I enjoy using it so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive on Soko Glam, as in $5-9 more, just saying!</li>
            <li>Pretty decent product.</li>
            <li>Gets a nice little foam going when you rub it on.</li>
            <li>I just gently swipe along each cheek and the soap lathers very well--enough for my whole face.  </li>
            <li>This way I only need to use a tiny bit and massage it into my face using a circular motion, which smells amazing and feels so luxurious.</li>
            <li>really, it&#x27;s just a bar of soap in a tube.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and it really seems to have a lot of product.  </li>
            <li>I have a very keen sense of smell.</li>
            <li>gently exfoliate your skin as well.</li>
            <li>At night I do my whole face routine.  </li>
            <li>I apply it straight to my face and then rub it with my hands.  </li>
            <li>but the product did get shipped fast.    </li>
            <li>I can see why there&#x27;s so much hype surrounding it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to get through airport TSA without having to worry about your skincare liquid products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle, foamy lather that cleans well without overdrying.</li>
            <li>Gentle cleaner that does not strip your skin.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to get a gentle lather going.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle, not drying.</li>
            <li>You can see the bits of exposed roses and those help to gently exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Nice size to last for several months</li>
            <li>Oil cleansing, miracle rose cleansing and water cleansing (warm water then cold water).</li>
            <li>Since it has a low pH level, it probably is better for people who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>For a bar/stick cleanser, my face feels clean, but not to super squeaky clean, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>well, if not in the first wash, I just put a little more and everything comes off.</li>
            <li>For anyone familiar with the double cleansing routine, with this soap you almost don&#x27;t need it!</li>
            <li>It really helps your skin look vibrant.</li>
            <li>This cleanser has quickly become my HG second step cleanser.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t particularly care for this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Based on reviews I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Application and traveling with it is easy due to</li>
            <li>It removes any scrap of makeup or oil leaving my skin clean and refreshed rather than dry.</li>
            <li>It keeps pores clean and closed.</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling clean and not dry.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice subtle smell, but the effectiveness is comparable to a drugstore cleanser.</li>
            <li>But this is definitely the only thing I use along with a light moisturizer these days in the summer.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m guessing each stick will last about three to four months with light daily use.</li>
            <li>I do need to apply a light moisturizer afterwards, but I use this product as the second part of a double cleanse method.</li>
            <li>It barely has any rose scent at all, especially compared to other products out there.</li>
            <li>, it just makes it seem more luxurious, although, I&#x27;m not certain it actually makes a difference</li>
            <li>but it makes my skin very soft even without exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I am in love, and worth the wait and hype!</li>
            <li>I use it as the second step of the Oil Cleansing Method in the evening, in which I first massage a homemade oil blend (olive, castor, camellia, jojoba, argan &amp; marula) into my face for a couple of minutes, rinse, and follow up by massaging in this cleanser for 2-3 minutes; I follow the 2 cleansing steps up with toner, serum, and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is portable and good for travel due to it being a stick, but I hardly use it since it burns my eyes so much.</li>
            <li>You can get rose soap from WholeFoods for $5 or less that will work and smell much better than this overly expensive product.</li>
            <li>This product made my relatively clear skin break out.</li>
            <li>My daughter is using it and she has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I really am pleasantly surprised and I will buy again.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really soft.  </li>
            <li>However,  having sensitive skin,  I hadn&#x27;t had any issues with this product like some reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh at all.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin and have not had any reactions to this product.</li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight, but it feels clean after.</li>
            <li>I like the stick-based appliance, but it&#x27;s unhygienic after the first use (dirt and oil will dry on the stick).</li>
            <li>This made me breakout for a week when I first used it, probably because it reset my extremely dry skin&#x27;s pH balance.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, and after a few weeks no new breakouts, and I would say skin is feeling more balanced.</li>
            <li>I think jet-setters and those wanting to break into Korean skin care products could use this as an initial purchase, for a few reasons, decent pricing, hands- free method and overall quality.  </li>
            <li>and it still had at least a couple more weeks left.</li>
            <li>Instructions were in Chinese and I didn&#x27;t really understand just how to use it properly.</li>
            <li>This leaves your skin feeling soft and removed all makeup especially waterproof eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>And the little thing is soft, very soft, like a petal!</li>
            <li>I feel it actually has calmed my sensitive dry skin over time.</li>
            <li>It seems to be fine, since it hasn&#x27;t broken me out, yet.  </li>

            <li> The stick is so convenient and easy.</li>
            <li> smells so good and really makes my skin feel dewy fresh!</li>
            <li> I use the Rose stick first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and feel smooth after using it</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s kind of huge.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and clean and the smell is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> It takes off my mascara with no problem and leaves my face so  smooth.</li>

            <li> The fermented rose is really a treat.</li>
            <li> It cleanses gently while being effective.  </li>
            <li> It has a light rose smell, gently exfoliates, and throughly cleanses.</li>
            <li> I also love the packaging -- it&#x27;s perfect for travel and the unique design really sets it apart from other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> felt clean but not tight like when all the good oils are washed away.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin smooth, silky and clean.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unique packaging</li>
            <li> I already bought two before when the prices were significantly higher ($35 and $25) and now I&#x27;m glad to see that it has dropped.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and moisturized after I use it.</li>
            <li> My face felt so clean.</li>
            <li> Rose petals gently exfoliate skin and leave a fresh scent</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my face feel clean and toned.</li>
            <li> It does cleanse really nicely but more importantly my face did not feel dry and taught after.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s super travel friendly because it&#x27;s not a liquid or gel.</li>
            <li> Cool and seductive idea.</li>
            <li> Overall, if you are looking for a nice, non drying cleanser that is good for sensitive skin, this one may be for you.</li>
            <li> I love that there are real petals in the cleansing stick.</li>
            <li> Whether or not that&#x27;s true, I can&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li> Quickly became my holy grail cleanser.</li>
            <li> It does smell wonderful, I like the portable non messy stick form, and it does a decent job cleansing, however, it really burns if you get it in your eyes!!</li>
            <li> Very gentle and travel friendly.  </li>
            <li> Pretty, has bits of real roses in it and smells lovely if it&#x27;s a fresh batch.  </li>
            <li> Such a lovely product!  </li>
            <li> A fine product that soften your skin, gentle for sensitive skin and smells quite lovely too.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleansing stick on a whim because I&#x27;ve heard such amazing things</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and leaves my face feeling really clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel velvety soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I feel that&#x27;s worth $5 or $7.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait and the price.</li>
            <li> Love the convenience of the hands free method, but worried about the bacteria lingering on the stick after daily use.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The cleansing stick really helps make pores appear smaller and gives skin a really gorgeous glow.</li>
            <li> The intriguing method of packaging this cleanser is half the fun in using it - the other is the delightful and natural rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> I will never be without the Sum37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick as long as it exists!</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin and smells pretty.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think this is an ok cleanser but not the miracle it was made out to be.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> It makes washing your face feel like a luxury, it smells so rosey and the lather is very luxurious!  </li>
            <li> You most likely won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> just starting using it - will update review after a while with more details on how it is working.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought the duo the first time around.</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning as my first step, and in the evening after I&#x27;ve used an oil cleanser to remove all my makeup.</li>
            <li> My assumption with most Korean face cleansing products is that they&#x27;re meant to be used in the multiple step cleanse process and using it otherwise won&#x27;t give the desired results.</li>
            <li> All I know is that using this product has improved my skin and made my evening routine much nicer!</li>
            <li> It looks and works like a giant Elmer&#x27;s gluestick which I thought was cute.</li>
            <li> Absolutely divine and leaves your skin so fresh.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s in this</li>
            <li> First I remove my make up with a cleansing water like Koh Gen Do (mineral spa cleansing water) or an oil cleanser.</li>
            <li> I will most likely get one for my daughter because of the ease of use and the gentleness of this product.</li>
            <li> Other reviews said that the rose petals imbedded in the stick acted as a sort of exfoliant, but I haven&#x27;t found them to be this useful, but they add a kind of romantic aspect to washing your face, as well as some natural essence</li>
            <li> Only used it 3 days but so far I love it!</li>
            <li> Its gentle face wash, does not irritate the skin and has pleasant fragrance..will definitely repurchase once I am finished with the current one</li>
            <li> It has a light, delicate rose scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, with little bits of rose petals that act to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am not yet halfway through with the stick, but already plan to purchase another because I enjoy using it so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive on Soko Glam, as in $5-9 more, just saying!</li>
            <li> Pretty decent product.</li>
            <li> Gets a nice little foam going when you rub it on.</li>
            <li> I just gently swipe along each cheek and the soap lathers very well--enough for my whole face.  </li>
            <li> This way I only need to use a tiny bit and massage it into my face using a circular motion, which smells amazing and feels so luxurious.</li>
            <li> really, it&#x27;s just a bar of soap in a tube.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and it really seems to have a lot of product.  </li>
            <li> I have a very keen sense of smell.</li>
            <li> gently exfoliate your skin as well.</li>
            <li> At night I do my whole face routine.  </li>
            <li> I apply it straight to my face and then rub it with my hands.  </li>
            <li> but the product did get shipped fast.    </li>
            <li> I can see why there&#x27;s so much hype surrounding it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to get through airport TSA without having to worry about your skincare liquid products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle, foamy lather that cleans well without overdrying.</li>
            <li> Gentle cleaner that does not strip your skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to get a gentle lather going.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle, not drying.</li>
            <li> You can see the bits of exposed roses and those help to gently exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Nice size to last for several months</li>
            <li> Oil cleansing, miracle rose cleansing and water cleansing (warm water then cold water).</li>
            <li> Since it has a low pH level, it probably is better for people who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For a bar/stick cleanser, my face feels clean, but not to super squeaky clean, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> well, if not in the first wash, I just put a little more and everything comes off.</li>
            <li> For anyone familiar with the double cleansing routine, with this soap you almost don&#x27;t need it!</li>
            <li> It really helps your skin look vibrant.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has quickly become my HG second step cleanser.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t particularly care for this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Based on reviews I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Application and traveling with it is easy due to</li>
            <li> It removes any scrap of makeup or oil leaving my skin clean and refreshed rather than dry.</li>
            <li> It keeps pores clean and closed.</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling clean and not dry.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice subtle smell, but the effectiveness is comparable to a drugstore cleanser.</li>
            <li> But this is definitely the only thing I use along with a light moisturizer these days in the summer.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m guessing each stick will last about three to four months with light daily use.</li>
            <li> I do need to apply a light moisturizer afterwards, but I use this product as the second part of a double cleanse method.</li>
            <li> It barely has any rose scent at all, especially compared to other products out there.</li>
            <li> , it just makes it seem more luxurious, although, I&#x27;m not certain it actually makes a difference</li>
            <li> but it makes my skin very soft even without exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am in love, and worth the wait and hype!</li>
            <li> I use it as the second step of the Oil Cleansing Method in the evening, in which I first massage a homemade oil blend (olive, castor, camellia, jojoba, argan &amp; marula) into my face for a couple of minutes, rinse, and follow up by massaging in this cleanser for 2-3 minutes; I follow the 2 cleansing steps up with toner, serum, and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is portable and good for travel due to it being a stick, but I hardly use it since it burns my eyes so much.</li>
            <li> You can get rose soap from WholeFoods for $5 or less that will work and smell much better than this overly expensive product.</li>
            <li> This product made my relatively clear skin break out.</li>
            <li> My daughter is using it and she has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I really am pleasantly surprised and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really soft.  </li>
            <li> However,  having sensitive skin,  I hadn&#x27;t had any issues with this product like some reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh at all.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin and have not had any reactions to this product.</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight, but it feels clean after.</li>
            <li> I like the stick-based appliance, but it&#x27;s unhygienic after the first use (dirt and oil will dry on the stick).</li>
            <li> This made me breakout for a week when I first used it, probably because it reset my extremely dry skin&#x27;s pH balance.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, and after a few weeks no new breakouts, and I would say skin is feeling more balanced.</li>
            <li> I think jet-setters and those wanting to break into Korean skin care products could use this as an initial purchase, for a few reasons, decent pricing, hands- free method and overall quality.  </li>
            <li> and it still had at least a couple more weeks left.</li>
            <li> Instructions were in Chinese and I didn&#x27;t really understand just how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin feeling soft and removed all makeup especially waterproof eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> And the little thing is soft, very soft, like a petal!</li>
            <li> I feel it actually has calmed my sensitive dry skin over time.</li>
            <li> It seems to be fine, since it hasn&#x27;t broken me out, yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various other products after my oil cleanse step, but this is the only cleanser so far that has worked as well as</li>
            <li> It feels like any other face soap, but, doesn&#x27;t cleanse nearly as well.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get here, and in the time it took for it to ship out, the price kept dropping but the seller would not adjust the price i paid.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and can wash my face twice a day without my skin feeling dried out.  </li>
            <li> and I will continue to purchase it for as long as Su:</li>
            <li> and I expected it to be smaller.</li>
            <li> Took long to arrive.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m home I do like to leave it open so the soap doesn&#x27;t stay soggy for as long as if it was closed.  </li>
            <li> I was using Hada Labo&#x27;s Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Cleansing Foam but was still finding my face was a bit dry after washing.</li>
            <li> my skin never feels too dry after I use it.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin &amp; my skin is not feeling dry after waaging my fave with this</li>
            <li> (It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much soap other users are using, but personally for me, a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not good at or used to using bar soap, but this doesn&#x27;t lather much for me.</li>
            <li> My face is firm but not dried up or itchy like other cleansers.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it and tired it</li>
            <li> I have been using this for six months and still have half of the stick left.  </li>
            <li> It can be slightly drying when not used as part of the double cleanse method</li>
            <li> It needs to be applied to a slightly damp face and will instantly lather up.  </li>
            <li> I generally wet my face and rub this stick on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> I try to work it around with my fingers, but not much lather comes up whether I have makeup on or just sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Simply wet your face and massage the stock over your skin, lather up and rinse.  </li>
            <li> I will normally wet my face, rub the stick all over my face, massage my face with my hands, and then rinse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not worth the expensive price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to see how long this stick will last me because compared to other cleansers I&#x27;ve used in the past, the price is a bit steep ($36.89).  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> , other reviewers tout the exfoliating benefits. ??</li>
            <li> I usually use it as the second step of my cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where all the other reviewers are getting the luxurious scent and feel from.</li>
            <li> Unlike any other packaging I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight after washing and my breakouts have actually gone down a little since using it.</li>
            <li> A slight drying feeling after washing but other than that she loves it.</li>
            <li> It feels so moisturized even after you cleanse it down.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m updating my review because although it does everything I mentioned in my previous review, my skin (combination eczema) felt overly tight after washing.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t noticed it making my skin too tight.</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t strip your skin and make it tight.</li>
            <li> Took care of all the little bumps and blemishes and pimples.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does feel a little filmy after cleansing, and my skin does need moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> I do like the dried roses</li>
            <li> My skin has noticeably improved since using this product for the past month</li>
            <li> Expensive for facial soap</li>
            <li> Its a bit expensive but this cleaning stick is terrific.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything of it before since I use thick creams to maintain moisture.</li>
            <li> A little expensive though...</li>
            <li> so I can have extras since the line is discontinued due to issues importing the roses :(</li>
            <li> But nothing bad to say about the product about the price.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 3 weeks. My skin feels clean and moisturized after I use it. My complexion is looking great. Highly recommend. Great for travel!</li>
            <li> If this was actually sold in stores in the US it would be crazy popular here to. It lathers so well, so much more than I was expecting. The rose scent is very light, and calming, specially at night. For a bar/stick cleanser, my face feels clean, but not to super squeaky clean, if you know what I mean. My skin is soft, and after a few weeks no new breakouts, and I would say skin is feeling more balanced. I can&#x27;t wait to take this on vacation. I do tend to use this more at night, and use a clay cleanser in the a.m. But you could use it for both. Needless to say I am in love, and worth the wait and hype!</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin feeling soft and removed all makeup especially waterproof eyeliner. I would purchase again even though it&#x27;s pricey but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for traveling and works just as stated.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. So easy to use and leaves my face feeling really clean but not dried out. Buy it if you can get your hands on it!</li>
            <li> |It is amazing.  It takes off my mascara with no problem and leaves my face so  smooth. It is good or better then my Philosophy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Will be ordering some more before I run out!</li>
            <li> Easy to use product and feels luxurious. A little expensive though...</li>
            <li> Great product!  Makes my skin feel velvety soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I read an article online that hyped up this product so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It does smell wonderful, I like the portable non messy stick form, and it does a decent job cleansing, however, it really burns if you get it in your eyes!! Overall I think this is an ok cleanser but not the miracle it was made out to be. Probably will not repurchase, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I too read about this on a beauty blog, where it&#x27;s scent and benefits were talked up in a big way. It is portable and good for travel due to it being a stick, but I hardly use it since it burns my eyes so much. Maybe I&#x27;m not good at or used to using bar soap, but this doesn&#x27;t lather much for me. I generally wet my face and rub this stick on my cheeks and forehead. I try to work it around with my fingers, but not much lather comes up whether I have makeup on or just sunscreen. I have combo skin so I haven&#x27;t noticed it making my skin too tight.</li>
            <li> Really smells wonderful and easy to use.  Left my skin feeling clean and not dry.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that is perfect for my skin. It keeps pores clean and closed. My face is firm but not dried up or itchy like other cleansers. I&#x27;m on my second purchase.</li>
            <li> best cleanser ever. i love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Cool and seductive idea. Smells great! --but really, it&#x27;s just a bar of soap in a tube. I&#x27;m not sure why I didn&#x27;t realize that in the first place. My daughter is using it and she has sensitive skin -- she suspects it is the culprit in a couple recent breakouts.</li>
            <li> Best face cleanser, leaves skin soft with a beautiful rose scent.  I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This face wash smells great and is gentle on my skin.  I&#x27;m not sure how much soap other users are using, but personally for me, a little goes a long way!  I just gently swipe along each cheek and the soap lathers very well--enough for my whole face.  It has a light, delicate rose scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, with little bits of rose petals that act to exfoliate.  I&#x27;ll have to see how long this stick will last me because compared to other cleansers I&#x27;ve used in the past, the price is a bit steep ($36.89).  If it was under $25, I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li> My skin has noticeably improved since using this product for the past month and I have gotten so many compliment on it. My breakouts are halved and keep getting better. I just now need to see if this company makes a dark-spot corrector/brightener and I will try that too!</li>
            <li> Pretty, has bits of real roses in it and smells lovely if it&#x27;s a fresh batch.  Expensive for facial soap but it is low ph which is the only reason I have repurchased. Good for travel.</li>
            <li> Its gentle face wash, does not irritate the skin and has pleasant fragrance..will definitely repurchase once I am finished with the current one</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and the product design is great for washing over the sink and packing for travel without worrying about leaking. Smells good. Love it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Love the smell.. Easy to use and feel smooth after using it</li>
            <li> Smells good. I love using it. Package came in time frame posted.</li>
            <li> super nice and smells great</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. The first time I used it I can feel the difference. My face felt so clean.</li>
            <li> I will never be without the Sum37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick as long as it exists! It makes washing your face feel like a luxury, it smells so rosey and the lather is very luxurious!  The ph balance of this is a perfect 5.5, which is great for keeping your son balanced and acid mantle in tact.  Simply wet your face and massage the stock over your skin, lather up and rinse.  I use this as the second step after an oil cleanse to take off makeup and my skin has never felt or looked better!  Such a lovely product!  It lasts forever also!</li>
            <li> Pretty decent product. It took a long time to get here, and in the time it took for it to ship out, the price kept dropping but the seller would not adjust the price i paid. I can&#x27;t say that it was worth it money, but it&#x27;s a good cleanser, as soon as any quality kind. It was an impulse buy on my part. But nothing bad to say about the product about the price. Feels nice on my skin, smells nice, i like it. Would I buy it again? Not for more than $15. I paid $40 for this.</li>
            <li> I love this stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Miracle Rose cleansing stick has a very nice and light scent to it and does a really nice job of cleansing one&#x27;s face without stripping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the innovative design and it really seems to have a lot of product.  Overall, if you are looking for a nice, non drying cleanser that is good for sensitive skin, this one may be for you.</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing stick. I was using Hada Labo&#x27;s Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Cleansing Foam but was still finding my face was a bit dry after washing. I bought this cleansing stick on a whim because I&#x27;ve heard such amazing things and I love it. I put some on a konjac sponge and i&#x27;m able to wash my face / neck easily. My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight after washing and my breakouts have actually gone down a little since using it. Will be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> Im African American with combination oily skin.Leaves your skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt pores are reduced as if you exfoliate it. Very pleasant light rose scentGreat for travel just throwing your back no worries of spills or leakage. Nice size to last for several months</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this cleaning stick. Great for travel because I don&#x27;t have to deal with spills. Removes my non-waterproof mascara well, if not in the first wash, I just put a little more and everything comes off. Smells amazing, like fresh roses!</li>
            <li> Very gentle and travel friendly.  The plastic feels cheap but the product works and smells lovely. It is easy to use,  store,  and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. Gets all my makeup off, and exfoliates beautifully. my skin never feels too dry after I use it. I have combination oily and dry skin. I also have problems with acne and whiteheads / blackheads. My skin has never looked better! Took care of all the little bumps and blemishes and pimples.I still haven&#x27;t used my entire stick but I bought 2 more so I wouldn&#x27;t run out! Love love love love love this product. I can never do without it!</li>
            <li> This is such a great soap!! For one thing, the ingredients are impressive and so good for the skin. For anyone familiar with the double cleansing routine, with this soap you almost don&#x27;t need it! It removes makeup and dirt so well without leaving your face feeling stripped. Also, it&#x27;s a great buy for the money. This stick lasted me a year! Take into account that I use it once a day, but I still have a couple months of uses left. And it&#x27;s super travel friendly because it&#x27;s not a liquid or gel. Buy it! You most likely won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Based on reviews I had high hopes. When I first opened it and tired it I thought &amp;#34; oh, its basically a bar of soap in a tube for my face&amp;#34; I rubbed the stick on my face and then lathered it with my hands. It does cleanse really nicely but more importantly my face did not feel dry and taught after. I feel it actually has calmed my sensitive dry skin over time. I really am pleasantly surprised and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have dry skin &amp; my skin is not feeling dry after waaging my fave with this and it smells great!</li>
            <li> This cleanser smells like roses and it incredibly travel friendly.  It makes my skin feel really soft.  I use it as a 2nd cleanse after oil cleansing.  When I&#x27;m home I do like to leave it open so the soap doesn&#x27;t stay soggy for as long as if it was closed.  I will normally wet my face, rub the stick all over my face, massage my face with my hands, and then rinse.</li>
            <li> i like this wash - it is easy to use and feels great on my skin and smells wonderful.  just starting using it - will update review after a while with more details on how it is working.</li>
            <li> Perfect cleanser especially for going on trips. Gentle and great for all skin types. Rose petals gently exfoliate skin and leave a fresh scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit baffled by most of the reviews. I have a very keen sense of smell. It smells like ivory soap to me. I regularly use rosewater that I bought at the health store as a spray after cleansing and to set my mineral makeup. No similarity whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does feel a little filmy after cleansing, and my skin does need moisturizer. However,  having sensitive skin,  I hadn&#x27;t had any issues with this product like some reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, other reviewers tout the exfoliating benefits. ?? There is one mm. piece of petal that will come off once in awhile -- maybe one a week. And the little thing is soft, very soft, like a petal! It does not exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $33+. I give it 2 stars because the method of application is handy to throw in my bike bag or backpack to keep me clean on the go. I feel that&#x27;s worth $5 or $7.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STICK. It smells amazing, looks so luxurious and cleans so well. I usually use it as the second step of my cleansing routine. No complaints - gets the job done, smells and feels great, not drying. Gets a nice little foam going when you rub it on. Will repurchase! Wish I had bought the duo the first time around.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleaning product EVER!  I have bought this as gifts for my friends and they love it.  Totally worth the price. I have been using this for six months and still have half of the stick left.  I have really sensitive skin and can wash my face twice a day without my skin feeling dried out.  I will never use another cleanser.</li>
            <li> Easily the best cleanser I have ever used. It smells amazing, feels luxurious, and the rose petals found in the cleanser gently exfoliate your skin as well. I use this in the morning as my first step, and in the evening after I&#x27;ve used an oil cleanser to remove all my makeup. I&#x27;ve already ordered two more so I can have extras since the line is discontinued due to issues importing the roses :(</li>
            <li> At night I do my whole face routine.  I cleanse, exfoliate and moisturize. When I sleep with all of that, I wake up in the morning and just cleanse my face with this.  It&#x27;s not harsh at all.  It&#x27;s a perfect soap for your face. I apply it straight to my face and then rub it with my hands.  Pat dry and your face is flawless.  It feels so moisturized even after you cleanse it down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where all the other reviewers are getting the luxurious scent and feel from. It feels like any other face soap, but, doesn&#x27;t cleanse nearly as well. It barely has any rose scent at all, especially compared to other products out there. You can get rose soap from WholeFoods for $5 or less that will work and smell much better than this overly expensive product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Worth the wait and the price. Love the scent and the packaging. Quickly became my holy grail cleanser.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has quickly become my HG second step cleanser. It has a light rose smell, gently exfoliates, and throughly cleanses. I have sensitive, combination skin and have not had any reactions to this product. If anything, I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or even a zit since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention though that I would not suggest using this as a solo cleanser. It can be slightly drying when not used as part of the double cleanse method and I actually think that&#x27;s the point since the first cleansing step is usually an oil cleanser. My assumption with most Korean face cleansing products is that they&#x27;re meant to be used in the multiple step cleanse process and using it otherwise won&#x27;t give the desired results. I&#x27;ve used various other products after my oil cleanse step, but this is the only cleanser so far that has worked as well as it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely purchase if you do the double cleanse, otherwise if you&#x27;re looking for a one step,  all-in-one cleanser;  this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> The intriguing method of packaging this cleanser is half the fun in using it - the other is the delightful and natural rose fragrance. Best of all, my skin did indeed feel soft and gently cleansed after using it. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Love the convenience of the hands free method, but worried about the bacteria lingering on the stick after daily use.  It seems to be fine, since it hasn&#x27;t broken me out, yet.  Directions are in Korean, but pictures were included.  It needs to be applied to a slightly damp face and will instantly lather up.  I do like the dried roses, it just makes it seem more luxurious, although, I&#x27;m not certain it actually makes a difference (maybe for others?).  I think jet-setters and those wanting to break into Korean skin care products could use this as an initial purchase, for a few reasons, decent pricing, hands- free method and overall quality.  I would probably buy this again, especially from Amazon.  It&#x27;s more expensive on Soko Glam, as in $5-9 more, just saying!</li>
            <li> This is a nice cleanser in a travel friendly formula. I have combo acne prone skin and this doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight, but it feels clean after.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it. She loved the rose smell and that the lather is creamy. A slight drying feeling after washing but other than that she loves it.</li>
            <li> I already purchased one of these from a Korean website because I am a Su:m37 lover and will always purchase their products. However, this is the perfect cleanser for those that are traveling and has a low pH so it won&#x27;t strip your skin and make it tight. It can remove make-up but I still use the double cleansing method anyways this taking place as the second cleanser. I also use this just as my morning cleanser as well. It comes in very beautiful packaging and bonus points go to the rose petals in it. For an in-depth review check out my review on my blog here: https://bethanyirwin.wordpress.com/2015/02/20/sum37-miracle-rose-cleansing-stick/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second stick and I will continue to purchase it for as long as Su:m37 keeps it in stock.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Great to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;Face felt clean but not tight like when all the good oils are washed away.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Helps brighten your skin. The smell is divine. I love that there are real petals in the cleansing stick. I recommend the 2-4-2 method. Oil cleansing, miracle rose cleansing and water cleansing (warm water then cold water). And method means minutes of cleansing. It really helps your skin look vibrant. Cheaper elsewhere but the product did get shipped fast.    Update November 26, 2014    So I&#x27;m updating my review because although it does everything I mentioned in my previous review, my skin (combination eczema) felt overly tight after washing. I didn&#x27;t think anything of it before since I use thick creams to maintain moisture. But the tightness on my skin after every wash has taken a toll on me. So this  product is  just not for me given the price and the performance of the product. I&#x27;m giving it three stars because I purchased this in August and it still had at least a couple more weeks left.</li>
            <li> I like the stick-based appliance, but it&#x27;s unhygienic after the first use (dirt and oil will dry on the stick). It has a really nice subtle smell, but the effectiveness is comparable to a drugstore cleanser. Since it has a low pH level, it probably is better for people who have sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone who is looking for a deep cleanser or a makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the expensive price.</li>
            <li> Only used it 3 days but so far I love it! The stick is so convenient and easy. Skin feels soft and clean and the smell is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> smells so good and really makes my skin feel dewy fresh!</li>
            <li> Have been using this cleanser for a month I can see why there&#x27;s so much hype surrounding it. A little pricey but it makes my skin very soft even without exfoliation. Smells great and is very convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> Holy grail product! Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a balm type face wash to remove my makeup before using the Rose Cleansing Stick. This way I only need to use a tiny bit and massage it into my face using a circular motion, which smells amazing and feels so luxurious. It removes any scrap of makeup or oil leaving my skin clean and refreshed rather than dry. The fermented rose is really a treat. I&#x27;ve read quite a bit about fermented ingredients being great skin care actives. Whether or not that&#x27;s true, I can&#x27;t say. All I know is that using this product has improved my skin and made my evening routine much nicer! I also love the packaging -- it&#x27;s perfect for travel and the unique design really sets it apart from other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Got it within the estimated delivery time. Item is legit, and i really love the smell and usefulness of cleanser on a stick.</li>
            <li> Closest I come to finding the ideal one step cleanser for face.&lt;br /&gt;I used to struggle with oil cleanser then foaming cleanser to get sunscreen and makeup off each night.&lt;br /&gt;This lovely rose scented creamy cleanser in a stick does the job more efficiently and gently that all that.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect TSA friendly carryon!  Will buy more since its a d/c&#x27;d item</li>
            <li> The product came on time and I have been using it since I&#x27;ve received it. It leaves the skin smooth, silky and clean. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my face feel clean and toned. Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Literally the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous consistency, thorough cleanse - all makeup disappears - and brilliant packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I only discovered this now.</li>
            <li> Well worth the wait.  A fine product that soften your skin, gentle for sensitive skin and smells quite lovely too.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin and smells pretty.  Good product.</li>
            <li> This made me breakout for a week when I first used it, probably because it reset my extremely dry skin&#x27;s pH balance. But this is definitely the only thing I use along with a light moisturizer these days in the summer.  Application and traveling with it is easy due to it&#x27;s unique packaging and I travel a LOT. It&#x27;s so much easier to get through airport TSA without having to worry about your skincare liquid products. It looks and works like a giant Elmer&#x27;s gluestick which I thought was cute. I did have to share with a friend or two whenever they come over and they&#x27;re always so intrigued by how it works.   I already bought two before when the prices were significantly higher ($35 and $25) and now I&#x27;m glad to see that it has dropped. It&#x27;s only been a year so I&#x27;m guessing each stick will last about three to four months with light daily use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle, foamy lather that cleans well without overdrying. I do need to apply a light moisturizer afterwards, but I use this product as the second part of a double cleanse method. The scent is heavenly! Other reviews said that the rose petals imbedded in the stick acted as a sort of exfoliant, but I haven&#x27;t found them to be this useful, but they add a kind of romantic aspect to washing your face, as well as some natural essence I&#x27;m sure. Overall, I am not yet halfway through with the stick, but already plan to purchase another because I enjoy using it so much!</li>
            <li> Very gentle, smells amazing, appropriate pH for skin, great for traveling. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The best! Absolutely divine and leaves your skin so fresh.</li>
            <li> Gentle cleaner that does not strip your skin.</li>
            <li> Its a bit expensive but this cleaning stick is terrific.  You don&#x27;t need much to get a gentle lather going.  It cleanses gently while being effective.  (It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.)  Another added bonus, the stick form factor is also a plus for traveling.</li>
            <li> Hmm. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. First of all, it&#x27;s kind of huge. I initially bought it to take traveling bc it&#x27;s not liquid and I expected it to be smaller. In terms of the soap, it&#x27;s good. The smell is really nice. I dropped this in the shower and the plastic on the top cracked and so now the lid doesn&#x27;t snap on. Definitely can&#x27;t use it for travel now.</li>
            <li> I love sum 37 products. This rose stick is a great product! There were lots of samples! I will order again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful aroma and great lather. Love it</li>
            <li> This product made my relatively clear skin break out. But it did smell lovely.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t particularly care for this product.  Instructions were in Chinese and I didn&#x27;t really understand just how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> This is a really lovely cleanser-- leaves skin soft, hydrated, and glowing and it smells great! The cleansing stick really helps make pores appear smaller and gives skin a really gorgeous glow. I use it as the second step of the Oil Cleansing Method in the evening, in which I first massage a homemade oil blend (olive, castor, camellia, jojoba, argan &amp; marula) into my face for a couple of minutes, rinse, and follow up by massaging in this cleanser for 2-3 minutes; I follow the 2 cleansing steps up with toner, serum, and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s in this that makes it so good (as in, I don&#x27;t know which of the ingredients work so wonderfully), but it functions rather like a very good brightening toner. I&#x27;d recommend massaging it into your face for several minutes before rinsing. Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing stick. First I remove my make up with a cleansing water like Koh Gen Do (mineral spa cleansing water) or an oil cleanser. I then use the Rose Stick. It is gentle, not drying. You can see the bits of exposed roses and those help to gently exfoliate. I use the Rose stick first thing in the morning. I love how compact and easy to use it is. Unlike any other packaging I have ever seen. I will most likely get one for my daughter because of the ease of use and the gentleness of this product. I would recommend buying it. I love Korean skin care lines!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Took long to arrive. I would get it again but waited s month.</li>
