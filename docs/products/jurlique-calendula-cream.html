            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>Calendula is great.</li>
            <li>Very effective against skin sores - would recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely cream, for me it is the best.</li>
            <li>This cream has really nice ingredients!</li>
            <li>This cream is good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard good things about calendula</li>
            <li>I bought this moisturizer based on the great reviews and it being listed in a rundown of top moisturizers.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s amazing in it of itself for sensitive/redness skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of yeasty</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s kind of a matter of opinion though, so others might disagree.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for sensitive skin (I suffer from excema &amp; it hasn&#x27;t bothered me yet).  </li>
            <li>This is the best cream I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>I would put this cream on at night and by the morning my hands were 90 percent better.</li>
            <li>This cream can do way more then just hydrate.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying it.</li>
            <li>bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works like magic to soothe my skin, evening out redness and irritation.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great to just order it and have it delivered straight to your home.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and I love this cream for controlling the redness</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.</li>
            <li>This tube lasted me about two months and it is spendy but I will continue to buy it as it is such a great product!</li>
            <li>It even made my eczema better.  </li>
            <li>I like calendula :)</li>
            <li>I love it, it works so well for me.</li>
            <li>I know some celbrities love Jurlique</li>
            <li>It made an immediate change in my skin after the 1st use. :-)))</li>
            <li>My skin seems to love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients that are listed are NOT the most up to date ones.</li>
            <li>So, if you buy from Amazon, make sure both of those dates match and the formula is up to date.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice rich cream but again, not a miracle worker for me.  </li>
            <li>This cream is so rich and luxurious!  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a natural alcohol that is a great moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, and LOVED it!  </li>
            <li>Please read very important pre-scriptum then please read full review.</li>
            <li>I had bought some in New Zealand originally and loved it but couldn&#x27;t seem to find it there - so was really pleased to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>Absorbs very quickly and skin dries just as quick!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>A much more effective moisturizer product for sensitive skin that is also unscented (and has SPF30 UV protection) at a much lower price is \\&quot;CeraVe AM Moisturizing Lotion\\&quot; -- it is available on Amazon and in popular retail stores.</li>
            <li>however I don&#x27;t think it was a fit for me and my skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel silky smooth</li>
            <li>but it has a light, non-greasy consistency.  </li>
            <li>Such a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And it does calm redness and sensitivity!</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry and it is great.</li>
            <li>But I do think for the right skin type this would be fabulous.</li>
            <li>** rub a dime to nickel sized amt in your palm to warm up the product and make it more easily spreadable on your face -- then it absorbs in less than a minute.</li>
            <li>Love the way this cream goes on, smooth, but not slick.  </li>
            <li>, that reminds me of one quick point.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure Jurlique just made a new batch, though, so don&#x27;t expect to be as fortunate as me and have 10-11 months.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going through the harsh winter and just want a product filled with great natural ingredients and phenomenal emollients, this is your cream.</li>
            <li>(It is pretty rich</li>
            <li>/&gt;Literally, within the first week, my redness was gone!</li>
            <li>love that all of the ingredients are soothing, natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In trying to apply the product it just wasn&#x27;t absorbed and added NO moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li>so I have to see if in the long run it will cause large pores or something, but so far so good! )</li>
            <li>Ok, here is a MAJOR flaw done by Amazon or the people who handle Jurlique&#x27;s products on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The most up to date ingredients are much more soothing, less irrititating (No Alcohol) and is without the formaldehyde releaser listed (Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also thought this would be suitable as a daily face cream</li>
            <li>This cream is exactly what i was looking for it has kept my dry skin nicely moisturized</li>
            <li>Very gentle cream.</li>
            <li>A little goes a very long way, it has a fresh clean light scent and feels soooo good.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>; I love about the product is they tell you the specific month and year when the product will expire.</li>
            <li>; It&#x27;s both incredibly soothing -- darn near &amp;#34;cured my rosecea&amp;#34; and is nice and thick and moisturizing and your face is supple all day long.</li>
            <li>Really good for sensitive skin, acne, dry, etc.</li>
            <li>it comes in and the very top of the actual bottle (where the ridge-y part is on the back).</li>
            <li>, very sensitive skin and for some reason a lot of products out right now for &amp;#34;aging skin&amp;#34; contains some ingredients that are supposed to help tighten etc.</li>
            <li>It healed a dry patch on my face and has other great qualities.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my mom to try and she really likes it</li>
            <li>so I guess it was just too much for my skin.</li>
            <li>a very soothing healing cream.</li>
            <li>but it goes away fast.</li>
            <li>I really like it though.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts quite a while.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, the name really speaks for itself.</li>
            <li>So, when I spent $46 on it, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled, but it was far from being overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s another nice feature instead of the traditional &amp;#34;6m&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;12m&amp;#34; in those open bottles.</li>
            <li>While it is definitely more pricey than what you find at the drug store - I&#x27;ve spent hundreds trying everything anyway!  </li>
            <li>Before I get into it, I want to make it known, I very, very rarely give products flat out 5 star ratings without even thinking twice.</li>
            <li>This has been the first face lotion I have tried in 15+ years that has not made my ultra sensitive, acne prone skin break out.  </li>
            <li>Not super moisturizing but ok cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad either which is a great plus!</li>
            <li>I have normal but sensative skin.</li>
            <li>I suffer from acne and was worried it would make me break out more because it&#x27;s pretty thick.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER sensitive skin, and this is that I turn to when my skin needs a break from all of the products I use and my skin just needs to calm down a</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a complete convert!</li>
            <li>Not diminishing, not slight progress but G-O-N-E!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  a aesthetician and I started using Jurlique in the early 90&#x27;s and the calendula cream was one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>but it really seems to be for spot treatments only.  </li>
            <li>Im in my early forties</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin - bordering on Eczema.  </li>
            <li>No more redness and my skin was soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that this cream + the oil has decreased the fine lines around my eyes, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive dry skin and cause acne like so many other products.  </li>
            <li>It is a little pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li>not too thick but medium, quick absorption, yellow color, huge size, pricey though, australian product non-local, paula&#x27;s choice rates this average</li>
            <li>Last year was the first time my skin became dry, red and irritated in the fall/winter.</li>
            <li>It is thick and rich, but not oily or greasy at all, so no</li>
            <li>, now to my product review: I usually buy this cream at a retail store, which I urge you to do or email the seller to get the full ingredient listing -- I will try to list ALL CURRENT INGREDIENTS in the product after this review section).  </li>
            <li>I have mature very dry skin</li>

            <li> a 26 year old male living in the Philadelphia area, which has 4 distinct seasons (very hot in the summer, very cold in the winter -- you get the idea).</li>
            <li> an absolute lifesaver, on my sensitive, break-out prone skin that now has to spend 9 hours a day in an office that is as dry as a desert -- seriously</li>
            <li> This cream, so long as it never changes or only upgrades will be the cream I use for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff for my hands and arms, but I&#x27;m not wild about it on my face.  </li>
            <li> it is a bit spendy, but I add 2-4 drops of argan oil and it has lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> I spent countless dollars on &amp;#34;redness beauty creams&amp;#34; from Clinique to La Mer ($40-$410).</li>
            <li> I also have a slight case of rosecea that would have constant redness on my cheeks that would never go away -- not even with countless PRESCRIPTION medications including Orecea and Finecea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with oily skin or even dry skin</li>
            <li> and my face was still dry!  </li>
            <li> sometimes I&#x27;ll put on some Seaberry oil around my nose or really dry spots, then this, then sunscreen or BB cream and voila!  </li>
            <li> There really is no smell</li>
            <li> Product just as expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> : I left a tangerine on my desk on a Friday and by the after-holiday Tuesday it was completely dried out!</li>
            <li> You may say, &amp;#34;only 7 months vs. my other cream</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, brighter, and healthier -- less breakouts and the ones I have heal faster.</li>
            <li> They do have 2 of the LEAST harsh preservatives (Phenoxyethanol &amp; Sodium Benzoate), but they&#x27;re 2 of the LAST 3 ingredients.</li>
            <li> I think it helps a little with redness on skin.</li>
            <li> Leave my face a little oily but that is just the chemistry of my face.</li>
            <li> For me it was just a little to greasy.</li>
            <li> It also healed a burn I got on my arm from the stove within  a few days.</li>
            <li> I just like to stay moisturized during the winter, but this is little overboard.</li>
            <li> Because of excessive hand washing and stress</li>
            <li> From my experience it&#x27;s usually 6-8 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find a Jurlique store nearby, so</li>
            <li> This gives you a hard date.</li>
            <li> the cold winter wind irritates my skin, but this is the only product that saves my face.  </li>
            <li> The cream is thick but spreads well.</li>
            <li> One of the few products that doesn&#x27;t false advertise.</li>
            <li> Save your hard earned money for something that delivers!</li>
            <li> This comes out of the tube like toothpaste or worse and is the consistency of art paste.  </li>
            <li> After using it a couple times I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> It just has the wrong texture for faces, I feel.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer based on the great reviews and it being listed in a rundown of top moisturizers. After using it a couple times I was a little disappointed. It left my face greasy all day after putting it on in the morning despite using very tiny amounts. I cant imagine using it twice a day. I have normal but sensative skin. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with oily skin or even dry skin I just like to stay moisturized during the winter, but this is little overboard. I gave it to my mom to try and she really likes it so I guess it was just too much for my skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is a life saver. Because of excessive hand washing and stress I  had gotten eczema on my hands last winter. I would put this cream on at night and by the morning my hands were 90 percent better. It also healed a burn I got on my arm from the stove within  a few days. This cream can do way more then just hydrate.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I am really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I came across Jurlique Calendula Cream through a friend. I have SUPER sensitive skin, and this is that I turn to when my skin needs a break from all of the products I use and my skin just needs to calm down a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works like magic to soothe my skin, evening out redness and irritation. It is thick and rich, but not oily or greasy at all, so no breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that all of the ingredients are soothing, natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find a Jurlique store nearby, so it&#x27;s great to just order it and have it delivered straight to your home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, and LOVED it!  Recently, however, the product isn&#x27;t the same. Probably will not purchase again......</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.  It&#x27;s not all the moisturizing though.  May buy it again.  I think it helps a little with redness on skin.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and I love this cream for controlling the redness</li>
            <li> Love the way this cream goes on, smooth, but not slick.  On my second tube, and plan to repurchase again.  Love, love, love.</li>
            <li> Great product. Leave my face a little oily but that is just the chemistry of my face. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad either which is a great plus!</li>
            <li> Very gentle cream. It takes a bit of time to let it sink into your skin, and I use it as a night cream. Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> not too thick but medium, quick absorption, yellow color, huge size, pricey though, australian product non-local, paula&#x27;s choice rates this average</li>
            <li> This cream is good however I don&#x27;t think it was a fit for me and my skin. For me it was just a little to greasy. But I do think for the right skin type this would be fabulous.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer! I suffer from acne and was worried it would make me break out more because it&#x27;s pretty thick. But it soothed my skin and is moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li> This cream is exactly what i was looking for it has kept my dry skin nicely moisturized and i will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This cream is so rich and luxurious!  It makes my skin feel silky smooth and it&#x27;s not greasy.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  a aesthetician and I started using Jurlique in the early 90&#x27;s and the calendula cream was one of my favorites. Really good for sensitive skin, acne, dry, etc. a very soothing healing cream. All skin types could benefit!</li>
            <li> This has been the first face lotion I have tried in 15+ years that has not made my ultra sensitive, acne prone skin break out.  There really is no smell but it has a light, non-greasy consistency.  It leaves my skin feeling moisturized but not too oily.  This tube lasted me about two months and it is spendy but I will continue to buy it as it is such a great product!</li>
            <li> Wonderfully hydrating cream! It is perfect for sensitive skin (I suffer from excema &amp; it hasn&#x27;t bothered me yet).  There is no fragrance which is a challenge to find these days.  I use it with the MyChelle Hydrating Serum &amp; my skin loves this moisturizing regimen. It is a little pricey but worth it.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Best face moisturizer out there. The smell is kind of yeasty but it goes away fast. The cream is thick but spreads well.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff for my hands and arms, but I&#x27;m not wild about it on my face.  It&#x27;s definitely calming to the skin.  It even made my eczema better.  It just has the wrong texture for faces, I feel.  That&#x27;s kind of a matter of opinion though, so others might disagree.  I really like it though.  This is my second tube.</li>
            <li> This cream didn&#x27;t work the wonders it has for others.  I&#x27;d heard good things about calendula but I&#x27;ve applied it to several types of skin issues but haven&#x27;t seen any big results.  Also thought this would be suitable as a daily face cream but it really seems to be for spot treatments only.  It&#x27;s a nice rich cream but again, not a miracle worker for me.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different...</li>
            <li> Not super moisturizing but ok cream. I like calendula :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!  Im in my early forties, very sensitive skin and for some reason a lot of products out right now for &amp;#34;aging skin&amp;#34; contains some ingredients that are supposed to help tighten etc. My issue was moisture and my face felt like it was burning all the time. I have used a different product and couldnt find it. I saw a review of this product but couldnt find it anywhere. Found it here and tried it. This feels like silk on my face. A little goes a very long way, it has a fresh clean light scent and feels soooo good. My face feels &amp;#34;healed&amp;#34; and people keep telling me I look &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; lol  I can see a difference in my skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Calendula is great. It healed a dry patch on my face and has other great qualities. Product just as expected. Will order from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> This comes out of the tube like toothpaste or worse and is the consistency of art paste.  In trying to apply the product it just wasn&#x27;t absorbed and added NO moisture to my skin. Felt like putting petroleum jelly on my face.  A much more effective moisturizer product for sensitive skin that is also unscented (and has SPF30 UV protection) at a much lower price is \\&quot;CeraVe AM Moisturizing Lotion\\&quot; -- it is available on Amazon and in popular retail stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely cream, for me it is the best.</li>
            <li> Very effective against skin sores - would recommend it.  I had bought some in New Zealand originally and loved it but couldn&#x27;t seem to find it there - so was really pleased to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> Jurlique calendula cream is excellent. I love it, it works so well for me. Such a great moisturizer. My skin is very dry and it is great. Buy it!!!</li>
            <li> I know some celbrities love Jurlique so I always wanted to try it. This cream has really nice ingredients! And it does calm redness and sensitivity! (It is pretty rich so I have to see if in the long run it will cause large pores or something, but so far so good! )... If you are struggling with red skin, you MUST try the Jurlique Soothing Foaming Cleanser!!! It made an immediate change in my skin after the 1st use. :-)))</li>
            <li> Last year was the first time my skin became dry, red and irritated in the fall/winter. I tried 3 moisturizes from Phytomer and Yonka with no results.  Even twice weekly exfoliation and 2 microdermabrasion treatments didn&#x27;t help.  I discovered the Calendula cream by Jurlique and the results were immediate. No more redness and my skin was soft and smooth.  I commute to work by bicycle and the cold winter wind irritates my skin, but this is the only product that saves my face.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have mature very dry skin and this didn&#x27;t even come close to hydrating it!  I applied it three times in one morning alone and my face was still dry!  Absorbs very quickly and skin dries just as quick! Save your hard earned money for something that delivers!</li>
            <li> I am on my second tube of this stuff- it is a bit spendy, but I add 2-4 drops of argan oil and it has lasted a long time.  My skin seems to love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve noticed that this cream + the oil has decreased the fine lines around my eyes, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive dry skin and cause acne like so many other products.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> an absolute lifesaver, on my sensitive, break-out prone skin that now has to spend 9 hours a day in an office that is as dry as a desert -- seriously: I left a tangerine on my desk on a Friday and by the after-holiday Tuesday it was completely dried out! Anyway, I use this after a serum at night, and in the AM sometimes I&#x27;ll put on some Seaberry oil around my nose or really dry spots, then this, then sunscreen or BB cream and voila!  **The way to apply** rub a dime to nickel sized amt in your palm to warm up the product and make it more easily spreadable on your face -- then it absorbs in less than a minute. My skin is softer, brighter, and healthier -- less breakouts and the ones I have heal faster. It&#x27;s only been three weeks and I&#x27;m a complete convert!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin - bordering on Eczema.  This is the best cream I&#x27;ve found so far.  While it is definitely more pricey than what you find at the drug store - I&#x27;ve spent hundreds trying everything anyway!  It doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts quite a while.  The size is perfect for the 3-1-1 Travel Requirements!</li>
            <li> Please read very important pre-scriptum then please read full review. Before I get into it, I want to make it known, I very, very rarely give products flat out 5 star ratings without even thinking twice. Ok, here is a MAJOR flaw done by Amazon or the people who handle Jurlique&#x27;s products on Amazon. The ingredients that are listed are NOT the most up to date ones. The most up to date ingredients are much more soothing, less irrititating (No Alcohol) and is without the formaldehyde releaser listed (Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, now to my product review: I usually buy this cream at a retail store, which I urge you to do or email the seller to get the full ingredient listing -- I will try to list ALL CURRENT INGREDIENTS in the product after this review section).  This cream, so long as it never changes or only upgrades will be the cream I use for the rest of my life. It&#x27;s really that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 26 year old male living in the Philadelphia area, which has 4 distinct seasons (very hot in the summer, very cold in the winter -- you get the idea). I also have a slight case of rosecea that would have constant redness on my cheeks that would never go away -- not even with countless PRESCRIPTION medications including Orecea and Finecea. Those are supposed to be &amp;#34;knock out punches&amp;#34; for rosecea; well not for me. I even saw one of the leading dermatologists in the country and nothing could be done. That is, until I stumbled onto this cream. I spent countless dollars on &amp;#34;redness beauty creams&amp;#34; from Clinique to La Mer ($40-$410). So, when I spent $46 on it, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled, but it was far from being overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally, within the first week, my redness was gone! Not diminishing, not slight progress but G-O-N-E! Also, it is incredibly moisturizing. It&#x27;s not just for redness. If you&#x27;re going through the harsh winter and just want a product filled with great natural ingredients and phenomenal emollients, this is your cream.To the people/person who said it&#x27;s not moisturizing, I&#x27;m betting the seller is selling an out of date formulation with alcohol as still an ingredient. I&#x27;m talking about regular alcohol, not cetearyl alcohol -- that&#x27;s a natural alcohol that is a great moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another &amp;#34;feature&amp;#34; I love about the product is they tell you the specific month and year when the product will expire. It&#x27;s located both on the bottom of the box it comes in and the very top of the actual bottle (where the ridge-y part is on the back). So, if you buy from Amazon, make sure both of those dates match and the formula is up to date. For example, on the bottom of the box it says EXP NOV 15 -- says the same on the back, top/middle part. I think that&#x27;s another nice feature instead of the traditional &amp;#34;6m&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;12m&amp;#34; in those open bottles. This gives you a hard date. I&#x27;m pretty sure Jurlique just made a new batch, though, so don&#x27;t expect to be as fortunate as me and have 10-11 months. From my experience it&#x27;s usually 6-8 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, that reminds me of one quick point. You may say, &amp;#34;only 7 months vs. my other cream that&#x27;s 12 or 24 months.&amp;#34; Well, that&#x27;s because this product contains NO parabens, alcohol, formaldehyde releasers or synthetic fragrances! That&#x27;s amazing in it of itself for sensitive/redness skin. They do have 2 of the LEAST harsh preservatives (Phenoxyethanol &amp; Sodium Benzoate), but they&#x27;re 2 of the LAST 3 ingredients. Therefore, there are probably only trace amounts of synthetic preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the name really speaks for itself. One of the few products that doesn&#x27;t false advertise. &amp;#34;Soothing Moisturizing Cream.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s both incredibly soothing -- darn near &amp;#34;cured my rosecea&amp;#34; and is nice and thick and moisturizing and your face is supple all day long. If you read all of this, kudos. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the current list of ingredients that Jurlique is putting out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Glycerin, Honey, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Echinacea Purpurea Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Prunella Vulgaris Leaf Extract, Spilanthes Acmella Flower Extract, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract, Hydrolyzed Linseed Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Cucumis Sativa (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lauroyl Lysine, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Beta-Carotene, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lecithin, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Totarol, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Benzoate.</li>
