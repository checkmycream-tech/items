            <li>Pass it on. :)</li>
            <li>Maybe more for more expert nail art types</li>
            <li>Shipping was great, love the packaging, they come in a clear plastic container that can be reused to store them in.</li>
            <li>these are acrylic paints, not special paints for nails, just acrylic in nice tubes, work great though, non toxic, works on nails, plastic nails, bonded nails, just make sure to use a topcoat or two or it will chip quickly, nice variety pack of paints for the price.</li>
            <li>They work great for natural acrylic and gel nails.</li>
            <li>So far its working great.</li>
            <li>colors are very true to the pictures and what you&#x27;d expect them to be, and they&#x27;re easily blendable and thinned with water.</li>
            <li>Paint rubs off easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong in color</li>
            <li>(...else rest all fine.</li>
            <li>than that, a fine set</li>
            <li>I find this brand is the best and a little</li>
            <li>Is so much more durable and fun to use.</li>
            <li>Its worth the money :).</li>
            <li>They are much thicker than bottled acrylic paint which is good when drawing certain designs</li>
            <li>These are realky cool.</li>
            <li>I intend to purchase more, thanks a million.</li>
            <li>The only good thing is it come so quickly.</li>
            <li>It took a little while to get here, but all in all I loved these!</li>
            <li>Other than the paint pealing off the nail even after top coat of paint I am very pleased with it</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li>I have tons of fun painting designs on my nails</li>
            <li>and it got to me super fast!</li>
            <li>Other than that, good quality.</li>
            <li>so now I use these instead and a little water to clean off my brushes and they stay good as new.</li>
            <li>They sent me exactly what was paid for.</li>
            <li>First lesson for a novice nail artist...</li>
            <li>You can buy bottles of acrylic paint in every color imaginable at your local craft store and you get way more bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li>Shipping fast!</li>
            <li>Also the colors are really pretty.</li>
            <li>This is not a fake review</li>
            <li>As long as you let it dry and then put a clear coat over it, it looks perfect.</li>
            <li>Came pretty fast as well/</li>
            <li>and it has worked out really well.</li>
            <li>but however it dries really fast before I can finish using it for my nail art designs.</li>
            <li>No one wants to buy a crappy product.</li>
            <li>Granted the tubes are tiny, but I only need small amounts at a time for my miniatures, so they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li>Ok, doesn&#x27;t work better for an amateur (me) that using wet n</li>
            <li>This is my second set, first set lasted over two years when covers are sealed!</li>
            <li>It came in early and it was very neatly packaged&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got it with in a week and normally it takes up to 3 weeks when I order stuff from China but not this</li>
            <li>Anyways the Oumaxi Paint came in today, about a week and a half early :).</li>
            <li>They are a little dry but a little bit of water solves that issue and the price is awesome</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a tip when using acrylic paint for nail art water down the paint till you can easily draw a linen</li>
            <li>You can even mix them to make new colors.</li>
            <li>it was a good starter set, only draw back was, the delivery was a little long.&lt;br /&gt;other</li>
            <li>so I can use it for nail art and it won&#x27;t dry out right away like normal nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I have used a few different paints for nails and so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>wild nail polish as paint.</li>
            <li>and when I opened it one of the paints had leaked not only all over the other paints that were no longer in the original package but all over in the bag they had shipped them in.</li>
            <li>I HAD SUCH HIGH HOPES FOR THIS PAINT</li>
            <li>It just seemed that it wasn&#x27;t thick enough because I wasn&#x27;t able to creat any designs with it.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product once so far</li>
            <li>The paint is a little hard to use with the stamps but is good for other designs.</li>
            <li>paint seems decent, not to thick, and not too runny, dries fast.</li>

            <li> many of them were dried or on the way to being thick and gloopy.</li>
            <li> came two weeks earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re washable with water, but they dry within about 5-10 minutes depending on the thickness of the coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some tubes were dry and goopy.  </li>
            <li> In fact I was little worried whether they would last long.</li>
            <li> The sky is blue the grass is green.</li>
            <li> The quality is not great and it is not long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Nail polish ruins your brushes...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is when I got the package, they didn&#x27;t send the paint in padded packaging material so one of the tubes&#x27; caps came off and splattered everywhere in the package.</li>
            <li> The tubes of color are dry and do not spread evenly, I am going to assume the product is way past its shelf life and should be thrown away.</li>
            <li> The tubes are small but you only need very little paint.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> Few of the color tubes were damaged and the paint got leaked too :</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not happy with the tiny size of the containers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not easy to work with the nail design tools.</li>
            <li> I like that its a little bit thick</li>
            <li> but I was not able to use them for nail art.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF ARRIVED AND WAS THICK AND MUCKY.</li>
            <li> Helped make allot of money for a very small price</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> BUT I was not impressed with the shipping!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the paints are kind of watery. i bought them for nail designs and i dont like the way the paints work on the nails. i can still do designs. it feels as they are alittle runny and i cant do the designs as i want.</li>
            <li> Other than the paint pealing off the nail even after top coat of paint I am very pleased with it</li>
            <li> great deal and good price</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get here, but all in all I loved these! Helped make allot of money for a very small price</li>
            <li> While the colors are bright and the ones pictured...many of them were dried or on the way to being thick and gloopy. I bought for nail art but I may just give them to my kids to paint with.</li>
            <li> I love it. Looks great on nails with the finishing top coat. The tubes are small but you only need very little paint. A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> These are realky cool. They work great for natural acrylic and gel nails. They are a little dry but a little bit of water solves that issue and the price is awesome</li>
            <li> The paint is a little hard to use with the stamps but is good for other designs. I think they are for airbrushing.</li>
            <li> They sent me exactly what was paid for. 4 stars for the length of time it took. Other than that, good quality.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors but I was not able to use them for nail art. It just seemed that it wasn&#x27;t thick enough because I wasn&#x27;t able to creat any designs with it.</li>
            <li> Great Value, Bright colors and cures well with UV or LED lamp. This is my second set, first set lasted over two years when covers are sealed!</li>
            <li> I love these colors!!! I would recommend them to anyone who&#x27;s looking for nice colors to do nail arts. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> All the colors were great. In fact I was little worried whether they would last long. But they do and they are just perfect. But wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the packing when it was delivered. Few of the color tubes were damaged and the paint got leaked too :(...else rest all fine.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different paints for nails and so far this is my favorite. It goes on smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li> great variety of colors</li>
            <li> These are amazing. I bought them to use on polymer clay. Granted the tubes are tiny, but I only need small amounts at a time for my miniatures, so they&#x27;re perfect. Shipping was great, love the packaging, they come in a clear plastic container that can be reused to store them in. I&#x27;ll be buying more for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re washable with water, but they dry within about 5-10 minutes depending on the thickness of the coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are very true to the pictures and what you&#x27;d expect them to be, and they&#x27;re easily blendable and thinned with water.</li>
            <li> these are acrylic paints, not special paints for nails, just acrylic in nice tubes, work great though, non toxic, works on nails, plastic nails, bonded nails, just make sure to use a topcoat or two or it will chip quickly, nice variety pack of paints for the price.</li>
            <li> Paint rubs off easily.</li>
            <li> came in a plastic box, all there, no leaks, breaks or anything. paint seems decent, not to thick, and not too runny, dries fast. came two weeks earlier than expected. all in all, I&#x27;m very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> it was a good starter set, only draw back was, the delivery was a little long.&lt;br /&gt;other than that, a fine set</li>
            <li> Nice paints for nail art.</li>
            <li> Paint comes off even after drying and messes up the manicure or pedicure. It&#x27;s also not easy to work with the nail design tools.</li>
            <li> I HAD SUCH HIGH HOPES FOR THIS PAINT BECAUSE IT&#x27;S PAINT AND NOT POLISH SO I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE THE DESIGNS I WANTED WITHOUT HAVING TO CHANGE POLISH WITH EVERY MISTAKE. THIS STUFF ARRIVED AND WAS THICK AND MUCKY. IT DIDN&#x27;T GO ON THE WAY I HOPED. I TAKE THE BLAME WHEN I AM TO BLAME BUT THIS WAS NOT ME IT WAS THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This makes the perfect nail polish. Is so much more durable and fun to use. You can even mix them to make new colors.</li>
            <li> I love it. I intend to purchase more, thanks a million. I wish I had silver, glitter and gold colors</li>
            <li> I love them I will be purchasing another once I run out every nail artist should have these</li>
            <li> The paint do their job.  But I&#x27;m not happy with the tiny size of the containers.  I want bigger tubes but not too big at the same time.</li>
            <li> Was using nail polish to do nail art designs and it ruined all my brushes so now I use these instead and a little water to clean off my brushes and they stay good as new. Beautiful colors easy to mix comes out very nice. First lesson for a novice nail artist...Nail polish ruins your brushes...even faster if they are synthetic. Pass it on. :)</li>
            <li> The tubes of color are dry and do not spread evenly, I am going to assume the product is way past its shelf life and should be thrown away. I am not happy with the purchase.  The only good thing is it come so quickly.</li>
            <li> I was using nail polish for nail art and when I found these paints I had to have them! I love them! BUT I was not impressed with the shipping!!! They did come on the day they told me however, they were in a plastic bag and when I opened it one of the paints had leaked not only all over the other paints that were no longer in the original package but all over in the bag they had shipped them in.</li>
            <li> Great variety of colors and great quality of paint! As long as you let it dry and then put a clear coat over it, it looks perfect.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so far and it has worked out really well. I like that its a little bit thick so I can use it for nail art and it won&#x27;t dry out right away like normal nail polishes. My only complaint is when I got the package, they didn&#x27;t send the paint in padded packaging material so one of the tubes&#x27; caps came off and splattered everywhere in the package.</li>
            <li> Ok, doesn&#x27;t work better for an amateur (me) that using wet n wild nail polish as paint. Maybe more for more expert nail art types</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted!  The colors blend well and cover perfectly.  Came pretty fast as well/</li>
            <li> These work great! Just what I wanted for my nail art and it got to me super fast! Got it with in a week and normally it takes up to 3 weeks when I order stuff from China but not this, the product was in perfect shape and I will defiantly order from them again.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth consistancy excellent for nail art designs. Here&#x27;s a tip when using acrylic paint for nail art water down the paint till you can easily draw a linen it&#x27;s strong in color and it don&#x27;t run. They you are good too. I find this brand is the best and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The colors are great but I was under the impression that the paints would be UV gel, not acrylic. You can buy bottles of acrylic paint in every color imaginable at your local craft store and you get way more bang for your buck.  The quality is not great and it is not long lasting.  Some tubes were dry and goopy.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> This set has amazing colors. You can create all sort of nail designs. The packing is great too, it comes in a cute case to store them as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> Great ! Shipping fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s some good quality paint but however it dries really fast before I can finish using it for my nail art designs.</li>
            <li> These paints are great for nail art.  They are much thicker than bottled acrylic paint which is good when drawing certain designs</li>
            <li> Alright, i figured i would write a review because I know whenever I am looking to buy something off of Amazon i always look at the reviews. No one wants to buy a crappy product. Anyways the Oumaxi Paint came in today, about a week and a half early :). So far its working great. So yes the product does work good. It came in early and it was very neatly packaged&lt;br /&gt; No messes. Also the colors are really pretty. Its worth the money :). The sky is blue the grass is green. This is not a fake review lol.</li>
            <li> Fun to use, the colors are wonderful, go on smoothly I have tons of fun painting designs on my nails</li>
