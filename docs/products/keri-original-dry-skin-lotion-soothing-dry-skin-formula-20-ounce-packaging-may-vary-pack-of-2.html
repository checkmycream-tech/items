            <li>Thanks for a superb transaction.</li>
            <li>By far this is the best skin lotion on the market.  </li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!  </li>
            <li>Very good for sensitive skin, may also be used on face.</li>
            <li>It is hypoallergenic and makes your skin look healthy and with a shine.</li>
            <li>Searched MANY stores and could not find \\&quot;Original.\\</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find it on line and will continue to be a customer.</li>
            <li>I have been using Keri lotion for many years and would not use anything else.  </li>
            <li>I have used this \\&quot;original\\&quot; Keri for many years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Keri Lotion for more than 30 years.</li>
            <li>This lotion has been discontinued in many drugstores and retail outlets.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love Keri Lotion.</li>
            <li>, sometimes it even turns it cloudy even if I have a top coat on.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin then this is the best lotion you can purchase.</li>
            <li>So glad that it is available from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is better than many higher priced products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I use it after every shower and it keeps my skin looking smooth and moist covering my dryness (scaliness).  </li>
            <li>All retailers seem to have stopped carrying this particular kind of Keri, but I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and this is the best product for absorbing in dry skin.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best product on the market for dry skin......</li>
            <li>Please keep this particular product in stock!!!</li>
            <li>It was the exact original lotion I had been searching for.</li>
            <li>but I would try other lotions to see if they are better, otherwise I will stick with Keri Original Dray Skin Lotion forever.</li>
            <li>Many health personnel are surprised at how soft my skin is for my age (76).</li>
            <li>but it soothes and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>I have tried others but always come back to Keri Original.     </li>
            <li>I bought Keri Original Dray Skin Lotion about three weeks ago for my dry skin and after applying it, I have seen substantial improvement to 90% part of my body.</li>
            <li>I really like it so far</li>
            <li>So I applied the Keri lotion and it restored my skin to normal.</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin soft and shiny without being oily.  </li>
            <li>And no harsh smell either.</li>
            <li>I could not find any local store that had the same price for the 20-ounce, plus you get twice as much!</li>
            <li>This is becoming harder and harder to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li>B00006RH5C Keri Original Dry Skin Lotion, Soothing Dry Skin Formula,</li>
            <li>There is no other lotion out there like it.</li>
            <li>Few places like the back of my thigh and and part of my leg not quiet yet but still a huge improvement as compared to before.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it but only with bare nails.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it is the only lotion that sinks into your skin without leaving a layer of grease.  So upset when can&#x27;t find it in stores or costco anymore.  It is hypoallergenic and makes your skin look healthy and with a shine.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!  Amazon has better price than in stores (when I can FIND it!).  Have been using it for years and wouldn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> Searched MANY stores and could not find \\&quot;Original.\\&quot; I cannot use the others, do not like the others.  I am allergic to everything and this is the best product for absorbing in dry skin. It was shipped immediately and i had it in several days.  I highy recommend it![[ASIN:B00006RH5C Keri Original Dry Skin Lotion, Soothing Dry Skin Formula, Packaging May Vary, 20 oz (567 g)]]</li>
            <li> Used Keri lotion for decades. Our local stores in our county don&#x27;t carry it anymore so we&#x27;ve had to go online to purchase it. Amazon service as always was as promised.</li>
            <li> I could not find any local store that had the same price for the 20-ounce, plus you get twice as much!</li>
            <li> This is becoming harder and harder to find in the stores.  I have used this lotion for 30 years and I hope they never stop making it.  There is no other lotion out there like it.</li>
            <li> I have used Keri lotion for over 30 years and was saddened when it was pulled from the shelves of my local shopping places.  I was pleased to find it on line and will continue to be a customer.</li>

            <li> I have used this \\&quot;original\\&quot; Keri for many years.  I prefer it to all the other Keri&#x27;s preferring this thicker texture to the thinner textures.  I use it after every shower and it keeps my skin looking smooth and moist covering my dryness (scaliness).  It covers scaliness on elbows, feet as well as hands.  It was recommended years ago by a doctor for use on very dry skin and I have continued to use it for over 25 years.  I have tried others but always come back to Keri Original.

I won&#x27;t use anything else.  It keeps your skin soft and shiny without being oily.  It can be used all over - even on your face.</li>

            <li> Absolutely the best product on the market for dry skin......Sometimes very difficult to find in stores, but never a problem on Amazon.  Again great product and great service - what else do you need.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
