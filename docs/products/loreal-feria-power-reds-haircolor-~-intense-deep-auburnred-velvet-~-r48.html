            <li>It gave me a beautiful, intense red.</li>
            <li>and it is just a gorgeous color overall.</li>
            <li>It turned my beautiful medium brown hair practically black.</li>
            <li>Just like another one star reviewer I had a beautiful bright red shade from Garnier R3 on my naturally very dark hair.</li>
            <li>I love this dye tho after going through 3 different dyes I found my one and only I haven&#x27;t had to redye for over a month now love it!</li>

            <li>First time, no problem.  </li>
            <li>This was the first home dye kit I have ever used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for about 15 years now, consistently for 10 years</li>
            <li>Wish I would have read these reviews first.</li>
            <li>Which I should of done in the first place.</li>
            <li>so pretty.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product online due the lack of being able to find it in stores!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite red so far!</li>
            <li>But really don&#x27;t pay 22 bucks for it</li>
            <li>It really did not work out for me.</li>
            <li>I have tried so hard to find a pure beautiful red with no orange or purple undertones.</li>
            <li>I have no other choice but to go to a professional now and have them lighten my hair so I can go back to the happy real red</li>
            <li>My hair was dark brown, and after using Garnier Nutrisse Ultra Color Ultra Intense Red for Darker Hair Permanent Color Light Intense Auburn R3, my hair was a vibrant and intense bright red.</li>
            <li>and it is a deep black cherry, bright only in the intense glare of my bathroom light.</li>
            <li>Yes I paid attention to all the directions, left on for the right amount of time, etc.</li>
            <li>When I first went red, I bought this color because it was the shade I was aiming for.    </li>
            <li>The first picture is my originally red.</li>
            <li>I also suggest you keep some bleach nearby to clean up the sink, shower and floor or other surfaces that get dripped on.</li>
            <li>My hair is more black and violet instead of red.</li>
            <li>and this is by far</li>
            <li>The red has stayed better than the Redken salon color and all of the other reds that I&#x27;ve tried from the drugstore to keep red in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have had more compliments on this color than any red I have been in the past year.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give a try of the L&#x27;Oreal Feria Power Reds Haircolor Intense Deep Auburn/Red Velvet R48 since my current haircolor was very near.</li>
            <li>This came out violet black on my hair that was light red before application.</li>
            <li>Turned out pretty much the same color as on the box, a few darker streaks here and there from where my hair didn&#x27;t lift enough.    </li>
            <li>I still think it looks very red compares to my natural color</li>
            <li>That would have been fine if that was my intention, BUT my intention was to have a color at least vaguely similar to the one on the box.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as vibrant as I expected.</li>
            <li>on a light bleached blonde hair it can leave you with red but on a copper shade or darker it leaves you a dark (almost black) violet color..</li>
            <li>Just like many other reviews I used this dye and ended up with dark purple black hair.</li>
            <li>I have had my hair a vibrant red colour for several years and expected this to be the red colour on the box....</li>

            <li> I have had my hair a vibrant red colour for several years and expected this to be the red colour on the box....</li>
            <li> The second shows r48, and the third shows the contrast between the new color and my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been starting to head back to my original color, dirty blonde, but when I saw this color, I just had to try it.  </li>
            <li> Look it may not be as red as expected</li>
            <li> If you try this put down a big drop cloth because once you add the Power Red booster the color drips like water and stains.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair black and red and this red isn&#x27;t noticable at all.</li>
            <li> I was sad when my hair went to a dark brown with just a red sheen in the light.</li>
            <li> Like every other review, this will NOT turn your hair the color red.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair with red highlights (bleached out and put in professionally) that keep fading since red is so hard to keep on the hair.  </li>
            <li> As others have stated this color left me a dark violet blackish color.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to spend a small fortune to get it fixed.</li>
            <li> I use L&#x27;Oreal Feria and have for years but the &amp;#34;Power Reds&amp;#34; are a big mess.</li>
            <li> Hair dye is tricky, so careful of your expectations of what you want this one to do for you.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when you&#x27;re dying</li>
            <li> Put on over dark red hair, it turns it black.  </li>
            <li> I bought it after reading reviews that said it was darker than expected because I was scared other reds may turn orange.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers, sadly, have the right of it.  </li>
            <li> Feria had always felt like it didn&#x27;t damage my hair like other colors.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing as i liked the colour on the box a lot :(</li>
            <li> Oh no, Feria, why did you let me down?  </li>
            <li> my biggest let down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li> My hair was black with purple highlights.  </li>
            <li> but it came out an almost black with a hint of violet colour.</li>
            <li> I just wanted a pretty red color for the summer :-(</li>
            <li> I had medium brown hair, now I have almost black hair.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve blow dried this crappy mess</li>
            <li> Dramatic and exaggerated I know, but as close to true as I could ever get.</li>
            <li> I bought it at Walgreens for roughly 9$!!!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re hair with this because it can get messy, place some newspaper around the area where you&#x27;re coloring to prevent getting dye everywhere.</li>
            <li> It turned my hair dark purple....and what a mess!!!</li>
            <li> I usually gravitate to the reds</li>
            <li> The results were very dull compared to other Feria colors.</li>
            <li> I just blasted their FB for this and they can expect a very unhappy (former) customer first thing tomorrow am.</li>
            <li> Not nice at all, Feria.</li>
            <li> The blood red tube drips like crazy.</li>
            <li> No joke, I receive at least two compliments a month from my hair color-</li>
            <li> The side panel that shows brfore &amp; after is false advertisement.</li>
            <li> strangers in bathrooms and in the grocery store- random people.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was hooked.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re scalp at all, unlike my previous dye from Revlon that burned my scalp horribly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not so bad</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed on how my hair turned out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate this color.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible dye!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE MISTAKE!</li>
            <li> This stuff is nightmarishly terrible!!</li>
            <li> The booster tube that mixes in makes the dye horribly runny...</li>
            <li> Worst hair color</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Horrible dye! Just like many other reviews I used this dye and ended up with dark purple black hair. So pissed off.</li>
            <li> When I first went red, I bought this color because it was the shade I was aiming for.    First time, no problem.  Turned out pretty much the same color as on the box, a few darker streaks here and there from where my hair didn&#x27;t lift enough.    A month later, time to do the roots, and I buy this again.    Oh no.  Oh no, Feria, why did you let me down?  My hair was black with purple highlights.  I wish I had taken a photo now in hindsight, but I didn&#x27;t want the reminder of the accident to be honest.    The other reviewers, sadly, have the right of it.  Put on over dark red hair, it turns it black.  Not nice at all, Feria.</li>
            <li> Why is this almost 23$?? I bought it at Walgreens for roughly 9$!!! I love this dye tho after going through 3 different dyes I found my one and only I haven&#x27;t had to redye for over a month now love it! But really don&#x27;t pay 22 bucks for it</li>
            <li> Will not buy this hair dye ever again.I am extremely disappointed on how my hair turned out.My hair is more black and violet instead of red.I expected more for the price..!</li>
            <li> My hair was dark brown, and after using Garnier Nutrisse Ultra Color Ultra Intense Red for Darker Hair Permanent Color Light Intense Auburn R3, my hair was a vibrant and intense bright red. I thought I would give a try of the L&#x27;Oreal Feria Power Reds Haircolor Intense Deep Auburn/Red Velvet R48 since my current haircolor was very near. I was hoping for either maintenance of the quality of the red color or an intensification. I was sad when my hair went to a dark brown with just a red sheen in the light. It really did not work out for me. Hair dye is tricky, so careful of your expectations of what you want this one to do for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this dye looking for the color on the box. Although it was not as red as I imagined, I couldn&#x27;t love it more! I bought it after reading reviews that said it was darker than expected because I was scared other reds may turn orange. Look it may not be as red as expected but I don&#x27;t know why everyone is getting upset that a color ended up darker than the box for once. Before dying this, I had a brown to medium blonde ombré that I had gotten dyed to a red (the same color on the r48 box). I heard that the color lightens into the box color, so I will be waiting for that. I&#x27;ll probably tone this by adding red manic panic to my conditioner. Honestly I can&#x27;t complain. This was the first home dye kit I have ever used and I&#x27;m impressed how great it looks. My color was even. It also hasn&#x27;t bled on my clothes or pillows (it&#x27;s been 2 days since I dyed it and I haven&#x27;t washed it yet). The first picture is my originally red. The second shows r48, and the third shows the contrast between the new color and my dark brown hair. I still think it looks very red compares to my natural color and it is just a gorgeous color overall.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this color.  It&#x27;s very rich and when the sun hits my hair it glows.  Lasts about a month, too, even without any color-treating shampoos.  It is a darker shade that fades to an auburn.</li>
            <li> I use L&#x27;Oreal Feria and have for years but the &amp;#34;Power Reds&amp;#34; are a big mess. The blood red tube drips like crazy. The results were very dull compared to other Feria colors. If you try this put down a big drop cloth because once you add the Power Red booster the color drips like water and stains. I also suggest you keep some bleach nearby to clean up the sink, shower and floor or other surfaces that get dripped on.</li>
            <li> As others have stated this color left me a dark violet blackish color.  That would have been fine if that was my intention, BUT my intention was to have a color at least vaguely similar to the one on the box.  I am very experienced in dyeing my hair at home, and have never had a color be so far from the swatch on the box.  I am going to be either using a color removing kit or clarifying shampoo to remove this as quickly as possible so I can actually have red hair again.  I absolutely hate this color.</li>
            <li> I love this color! Its a stunning gorgeous red velvet color, I have recieved so many compliments on the color of my hair! I could not be any happier with this hair dye. Just be careful when you&#x27;re dying you&#x27;re hair with this because it can get messy, place some newspaper around the area where you&#x27;re coloring to prevent getting dye everywhere. It comes with a wonderful mini shampoo and conditioner that smells like Vanilla cupcakes and it makes hair Silky smooth. This dye does NOT burn you&#x27;re scalp at all, unlike my previous dye from Revlon that burned my scalp horribly. This color Is beautiful! I will deffinetly purchase this product again when the time comes to touch up my roots and refresh the color. Loreal Feria, please do not discontinue this color.  I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I love this color. I have tried so hard to find a pure beautiful red with no orange or purple undertones. Feria had always felt like it didn&#x27;t damage my hair like other colors. If this color were to ever be discontinued I wouldn&#x27;t have a reason to ever leave the house again. Dramatic and exaggerated I know, but as close to true as I could ever get. I have had more compliments on this color than any red I have been in the past year. Red Velvet forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Consider yourself warned! Just like another one star reviewer I had a beautiful bright red shade from Garnier R3 on my naturally very dark hair. No joke, I receive at least two compliments a month from my hair color- strangers in bathrooms and in the grocery store- random people. Needless to say I was hooked. I wanted to amp up the color though, and since I was a shade lighter than the box I just wanted to get the richness Feria R48 had. I also thought it would be good to change it up since I had been using R3 for two years straight. HORRIBLE MISTAKE! I say this after dying my hair an hour ago, blow drying and washing two more times. I have no other choice but to go to a professional now and have them lighten my hair so I can go back to the happy real red I was before. I&#x27;ve blow dried this crappy mess and it is a deep black cherry, bright only in the intense glare of my bathroom light. Yes I paid attention to all the directions, left on for the right amount of time, etc. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for about 15 years now, consistently for 10 years and this is by far my biggest let down. If your looking to &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; your red- DON&#x27;T use this color. I just blasted their FB for this and they can expect a very unhappy (former) customer first thing tomorrow am. Do yourself a favor and just go with Garnier R3 or end up looking like a goth girl. FML.</li>
            <li> This came out violet black on my hair that was light red before application. Here&#x27;s to hoping it fades.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nightmarishly terrible!! It turned my hair dark purple....and what a mess!!! It&#x27;s actually messier than manic panic! The booster tube that mixes in makes the dye horribly runny...you might want to take this stuff outside to apply if you do not want you bathroom to resemble a crime scene. Worst hair color I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li> I have had my hair a vibrant red colour for several years and expected this to be the red colour on the box....but it came out an almost black with a hint of violet colour. I died over it with manic panic immediately after to maintain SOME of the red, but even still its basically just a purple/black. Pretty disappointing as i liked the colour on the box a lot :(</li>
            <li> Like every other review, this will NOT turn your hair the color red. It turned my beautiful medium brown hair practically black. Wish I would have read these reviews first. I followed directions, did everything the box said, and I thought my hair would turn out like the shades stated on the box. I just wanted a pretty red color for the summer :-( Now I have to spend a small fortune to get it fixed. Which I should of done in the first place. You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
            <li> Bought this product at Walgreen&#x27;s and hope it&#x27;s not a discontinued color.  I have dark brown hair with red highlights (bleached out and put in professionally) that keep fading since red is so hard to keep on the hair.  I bought this to cover the orange/blonde fade from the sun and color washing out.  It gave me a beautiful, intense red. I put it all over my head for about 15 minutes and that did the trick to cover the orange color.  I plan on using another box to do my roots and then 5-10 minutes all over in another week or so.  The red has stayed better than the Redken salon color and all of the other reds that I&#x27;ve tried from the drugstore to keep red in my hair.  I may even take this to my hairdresser and have her apply it when she does highlights again.  It&#x27;s my favorite red so far!</li>
            <li> I will never buy this hair colour again! It does not leave you with red hair. I had medium brown hair, now I have almost black hair. The side panel that shows brfore &amp; after is false advertisement.</li>
            <li> I love this color, it&#x27;s so much fun and so pretty.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this color.  I usually gravitate to the reds but I&#x27;ve been starting to head back to my original color, dirty blonde, but when I saw this color, I just had to try it.  I am in love.  I&#x27;ll definitely be waiting awhile til I go back to blonde.</li>
            <li> I used this on my over all bleached hair and it didn&#x27;t do anything. It wasn&#x27;t as vibrant as I expected. I dyed my hair black and red and this red isn&#x27;t noticable at all. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> this hair dye does not leave you with red hair .. on a light bleached blonde hair it can leave you with red but on a copper shade or darker it leaves you a dark (almost black) violet color.. it&#x27;s not so bad i guess just on the specific color</li>
            <li> My hair was copper. Now it&#x27;s black. Yes, I followed the directions precisely. I will never buy anything from Loreal again. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product online due the lack of being able to find it in stores! I purchased 6 more boxes from Walmart after trying it here!! Great product, perfect color!</li>
