            <li>so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Great price--arrived sooner than expected--sealed.</li>
            <li>However, Amazon was awesome and gave me a refund on my lost item, so superb job to the Amazon team for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very highly recommended product!</li>

            <li>I love this product regardless, and need it in bulk!</li>
            <li>i like how it cleans the tattooed area and the smell does not have a chemical smell but a nice odor.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, pleasant smell, and easily cleans away dirt, grime, and blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i wished it was better packaged the box was practically hanging on to itself</li>
            <li>Will try to order one more time brcause</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and it works great.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Bulk is always better.</li>

            <li>i love being able to sit at home and order what i would normally purchase from my tattoo suppliers at a better price and the convenience of to the door delivery...</li>
            <li>The green soap is excellent.</li>
            <li>True product.</li>
            <li>This is the very best green soap you can get!!</li>
            <li>Other than that it was what I wanted and a great deal for the product</li>
            <li>The seller ships quickly.</li>
            <li>Anyone with a tattoo knows exactly what I&#x27;m talking about, and if you don&#x27;t have a tattoo or know what I&#x27;m talking about, most people refer to the smell of this soap as one of the main reasons why they love getting tattoos and are addicted to it (of course, the rush/excitement of fresh ink may also be a reason :P ).</li>
            <li>Consider how much you would spend on any other type of soap, say for example SoftSoap, and it&#x27;s pretty easy to see this is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans and disinfects the wound without stinging or burning, and is medical-grade, so you know it&#x27;s getting cleaned right and getting cleaned</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Leaked so much it got everywhere!</li>
            <li>Shipped fast exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>Great big gallon of green soap the legit stuff that saved me money...</li>
            <li>Expecting a sterile ready to go product</li>
            <li>Very upset.</li>
            <li>really works on oily hair</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this size, if you go with the smaller sizes you will just run through it very quickly, This is a MUST HAVE in tattooing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>For some reason, my first order mysteriously got lost a day before it was to be delivered, and UPS has no idea what happened to it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;such as Sturgis for tattoing the public, even though many tattooist use other things</li>
            <li>am almost constantly hurting myself (out of stupidity or accidentally, not on purpose lol), and this is my go-to pre-care wash before treating the wound.</li>
            <li>There is nothing like the smell of a fresh tattoo, and the majority of that is the green soap.</li>
            <li>And it came exactly how it is in the pic 1gal of green soap</li>
            <li>Bottle was broken so almost half the green soap leaked plus a week late other then that good authentic product</li>

            <li> if you dont know what green soap is then you should not be buying it.  go get some dawn.  green soap has been around forever but for those in florida it doesnt meet the new antiseptic law.  you can use it but you still need an antiseptic soap prior to your stencil for that dettol works but smells like pinesol.  no you can not use pinesol as its not for human use</li>
            <li> Gallon wasn&#x27;t broken meet my expectations</li>
            <li> Was in great shape&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> There is nothing like the smell of a fresh tattoo, and the majority of that is the green soap.

Consider how much you would spend on any other type of soap, say for example SoftSoap, and it&#x27;s pretty easy to see this is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that this is not fulfilled through Amazon. I wish it was, because then it would qualify for free 2-day shipping with Prime, but alas. Also, watch your shipment if you do order this! For some reason, my first order mysteriously got lost a day before it was to be delivered, and UPS has no idea what happened to it. However, Amazon was awesome and gave me a refund on my lost item, so superb job to the Amazon team for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very highly recommended product!</li>
            <li> Spilled all over and shipped with out a lid</li>
            <li> What can I say this is the best soap on the market for tats and the price was awesome</li>
            <li> Great big gallon of green soap the legit stuff that saved me money...a constant need for a tattooer. The only draw back was i wished it was better packaged the box was practically hanging on to itself</li>

            <li> Bottle was broken so almost half the green soap leaked plus a week late other then that good authentic product</li>

            <li> I was not happy.. was wrapped up horribly. Looked like a mess before I even eventually got it open. Leaked so much it got everywhere! Will try to order one more time brcause I love this product regardless, and need it in bulk!</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived damaged and leaking all over the box.  Expecting a sterile ready to go product I was disappointed to not have that.</li>
