            <li>It would be a favorite of Al Capone!!</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s going to be my protective summer time soap when I want to avoid lanolin, as well as one of the more relaxing scents in my den., but uniqueness is perhaps the greatest prerequisite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another Top Notch product from Razorock Backed with one of the best customer service in the business.  </li>
            <li>What can I say about Razorock that hasn&#x27;t been said already, extremely easy to load, and it has procduced some of the the best lather I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>It is easy to build lather with, provides excellent cushion and glide for your razor along with superior post shave</li>
            <li>This my friends was a mudder focking good time.</li>
            <li>The Italians are known for their sophistication, good taste and consider living an art.  </li>
            <li>The scent is an awesome sweet smelling earthy scent.</li>

            <li>When it comes to soaps i feel the need to buy more than one of, it&#x27;s this one!</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing...</li>
            <li>soap is an amazing product and an amazing price.  </li>
            <li>It is a very affordable soap and provides an excellent face feel, like being covered in mud during a cruise for a 1000th of the price!</li>
            <li>A time when men shaved with sharpened steel blades, and made their own lather from a bowl and not from a can.  </li>
            <li>Beyond the quality of the product, which is fantastic, the company itself dedicates its time to the research and development of the best products available for a price point that everyone can afford.</li>
            <li>Thanks Joe for this amazing soap!!!</li>
            <li>Scent is light but a very nice men&#x27;s cologne type scent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great how a bit of inspiration can lead you to some unique results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it, and my wife loved it even more.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t concern yourself with performance or &amp;#34;lather-ability&amp;#34; at all, because every soap they make will lather very easily.</li>
            <li>It contains a special thermal mud that will turn you from Flabio to Fabio!!</li>
            <li>Razorock is an amazing brand and Mudder Focker is one of the better products in the market at any price.</li>
            <li>scent is ok, not as nice smelling as xxx.  </li>
            <li>If you want to try a true, top-shelf product without breaking the bank RR is the way to go.!!</li>
            <li>I would describe it as mild, pleasant and &amp;#34;spice plus&amp;#34; in nature.</li>
            <li>: It lathers very well in my area and a good lather helps you get a good shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First thing to note is that Joe&#x27;s a great guy.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>but in a good way) library that contains many leather bound books and smells of rich mahogany with a touch of vanilla.  </li>
            <li>The lather consistently has provided a great layer of protection for the razor against the skin.</li>
            <li>I have to admit this is my first time trying a RazoRock soap and what a great surprise.  </li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, kind of a sweet bread.</li>
            <li>In addition, RazoRock are a great company who do great things for the wet shaving community</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many soaps&lt;br /&gt;Always in the hopes</li>
            <li>soap will surely be a fave.</li>
            <li>Excellent Post Shave feel especially if you mate it with tje</li>
            <li>after using this soap my face was as smooth as Donald Trump&#x27;s Comb-over!</li>
            <li>In reality I love this stuff</li>
            <li>for the price I don&#x27;t think you will find a better soap.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that Joe from Razorock is a Canadian</li>
            <li>Have you ever been doing something, and thought to yourself that what you are doing could not get any better?  </li>
            <li>Like flying a helicopter through the Grand Canyon, driving a vintage Aston Martin around Brands Hatch, or eating at Heston Blumenthal&#x27;s The Fat Duck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sort of a citrusy aromatic vibe that comes out on top (which is where I think people are getting the cologne description).</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s going to be my protective summer time soap when I want to avoid lanolin, as well as one of the more relaxing scents in my den.</li>
            <li>It will seem like the razor isn&#x27;t touching your face at all.  </li>
            <li>I have a stack of Razorock soaps and the one that sits on top, the one i reach for the most</li>
            <li>Packaging, performance, price, everything is just top choice.</li>
            <li>I would gladly pay $40 for this Mudder Focker</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the most refined scent palate</li>
            <li>refreshing feeling better than it ever had shaving</li>
            <li>This soap scores a lot of top notch points in my book.</li>
            <li>Even my wife really enjoyed the scent, she said it reminds her of the &amp;#34;Vanilla Fields&amp;#34; cologne.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tends to be drawn to the elegant and stately creams of yore, but I was on a budget.  </li>
            <li>Amusing name, seemingly mystical ingredients, and a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li>Struck immediately by the elegant scent that was overwhelming in its depth, I knew my attempt at frugality had paid dividends.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never knew before this time that shaving could be enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>Truly a  fine  shaving soap which reflects the quality and workmanship for which Italian artisans are legendary.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fragrances are exotic yet familiar, with notes of sandalwood and strong bases of masculinity.</li>
            <li>I was able to use the remaining lather in my mug for a second application, and decided to go for an atg shave, with great results.</li>
            <li>Easily one of my faves.</li>
            <li>if you already have 10 Razorock soaps in your den, there&#x27;s a surprisingly strong case to be made for adding Mudder Focker to your stash.</li>
            <li>if you already have 10 Razorock soaps in your den, there&#x27;s a surprisingly strong case to be made for adding Mudder Focker to your stash.</li>
            <li>This soap performed great; very slick providing great protection for my skin.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not too many soaps that I&#x27;m willing to do that for, due to my EDT habit, but uniqueness is perhaps the greatest prerequisite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is nothing flowery or light about it.  </li>
            <li>It must be the additional earthly ingredient added to the Mudder Focker soap that takes it from a fantastic soap to a world class soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>shall it not be readily available again.</li>
            <li>Bought this soap on a whim a few months ago and I must say, this is one of the best shaving soaps I have used, period.</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasing, I would describe it as a... warm vanilla.  </li>
            <li>Artisan vanilla cola and a light musky cologne.  </li>
            <li>The scent will draw the female species right to your doorstep and beg you to do unspeakable things to them!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredible lather and slickness will glide that blade effortlessly.</li>
            <li>have used many of the Razorock soap and formulas(XXX Tallow, Zi&#x27;Peppino, Tobacco #1 and #2argain oil formula) and this formula stands out amongst the other great performers.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be both unique, and quite preferable in the summer heat.</li>
            <li>Joe is a great owner who is quite passionate about his offerings to the shaving world.</li>
            <li>Cheers Joe for my first and still most treasured soap.</li>
            <li>The skin feels clean and refreshed, like it has been rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>This Focker does so much more than just provide you with a slick, cushiony, great shaving experience; it leaves your skin feeling so clean, rejuvenated, exfoiliated, and smooth.</li>
            <li>A nice, masculine, cologne type scent!  </li>
            <li>The benefits of Fuller&#x27;s Earth are many and it is used for absorbing excess oil from skin, removes scars, improves skin complexion, treats acne, increases skin elasticity...</li>
            <li>I get a sweet, earthy, grounded scent.  </li>
            <li>I gave a good friend my Gillette Canadian Tech, and decided there was only one soap of quality that could go with it.  </li>
            <li>This Mudder Focker is very unique, as much Razorock products are.</li>
            <li>I imagine its what my super manly Uncle Ezio would smell like if I had an Uncle Ezio.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First for me the sent is mild.</li>
            <li>The scent is very clean and classic smelling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It always left my skin feeling great, and aftershaves were generally simply an excuse to experiment with more product.  </li>
            <li>To me its hard to describe the scent but while shaving with it it makes for such an enjoyable shave with one of the best post shaves</li>
            <li>his products are definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s distinct powdery cacao vibe...</li>
            <li>although it didn&#x27;t quite match up because Mudder Focker is slightly more fresh and masculine vs</li>
            <li>Who knew that covering your face in mud could be so enjoyable even if you&#x27;re not 5 years old anymore?</li>
            <li>The scent has a warm italian citrus note with a touch of vanilla and maybe even tobacco.</li>
            <li>With a Mission razor, an Omega brush, and a sampler of blades, I was determined to be economical.  </li>
            <li>They were rarely a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The post shave is notably more conditioning and softening than many other soaps I&#x27;ve used (vegan, tallow, or anywhere in between), but it doesn&#x27;t have that feel of an &amp;#34;extra layer&amp;#34; on your skin that lanolin gives you.</li>
            <li>I have since tried dozens of soaps and many manufacturers, including SMdF and other razorock products, but my latest purchase was nevertheless another Mudder Focker.  </li>
            <li>Cushion is fantastic, maintains a slick lather, and is great for use of a DE razor or Straight.</li>
            <li>Hard to elaborate more than that, but the post-shave feeling is good enough to not even need the use of alum, or an aftershave.</li>
            <li>A hot omega 48 brush, tapped slightly dry, with less than a teaspoon of this rich soap yielded the best lather I have ever had with a minimum of effort.</li>
            <li>This soap smells of what can only be described as a wonderful slightly musty (</li>
            <li>It is easy to lather, slick enough to provide a close smooth shave, and has a great post shave feeling.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how Razorock puts out consistently great products at such low price points.</li>
            <li>The intoxicating scent of light citrus, vanilla and tobacco on this stuff is fantastic and the added &#x27;mud(Fullers earth)&#x27; kicks up the post shave and face feel of this soap to the next level.</li>
            <li>The scent manages to be a bit fresh and somewhat classic, while striking that vibe of relaxing and natural, probably much like the spa which inspired it.</li>
            <li>RR MF quickly builds in volume to a rich and thick lather that coats the face very well and maintains a very enjoyable fragrance once lathered.</li>
            <li>They all give exactly what you want for protecting your face from a razor blade while still softening the hair you want to cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can confidently tell you that Mudder Focker stands out in a different way from any of the ones I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is pretty amazing--a blend of vanilla, tobacco, and what seems like a hint of vetiver and anise.  </li>
            <li>Buy this soap my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this soap for my first ever DE shave.  </li>
            <li>(though admittedly stylish) friends, I decided that the goatee would be a practical middle ground.  </li>
            <li>I thought that perhaps later I would purchase some higher ends creams to augment my status in the shaving world and step up towards a better product.  </li>
            <li>After the shave the RR MF rinses away cleanly leaving my skin soft and well moisturized .</li>
            <li>This scent is probably more agreeable than you&#x27;d expect, and was unique enough for me to get the matching aftershave to help carry the scent for several hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;RR MF  works very well with pretty much any type of brush</li>
            <li>Many of us shaving geeks have at least used some of the more popular Razorock soaps -- I&#x27;ve personally used XXX, Zi&#x27; Peppino, Don Marco, and recently Santa Maria del Fiore --</li>
            <li>Mudder Focker is certainly included in that recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Razorock has certainly become a premier line and this release furthers that.</li>
            <li>I have shaved with several different models of double edge razors and brands of blades, all of which cut beautifully with this product.</li>
            <li>Think Italians shoes, an Italian suit, and a fine perfume.</li>
            <li>Start the day, every day with a fine Italian shave soap.</li>
            <li>Since discovering the amazing difference shaving soap and a brush give me over stuff that comes out of a can my daily routine has not been the same.</li>
            <li>feel that leaves my sensitive skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the gentle prodding of a close friend I endeavored to shed my un-kept banner of the modern day hipster.  </li>
            <li>This scent is very pleasing and manly without being too over powering.</li>
            <li>Dior Homme Intense being a bit feminine (iris) and intimate.</li>
            <li>Plus, theres a matching aftershave splash to assure you carry on that fantastic scent throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li>so do yourself a favor, take advantage of the free shipping while it last and order yourself plenty of Focking soap so you never regret it!</li>
            <li>soap is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>After getting all spiffed up with a shave using this Mudder Focking soap I am ready to go oot</li>
            <li>It really makes the razor glide across my face with the feeling of no resistance.  </li>
            <li>You really begin to see the benefits of this ingredient after using the Mudder Focker soap.  </li>
            <li>So after much deliberation, I picked Mudder Focker.  </li>
            <li>Since then I have tried to bring into the wet shaving fold as many cartridge enslaved gents as I could.   </li>
            <li>Even after first pass, enough stayed on my face for some quick touch ups.</li>
            <li>a budding fragrance geek w/ about 40 EDTs in my collection right now, and</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different brushes of varying density to see how well the product loads into the brush and creates lather and was pleased that the soft texture makes the soap very easy to lather with any brush.</li>
            <li>Under any other brand name the cost of this soap would be many times the price.  </li>
            <li>Mudder Focker had a scent unique enough where I didn&#x27;t quite know what to pair with it.</li>
            <li>I managed to whip up a tremendous lather on my first attempt, and have yet to find a soap that builds a lather this easily and with such a wide margin for hydration.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft Italian style soap made in Italy, which makes it really easy to load a brush</li>
            <li>The method that has worked consistently well for me is to load the brush in the plastic bowl followed by lathering directly on my face to build the lather.</li>
            <li>great thing about this soap is how easy it churns up into a thick silky slick lather.  </li>
            <li>Not only is my face baby-butt smooth, but it is sooo soft.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The prices are incredibly low and they are very usable for beginners picking up a shaving brush for the first time.</li>
            <li>makes it worth the purchase, and will be in my regular rotation.</li>
            <li>I have other shave soaps that I love to use as well, but mudder focker just seems to have a certain feel to it that brings you back to a simpler time before fancy five finned razors.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s price, and the point that I want to emphasize is that it does this more so than perhaps any other Razorock soap (not just soaps in general).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a new soap give this a shot.  </li>
            <li>I just shaved with my new container of Mudder Focker from Razorrock, you know eh.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and the protection from this soap and</li>
            <li>It veers slightly to the sweet side, with perhaps the easiest thing I can point to being a gentle vanilla or cacao.</li>
            <li>This one is one of the first soaps I ordered along with the matching soap almost entirely based on the name because I&#x27;m an immature child man.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m typically a fan of lanolin soaps for their enhanced post shave feel, but many of them make me a bit itchy in the summer time when my skin doesn&#x27;t need that extra layer of protection.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really the manliest facial you will receive.</li>
            <li>The splash changed my perception as well, you don&#x27;t need to fear an alcohol splash even with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Give Mudder Focker a try, you will understand what I mean when I say shaving does not get better than this.</li>
            <li>Overall its a 9/10 soap, if you&#x27;ve never tried a Razorock before I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I recommended their products to anybody wether a new wet shaver or seasoned veteran.</li>
            <li>With several hundreds of different shaving soaps in the market it is almost impossible to know what product is best for you to buy, I personally have acquired over 40 shaving soaps and creams in my bathroom!</li>
            <li>It lathers directly on the face or in a bowl (my preference) easily and quickly with a thick and slick lather.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers easily, and the fuller&#x27;s earth in the mix makes the lather extra slick.  </li>
            <li>There are a number of products you didn&#x27;t actually know you needed until you purchased them, but once you had them, you simply cannot live without them anymore.  </li>
            <li>Intense due</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving or shaving soaps, please believe all of the reviews regarding Razorock soaps.</li>
            <li>Very comforting and relaxing, but also blended to sit somewhat evenly with a slightly Earthy undertone (so slight that I only really detect it out of the tub), and</li>
            <li>Product was less than half full.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The best way I can describe</li>

            <li> The scent is very pleasant.  </li>

            <li> When it comes to soaps i feel the need to buy more than one of, it&#x27;s this one!</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing...</li>
            <li> soap is an amazing product and an amazing price.  </li>
            <li> It is a very affordable soap and provides an excellent face feel, like being covered in mud during a cruise for a 1000th of the price!</li>
            <li> A time when men shaved with sharpened steel blades, and made their own lather from a bowl and not from a can.  </li>
            <li> Beyond the quality of the product, which is fantastic, the company itself dedicates its time to the research and development of the best products available for a price point that everyone can afford.</li>
            <li> Thanks Joe for this amazing soap!!!</li>
            <li> Scent is light but a very nice men&#x27;s cologne type scent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great how a bit of inspiration can lead you to some unique results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it, and my wife loved it even more.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t concern yourself with performance or &amp;#34;lather-ability&amp;#34; at all, because every soap they make will lather very easily.</li>
            <li> It contains a special thermal mud that will turn you from Flabio to Fabio!!</li>
            <li> Razorock is an amazing brand and Mudder Focker is one of the better products in the market at any price.</li>
            <li> scent is ok, not as nice smelling as xxx.  </li>
            <li> If you want to try a true, top-shelf product without breaking the bank RR is the way to go.!!</li>
            <li> I would describe it as mild, pleasant and &amp;#34;spice plus&amp;#34; in nature.</li>
            <li> : It lathers very well in my area and a good lather helps you get a good shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First thing to note is that Joe&#x27;s a great guy.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> but in a good way) library that contains many leather bound books and smells of rich mahogany with a touch of vanilla.  </li>
            <li> The lather consistently has provided a great layer of protection for the razor against the skin.</li>
            <li> I have to admit this is my first time trying a RazoRock soap and what a great surprise.  </li>
            <li> The scent is amazing, kind of a sweet bread.</li>
            <li> In addition, RazoRock are a great company who do great things for the wet shaving community</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many soaps&lt;br /&gt;Always in the hopes</li>
            <li> soap will surely be a fave.</li>
            <li> Excellent Post Shave feel especially if you mate it with tje</li>
            <li> after using this soap my face was as smooth as Donald Trump&#x27;s Comb-over!</li>
            <li> In reality I love this stuff</li>
            <li> for the price I don&#x27;t think you will find a better soap.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that Joe from Razorock is a Canadian</li>
            <li> Have you ever been doing something, and thought to yourself that what you are doing could not get any better?  </li>
            <li> Like flying a helicopter through the Grand Canyon, driving a vintage Aston Martin around Brands Hatch, or eating at Heston Blumenthal&#x27;s The Fat Duck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sort of a citrusy aromatic vibe that comes out on top (which is where I think people are getting the cologne description).</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s going to be my protective summer time soap when I want to avoid lanolin, as well as one of the more relaxing scents in my den.</li>
            <li> It will seem like the razor isn&#x27;t touching your face at all.  </li>
            <li> I have a stack of Razorock soaps and the one that sits on top, the one i reach for the most</li>
            <li> Packaging, performance, price, everything is just top choice.</li>
            <li> I would gladly pay $40 for this Mudder Focker</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the most refined scent palate</li>
            <li> refreshing feeling better than it ever had shaving</li>
            <li> This soap scores a lot of top notch points in my book.</li>
            <li> Even my wife really enjoyed the scent, she said it reminds her of the &amp;#34;Vanilla Fields&amp;#34; cologne.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tends to be drawn to the elegant and stately creams of yore, but I was on a budget.  </li>
            <li> Amusing name, seemingly mystical ingredients, and a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li> Struck immediately by the elegant scent that was overwhelming in its depth, I knew my attempt at frugality had paid dividends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never knew before this time that shaving could be enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> Truly a  fine  shaving soap which reflects the quality and workmanship for which Italian artisans are legendary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The fragrances are exotic yet familiar, with notes of sandalwood and strong bases of masculinity.</li>
            <li> I was able to use the remaining lather in my mug for a second application, and decided to go for an atg shave, with great results.</li>
            <li> Easily one of my faves.</li>
            <li> if you already have 10 Razorock soaps in your den, there&#x27;s a surprisingly strong case to be made for adding Mudder Focker to your stash.</li>
            <li> if you already have 10 Razorock soaps in your den, there&#x27;s a surprisingly strong case to be made for adding Mudder Focker to your stash.</li>
            <li> This soap performed great; very slick providing great protection for my skin.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not too many soaps that I&#x27;m willing to do that for, due to my EDT habit, but uniqueness is perhaps the greatest prerequisite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is nothing flowery or light about it.  </li>
            <li> It must be the additional earthly ingredient added to the Mudder Focker soap that takes it from a fantastic soap to a world class soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> shall it not be readily available again.</li>
            <li> Bought this soap on a whim a few months ago and I must say, this is one of the best shaving soaps I have used, period.</li>
            <li> The scent is very pleasing, I would describe it as a... warm vanilla.  </li>
            <li> Artisan vanilla cola and a light musky cologne.  </li>
            <li> The scent will draw the female species right to your doorstep and beg you to do unspeakable things to them!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredible lather and slickness will glide that blade effortlessly.</li>
            <li> have used many of the Razorock soap and formulas(XXX Tallow, Zi&#x27;Peppino, Tobacco #1 and #2argain oil formula) and this formula stands out amongst the other great performers.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be both unique, and quite preferable in the summer heat.</li>
            <li> Joe is a great owner who is quite passionate about his offerings to the shaving world.</li>
            <li> Cheers Joe for my first and still most treasured soap.</li>
            <li> The skin feels clean and refreshed, like it has been rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li> This Focker does so much more than just provide you with a slick, cushiony, great shaving experience; it leaves your skin feeling so clean, rejuvenated, exfoiliated, and smooth.</li>
            <li> A nice, masculine, cologne type scent!  </li>
            <li> The benefits of Fuller&#x27;s Earth are many and it is used for absorbing excess oil from skin, removes scars, improves skin complexion, treats acne, increases skin elasticity...</li>
            <li> I get a sweet, earthy, grounded scent.  </li>
            <li> I gave a good friend my Gillette Canadian Tech, and decided there was only one soap of quality that could go with it.  </li>
            <li> This Mudder Focker is very unique, as much Razorock products are.</li>
            <li> I imagine its what my super manly Uncle Ezio would smell like if I had an Uncle Ezio.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First for me the sent is mild.</li>
            <li> The scent is very clean and classic smelling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It always left my skin feeling great, and aftershaves were generally simply an excuse to experiment with more product.  </li>
            <li> To me its hard to describe the scent but while shaving with it it makes for such an enjoyable shave with one of the best post shaves</li>
            <li> his products are definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s distinct powdery cacao vibe...</li>
            <li> although it didn&#x27;t quite match up because Mudder Focker is slightly more fresh and masculine vs</li>
            <li> Who knew that covering your face in mud could be so enjoyable even if you&#x27;re not 5 years old anymore?</li>
            <li> The scent has a warm italian citrus note with a touch of vanilla and maybe even tobacco.</li>
            <li> With a Mission razor, an Omega brush, and a sampler of blades, I was determined to be economical.  </li>
            <li> They were rarely a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The post shave is notably more conditioning and softening than many other soaps I&#x27;ve used (vegan, tallow, or anywhere in between), but it doesn&#x27;t have that feel of an &amp;#34;extra layer&amp;#34; on your skin that lanolin gives you.</li>
            <li> I have since tried dozens of soaps and many manufacturers, including SMdF and other razorock products, but my latest purchase was nevertheless another Mudder Focker.  </li>
            <li> Cushion is fantastic, maintains a slick lather, and is great for use of a DE razor or Straight.</li>
            <li> Hard to elaborate more than that, but the post-shave feeling is good enough to not even need the use of alum, or an aftershave.</li>
            <li> A hot omega 48 brush, tapped slightly dry, with less than a teaspoon of this rich soap yielded the best lather I have ever had with a minimum of effort.</li>
            <li> This soap smells of what can only be described as a wonderful slightly musty (</li>
            <li> It is easy to lather, slick enough to provide a close smooth shave, and has a great post shave feeling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how Razorock puts out consistently great products at such low price points.</li>
            <li> The intoxicating scent of light citrus, vanilla and tobacco on this stuff is fantastic and the added &#x27;mud(Fullers earth)&#x27; kicks up the post shave and face feel of this soap to the next level.</li>
            <li> The scent manages to be a bit fresh and somewhat classic, while striking that vibe of relaxing and natural, probably much like the spa which inspired it.</li>
            <li> RR MF quickly builds in volume to a rich and thick lather that coats the face very well and maintains a very enjoyable fragrance once lathered.</li>
            <li> They all give exactly what you want for protecting your face from a razor blade while still softening the hair you want to cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can confidently tell you that Mudder Focker stands out in a different way from any of the ones I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is pretty amazing--a blend of vanilla, tobacco, and what seems like a hint of vetiver and anise.  </li>
            <li> Buy this soap my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this soap for my first ever DE shave.  </li>
            <li> (though admittedly stylish) friends, I decided that the goatee would be a practical middle ground.  </li>
            <li> I thought that perhaps later I would purchase some higher ends creams to augment my status in the shaving world and step up towards a better product.  </li>
            <li> After the shave the RR MF rinses away cleanly leaving my skin soft and well moisturized .</li>
            <li> This scent is probably more agreeable than you&#x27;d expect, and was unique enough for me to get the matching aftershave to help carry the scent for several hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;RR MF  works very well with pretty much any type of brush</li>
            <li> Many of us shaving geeks have at least used some of the more popular Razorock soaps -- I&#x27;ve personally used XXX, Zi&#x27; Peppino, Don Marco, and recently Santa Maria del Fiore --</li>
            <li> Mudder Focker is certainly included in that recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Razorock has certainly become a premier line and this release furthers that.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with several different models of double edge razors and brands of blades, all of which cut beautifully with this product.</li>
            <li> Think Italians shoes, an Italian suit, and a fine perfume.</li>
            <li> Start the day, every day with a fine Italian shave soap.</li>
            <li> Since discovering the amazing difference shaving soap and a brush give me over stuff that comes out of a can my daily routine has not been the same.</li>
            <li> feel that leaves my sensitive skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the gentle prodding of a close friend I endeavored to shed my un-kept banner of the modern day hipster.  </li>
            <li> This scent is very pleasing and manly without being too over powering.</li>
            <li> Dior Homme Intense being a bit feminine (iris) and intimate.</li>
            <li> Plus, theres a matching aftershave splash to assure you carry on that fantastic scent throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li> so do yourself a favor, take advantage of the free shipping while it last and order yourself plenty of Focking soap so you never regret it!</li>
            <li> soap is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> After getting all spiffed up with a shave using this Mudder Focking soap I am ready to go oot</li>
            <li> It really makes the razor glide across my face with the feeling of no resistance.  </li>
            <li> You really begin to see the benefits of this ingredient after using the Mudder Focker soap.  </li>
            <li> So after much deliberation, I picked Mudder Focker.  </li>
            <li> Since then I have tried to bring into the wet shaving fold as many cartridge enslaved gents as I could.   </li>
            <li> Even after first pass, enough stayed on my face for some quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> a budding fragrance geek w/ about 40 EDTs in my collection right now, and</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brushes of varying density to see how well the product loads into the brush and creates lather and was pleased that the soft texture makes the soap very easy to lather with any brush.</li>
            <li> Under any other brand name the cost of this soap would be many times the price.  </li>
            <li> Mudder Focker had a scent unique enough where I didn&#x27;t quite know what to pair with it.</li>
            <li> I managed to whip up a tremendous lather on my first attempt, and have yet to find a soap that builds a lather this easily and with such a wide margin for hydration.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft Italian style soap made in Italy, which makes it really easy to load a brush</li>
            <li> The method that has worked consistently well for me is to load the brush in the plastic bowl followed by lathering directly on my face to build the lather.</li>
            <li> great thing about this soap is how easy it churns up into a thick silky slick lather.  </li>
            <li> Not only is my face baby-butt smooth, but it is sooo soft.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The prices are incredibly low and they are very usable for beginners picking up a shaving brush for the first time.</li>
            <li> makes it worth the purchase, and will be in my regular rotation.</li>
            <li> I have other shave soaps that I love to use as well, but mudder focker just seems to have a certain feel to it that brings you back to a simpler time before fancy five finned razors.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s price, and the point that I want to emphasize is that it does this more so than perhaps any other Razorock soap (not just soaps in general).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a new soap give this a shot.  </li>
            <li> I just shaved with my new container of Mudder Focker from Razorrock, you know eh.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and the protection from this soap and</li>
            <li> It veers slightly to the sweet side, with perhaps the easiest thing I can point to being a gentle vanilla or cacao.</li>
            <li> This one is one of the first soaps I ordered along with the matching soap almost entirely based on the name because I&#x27;m an immature child man.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m typically a fan of lanolin soaps for their enhanced post shave feel, but many of them make me a bit itchy in the summer time when my skin doesn&#x27;t need that extra layer of protection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really the manliest facial you will receive.</li>
            <li> The splash changed my perception as well, you don&#x27;t need to fear an alcohol splash even with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Give Mudder Focker a try, you will understand what I mean when I say shaving does not get better than this.</li>
            <li> Overall its a 9/10 soap, if you&#x27;ve never tried a Razorock before I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I recommended their products to anybody wether a new wet shaver or seasoned veteran.</li>
            <li> With several hundreds of different shaving soaps in the market it is almost impossible to know what product is best for you to buy, I personally have acquired over 40 shaving soaps and creams in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> It lathers directly on the face or in a bowl (my preference) easily and quickly with a thick and slick lather.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers easily, and the fuller&#x27;s earth in the mix makes the lather extra slick.  </li>
            <li> There are a number of products you didn&#x27;t actually know you needed until you purchased them, but once you had them, you simply cannot live without them anymore.  </li>
            <li> Intense due</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving or shaving soaps, please believe all of the reviews regarding Razorock soaps.</li>
            <li> Very comforting and relaxing, but also blended to sit somewhat evenly with a slightly Earthy undertone (so slight that I only really detect it out of the tub), and</li>
            <li> Product was less than half full.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, even veteran wet shavers should take note that Mudder Focker (full disclosure: I ALMOST made a dangerous typo right there) punches way above</li>
            <li> last thing I will say is the the owners are passionate about their quality and service and never disappoint.</li>
            <li> This stuff is made in limited quantities by a European artisan.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to wet shaving but after trying a few soaps from the pharmacy I learned about Razorock on Instagram.</li>
            <li> The lather that this and all Razorock shave soaps produce is thick, rich and slick.</li>

            <li> Mudder Focker if this isn&#x27;t a great soap. The thermal mud used in this soap leaves a great post-shave feel. I feel like a man that just mud wrestled a grizzly bear off my face. Get this soap, get muddy, have a focking great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mudder Focking time!</li>
            <li> Just introduced this soap to my collection and I am very pleased that I did.  This soap performed great; very slick providing great protection for my skin.  The scent is very pleasant.  The best way I can describe it is a sort of manlier scent.  There is nothing flowery or light about it.  I imagine its what my super manly Uncle Ezio would smell like if I had an Uncle Ezio.  If you&#x27;re looking for a new soap give this a shot.  In addition, RazoRock are a great company who do great things for the wet shaving community so they deserve your business!</li>
            <li> First thing to note is that Joe&#x27;s a great guy.&lt;br /&gt;All his products are definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;This soap is no exception&lt;br /&gt;In fact, it&#x27;s perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many soaps&lt;br /&gt;Always in the hopes&lt;br /&gt;Of finding a soap like this.&lt;br /&gt;Mudder focker is not one to miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather is thick&lt;br /&gt;And it slides so slick&lt;br /&gt;If you you love a great shave&lt;br /&gt;This soap will surely be a fave.</li>
            <li> I have over 25 Razorock products including 14 soaps and this along with The Freedberg are my favorites. This scent is very pleasing and manly without being too over powering. The lather that this and all Razorock shave soaps produce is thick, rich and slick. Excellent Post Shave feel especially if you mate it with tje After Shave Splash. I don&#x27;t know how Razorock puts out consistently great products at such low price points. Bravisimo Razorock!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying that the little green dude is something if Caitlyn Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner had a baby. I am saying that this is a terrific soap and one of my favorites in my den. Great soap great scent. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing...after using this soap my face was as smooth as Donald Trump&#x27;s Comb-over! I had a Dr&#x27;s appointment two days after beginning to use this product...my cholesterol had dropped by 40 points, I had lost 13 pounds, my eyesite is now 15/20, I have grown two inches, I can now see through walls and I just challenged Chuck Norris to a Thumb War. The only downside to use of this product has been that I have yet to sleep since I started using it due to the fact that I can now hear people&#x27;s thoughts and the neighbor stays up all night thinking things unlawful for me to speak of. In reality I love this stuff and I&#x27;m unlikely to use another soap with my DE razor for at least a millennium! Go buy some and you will be your spouse&#x27;s superhero also!</li>
            <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t be intrigued by a shave soap called Mudder Focker! It contains a special thermal mud that will turn you from Flabio to Fabio!! The scent will draw the female species right to your doorstep and beg you to do unspeakable things to them!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredible lather and slickness will glide that blade effortlessly. C&#x27;mon, get some....NOW!</li>
            <li> Great Price - CHECK&lt;br /&gt;Great Performance - CHECK&lt;br /&gt;Great Scent - CHECK&lt;br /&gt;Great Company - CHECK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, Razorock has to be one of, if not, the best values in shaving. Mudder Focker personifies this. The intoxicating scent of light citrus, vanilla and tobacco on this stuff is fantastic and the added &#x27;mud(Fullers earth)&#x27; kicks up the post shave and face feel of this soap to the next level. Don&#x27;t let the name fool you. This DOES NOT smell like mud......cause if mud smelled like this we would all be like pigs rolling around in it. The scent is very clean and classic smelling.&lt;br /&gt;I have used many of the Razorock soap and formulas(XXX Tallow, Zi&#x27;Peppino, Tobacco #1 and #2argain oil formula) and this formula stands out amongst the other great performers.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wait any longer to try this soap.....for the price I don&#x27;t think you will find a better soap.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that Joe from Razorock is a Canadian gives him an EH+ in my book!</li>
            <li> Product was less than half full.</li>
            <li> Have you ever been doing something, and thought to yourself that what you are doing could not get any better?  Like flying a helicopter through the Grand Canyon, driving a vintage Aston Martin around Brands Hatch, or eating at Heston Blumenthal&#x27;s The Fat Duck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the same feeling I get while shaving with Razorock Mudder Focker shaving soap.  All Razorock soaps have enticing scents without being overpowering.  They all give exactly what you want for protecting your face from a razor blade while still softening the hair you want to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where Razorock Mudder Focker excels over the others is the way it leaves your skin feeling after a shave.  The skin feels clean and refreshed, like it has been rejuvenated.  There is no need for alum or any other post shave treatment, aftershave seems optional.  It must be the additional earthly ingredient added to the Mudder Focker soap that takes it from a fantastic soap to a world class soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be deceived by the price.  Under any other brand name the cost of this soap would be many times the price.  Give Mudder Focker a try, you will understand what I mean when I say shaving does not get better than this.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving or shaving soaps, please believe all of the reviews regarding Razorock soaps. The prices are incredibly low and they are very usable for beginners picking up a shaving brush for the first time. Don&#x27;t concern yourself with performance or &amp;#34;lather-ability&amp;#34; at all, because every soap they make will lather very easily. Mudder Focker is certainly included in that recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, even veteran wet shavers should take note that Mudder Focker (full disclosure: I ALMOST made a dangerous typo right there) punches way above it&#x27;s price, and the point that I want to emphasize is that it does this more so than perhaps any other Razorock soap (not just soaps in general). Many of us shaving geeks have at least used some of the more popular Razorock soaps -- I&#x27;ve personally used XXX, Zi&#x27; Peppino, Don Marco, and recently Santa Maria del Fiore -- and I can confidently tell you that Mudder Focker stands out in a different way from any of the ones I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m typically a fan of lanolin soaps for their enhanced post shave feel, but many of them make me a bit itchy in the summer time when my skin doesn&#x27;t need that extra layer of protection. Mudder Focker (and what I can only assume is the Fuller&#x27;s Earth ingredient) gives you something different. The post shave is notably more conditioning and softening than many other soaps I&#x27;ve used (vegan, tallow, or anywhere in between), but it doesn&#x27;t have that feel of an &amp;#34;extra layer&amp;#34; on your skin that lanolin gives you. Your skin simply feels &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; rather than over-protected or, dare I say, &amp;#34;gunked up&amp;#34; the way lanolin sometimes does. I&#x27;ve found this to be both unique, and quite preferable in the summer heat. In the category of post shave, Mudder Focker is 1 of 1; difficult to compare, and almost in a category of its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the reason that this soap has gone a bit under-appreciated is because the name and description can leave you scratching your head over what it actually smells like. Does it smell like mud? Dirt? Earth? Fock? A lot of people say &amp;#34;cologne type&amp;#34; scent, but you know that it was meant to remind you of a spa... so... cologne-type-spa scent??? The truth is that the scent is well-blended, so it&#x27;s tough to just pick out distinctive notes. It veers slightly to the sweet side, with perhaps the easiest thing I can point to being a gentle vanilla or cacao. Very comforting and relaxing, but also blended to sit somewhat evenly with a slightly Earthy undertone (so slight that I only really detect it out of the tub), and sort of a citrusy aromatic vibe that comes out on top (which is where I think people are getting the cologne description). The scent manages to be a bit fresh and somewhat classic, while striking that vibe of relaxing and natural, probably much like the spa which inspired it. Think about how tricky it must have been to combine such elements: spa + nature + shaving... it&#x27;s great how a bit of inspiration can lead you to some unique results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a budding fragrance geek w/ about 40 EDTs in my collection right now, and Mudder Focker had a scent unique enough where I didn&#x27;t quite know what to pair with it. The closest thing in my collection turned out to be Dior Homme Intense due it&#x27;s distinct powdery cacao vibe... although it didn&#x27;t quite match up because Mudder Focker is slightly more fresh and masculine vs Dior Homme Intense being a bit feminine (iris) and intimate. So what was the solution??? I GOT THE MUDDER FOCKING AFTERSHAVE SPLASH!! So dispel any weird conclusions your subconscious may have drawn from the name, description, or the green cartoon barber who is now the mascot for this soap (Mr. Focker himself? THE Focker?).  This scent is probably more agreeable than you&#x27;d expect, and was unique enough for me to get the matching aftershave to help carry the scent for several hours. There&#x27;s not too many soaps that I&#x27;m willing to do that for, due to my EDT habit, but uniqueness is perhaps the greatest prerequisite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you already have 10 Razorock soaps in your den, there&#x27;s a surprisingly strong case to be made for adding Mudder Focker to your stash. For me, it&#x27;s going to be my protective summer time soap when I want to avoid lanolin, as well as one of the more relaxing scents in my den., but uniqueness is perhaps the greatest prerequisite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you already have 10 Razorock soaps in your den, there&#x27;s a surprisingly strong case to be made for adding Mudder Focker to your stash. For me, it&#x27;s going to be my protective summer time soap when I want to avoid lanolin, as well as one of the more relaxing scents in my den.</li>
            <li> There are a number of products you didn&#x27;t actually know you needed until you purchased them, but once you had them, you simply cannot live without them anymore.  For example, you had no idea you needed a blanket with sleeves, but now you have a Snuggie for every room of the house.  You might not realize that you need this awesome shaving soap, but you do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mudder Focker is a perfect shaving product.  The soap lathers easily, and the fuller&#x27;s earth in the mix makes the lather extra slick.  It will seem like the razor isn&#x27;t touching your face at all.  When the shave is over, you won&#x27;t believe how nourished and hydrated your face is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pretty amazing--a blend of vanilla, tobacco, and what seems like a hint of vetiver and anise.  It&#x27;s a very complex, manly, cologne-type scent.  Seriously, this stuff is the goods.  I love it, and my wife loved it even more.  Just do yourself a favor and go ahead and order the matching aftershave from Razorock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is an amazing product and an amazing price.  Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Razorock has been topping the charts for years.! If you have yet to try them noes the time.! Their pricing and service is unbeatable. If you want to try a true, top-shelf product without breaking the bank RR is the way to go.!! I&#x27;ve tried them all, and as time goes on the products get better!! Kiddos for all the efforts! Can&#x27;t wait to see what they come up with next!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite Razorock soaps!  Always great performance but the scent is awesome!!  I would describe it as mild, pleasant and &amp;#34;spice plus&amp;#34; in nature. A nice, masculine, cologne type scent!  It would be a favorite of Al Capone!!</li>
            <li> What can you say , just another winner from Rozorock . Excellent performance and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Who knew that covering your face in mud could be so enjoyable even if you&#x27;re not 5 years old anymore? This soap has excellent performance. Provided wonderful slickness and excellent protection. It is a very affordable soap and provides an excellent face feel, like being covered in mud during a cruise for a 1000th of the price! Definitely a soap that belongs in your shave den.</li>
            <li> You guys (and ladies) need this Mudder Focker in your life. I have a stack of Razorock soaps and the one that sits on top, the one i reach for the most is Mudder Focker. This Focker does so much more than just provide you with a slick, cushiony, great shaving experience; it leaves your skin feeling so clean, rejuvenated, exfoiliated, and smooth. It&#x27;s really the manliest facial you will receive. This Mudder Focker is very unique, as much Razorock products are. Plus, theres a matching aftershave splash to assure you carry on that fantastic scent throughout the entire day. When it comes to soaps i feel the need to buy more than one of, it&#x27;s this one! I never want to run out of this Focking soap so do yourself a favor, take advantage of the free shipping while it last and order yourself plenty of Focking soap so you never regret it! Packaging, performance, price, everything is just top choice. I would gladly pay $40 for this Mudder Focker shall it not be readily available again. Hurry up and order this focking soap before i buy them all myself!</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to wet shaving but after trying a few soaps from the pharmacy I learned about Razorock on Instagram. This one is one of the first soaps I ordered along with the matching soap almost entirely based on the name because I&#x27;m an immature child man. That said it didn&#x27;t only out perform the other soaps I had in my drawer in terms of ease of use but also the way my face felt post shave. It lathers directly on the face or in a bowl (my preference) easily and quickly with a thick and slick lather. I don&#x27;t have the most refined scent palate but I find myself sniffing this stuff all the time even when I&#x27;m not shaving. The splash changed my perception as well, you don&#x27;t need to fear an alcohol splash even with sensitive skin. I have very sensitive skin and the protection from this soap and refreshing feeling better than it ever had shaving before.&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I will say is the the owners are passionate about their quality and service and never disappoint. I recommended their products to anybody wether a new wet shaver or seasoned veteran.</li>
            <li> Since discovering the amazing difference shaving soap and a brush give me over stuff that comes out of a can my daily routine has not been the same. I now look forward to my daily shave instead of thinking of it as one of the worst parts of my morning. With several hundreds of different shaving soaps in the market it is almost impossible to know what product is best for you to buy, I personally have acquired over 40 shaving soaps and creams in my bathroom! Razorock is an amazing brand and Mudder Focker is one of the better products in the market at any price. It is easy to build lather with, provides excellent cushion and glide for your razor along with superior post shave feel that leaves my sensitive skin feeling soft and smooth.  Don&#x27;t overlook this product because it is inexpensive. This stuff is made in limited quantities by a European artisan. Razorock could place this stuff in glass jars with fancy packaging and charge triple the price if they wanted. So get your hands on it while you still can.</li>
            <li> Wet shaving is an affordable luxury, and the possession of Razorock Mudder Focker shaving soap epitomizes an investment in an indulgence.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrances are exotic yet familiar, with notes of sandalwood and strong bases of masculinity. A hot omega 48 brush, tapped slightly dry, with less than a teaspoon of this rich soap yielded the best lather I have ever had with a minimum of effort. Even after first pass, enough stayed on my face for some quick touch ups. I was able to use the remaining lather in my mug for a second application, and decided to go for an atg shave, with great results. I&#x27;m often a victim of razor burn and in growns, however, after a splash of witch hazel and a cold towel, and I found myself without either.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s why I like this shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First for me the sent is mild. I have chronic headaches, and migraines. This soap doesn&#x27;t make them worse, and is doesn&#x27;t make me nauseous.&lt;br /&gt;Two: It lathers very well in my area and a good lather helps you get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;Third: My face fells moisturized. I&#x27;ve tried soaps that I would never use again because of drying issues. I don&#x27;t have that problem with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, with my body chemistry and water conditions, this soap doesn&#x27;t linger. If i want to go out and wear cologne I can, this is great for date night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to blow smoke. This soap just works for me.</li>
            <li> Slippery smoothness batman!  This shave soap is the real deal.  This soap smells of what can only be described as a wonderful slightly musty (but in a good way) library that contains many leather bound books and smells of rich mahogany with a touch of vanilla.  It&#x27;ll make your face feel like a newborn.  It&#x27;ll make you feel like the dos Equis guy, and it&#x27;ll cause women to instinctively flock to you like the salmon of Capistrano.  I have other shave soaps that I love to use as well, but mudder focker just seems to have a certain feel to it that brings you back to a simpler time before fancy five finned razors.  A time when men shaved with sharpened steel blades, and made their own lather from a bowl and not from a can.  This my friends was a mudder focking good time.</li>
            <li> Where do I start with this stuff? The scent is an awesome sweet smelling earthy scent. But the performance is where this stuff shines! It is easy to lather, slick enough to provide a close smooth shave, and has a great post shave feeling. Easily one of my faves. Try this and see what a great soap it is!</li>
            <li> What can I say about Razorock that hasn&#x27;t been said already, extremely easy to load, and it has procduced some of the the best lather I&#x27;ve ever had. The scent is amazing, kind of a sweet bread. Overall its a 9/10 soap, if you&#x27;ve never tried a Razorock before I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This soap was awesome!! Hard to elaborate more than that, but the post-shave feeling is good enough to not even need the use of alum, or an aftershave. Great scent as well.</li>
            <li> Bought this soap on a whim a few months ago and I must say, this is one of the best shaving soaps I have used, period. The italian artisans who created this soap integrated actual thermal mud in the soap in order to create a post shave feel that rivals the use of an aftershave balm. Cushion is fantastic, maintains a slick lather, and is great for use of a DE razor or Straight. I shave with both and I have not had single bad shave. The scent has a warm italian citrus note with a touch of vanilla and maybe even tobacco. They truly hit the nail on the head with this soap. Razorock has certainly become a premier line and this release furthers that. Beyond the quality of the product, which is fantastic, the company itself dedicates its time to the research and development of the best products available for a price point that everyone can afford. Joe is a great owner who is quite passionate about his offerings to the shaving world. Thanks Joe for this amazing soap!!!</li>
            <li> Truly a  fine  shaving soap which reflects the quality and workmanship for which Italian artisans are legendary. The Italians are known for their sophistication, good taste and consider living an art.  Think Italians shoes, an Italian suit, and a fine perfume. Start the day, every day with a fine Italian shave soap. Think Razorock.</li>
            <li> I just shaved with my new container of Mudder Focker from Razorrock, you know eh.  I was very impressed with this soap.  Scent is light but a very nice men&#x27;s cologne type scent. After getting all spiffed up with a shave using this Mudder Focking soap I am ready to go oot &#x27;n aboot and see if it draws the female species like another reviewer claimed.  Don&#x27;t tell my wife I said that.</li>
            <li> This mudder focking shave soap gave me the best mudder focking shave of my mudder focking life.</li>
            <li> Razorock Mudder Focker is one of those that is truly under estimated in my book. Just like Totto Schillaci from the 1990 World cup soccer team. Cam off the bench as a substitute and started to score. Well this soap in my book did the same thing. This soap scores a lot of top notch points in my book. To me its one of the best soaps I ever used. To me its hard to describe the scent but while shaving with it it makes for such an enjoyable shave with one of the best post shaves feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RR MF  works very well with pretty much any type of brush I tried. The method that has worked consistently well for me is to load the brush in the plastic bowl followed by lathering directly on my face to build the lather. RR MF quickly builds in volume to a rich and thick lather that coats the face very well and maintains a very enjoyable fragrance once lathered. I have tried a few different brushes of varying density to see how well the product loads into the brush and creates lather and was pleased that the soft texture makes the soap very easy to lather with any brush. During the shave, I found the RR MF to be an excellent product. Once the soap is lathered, it is very slick and lubricating with little to no excess bubbles. The lather consistently has provided a great layer of protection for the razor against the skin. I have shaved with several different models of double edge razors and brands of blades, all of which cut beautifully with this product. After the shave the RR MF rinses away cleanly leaving my skin soft and well moisturized . Another Top Notch product from Razorock Backed with one of the best customer service in the business.  I am so happy I have 3 containers of this soap in my Den.</li>
            <li> I have to admit this is my first time trying a RazoRock soap and what a great surprise.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of other artisan soaps and this is the cream of the crop.  The scent is very pleasing, I would describe it as a... warm vanilla.  Even my wife really enjoyed the scent, she said it reminds her of the &amp;#34;Vanilla Fields&amp;#34; cologne.  It&#x27;s a soft Italian style soap made in Italy, which makes it really easy to load a brush with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great thing about this soap is how easy it churns up into a thick silky slick lather.  It really makes the razor glide across my face with the feeling of no resistance.  But the best thing about this soap is how it makes my face feel after the shave.  Not only is my face baby-butt smooth, but it is sooo soft.  It was quite shocking how soft this soap made my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leads me to the ingredients of this soap.  The one that I assume gives it it&#x27;s name is the Fuller&#x27;s Earth.  Fuller&#x27;s Earth is a type of clay and one of those miracle products made by mother nature.  The benefits of Fuller&#x27;s Earth are many and it is used for absorbing excess oil from skin, removes scars, improves skin complexion, treats acne, increases skin elasticity... You really begin to see the benefits of this ingredient after using the Mudder Focker soap.  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough, buy it now!</li>
            <li> scent is ok, not as nice smelling as xxx.  The post shave feel on this makes it worth the purchase, and will be in my regular rotation.</li>
            <li> Buy this soap my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this soap for my first ever DE shave.  Thanks to the gentle prodding of a close friend I endeavored to shed my un-kept banner of the modern day hipster.  Fearing the onslaught of comments from my community of hairy (though admittedly stylish) friends, I decided that the goatee would be a practical middle ground.  To accomplish this without serious discomfort and blunt-steel drudgery, I was steered towards Italian Barber.  With a Mission razor, an Omega brush, and a sampler of blades, I was determined to be economical.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tends to be drawn to the elegant and stately creams of yore, but I was on a budget.  So after much deliberation, I picked Mudder Focker.  Amusing name, seemingly mystical ingredients, and a fantastic price.  I thought that perhaps later I would purchase some higher ends creams to augment my status in the shaving world and step up towards a better product.  I have never been so wrong.  Struck immediately by the elegant scent that was overwhelming in its depth, I knew my attempt at frugality had paid dividends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am never sure how to describe the scent; it is not a strength of mine.  I get a sweet, earthy, grounded scent.  Artisan vanilla cola and a light musky cologne.  This does not do it justice, but it must suffice.  I never knew before this time that shaving could be enjoyable.  I managed to whip up a tremendous lather on my first attempt, and have yet to find a soap that builds a lather this easily and with such a wide margin for hydration.  It always left my skin feeling great, and aftershaves were generally simply an excuse to experiment with more product.  They were rarely a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Since then I have tried to bring into the wet shaving fold as many cartridge enslaved gents as I could.   I gave a good friend my Gillette Canadian Tech, and decided there was only one soap of quality that could go with it.  My tub of Mudder Focker.  Dearly parted but hopefully well given.  I have since tried dozens of soaps and many manufacturers, including SMdF and other razorock products, but my latest purchase was nevertheless another Mudder Focker.  I have never before ordered the same soap twice.  Cheers Joe for my first and still most treasured soap.</li>
