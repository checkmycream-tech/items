            <li>Nice body.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell didn&#x27;t use it yet</li>
            <li>It seems to be kind to my color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>The best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried so far.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thinning.  </li>
            <li>my hair feels lighter, silky and very smooth.</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for about a year now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I also use the conditioner and many of their skin products and love them all.  </li>
            <li>I am now on bottle #2 and just love it.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to use it and see the results for my self :-)</li>
            <li>My hair stylist always compliments me on the healthy condition of my hair every time I go in for a hair cut.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products for my hair</li>
            <li>This one smells good and seems to clean well, which is important to me since I am prone to oiliness.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with the quality of the shampoo and do feel that it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used, but I&#x27;m not sure I notice any particular change in my hair quality.</li>
            <li>I feel like my hair and scalp are very clean after i use it...</li>
            <li>Great price and leaves my hair soft and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Most important all the ingredient are pronounceable and safe.</li>
            <li>The lather was easily rinsed out, leaving my hair squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My barber even noticed that my hair was thicker and that my hairline is holding strong.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use anything with too strong a perfume-y smell in my line of business.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neutral: This shampoo had a strong scent that reminded me of patchouli even though it does not contain any (perhaps it was the cedarwood and/or cloves?).</li>
            <li>I do not know if this product has really helped me grow or thicken my hair, but I am very pleased with the cleaning it gives.  </li>
            <li>I have used everything you can imagine, from Alterna to Aveda in an attempt to improve my fine hair.</li>
            <li>works good, my hair is really soft!</li>
            <li>I was hoping this shampoo would help smooth my hair and give it some body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo for a couple times and so far so good...</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, my hair has not been this soft, shiny and full of body in 20 years.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a full year now</li>
            <li>I wonder how it got such good ratings.</li>
            <li>I hope this is not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh, clean smell of this shampoo and it really makes my hair feel clean.  </li>
            <li>for sure its not the best in the market ,dry the hair at the first day ,then second day the smell of oily hair come out .im</li>
            <li>I tried this product that I originally ordered from another large health food website (which has a lower price), but on that site I would have to purchase $49 to receive free shipping, and their shipping was not always the quickest.  </li>
            <li>It comes with gentle smell and make your hair feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: I found the strong scent to be too much for me.</li>
            <li>Could tell the difference from the first time I used it!  </li>
            <li>I like the ingredients, but mostly, I like the way it makes my hair look shiny and feel incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Regardless, this strong scent did not dissipate and always left me feeling &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34; If you like earthy scents, you might enjoy this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li>If I change my opinion, I will certainly post again!</li>
            <li>I just tried this shampoo for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>: I like Andalou Naturals products as they tend to get low hazard scores from the EWG database (http://www.ewg.org/skindeep) by using safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have added this product to my subscribe and save to save a little more money, but to know I also do not have to spend $49 to have this shipped free.</li>
            <li>Really like it too for being natural and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>it would look like it had more volume, but it was just dry and brittle looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I am very particular.</li>
            <li>still using it ,it doesn&#x27;t make the hair lose worse ,so that&#x27;s already a good thing ,besides no bad ingredient in it .</li>
            <li>I certainly do feel tingling in my scalp when using it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the past 3 years and have been very pleased with the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo generated a lot of lather without much product.</li>
            <li>I have long, wavy hair that is fairly fine.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel soft, shiny and thicker, which is exactly what you want.</li>
            <li>my hair is not thinning but this leaves it so soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and have found my hair falling out way too quickly for my liking.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything and was most recently a WEN user until it started to dry out my hair after using for a couple of years.</li>
            <li>The weight of my hair makes it lie flat, but right after I shampoo with this stuff</li>
            <li>Besides leaving a strong scent, the shampoo did little else for me.</li>
            <li>I bought it because of an allergy to alcohol that I developed, and now I can&#x27;t live without this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is VERY fine and thin and the shampoo and conditioner make it feel fuller and very shiny.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by how well it seemed to work.  </li>
            <li>it is mild and lathers well without all those harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>The fact that all of the product is natural is a definite plus for those trying to go without sulfates and parabens.  </li>
            <li>My dry, rough hair certainly did not help the case for this shampoo.</li>

            <li> Defying Shampoo and Conditioner for several months after trying several other high-quality natural shampoo/conditioner combos for dry/thinning hair.</li>
            <li> My hair, before this shampoo, usually lasts without having to wash it for about 3 to 4 days, but since I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo I have to wash it every single night of how much oil my hair produces using it.</li>
            <li> and I feel it all day long.</li>
            <li> It feels thick and luxurious, and lathers really well.  </li>
            <li> This plus the tall bottle of spay in thickener by Adalou work every bit as well as more expensive Aveda product I had been using, but couldn&#x27;t afford to keep using!</li>
            <li> I try hard to pick products that are organic and natural wherever possible.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt as dry as straw and the flyaways were out of control.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I decided to stop using hair products with questionable chemicals in them, however I could not find a product that provided the same cleaning and conditioning the major brands did.  </li>
            <li> and I find I am losing less hair.</li>
            <li> This product adds texture without weighing my hair down, makes it feel and look a little thicker and fuller.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, wavy, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Use everyday.</li>
            <li> I tried using Loreal Volumizing shampoo and conditioner; however, it had something in it that dried out my hair-</li>
            <li> I will update again in a few months.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smell</li>
            <li> Hair is fuller and noticing less hair loss!</li>
            <li> Not worth it. :(</li>
            <li> And hair still falls out like crazy..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and have found my hair falling out way too quickly for my liking.  I have been using this product for a full year now and it has paid dividends.  My barber even noticed that my hair was thicker and that my hairline is holding strong.  Will continue to use and recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for about a year now and love it.  I also use the conditioner and many of their skin products and love them all.  The only brand I use.  My hair is VERY fine and thin and the shampoo and conditioner make it feel fuller and very shiny.  I definitely recommend it for hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo.  Great price and leaves my hair soft and healthy looking.  Nice body.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  It feels thick and luxurious, and lathers really well.  A little goes a long way.  I try hard to pick products that are organic and natural wherever possible.  This is probably the fifth or sixth shampoo that I have tried, and I keep going back to it.  I like the ingredients, but mostly, I like the way it makes my hair look shiny and feel incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle on hair. Use everyday. Works great.</li>
            <li> People comment that my hair smells good when I use this shampoo. I work as a yoga teacher so that&#x27;s pretty cool. I can&#x27;t use anything with too strong a perfume-y smell in my line of business. This stuff leaves my hair feeling fuller. If you see my photo you&#x27;ll note I have hair to my waist. The weight of my hair makes it lie flat, but right after I shampoo with this stuff my hair feels lighter, silky and very smooth.</li>
            <li> I am now on bottle #2 and just love it.  It makes your hair feel soft, shiny and thicker, which is exactly what you want. The fact that all of the product is natural is a definite plus for those trying to go without sulfates and parabens.  I won&#x27;t buy anything else!!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! Smells great and it does help thinning hair!</li>
            <li> One of the best in the Naturals world.</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful for this shampoo. I really wanted it to work. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was bc of the ingredients and the thought that I am not damaging my hair. My hair, before this shampoo, usually lasts without having to wash it for about 3 to 4 days, but since I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo I have to wash it every single night of how much oil my hair produces using it. I don&#x27;t understand why?! I only use this shampoo and my regular organic conditioner. I&#x27;ve never had this problem before. And hair still falls out like crazy.. no growth difference. I&#x27;m gona try something else. Not worth it. :(</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo for a couple times and so far so good...it is mild and lathers well without all those harsh chemicals. I feel like my hair and scalp are very clean after i use it...i like it and will continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li> BEST shampoo ever. I have tried everything and was most recently a WEN user until it started to dry out my hair after using for a couple of years. This stuff is amazing, my hair has not been this soft, shiny and full of body in 20 years.</li>
            <li> I got this for my partner, and he LOVES it.  It smells sooooooooo good too.  His hair is definitely getting thicker and shinier.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year.  i like it and it smells pleasant. It doesn&#x27;t grow hair but adds volume and I find I am losing less hair.</li>
            <li> Could tell the difference from the first time I used it!  I tried using Loreal Volumizing shampoo and conditioner; however, it had something in it that dried out my hair- it would look like it had more volume, but it was just dry and brittle looking.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot attest to hair growth yet, as I am not through using the bottle. I certainly do feel tingling in my scalp when using it and I feel it all day long. I hope this is not a bad thing. If I change my opinion, I will certainly post again!</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and thinning.  This product adds texture without weighing my hair down, makes it feel and look a little thicker and fuller.  Really like it too for being natural and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of an allergy to alcohol that I developed, and now I can&#x27;t live without this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy. makes my hair and scalp very healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Andalou Age Defying Shampoo and Conditioner for several months after trying several other high-quality natural shampoo/conditioner combos for dry/thinning hair. I am very impressed with the quality of the shampoo and do feel that it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used, but I&#x27;m not sure I notice any particular change in my hair quality.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smell but it does a great job with no residue</li>
            <li> This plus the tall bottle of spay in thickener by Adalou work every bit as well as more expensive Aveda product I had been using, but couldn&#x27;t afford to keep using! Awesome products!</li>
            <li> Love the scent! Hair is fuller and noticing less hair loss!</li>
            <li> There is no noticeable difference. I wonder how it got such good ratings.</li>
            <li> i began suffer of dandruff after using this shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to say all my hair is coming back, which it&#x27;s not. I can say it smells great, the results are shinny and fuller hair. Most important all the ingredient are pronounceable and safe.</li>
            <li> excellent, well pleased, no complaints</li>
            <li> Very nice, but smell is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> works good, my hair is really soft!</li>
            <li> It comes with gentle smell and make your hair feel smooth and clean. The best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried so far.</li>
            <li> for sure its not the best in the market ,dry the hair at the first day ,then second day the smell of oily hair come out .im still using it ,it doesn&#x27;t make the hair lose worse ,so that&#x27;s already a good thing ,besides no bad ingredient in it .</li>
            <li> Nice smell didn&#x27;t use it yet but it smells great can&#x27;t wait to use it and see the results for my self :-)</li>
            <li> I love the fresh, clean smell of this shampoo and it really makes my hair feel clean.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;d call it &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34;.  It seems to be kind to my color-treated hair.  I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 3 years and have been very pleased with the shampoo and conditioner.  I have very long, thick, wavy, color treated hair.  I decided to stop using hair products with questionable chemicals in them, however I could not find a product that provided the same cleaning and conditioning the major brands did.  I do not know if this product has really helped me grow or thicken my hair, but I am very pleased with the cleaning it gives.  My hair stylist always compliments me on the healthy condition of my hair every time I go in for a hair cut.  I tried this product that I originally ordered from another large health food website (which has a lower price), but on that site I would have to purchase $49 to receive free shipping, and their shipping was not always the quickest.  I have added this product to my subscribe and save to save a little more money, but to know I also do not have to spend $49 to have this shipped free.</li>
            <li> I just tried this shampoo for the first time this morning. I was impressed. I have tried many products for my hair and I am very particular. I have used everything you can imagine, from Alterna to Aveda in an attempt to improve my fine hair. This one smells good and seems to clean well, which is important to me since I am prone to oiliness. I was surprised by how well it seemed to work.  I wonder if it will make my hair grow faster and thicker. Only time will tell! I will update again in a few months.</li>
            <li> Caveat: Different hair, different results. This review is based on my experience. I have long, wavy hair that is fairly fine. I was hoping this shampoo would help smooth my hair and give it some body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I like Andalou Naturals products as they tend to get low hazard scores from the EWG database (http://www.ewg.org/skindeep) by using safe ingredients. The shampoo generated a lot of lather without much product. This is especially impressive since the shampoo is sulfate-free. The lather was easily rinsed out, leaving my hair squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral: This shampoo had a strong scent that reminded me of patchouli even though it does not contain any (perhaps it was the cedarwood and/or cloves?). Regardless, this strong scent did not dissipate and always left me feeling &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34; If you like earthy scents, you might enjoy this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Besides leaving a strong scent, the shampoo did little else for me. My hair felt as dry as straw and the flyaways were out of control. I applied coconut oil before and extra leave-in conditioner after the shampoo to no avail. Despite using the entire bottle, I never got it to work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I found the strong scent to be too much for me. My dry, rough hair certainly did not help the case for this shampoo.</li>
            <li> my hair is not thinning but this leaves it so soft and pretty.  I get compliments about my hair and how shiny it is. Will buy again</li>
