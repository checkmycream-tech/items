            <li> This is so perfect for holding Q-tips and all other small items!!!!!!</li>
            <li> We use them for cotton balls, Q-tips, eye wipes, make-up and other frequently used small items in bathrooms and bedrooms.</li>

            <li> This is a very heavy plastic box.</li>
            <li> This looks like glass, but is acrylic, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about broken glass on a bathroom floor, if you drop the lid.</li>
            <li> Expensive looking but safety of acrylic instead of crystal</li>
            <li> Looks expensive.</li>

            <li> Bought this to store my makeup remover towelettes. However they&#x27;re rectangular and this is square. I put a few in but I wish a rectangular one was sold. It is pretty and seems as if it has a tight fit.</li>

            <li> I purchased this to hold my Q-tips on my vanity.  It is very pretty and good quality.  The plastic is very think and if you didn&#x27;t know it you would think it was made of beveled glass.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is so perfect for holding Q-tips and all other small items!!!!!! What is so great about this particular one is you can just grab the Q-tip by the stick vs the tips. No sanitary issues to deal with/worry about. This acrylic holder is thick and heavy. Very solid and wonderfully made. The lid sits perfectly on top. Not only is this very functional, it is also very beautiful. Looks like crystal/glass. This would look great in any decor/setting. I think this would make a really nice trinket or jewelry box too. I highly recommend this product!!!!!!</li>
