            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I can kind of understand why they didn&#x27;t include one, but still,  I would use it more if it had a lid.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t give it a great review for the first oral irrigator as it didn&#x27;t run.  </li>
            <li>I recieved this water pic I love it, cleans my teeth and my crowns aren&#x27;t sore anymore.</li>
            <li>meets the need handsomely.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and I love that it has varying levels of pressure.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>All in all I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>I love this irrigator.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE that the water tank can be inverted so it is easy to store or travel with&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it has worked great at every level</li>
            <li>but overall I am still happy with the product and pleased with my purchase and would probably buy another when this one wears out.</li>
            <li>with an easy to turn on and off button and a slot to place the flosser when not in use.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a water-pik for your family at a decent price this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Works well, easy to work with, very powerful.</li>
            <li>The large water tank and extra accessories make this water flosser an excellent value  </li>
            <li>Feels cheap and I prefer something with a cover,  not something you flip over after you dump the water out.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, AMAZON expedited a refund.  </li>
            <li>cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I have a big family and this is great for that ....</li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase  Works well and am pleased with the quick service from Toilet Tree Products.  </li>
            <li>When I saw the great deal that Toilet Tree products had I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first thing is I do not like that it doesn&#x27;t have a lid on top of the water tank.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I felt really torn on how many stars to give this.</li>
            <li>so I can say that one of these units is good for about 5 years of daily use (I use the highest pressure setting).  </li>
            <li>and I liked my old one.</li>
            <li>I really like the capacity it has for holding alot of liquid being water or mouthwash or whatever in the top of the system.</li>
            <li>Works great as a water flosser with a tank large enough to satisfy anyone&#x27;s needs.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>...has great pressure (with adjustment) but is a little too light weight as it is not stable and rocks around.</li>
            <li>Water flossers are a great way to help keep your teeth extra clean and work much better than just regular flossing.</li>
            <li>(provided it doesn&#x27;t wear out quickly)</li>
            <li>This one is strong, has a good flow and fits very nicely on the small shelf above my sink.  </li>
            <li>The bowl is to big and motor is to noisy,other then that ,it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>You have to clean FAST!</li>
            <li>My hubby and I are super happy with this Professional Series Countertop Oral Irrigator Water Flosser by Toilet Tree Products.</li>
            <li>I had a water-pik when I was a kid and loved the feeling of it massaging my gums and how it kept my mouth clean without being harsh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Has a very large water tank</li>
            <li>Lots of water pressure, simple to run easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I love that the tips have their own little storage compartment on the side that keeps them clean, dry and easily accessible.</li>
            <li>I love the fact you can put mouth wash right in the container with the water, I like all the different tips that it came with.</li>
            <li>I like this very much.  </li>
            <li>and I am confident it will last.</li>
            <li>It has storage for more tips if you have a big family&lt;</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>The second is it comes with 9 openings for tips/attachments, I wish it would come with 9 attachments so there would have been one for each person in my family without purchasing more.</li>
            <li>When unrapped and set up exactly according to the instructions, this product didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than my last one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine over a month now and really like the powerful jet stream it can produce.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product that has worked very well so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different one&#x27;s  but Toilet Tree&#x27;s oral irrigators are the best.  </li>
            <li>helped an old man try and keep his teeth clean</li>
            <li>I also love the large reservoir as most of the other units I have owned have all had much smaller water tanks than this one.</li>
            <li>Is quite large, takes up my whole counter space</li>
            <li>It really makes it easier to keep track of everything.</li>
            <li>The water flosser works really well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quite noisy when you use it.</li>
            <li>so it really needs to be cleaned up and put away with every use.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the fact that the speed/flow-stop control is on the handle which makes it very convenient during use.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this.  </li>
            <li>There are things I really like about this irrigator and things that I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Did not like as much as my water pik.</li>
            <li>I received the item on time and everything was there, the package was not damaged therefore the item was not broken.</li>
            <li>, this works very well</li>
            <li>Says it works very well.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>More than other units I have owned.</li>
            <li>It ramps down &amp; quits pulsing the water but begins just spilling out water most of the time.  </li>
            <li>I am told that daily flossing is a better means to oral health but considering my experience over the past 25 years, I consider this to be a pretty good alternative to the mess I make of dental floss and the bits of floss that end up caught in my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Water pressure is decent.</li>
            <li>I really love the great storage on this product and how you can store all of water picks within the base.</li>
            <li>had an older model ( lasted for years ).</li>
            <li>Water is still high in the water tank but NO pressure.</li>
            <li>I really like the feature of the storage compartment on the side of the unit that you can open and close easily and that the system came with 5 different attachment pieces as well!</li>
            <li>As it is it&#x27;s a hassle to clean it up, dry it off, etc with every use</li>
            <li>my only con is i wish it had a lid on the top to prevent foreign object from getting in ...but other than that my hubby and i love it ...</li>
            <li>A complete waste of time because I had to return this one and go out and purchase another more reliable brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Is very loud compared to my old machine.</li>
            <li>It has a large water reservoir and puts out enough pressure to get the job done.</li>
            <li>and I have only used it a little more than a month.  </li>
            <li>Replaced my over 35 year old one with this.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it has different speeds for you to use and the fact that you can slide to each setting and slide off...</li>
            <li>BUT not this one i had complete control of it with no worry of getting hurt.</li>
            <li>Just too inconvenient for our needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it seemed like a very nice product</li>
            <li>This keep the water tank clean and saves a little space if you do not have a bathroom counter were</li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t care for about this water flosser is just how loud it is.</li>
            <li>my old water pic was crooked over 90 degrees which was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think i will try and find the same model as my old one and trash this one.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find the pocket attachment which I really want but other than that he works like a dream</li>
            <li>Plus...the little clamp that the pick handle sits in  broke within the first 2 weeks of having it.</li>
            <li>Since both my husband and I would use it everyday, we didn&#x27;t want to empty it, clean it, and refill it every time we would use it.  </li>
            <li>bin using it for a week and Its only saving grace is the large water tank ( about a half gallon ) .</li>

            <li> I really love the great storage on this product and how you can store all of water picks within the base.</li>

            <li> Replaced my over 35 year old one with this.  </li>

            <li> Tried the other smaller irrigators, but not enough pressure and electrically always breaking down.</li>
            <li> so I only use it weekly.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little on the loud and messy side to use.</li>
            <li> I had no issues with it as far as working and doing what it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;It can reach hard to reach areas.</li>

            <li> No more bleeding gums.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker or even a serious negative though.</li>
            <li> Most units do not have a place to store them or store them in the lid of the unit which I think is inconvenient and nasty since they are over the water you are using.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t horrible though and didn&#x27;t really affect anything.&lt;br /&gt;There is no lid to the tank</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recieved this water pic I love it, cleans my teeth and my crowns aren&#x27;t sore anymore. I love the fact you can put mouth wash right in the container with the water, I like all the different tips that it came with.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t give it a great review for the first oral irrigator as it didn&#x27;t run.  I called Toilet Tree Products and they said it was probably a defective product and would send out a replacement.  The second machine came in three days time and works as expected.  It has a large water reservoir and puts out enough pressure to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap and I prefer something with a cover,  not something you flip over after you dump the water out.</li>
            <li> Pressure runs out half way through cleaning. Water is still high in the water tank but NO pressure. You have to clean FAST! Would not recommend. Sorry :(</li>
            <li> meets the need handsomely.</li>
            <li> I like this very much.  I can&#x27;t seem to find the pocket attachment which I really want but other than that he works like a dream</li>
            <li> The bowl is to big and motor is to noisy,other then that ,it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> The large water tank and extra accessories make this water flosser an excellent value  It is made well and I am confident it will last.</li>
            <li> The oral irrigator works great.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Replaced my over 35 year old one with this.  Slightly larger.</li>
            <li> took a chance. works okay...has great pressure (with adjustment) but is a little too light weight as it is not stable and rocks around. Plus...the little clamp that the pick handle sits in  broke within the first 2 weeks of having it.</li>
            <li> The irrigator didn&#x27;t work as soon as I set it up. The problem was with the rubber feed of the liquid from the tank to the pump. I played with it a little and got one squirt out of it and then nothing. This is the third company that I have tried regarding an oral irrigator. I also used INTERPLAK and WATERPIK. They all have the same basic problem. Either the water feed doesn&#x27;t work or the pump dies after a few weeks. From the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, I am not alone with this experience. It is a shame too, because when these things work, they are great for your teeth. But they are very expensive when you consider their useful life. I don&#x27;t know if this is an intended built-in obsolescence or an idiot design. Fortunately, AMAZON expedited a refund.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy any product like this without going through AMAZON or getting some other guarantee.</li>
            <li> This product has not been working properly for a few weeks now and I have only used it a little more than a month.  It ramps down &amp; quits pulsing the water but begins just spilling out water most of the time.  I am not satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I had a water-pik when I was a kid and loved the feeling of it massaging my gums and how it kept my mouth clean without being harsh. My gums have been receding and I don&#x27;t know what else to do about it. I floss, brush constantly and even oil pull. When I saw the great deal that Toilet Tree products had I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Has a very large water tank so I don&#x27;t have to refill after my husband uses it&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with 4 different tips that are color coded for each person and a tongue cleaning tip&lt;br /&gt;- It has storage for more tips if you have a big family&lt;br /&gt;- I LOVE that the water tank can be inverted so it is easy to store or travel with&lt;br /&gt;- You can control the water with the bar on the handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Is very loud compared to my old machine. I was afraid it would wake my kids&lt;br /&gt;- Water pressure is decent. I have had stronger in other picks&lt;br /&gt;- Is quite large, takes up my whole counter space&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it is a good machine but not the best. If you are looking for a water-pik for your family at a decent price this is a good choice. But if you are hardcore about your water flossing I would suggest buying a more expensive machine. I&#x27;m so glad I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Water flossers are a great way to help keep your teeth extra clean and work much better than just regular flossing. This product is well built and great quality. I really love the great storage on this product and how you can store all of water picks within the base. It really makes it easier to keep track of everything. It&#x27;s easy to set up and the instructions are perfect. The water flosser works really well and I love that it has varying levels of pressure. So far it has worked great at every level and I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with it. The only thing that I don&#x27;t care for about this water flosser is just how loud it is. It&#x27;s really quite noisy when you use it. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product that has worked very well so far. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> No lid for the reservior.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I felt really torn on how many stars to give this. There are several pros and cons, which I will go through in a minute, but in the end I felt the benefits outweighed the negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It works well. My teeth felt squeaky clean. I had no issues with it as far as working and doing what it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;It can reach hard to reach areas. I have a lot of trouble cleaning my wisdom teeth because of how far back they are but this does a good job of cleaning them.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with multiple heads so several people can use it. It even comes with a little storage place for them and they are color coded.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried flossing after using this and found the floss gets almost nothing. This thing does a good job of &#x27;flossing&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;There is no locking mechanism for the water tank. It says to push down well, which I did, but my tank still leaked a little. It wasn&#x27;t horrible though and didn&#x27;t really affect anything.&lt;br /&gt;There is no lid to the tank so it really needs to be cleaned up and put away with every use. I can kind of understand why they didn&#x27;t include one, but still,  I would use it more if it had a lid. As it is it&#x27;s a hassle to clean it up, dry it off, etc with every use so I only use it weekly.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little on the loud and messy side to use. It&#x27;s not too bad though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a good product. I haven&#x27;t priced these before so I&#x27;d say do some research, but this one definitely works. My dentist will be very happy to see I&#x27;ve been using this. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful assistant to protecting teeth and gums.  I really appreciate the fact that the speed/flow-stop control is on the handle which makes it very convenient during use.  It would be perfect with 5 STARS if the unit was quieter since I use it mostly at night.  However, I realize there&#x27;s a lot of power in a compact machine.  This is a great purchase at a great price!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this.  I especially love the size of the tank.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Excellent, product works well, easy to use. I recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Tried the other smaller irrigators, but not enough pressure and electrically always breaking down. THIS ONE WORKS. Lots of water pressure, simple to run easy to keep clean. Love it.</li>
            <li> bin using it for a week and Its only saving grace is the large water tank ( about a half gallon ) . However! you cant fill it and leave it as it will drain out onto the counter and floor, as the wand leaks . Speaking of the wand. the output end is almost straight which makes it hard to use. my old water pic was crooked over 90 degrees which was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an older model ( lasted for years ). I think i will try and find the same model as my old one and trash this one.</li>
            <li> There are things I really like about this irrigator and things that I don&#x27;t. Lets get the bad out of the way first. The first thing is I do not like that it doesn&#x27;t have a lid on top of the water tank. I know it&#x27;s meant to be stored upside down, it&#x27;s just a personal preference that I don&#x27;t like the water tank uncovered when I am using it. The second is it comes with 9 openings for tips/attachments, I wish it would come with 9 attachments so there would have been one for each person in my family without purchasing more. This wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker or even a serious negative though. The hose is a bit leaky. I&#x27;m not sure of this is regular with all the units or if mine was a bit defective. I am also not a fan of the &amp;#34;push up&amp;#34; type button on the handle. I had difficulty changing the pressure settings while using the unit. For the pluses.....I LOVED the pressure on this unit. Even with the leaky hose (which can be annoying and messy) it had amazing pressure. More than other units I have owned. I also love the large reservoir as most of the other units I have owned have all had much smaller water tanks than this one. I love that the tips have their own little storage compartment on the side that keeps them clean, dry and easily accessible. Most units do not have a place to store them or store them in the lid of the unit which I think is inconvenient and nasty since they are over the water you are using. I also (ironically since I want a lid on the tank) do like that it can be stored upside down. This keep the water tank clean and saves a little space if you do not have a bathroom counter were you keep it set up (like me). All in all I am pleased with my purchase. I would like to get the hose to stop leaking so I wouldn&#x27;t have to wipe up a puddle of water or change my shirt when I am done. but overall I am still happy with the product and pleased with my purchase and would probably buy another when this one wears out. (provided it doesn&#x27;t wear out quickly)</li>
            <li> cheaply made. Noisy and bulky. Sent item back.  Did not like as much as my water pik.</li>
            <li> Product is noisy and it&#x27;s somewhat difficult to find the desired pressure for water flow.</li>
            <li> When unrapped and set up exactly according to the instructions, this product didn&#x27;t work.  A complete waste of time because I had to return this one and go out and purchase another more reliable brand.</li>
            <li> I received the item on time and everything was there, the package was not damaged therefore the item was not broken. So every thing was good.</li>
            <li> sorry, but we returned the produce to Amazon the same day we received it.  We were not satisfied that there was no lid over the water.  Since both my husband and I would use it everyday, we didn&#x27;t want to empty it, clean it, and refill it every time we would use it.  Just too inconvenient for our needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it seemed like a very nice product so I gave it 4 stars</li>
            <li> I have been using these oral-irrigation appliances for the past 25 years.  This is the fifth such unit I have owned so I can say that one of these units is good for about 5 years of daily use (I use the highest pressure setting).  I simply can not seem to get along with dental floss so this is the answer for me.  No more bleeding gums.  I am told that daily flossing is a better means to oral health but considering my experience over the past 25 years, I consider this to be a pretty good alternative to the mess I make of dental floss and the bits of floss that end up caught in my teeth.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It does not have a lid. Nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this irrigator. Water tank oversized. No cover.&lt;br /&gt;Tips provided weren&#x27;t the good ones.</li>
            <li> I love this irrigator.  It&#x27;s better than my last one and I liked my old one.</li>
            <li> This water pik is very good - lots of options for the amount of pressure you want to apply.  The tank is a bigger than necessary and takes up a lot of space on the sink.  Other than that, this works very well and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift. The recipient likes it. Says it works very well. No complaints.</li>
            <li> helped an old man try and keep his teeth clean</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase  Works well and am pleased with the quick service from Toilet Tree Products.  Would buy from them again in the future if needed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Delivered on time. Works great as a water flosser with a tank large enough to satisfy anyone&#x27;s needs.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> difficult to start pulsing</li>
            <li> This works well and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:68cfc28d7aee44817c7e57376e0b0e37]] Super happy with this water flosser! i received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. My hubby and I are super happy with this Professional Series Countertop Oral Irrigator Water Flosser by Toilet Tree Products. I really like the capacity it has for holding alot of liquid being water or mouthwash or whatever in the top of the system. I have a big family and this is great for that ....I really like the feature of the storage compartment on the side of the unit that you can open and close easily and that the system came with 5 different attachment pieces as well! with an easy to turn on and off button and a slot to place the flosser when not in use. very easy to change in and out the attachment pieces as well...I really like that it has different speeds for you to use and the fact that you can slide to each setting and slide off...different water piks that we had tried you had to hold the button and sometimes if you forget you could hit yourself in the eye with it BUT not this one i had complete control of it with no worry of getting hurt. my only con is i wish it had a lid on the top to prevent foreign object from getting in ...but other than that my hubby and i love it ...thank you so much</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to work with, very powerful.</li>
            <li> This oral irrigator is excellent.  I&#x27;ve tried several different one&#x27;s  but Toilet Tree&#x27;s oral irrigators are the best.  This one is strong, has a good flow and fits very nicely on the small shelf above my sink.  For a really fresh feeling you can some mouth or concentrated irragator solution to the tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company&#x27;s Customer Service is excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine over a month now and really like the powerful jet stream it can produce.  Good thorough cleaning and I expect it to last longer than those rechargeable ones do.</li>
            <li> Great product for the home in having a healthy clean mouth and teeth.</li>
