    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Product was awesome smelling, was delivered on time..</li>
            <li>Combined with the smell of leaves in autumn, it smells incredible!</li>
            <li>Perfect fragrance for Winter Solstice Ritual.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good incense.</li>
            <li>I think it smells very nice, it burns for about 15 mins, give or take.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an \\&quot;untamed\\&quot; wilderness fragrance for those who love camping in the great outdoors.</li>
            <li>Love the sent of these incense!</li>
            <li>Nothing better than Gonesh!</li>
            <li>A nice pine smell fills the air.</li>
            <li>The stick ignites very easily because of the volatile oils, and burns with growing flame until you blow it out.</li>
            <li>Good smell although it is not quite the fresh pine scent I am looking for.</li>
            <li>Gonesh make the  best smelling incense sticks plus have a lot of different cense to choose from.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definately be buying more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made from more oil than plant material.</li>
            <li>Plus, it burns longer than most oil-dipped sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, if you want a more perfume-like aroma, Mountain Naturals is NOT for you.</li>
            <li>IMO, you can&#x27;t buy better.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of incense, been buying it for years.  </li>
            <li>These have a strong woodsy scent which I love.</li>
            <li>Plus, each stick burns for a good two hours because the resin provides so much fuel.</li>
            <li>It makes shopping easy and I always find what I need.</li>
            <li>They strongly smell of soap, and made the room smell like a Bed Bath n&#x27;Beyond.</li>
            <li>Totally authentic aroma because it&#x27;s pure plant material.</li>
            <li>To me, oil has a much less pleasant smell than plant material, but this better than others</li>
            <li>This product is much more convenient to use, but lacks the intense scent of the cone incense.</li>
            <li>At first this was tolerable, but eventually smell was so strong</li>
            <li>Eadsy to light, stays lit and a very woodsy aroma.</li>
            <li>It smells just like a campfire of fresh pine logs.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different formats but</li>
            <li>Their incense has always been first rate.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s too quick to light and has a big flame</li>
            <li>I burn only 1/2 stick at a time and it more than fills my large room with a woodsey/pine scent for hours.</li>
            <li>This pine fragrance is light and refreshing, it&#x27;s one of the few that I feel could be</li>
            <li>still love it and recommend it, especially for those who are not as much into the florals.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell like pine at all</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and packed well.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for an intense pine experience, try</li>
            <li>Well, I have to say that Gonesh incense is not the highest quality, but it&#x27;s also not very expensive</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying, but only if you don&#x27;t pay too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like any Indian incense, but is a more North American method using actual tree resin.</li>
            <li>I certainly will add this scent to my regular incense purchases.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive, but one whiff and you&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t bad, but isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>I generally use cone incense.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the sent of these incense!</li>
            <li> Nothing better than Gonesh!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like pine at all</li>
            <li> These have a strong woodsy scent which I love. I burn only 1/2 stick at a time and it more than fills my large room with a woodsey/pine scent for hours. Get these, you wont be disappointed. I&#x27;m placing another order ...</li>
            <li> Well, I have to say that Gonesh incense is not the highest quality, but it&#x27;s also not very expensive (I get mine at the grocery store for $1 or $1.50). It&#x27;s worth buying, but only if you don&#x27;t pay too much.</li>
            <li> A nice pine smell fills the air.</li>
            <li> Good smell although it is not quite the fresh pine scent I am looking for.I have tried many different formats but so for nothing hits the mark.</li>
            <li> Product was awesome smelling, was delivered on time.. Would order again. Gonesh make the  best smelling incense sticks plus have a lot of different cense to choose from.</li>
            <li> I generally use cone incense. This product is much more convenient to use, but lacks the intense scent of the cone incense.</li>
            <li> This is a very good incense. Eadsy to light, stays lit and a very woodsy aroma. I have reorderd several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tyr it, you&#x27;ll like it !!.  AAAAA+++++ Fast shipping and packed well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like the pine scent, but I thought I&#x27;d try it out. Combined with the smell of leaves in autumn, it smells incredible! I&#x27;ll definately be buying more. One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t bad, but isn&#x27;t great. It&#x27;s made from more oil than plant material. The stick ignites very easily because of the volatile oils, and burns with growing flame until you blow it out. When it&#x27;s too quick to light and has a big flame it&#x27;s a clue that a lot of volatile oil is used. To me, oil has a much less pleasant smell than plant material, but this better than others I would put in this category. Plus, it burns longer than most oil-dipped sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an intense pine experience, try Mountain Naturals brand&#x27;s \\&quot;Pi&amp;ntilde;on [Pine] Resin Sticks\\&quot; [[ASIN:B00E6DIP9A Pinon Resin Sticks Mountain Naturals - Per Package]]. It&#x27;s not like any Indian incense, but is a more North American method using actual tree resin. It smells just like a campfire of fresh pine logs. Totally authentic aroma because it&#x27;s pure plant material. It&#x27;s more expensive, but one whiff and you&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s the real thing. Plus, each stick burns for a good two hours because the resin provides so much fuel. But, if you want a more perfume-like aroma, Mountain Naturals is NOT for you. It&#x27;s an \\&quot;untamed\\&quot; wilderness fragrance for those who love camping in the great outdoors.</li>
            <li> Gonesh&#x27;s Pine Stick Incense brings back memories of trips to north wood&#x27;s lodges as a child.  I certainly will add this scent to my regular incense purchases.</li>
            <li> The Gonesh name has been around for decades. Their incense has always been first rate. IMO, you can&#x27;t buy better.</li>
            <li> I like Gonesh Stick Incense. My neighbors&#x27; smells are off putting to me, and this helps me endure their visit here from another world.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of incense, been buying it for years.  This pine fragrance is light and refreshing, it&#x27;s one of the few that I feel could be a little bit stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I still love it and recommend it, especially for those who are not as much into the florals.  This is earthy, woodsy and not as sweet.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying it again when it runs out, as well as the florals.</li>
            <li> Idk what you&#x27;d like to hear about an incense... I think it smells very nice, it burns for about 15 mins, give or take.</li>
            <li> Perfect fragrance for Winter Solstice Ritual.  This company carries a wide variety of incense.  It makes shopping easy and I always find what I need.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the pine I was looking for, but it&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell. xtra word, xtra word hehehe</li>
            <li> I ordered these hoping for the scent of outdoors. They strongly smell of soap, and made the room smell like a Bed Bath n&#x27;Beyond. At first this was tolerable, but eventually smell was so strong gave me a tension headache. I now use them as a deodorant for my trash (kept under the bag).</li>
