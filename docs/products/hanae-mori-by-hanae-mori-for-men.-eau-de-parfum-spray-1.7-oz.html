            <li>so, so, delicious that it even beats out Blue Sugar in smell but</li>

            <li>Smells legit :)</li>
            <li>After smelling many men&#x27;s cologne/parfums that said they had vanilla, I decided on this one.</li>
            <li>Me and the ladies love this stuff,,spray it on and see what happens,,</li>
            <li>AND FOR SURE THIS ONE IS NOW ON MY LIST.....</li>
            <li>The cologne was fine :)</li>
            <li>but overall, the dry-down was also great but after such a magnificent opening</li>
            <li>Hanae Mori is the first EDP I&#x27;ve purchased and I absolutely LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It was delivered in its original package and packs a potent Hana Mori punch.</li>

            <li>Easy on the sprayer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He gets many compliments on how great he smells and the scent does last all day!</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s parfum, it easily lasts all day whereas Spicebomb fades.</li>
            <li>I liked it that much.</li>
            <li>same one lol.</li>
            <li>product and quite cheap too.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 32 and think this scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this Blue Sugar is GREAT and a bargain bin special at just $17/1.7 oz .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>The bottle is nice and very classy.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t much care for the way it tasted (literally) or how strong it was once I first smelled it out of the bottle, very strong and made me sneeze.</li>
            <li>This is very gourmand, in other words, its smells like something so delicious</li>
            <li>Nothing to write home about but good for a daily gym scent or after work run to the grocery store etc.</li>
            <li>Nothing to write home about but good for a daily gym scent or after work run to the grocery store etc.</li>
            <li>Too sweet.</li>
            <li>more of a ladies man scent, it wouldnt really work on a lumberjack.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s very dirrerent.</li>
            <li>I was first drawn to Spicebomb in my search of a lighter cologne, but decided to give this one a shot and fell in love right away.</li>
            <li>, a quick circle will do or even a breath out while you apply.</li>
            <li>Very high concentrate perfume!!</li>
            <li>Must try if you like fresh, sweet summer scents.</li>
            <li>The fresh pineapple remains throughout  tho.</li>
            <li>scent wins the 4th spot by default because #5 has projection problems and it ticks me off because its a designer fragrance.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought it in a store for full price-</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Nice size bottle, lasts several hours like five-ish.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine had this in his collection but rarely wore it.</li>
            <li>Fresh and sweet, perfect for casual wear.</li>
            <li>When I chose a men&#x27;s fragrance I always looking for some qualities such as masculine, fresh essence, stay on your body  and something pleasant to your senses.</li>
            <li>It is slightly aggressive and interesting right off the top.</li>
            <li>It is slightly aggressive and interesting right off the top.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is not only good for all  of above, it also has a fabulous price for  the quality of the product that you receive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great opening, dry down almost seems to project a bit more but fantastic,mysterious, vetiver and bourbon essence that is still banging after 3 hrs on a piece of paper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, fruity, and spicy, yet very masculine.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like Dunhill Red by Dunhill that I used to own and didn&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like Dunhill Red by Dunhill that I used to own and didn&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews for this particular fragrance, the reviews were right!  </li>
            <li>The receiver loves it very much.</li>
            <li>I must say thanks to him for adding this one to my repertoire because it is fresh, clean and masculine and fun wrapped in one.</li>
            <li>but I only hope Him by Hanae Mori will compare or be better than this?</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pissed off at D&amp;G for creating this masterpiece because it sure does fall short in the projection dept.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great smelling cologne and it last a long time.</li>
            <li>After I had walked around for a while in the mall I noticed that I very much enjoyed a scent around me and couldn&#x27;t figure out who I was following around with that smell</li>
            <li>Long lasting, beautiful scent for the modern gentleman.</li>
            <li>I would buy more just to have plenty for the future.</li>
            <li>The good news is you can spray it on your clothes instead of your body and 3-4 spraysWILL LAST for your entire 8hr work day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not often a light, fruity cologne appeals to a broad spectrum of men.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume because it lasts for long hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rather light, it&#x27;s better suited for spring and summer, and, in my opinion, has a better longevity that the edc version which fails to impress me despite the exposure on fragrance counters.</li>

            <li>/&gt;#6 Angel Men Pure Malt by Thierry Mugler</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for cocktail parties, black tie events and even heading to your local club.</li>
            <li>Very well done for a cheapy.</li>
            <li>For that reason, I didn&#x27;t really care for this opening here because I had smelled this scent before.</li>
            <li>it projects very well.</li>
            <li>For that reason, I didn&#x27;t really care for this opening here because I had smelled this scent before.</li>
            <li>it projects very well.</li>
            <li>This is a floral scent that is very manly, if I do say so myself.  </li>
            <li>The price at Sephora for the 1.7 oz spray is over twice as much as Amazon&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is very body chemistry oriented.</li>
            <li>this is much cheaper than what I paid for it at the mall.</li>
            <li>very powdery</li>
            <li>It could very well be a question of skin chemistry, or</li>
            <li>Highly recommend that you add this EDP fragrance to your collection!</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I do wish I could just dab it instead of spraying it since I don&#x27;t like using too much at once</li>
            <li>generic summer scent that I bought because it has many natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>generic summer scent that I bought because it has many natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other mien&#x27;s fragrances from Amazon and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li>then the dry-down smells more like a pineapple with a strong vanilla vibe behind it.</li>
            <li>bought this years and years ago because it is a timeless classic.</li>
            <li>The time for this classic has come and gone in my opinion.</li>
            <li>bought this years and years ago because it is a timeless classic.</li>
            <li>The time for this classic has come and gone in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It is somewhat musky so maybe for an older crowd who grew up with musky scents.</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments from women on this, usually older women but compliments none the less.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it for my husband because both of us liked it so much, though I was slightly tempted not to because the ladies he works with have all complimented him on it at one time or another.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The girls want to eat you alive with this on!    </li>
            <li>I always get compliments on this, one of my married friends asked me in a middle of party what I was wearing so she could get this for her husband.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light at first (Eau De Parfume) with a note of mint, but after wearing for a while it begins to manifest into a very subtle scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was very close but mysterious nostalgia pushed Encre Noire to the title.</li>
            <li>is that one spray lasts nearly all day, but it&#x27;s not an overpowering</li>
            <li>This is a very concentrated spray, I took a chance and purchased this Eau De Parfum only having sampled the lighter version at sephora.     </li>
            <li>Its also very oriental, check basenotes for further information.</li>
            <li>It smells much nicer than Spicebomb, yet the two are quite similar.</li>
            <li>I found it cheaper here than any brick &amp; mortar store near me.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon I got my money back with the gift card I&#x27;ve been offered from them.</li>
            <li>Not a feminine fragrance, but masculine.</li>
            <li>It last waaaaay longer and is worth the extra $10-$20.</li>
            <li>As much as I like the scent when I first put it on, I also love the dry down, as in 18 hours later there is a smooth subtle sweetness left on your skin.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle slight sweet smell.</li>
            <li>It is light, not overwhelming, masculine yet yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Parfums have a much more concentrated scent, and they last much longer, and require less on application, this lasted once until the next morning after a long night out.    </li>
            <li>After a long days work I could still smell the perfume on me but if you use too much you might suffocate the people around you</li>
            <li>About the cologne, heavy, sweet and in my opinion (ofcours</li>
            <li>Fruity opening, even better fruity dry down with a musky undertone behind it while staying masculine, mysterious and potent.</li>
            <li>My only recommendation is choose another seller, I ordered an Eau de Parfum and they sent me an Eau de Toilette (which is considerably cheaper than EDP, which is the one I paid for).</li>
            <li>Polo stinks so good if you like it</li>
            <li>Polo stinks so good if you like it</li>
            <li>I will usually put this on before I go into work and even now I find it beneficial to spray on and walk forward as to not get the full plume in my face and sneeze</li>
            <li>Same exact juice, however, the dry down of Pure Malt is where this fragrance shines.</li>
            <li>Same exact juice, however, the dry down of Pure Malt is where this fragrance shines.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that it last almost 8hrs,not bad at all for EDT,otherwise I&#x27;d put just one star.</li>

            <li> Go easy on the sprays in the heat tho.</li>
            <li> You get 6-8 hrs on the skin easily with this one and 24hrs on ur clothing.</li>
            <li> Easy on the sprayer.</li>

            <li> Easy on the sprayer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He gets many compliments on how great he smells and the scent does last all day!</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s parfum, it easily lasts all day whereas Spicebomb fades.</li>
            <li> I liked it that much.</li>
            <li> same one lol.</li>
            <li> product and quite cheap too.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 32 and think this scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this Blue Sugar is GREAT and a bargain bin special at just $17/1.7 oz .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> The bottle is nice and very classy.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t much care for the way it tasted (literally) or how strong it was once I first smelled it out of the bottle, very strong and made me sneeze.</li>
            <li> This is very gourmand, in other words, its smells like something so delicious</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about but good for a daily gym scent or after work run to the grocery store etc.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about but good for a daily gym scent or after work run to the grocery store etc.</li>
            <li> Too sweet.</li>
            <li> more of a ladies man scent, it wouldnt really work on a lumberjack.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s very dirrerent.</li>
            <li> I was first drawn to Spicebomb in my search of a lighter cologne, but decided to give this one a shot and fell in love right away.</li>
            <li> , a quick circle will do or even a breath out while you apply.</li>
            <li> Very high concentrate perfume!!</li>
            <li> Must try if you like fresh, sweet summer scents.</li>
            <li> The fresh pineapple remains throughout  tho.</li>
            <li> scent wins the 4th spot by default because #5 has projection problems and it ticks me off because its a designer fragrance.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought it in a store for full price-</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Nice size bottle, lasts several hours like five-ish.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had this in his collection but rarely wore it.</li>
            <li> Fresh and sweet, perfect for casual wear.</li>
            <li> When I chose a men&#x27;s fragrance I always looking for some qualities such as masculine, fresh essence, stay on your body  and something pleasant to your senses.</li>
            <li> It is slightly aggressive and interesting right off the top.</li>
            <li> It is slightly aggressive and interesting right off the top.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is not only good for all  of above, it also has a fabulous price for  the quality of the product that you receive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great opening, dry down almost seems to project a bit more but fantastic,mysterious, vetiver and bourbon essence that is still banging after 3 hrs on a piece of paper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, fruity, and spicy, yet very masculine.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like Dunhill Red by Dunhill that I used to own and didn&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like Dunhill Red by Dunhill that I used to own and didn&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this particular fragrance, the reviews were right!  </li>
            <li> The receiver loves it very much.</li>
            <li> I must say thanks to him for adding this one to my repertoire because it is fresh, clean and masculine and fun wrapped in one.</li>
            <li> but I only hope Him by Hanae Mori will compare or be better than this?</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pissed off at D&amp;G for creating this masterpiece because it sure does fall short in the projection dept.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great smelling cologne and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> After I had walked around for a while in the mall I noticed that I very much enjoyed a scent around me and couldn&#x27;t figure out who I was following around with that smell</li>
            <li> Long lasting, beautiful scent for the modern gentleman.</li>
            <li> I would buy more just to have plenty for the future.</li>
            <li> The good news is you can spray it on your clothes instead of your body and 3-4 spraysWILL LAST for your entire 8hr work day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not often a light, fruity cologne appeals to a broad spectrum of men.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume because it lasts for long hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rather light, it&#x27;s better suited for spring and summer, and, in my opinion, has a better longevity that the edc version which fails to impress me despite the exposure on fragrance counters.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#6 Angel Men Pure Malt by Thierry Mugler</li>
            <li> /&gt;#6 Angel Men Pure Malt by Thierry Mugler</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for cocktail parties, black tie events and even heading to your local club.</li>
            <li> Very well done for a cheapy.</li>
            <li> For that reason, I didn&#x27;t really care for this opening here because I had smelled this scent before.</li>
            <li> it projects very well.</li>
            <li> For that reason, I didn&#x27;t really care for this opening here because I had smelled this scent before.</li>
            <li> it projects very well.</li>
            <li> This is a floral scent that is very manly, if I do say so myself.  </li>
            <li> The price at Sephora for the 1.7 oz spray is over twice as much as Amazon&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is very body chemistry oriented.</li>
            <li> this is much cheaper than what I paid for it at the mall.</li>
            <li> very powdery</li>
            <li> It could very well be a question of skin chemistry, or</li>
            <li> Highly recommend that you add this EDP fragrance to your collection!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I do wish I could just dab it instead of spraying it since I don&#x27;t like using too much at once</li>
            <li> generic summer scent that I bought because it has many natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> generic summer scent that I bought because it has many natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other mien&#x27;s fragrances from Amazon and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li> then the dry-down smells more like a pineapple with a strong vanilla vibe behind it.</li>
            <li> bought this years and years ago because it is a timeless classic.</li>
            <li> The time for this classic has come and gone in my opinion.</li>
            <li> bought this years and years ago because it is a timeless classic.</li>
            <li> The time for this classic has come and gone in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat musky so maybe for an older crowd who grew up with musky scents.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments from women on this, usually older women but compliments none the less.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it for my husband because both of us liked it so much, though I was slightly tempted not to because the ladies he works with have all complimented him on it at one time or another.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The girls want to eat you alive with this on!    </li>
            <li> I always get compliments on this, one of my married friends asked me in a middle of party what I was wearing so she could get this for her husband.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light at first (Eau De Parfume) with a note of mint, but after wearing for a while it begins to manifest into a very subtle scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was very close but mysterious nostalgia pushed Encre Noire to the title.</li>
            <li> is that one spray lasts nearly all day, but it&#x27;s not an overpowering</li>
            <li> This is a very concentrated spray, I took a chance and purchased this Eau De Parfum only having sampled the lighter version at sephora.     </li>
            <li> Its also very oriental, check basenotes for further information.</li>
            <li> It smells much nicer than Spicebomb, yet the two are quite similar.</li>
            <li> I found it cheaper here than any brick &amp; mortar store near me.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon I got my money back with the gift card I&#x27;ve been offered from them.</li>
            <li> Not a feminine fragrance, but masculine.</li>
            <li> It last waaaaay longer and is worth the extra $10-$20.</li>
            <li> As much as I like the scent when I first put it on, I also love the dry down, as in 18 hours later there is a smooth subtle sweetness left on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle slight sweet smell.</li>
            <li> It is light, not overwhelming, masculine yet yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Parfums have a much more concentrated scent, and they last much longer, and require less on application, this lasted once until the next morning after a long night out.    </li>
            <li> After a long days work I could still smell the perfume on me but if you use too much you might suffocate the people around you</li>
            <li> About the cologne, heavy, sweet and in my opinion (ofcours</li>
            <li> Fruity opening, even better fruity dry down with a musky undertone behind it while staying masculine, mysterious and potent.</li>
            <li> My only recommendation is choose another seller, I ordered an Eau de Parfum and they sent me an Eau de Toilette (which is considerably cheaper than EDP, which is the one I paid for).</li>
            <li> Polo stinks so good if you like it</li>
            <li> Polo stinks so good if you like it</li>
            <li> I will usually put this on before I go into work and even now I find it beneficial to spray on and walk forward as to not get the full plume in my face and sneeze</li>
            <li> Same exact juice, however, the dry down of Pure Malt is where this fragrance shines.</li>
            <li> Same exact juice, however, the dry down of Pure Malt is where this fragrance shines.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that it last almost 8hrs,not bad at all for EDT,otherwise I&#x27;d put just one star.</li>
            <li> is for little bit older person.</li>
            <li> simply that there is no wow factor to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over it and so are the perfumers of the world because there are not many scents on the market like Polo&#x27;s green bottle original scent and noone is trying to mimic it anytime soon.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I live in the Los Angeles area and it was around 80 degrees for the past few days here in the city just to give you a visual of my surrounding temp. No humidity. Nice breeze. Love LA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the fragrances being reviewed and their ranking in comparison to Hanae Mori (Parfum). I purchased #1-7 below within the last 2 months but I&#x27;ve had the same Polo bottle for over 10 year lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut up 8 pieces of paper and sprayed each with one scent then had my girlfriend blind test me. I sprayed at 6:25pm and started writing this review at 9:25pm after giving them one more sniff. My review is based on the opening, dry down and projection within these last 3 hours only. I will also recommend (blind buy) or (try 1st) for those who care about stuff like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 Encre Noire by Lalique&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent reminds me of something or someone from my childhood. I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on it but the smell made me happy and I wanted to keep smelling it over and over. Great opening, dry down almost seems to project a bit more but fantastic,mysterious, vetiver and bourbon essence that is still banging after 3 hrs on a piece of paper. I will agree with some reviewers and say this is an acquired tatse, so-to-speak and you will either LOVE it or HATE it. It is somewhat aggressive but a wonderful scent in order to beat out Hanae Mori. It was very close but mysterious nostalgia pushed Encre Noire to the title. (Try a sampler of this 1st)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 Hanae Mori by Hanae Mori&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening to this scent is #1 on this list without a doubt but overall, the dry-down was also great but after such a magnificent opening, I felt cheated. DO NOT BE FOOLED. This parfum version is very potent and 100% authentic. The opening smelled to me like a caramelized pineapple dipped in chocolate with a hint of musk or pepper then the dry-down smells more like a pineapple with a strong vanilla vibe behind it. The fresh pineapple remains throughout  tho. I&#x27;m not a professional, I&#x27;m just sharing how it smelled to me. Ironicaly, I meant to buy Him by Hanae Mori but ordered this one by mistake. VERY PLEASED in my error but I only hope Him by Hanae Mori will compare or be better than this? It&#x27;s my next purchase. Great fragrance. Must buy. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 Uomo Maschino by Moschino&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A close friend recommended this one for me as he swore by it for the last 15 yrs. I must say thanks to him for adding this one to my repertoire because it is fresh, clean and masculine and fun wrapped in one. Fruity opening, even better fruity dry down with a musky undertone behind it while staying masculine, mysterious and potent. Good projection on this one too. Oddly, you can spray 4-5 sprays and not offend anyone because of the soft sweetness that remains throughout this scent. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4 Blue Sugar by Aqualina&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent wins the 4th spot by default because #5 has projection problems and it ticks me off because its a designer fragrance. Anyway, this Blue Sugar is GREAT and a bargain bin special at just $17/1.7 oz . It opens like cotton candy or a slight bubble gum vibe but then drys down into a yellow cake batter or caramelized vanilla/sugar mixture. Amazing stuff for this price. Very well done for a cheapy. Must try if you like fresh, sweet summer scents. Go easy on the sprays in the heat tho. Can&#x27;t lose. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#5 The One by Dolce &amp; Gabbana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pissed off at D&amp;G for creating this masterpiece because it sure does fall short in the projection dept. It smells so, so, so, delicious that it even beats out Blue Sugar in smell but the dry down from D&amp;G for ($52) from a deisgner house is just pathetic. If you give someone a hug after 4 hrs, they might still smell it on you but you have to go 4-6 sprays on this just to make it through a an 8hr work day. The good news is you can spray it on your clothes instead of your body and 3-4 spraysWILL LAST for your entire 8hr work day. Damn good smell tho. If D&amp;G 1 had the projection of Encre Noire, D&amp;G would be #1 HANDS DOWN it smells that good. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#6 Angel Men Pure Malt by Thierry Mugler&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a bias toward fragrances that I have smelled before that mimic other fragrance houses. For that reason, I didn&#x27;t really care for this opening here because I had smelled this scent before. It is slightly aggressive and interesting right off the top. It smells exactly like Dunhill Red by Dunhill that I used to own and didn&#x27;t really care for. Same exact juice, however, the dry down of Pure Malt is where this fragrance shines.This is another acquired taste. I can see why many reviewers rave about it, and I can see why some do not like it. I lean more toward not liking it but the dry-down is really nice and it projects very well. You get 6-8 hrs on the skin easily with this one and 24hrs on ur clothing. I can always smell it on my clothes the next day. Easy on the sprayer. (Try a sample before buying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#7 Silver by Jack Black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very generic summer scent that I bought because it has many natural ingredients. Nothing to write home about but good for a daily gym scent or after work run to the grocery store etc. Poor projection after 4 hrs and semi floral on the dry-down. (Try a sample before buying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#8 Polo by Ralph Lauren&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this years and years ago because it is a timeless classic. The time for this classic has come and gone in my opinion. I&#x27;m over it and so are the perfumers of the world because there are not many scents on the market like Polo&#x27;s green bottle original scent and noone is trying to mimic it anytime soon. I can&#x27;t believe this thing is not a parfum. It projects like a BEAST. You know the deal guys...Polo stinks so good if you like it and it stinks so bad when you don&#x27;t. (Try a sample before buying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry this was so long people. Hope it was helpful at least.WILL LAST for your entire 8hr work day. Damn good smell tho.

(Try a sample before buying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry this was so long people. Hope it was helpful at least.</li>
            <li> This cologne was great. I love the subtle slight sweet smell. It is very masculine yet very subtle. It&#x27;s my top 5 favorite cologne. Make sure to get the eau de parfume version. It last waaaaay longer and is worth the extra $10-$20. It&#x27;s great for cocktail parties, black tie events and even heading to your local club. Ladies will flock, I promise!</li>
            <li> 1. Too sweet. Felt like I was spraying sugar on me.  2. Fragrance did not last even for 3 hours even with 4-5 sprays. And its a EDP for gods sake!</li>
            <li> Very high concentrate perfume!! But loved the smell :)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scent. Definitely a turn on for ladies! This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it for my husband because both of us liked it so much, though I was slightly tempted not to because the ladies he works with have all complimented him on it at one time or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best things about it is that one spray lasts nearly all day, but it&#x27;s not an overpowering scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon had one of the best prices out there for this item as well. The first time I bought it in a store for full price- but never again!</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift. The receiver loves it very much.</li>
            <li> good perfume, excellent price. I paid mor at a dept store and when i found it on amazon.com...took it and ran...it&#x27;s a must buy</li>
            <li> in the description it said for men. the bottle came back saying for women. I had a gift card and didnt want to go through with the returning of it. so i just gave it to my roommate. waist of a Christmas gift card.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to write?  This is a floral scent that is very manly, if I do say so myself.  I already had it before I bought it this time.  I liked it that much.</li>
            <li> Scents are personal matter of taste but i doubt anyone would be turned off by this. more of a ladies man scent, it wouldnt really work on a lumberjack.</li>
            <li> This is a very concentrated spray, I took a chance and purchased this Eau De Parfum only having sampled the lighter version at sephora.     Parfums have a much more concentrated scent, and they last much longer, and require less on application, this lasted once until the next morning after a long night out.    This is very gourmand, in other words, its smells like something so delicious you would want to eat it! Its also very oriental, check basenotes for further information. The girls want to eat you alive with this on!    The bottle is nice and very classy. try this in store, but spray it on your skin and walk around a bit, as it will change, you will like it!</li>
            <li> My guy neighbor wears Hanae Mori &amp;#60;ooh smelled so good... I ordered two bottles for my son and boyfriend.</li>
            <li> SO GREAT!!! THE SCENT IS THE EPITOME OF A SEXY SENSUAL MAN BUT I DROPPED IT ON THE FLOOR AND IT DOESN&#x27;T SPRAY ANYMORE KINDA SAD</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great smelling cologne and it last a long time. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this cologne. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance for my husband on Amazon after he sampled it at Sephora.  The price at Sephora for the 1.7 oz spray is over twice as much as Amazon&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He gets many compliments on how great he smells and the scent does last all day!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume because it lasts for long hours. After a long days work I could still smell the perfume on me but if you use too much you might suffocate the people around you it is very strong.</li>
            <li> Great, long-lasting scent.  A little goes a long way.  Great seller -- price way below Nordstrom&#x27;s price and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase and it is not a knock-off. I have total faith in Amazon and the scent is the final proof. The return policy is do to the fact that it is an alcohol based product and safety concerns. I have purchased other mien&#x27;s fragrances from Amazon and have always been satisfied. The scent is a personal thing and I like it. It is somewhat musky so maybe for an older crowd who grew up with musky scents.</li>
            <li> I love this spray. I had a guy from Nordstrom spray me with some and I didn&#x27;t much care for the way it tasted (literally) or how strong it was once I first smelled it out of the bottle, very strong and made me sneeze. After I had walked around for a while in the mall I noticed that I very much enjoyed a scent around me and couldn&#x27;t figure out who I was following around with that smell but I liked it. I soon realized it was me after sidestepping for someone not paying attention and smelled it stronger on myself. I then took my collar and smelled it from my shirt and noticed it had a slightly different smell. This is very body chemistry oriented. It will do just fine on your clothing if you are wearing and even if you are not it will smell good, just not like it will while it is on you. I have gotten many compliments from women on this, usually older women but compliments none the less. I love the smell of this and per oz this is much cheaper than what I paid for it at the mall. This is by far my favorite scent. I will usually put this on before I go into work and even now I find it beneficial to spray on and walk forward as to not get the full plume in my face and sneeze, a quick circle will do or even a breath out while you apply.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent of all time. As much as I like the scent when I first put it on, I also love the dry down, as in 18 hours later there is a smooth subtle sweetness left on your skin.</li>
            <li> Not my style... very powdery and I hate powdery fragrances.  My friend liked it so I just gave it to him.  Won&#x27;t fragrances based on reviews anymore lol.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is citrus based and carry an interesting list of ingredients. Rather light, it&#x27;s better suited for spring and summer, and, in my opinion, has a better longevity that the edc version which fails to impress me despite the exposure on fragrance counters. The edp too fails to impress me. Not that I do not like, I still wear it, but it&#x27;s just nothing to talk about after an hour of application. It could very well be a question of skin chemistry, or simply that there is no wow factor to it. I get no occasional whiff to remind me of it&#x27;s presence throughout the day. For an edp I&#x27;m just not impressed.</li>
            <li> I usually am a fragrancenet.com shopper but I found this cologne even cheaper on amazon. I wouldn&#x27;t start buying all my perfumes from amazon however this was a good find. Bought for my boyfriends dad as he was constantly wearing my boyfriends same one lol. Smells legit :)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s only requirement for a scent was that it contained some vanilla. After smelling many men&#x27;s cologne/parfums that said they had vanilla, I decided on this one. It is light, not overwhelming, masculine yet yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, ordering via Amazon was significantly less expensive than buying in store. So while I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying scents blind, I would definitely recommend testing scents in a brick-and-mortar store than purchasing online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, fruity, and spicy, yet very masculine. I was first drawn to Spicebomb in my search of a lighter cologne, but decided to give this one a shot and fell in love right away. It smells much nicer than Spicebomb, yet the two are quite similar. Since it&#x27;s parfum, it easily lasts all day whereas Spicebomb fades. It&#x27;s also pretty reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every one of my friends that has tried it loves it as well. That says a lot. It&#x27;s not often a light, fruity cologne appeals to a broad spectrum of men. I&#x27;ve found this niche to be quite polarizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s worth the price! I found it cheaper here than any brick &amp; mortar store near me. I would gladly order again!</li>
            <li> This smells great! Nice size bottle, lasts several hours like five-ish. Also, very durable bottle, i dropped it onto a heavy glass dish.  The dish shattered. The cologne was fine :)&lt;br /&gt;(Smells of tobacco and cholcolte at start and finishes to lilly of the valley)</li>
            <li> Long lasting, beautiful scent for the modern gentleman.</li>
            <li> Me and the ladies love this stuff,,spray it on and see what happens,,</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on this, one of my married friends asked me in a middle of party what I was wearing so she could get this for her husband.</li>
            <li> Hanae Mori is the first EDP I&#x27;ve purchased and I absolutely LOVE IT! I get plenty of complements from the Ladies too!&lt;br /&gt;I Highly recommend that you add this EDP fragrance to your collection! BTW... the scent lasts a long time, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. It was delivered in its original package and packs a potent Hana Mori punch. Well done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to write a review for everything that I buy, But  I do when the item is exceptional good or when I&#x27;m totally disappointed with the product to help others to get  better choices.&lt;br /&gt;In this particular case this fragrance is exceptional!!!  When I chose a men&#x27;s fragrance I always looking for some qualities such as masculine, fresh essence, stay on your body  and something pleasant to your senses. This fragrance is not only good for all  of above, it also has a fabulous price for  the quality of the product that you receive.&lt;br /&gt;I like good fragrances and I have my favorites (TOM FORD,GUCCI,....) AND FOR SURE THIS ONE IS NOW ON MY LIST.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you HANAE MORI... !!!</li>
            <li> Got compliments form everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Subtle but distinctive aroma.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts up to 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Good product and quite cheap too.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by someone who knows scents since I was told this scent does not change according to its wearer. It smells great. I&#x27;ve received compliments on how nice it smells. I do wish I could just dab it instead of spraying it since I don&#x27;t like using too much at once (I would just dab some behind each ear, on each wrist and right above the manubrium).</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s very dirrerent. Fresh and sweet, perfect for casual wear. My only recommendation is choose another seller, I ordered an Eau de Parfum and they sent me an Eau de Toilette (which is considerably cheaper than EDP, which is the one I paid for).</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> I liked it, but she loves it! A friend of mine had this in his collection but rarely wore it. I tried it one night having stayed with him while visiting him in Houston. My girlfriend was very impressed, so I had to order some for myself. This seller had it for a great price considering it was the Eau de parfum version.</li>
            <li> The seller sent me a wrong item.I ordered EDP but I received EDT.I requested exchange by email but they wanted to charge me for the return shipping.Thanks to Amazon I got my money back with the gift card I&#x27;ve been offered from them.About the cologne, heavy, sweet and in my opinion (ofcours I can be wrong) is for little bit older person. The good thing is that it last almost 8hrs,not bad at all for EDT,otherwise I&#x27;d put just one star.</li>
            <li> Product is legit. Saved $20 compared to department stores! I would buy more just to have plenty for the future.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this particular fragrance, the reviews were right!  Everywhere you go, you get compliments.  The scent is very light at first (Eau De Parfume) with a note of mint, but after wearing for a while it begins to manifest into a very subtle scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 32 and think this scent is fantastic. Not a feminine fragrance, but masculine. Great for a night out with a lady, party, wherever you go and not expensive at all!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable price and hard to believe it is genuine) Won&#x27;t buy in Nordstroms anymore)</li>
