            <li>Bare Minerals powder does not go through the chamber to the brush.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to fill, but i am having a really hard time getting the powder to come out of it.</li>

            <li> Lid to the powder compartment does not go on very well.  Also, this is not one of those brushes where the powder automatically gets loaded onto the brush.  If it is, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Jury is still out. I think it will work better with time. Nice soft brush!</li>
            <li> Easy enough to fill, but i am having a really hard time getting the powder to come out of it. The powder is micro fine, it just won&#x27;t advance out of the bristles no matter how hard i shake the thing. I want to love these!</li>
            <li> Easy to fill and easy to use. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the powder not coming out, it worked just fine. I like that it is clear so you can see how much powder is left inside. No complaints, I would recommend this brush, and I am going to buy another for my daughter.</li>
            <li> My power does not come out of the brush.  It will hold a good amount of mineral powder and it is compact.  You&#x27;ll get what you pay for with this.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but the quality is just bad.  The bristles were continuously falling out and I had to dig the brush into my skin because none of the mineral product is coming out.  I would give it one star but the price was really low so I couldn&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> The brush just falls apart when you are using it.  I thought I would just keep using it and then maybe it would get better but no</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Bare Minerals powder does not go through the chamber to the brush. When I tried to tap it out it cracked. Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for the powder to&lt;br /&gt;Come out. You need to tab on it and watch out it doesn&#x27;t spill. I barley use it</li>
            <li> The bristles do fall out but that may be because its new, I&#x27;m not sure, I&#x27;ve never owned ones of these before.&lt;br /&gt;It took a little while to get the powder to come out but now that its working, its great. I keep it in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone and am going to purchase a couple more as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is just right.</li>
            <li> This brush is garbage. I bought a mineral powder sunscreen to put in it, and not only does the powder not come out easily (you have to bang it on the counter forever to even get a tiny amount) but the bristles always fall out. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy.  Nice to put mineral powder in with less muss and fuss.  Easy to use and fill.</li>
            <li> Easy and convenient but bristles come out.</li>
            <li> This brush feels cheap. Spend the money  you saved and buy one that is actually worth it. It takes pounding this thing on the counter to get powder to come out. And the bristles break off and leave little black flecks all over my face. And I&#x27;m not just talking about after a couple times. I&#x27;ve used it several times and it&#x27;s still happening.</li>
            <li> Works Great. Can&#x27;t beat the price. I read all the reviews and this one works great for me. No spillage and very easy to carry.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Sturdy. Exactly what I was looking for! Easy to use! Perfect!</li>
            <li> Cheaply made came apart when I was trying to figure out how it worked but it does work just have to be careful. I had to remember didn&#x27;t pay much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother to read what the dimensions of this brush was so it was my fault for expecting something larger. I was going to use it for perfumed body dusting powder but will now make it a loose face powder brush. Came fairly quick and was packaged well, arrived with no damage.</li>
            <li> Does not work. Powder does not come out. Not worth the postage sending back .  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than expected, but works great. Nice and soft!!</li>
