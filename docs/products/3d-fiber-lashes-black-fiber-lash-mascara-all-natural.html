    <ol>
            <li>These re great!  </li>
            <li>Lashes look great!!</li>
            <li>you get what you pay for and I would just stick with the best.</li>
            <li>These are awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with just 1 coat.</li>
            <li>I really love the case!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this brand &amp; will be buying again!</li>
            <li>This stuff works amazing!</li>
            <li>The concept is good and it does build lashes.</li>
            <li>The younique fiber lashes didn&#x27;t work on me but surprisingly these worked a lot better !</li>
            <li>Very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>If the fibers could stay on your lashes over time this product would be amazing.</li>
            <li>It works better for some reason.</li>
            <li>I was better off with over the counter products from drug stores for cheaper.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Their customer service is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;mascara&#x27; part seems to be ok but those fibers?</li>
            <li>Product is great, it really gives 3D to the lashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Funny thing though, I could just about use the sealer as mascara by itself, kind of light but not bad.</li>
            <li>For the price...I thought this product would have been cheaply made</li>
            <li>But it can get clumpy if you don&#x27;t do it just right.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying it out on different clients just to make sure</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>100% comparable to the much higher priced Younique.</li>
            <li>As with most things (especially one you use around your eyes)</li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s just as good as the more expensive one my friend bought.</li>
            <li>Well I honestly believe that if I used the lint from my clothes dryer my eyes couldn&#x27;t get any more irritated!&lt;br /&gt;So needless to say, but I will anyways just for clarification, if you wear contacts lenses DO NOT BUY OR TRY THIS PRODUCT ON YOUR EYE LASHES</li>
            <li>It really helps a lot.</li>
            <li>But my recommendation would be to save your money for the best and save your eyes from a bad product.</li>
            <li>Try taking it off, put 1 layer of normal eyeliner, before your normal eye liner dries start to put the transplant gel on and fibers.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about buying them, but the price was good</li>
            <li>They really make long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>A little practice and you get great at having thick, long lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling you the unbiased truth here since I haven&#x27;t asked anyone for a refund on a &#x27;used product&#x27; (used only by me) and if you have sensitive eyes you will basically not want to try it either.</li>
            <li>little clumps brake off and fall in your eyes the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> It makes your lashes look long and thick, however, they start falling off over time and you will have little fibers around your eyes.</li>
            <li> Also my contact wearers are having trouble with fibers getting in their eyes.</li>
            <li> Just saying this to try to save someone else the money time and heartache (and eye irritations) of a failed purchased product.</li>
            <li> Hate to do a poor review, but it does not do what it says.</li>
            <li> This is simply a badly done knock off of the younique brand 3D mascara.</li>
            <li> hate this and returned it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like at all didn&#x27;t do what it said it would do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and I trained at the Westmore Academy of Makeup artistry so I know makeup. The concept is good and it does build lashes. But it can get clumpy if you don&#x27;t do it just right.  And it gives dark flakey shadows by end of day. I&#x27;ve been trying it out on different clients just to make sure and we all get dark under eyes by the end of day. Also my contact wearers are having trouble with fibers getting in their eyes. Also use a inexpensive mascara with it. It works better for some reason. I&#x27;m going to keep trying different techniques and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> These re great!  I was skeptical about buying them, but the price was good so I wanted to try them.  Very glad I did.  Lashes look great!!</li>
            <li> This was a pain in the butt. I put it into the garbage where it belongs.&lt;br /&gt;Funny thing though, I could just about use the sealer as mascara by itself, kind of light but not bad.</li>
            <li> It really helps a lot. I didn&#x27;t think it would do all it says it would but everyone compliments my eyelashes</li>
            <li> little clumps brake off and fall in your eyes the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;I hate this and returned it.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing! Because it is a cosmetic I did not return it. I was better off with over the counter products from drug stores for cheaper. Hate to do a poor review, but it does not do what it says.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  100% comparable to the much higher priced Younique. Their customer service is phenomenal. I will continue to purchase these.</li>
            <li> This is simply a badly done knock off of the younique brand 3D mascara. As with most things (especially one you use around your eyes) you get what you pay for and I would just stick with the best. I have visited lashalert.com as well as youniqueproducts.com/fastlash and both are guaranteed. If you buy younique from any external sites other than younique, the presenters are not allowed to sell there, so you many be getting an expired, damaged, or fake product (again a bad option for something going near your eyes) But my recommendation would be to save your money for the best and save your eyes from a bad product.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. My DIL introduced them to me. A little practice and you get great at having thick, long lashes. If you wear glasses, you will have to wear them slightly lower to avoid smudges on your lenses from your new long thick lashes!</li>
            <li> For the price...I thought this product would have been cheaply made but, it&#x27;s just as good as the more expensive one my friend bought. I really love the case!!!</li>
            <li> clumps a bit together buit the length is awsome and it does its job</li>
            <li> I saw this being demonstrated by someone and thought OH MY what a novel idea for getting longer looking lashes. It looked simple enough. So I ordered myself one and I wasted every penny I spent on it. I can&#x27;t wear tolerate it on my eyes because they are ultra-uber-sensitive to whatever those dry fibers are that it&#x27;s made with. The &#x27;mascara&#x27; part seems to be ok but those fibers? Well I honestly believe that if I used the lint from my clothes dryer my eyes couldn&#x27;t get any more irritated!&lt;br /&gt;So needless to say, but I will anyways just for clarification, if you wear contacts lenses DO NOT BUY OR TRY THIS PRODUCT ON YOUR EYE LASHES no matter what you read, see or hear. I&#x27;m telling you the unbiased truth here since I haven&#x27;t asked anyone for a refund on a &#x27;used product&#x27; (used only by me) and if you have sensitive eyes you will basically not want to try it either. Just saying this to try to save someone else the money time and heartache (and eye irritations) of a failed purchased product. Hope this helps someone else.</li>
            <li> The younique fiber lashes didn&#x27;t work on me but surprisingly these worked a lot better ! I&#x27;m very satisfied with this brand &amp; will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Product is great, it really gives 3D to the lashes.</li>
            <li> They really make long eyelashes. Only downfall is having the fibers fall on your cheeks through out the day.</li>
            <li> It makes your lashes look long and thick, however, they start falling off over time and you will have little fibers around your eyes. If the fibers could stay on your lashes over time this product would be amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing! I&#x27;m impressed with just 1 coat. Note if it starts getting clumpy Try taking it off, put 1 layer of normal eyeliner, before your normal eye liner dries start to put the transplant gel on and fibers. Also they fibers kinda hurt when they land in your eye.</li>
