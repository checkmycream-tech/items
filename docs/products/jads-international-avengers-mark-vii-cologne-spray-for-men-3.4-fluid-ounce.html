            <li>and i are both proud nerds.</li>
            <li>i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he LOVED it - great smell</li>
            <li>I, for whatever reason, hadn&#x27;t been expecting that so it was quite the pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>Having sniffed Mark VII there, I already knew I loved the smell, so I knew what I was getting into.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loved the smell too.</li>
            <li>and he loved the &amp;#34;marvel&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Smells really good.</li>
            <li>A rather unique fragrance in the overpowering Axe age, but very welcome.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase! :)</li>
            <li>He loves it, I love it and it smells great on him.  </li>
            <li>Im happy that he love it.</li>
            <li>The sme&#x27;ll is amazing.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, but seemingly universally liked.  </li>
            <li>smells really good, gf love it aswell.</li>
            <li>When I tell them what it is and that its a Mens Cologne and Iron man Mark 7.They say its a really nice scent .So</li>
            <li>The box was cool but the smell was not so great...</li>
            <li>For sure a winner.</li>
            <li>But I love this one .</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The JADS International Avengers Mark Vii Cologne arrived quickly and in perfect condition!  </li>
            <li>nice cologne, light, fresh, citrusy  and cool bottle</li>
            <li>All my co-workers and friends enjoy the smell of it.</li>
            <li>Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent</li>
            <li>Not a bad cologne.  </li>
            <li>This cologne smells absolutely amazing, I was a little sceptikal at first but after getting it here, I am very glad I bought it, and it comes very well packaged</li>
            <li>For any one that is a fan of Tony Stark, this would be a great product to purches.</li>
            <li>bottle is- obviously- bigger than the one that came in the deluxe set, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most likely going to buy another one :) I would HIGHLY recommend getting this</li>
            <li>My friend got the deluxe set of Avengers cologne back when The Avengers first came to theaters.</li>
            <li>Be ready to be asked what you&#x27;re using when you wear it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s educational value.</li>
            <li>; theme - i just got him the whole set too!</li>
            <li>Well first off to set the record straight ..</li>
            <li>At the price though it doesn&#x27;t seem to much like an every day product.</li>
            <li>I was also partially worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be a sophisticated smell (we&#x27;re in our 20s)</li>
            <li>I like this one just as much as the Captain America Patriot cologne.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>l love it and wear it everyday</li>
            <li>Men love it because they want to smell as manly as Tony Stark.</li>
            <li>Even better than I may have expected not having smelled it prior to purchase.  </li>
            <li>It comes out a little strong at first but it definitely lasts.</li>
            <li>It is masculine yet soft in scent.</li>
            <li>Shipment was quick, the outer box had a little bit of wear at the corners, but otherwise everything was in tip-top shape.&lt;br /&gt;tenoutaten</li>
            <li>Wish the scent would last a little bit longer but all in all not bad.</li>

            <li> The JADS International Avengers Mark Vii Cologne arrived quickly and in perfect condition!  It smells absolutely wonderful!  Even better than I may have expected not having smelled it prior to purchase.  It was a gift for my husband.  He loves it, I love it and it smells great on him.  It is masculine yet soft in scent.</li>
            <li> I brought this cologne for my kids Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent i wore it a few times and i have alot of women at my job ask me the name of this cologne.</li>
            <li> A rather unique fragrance in the overpowering Axe age, but very welcome.  Not overpowering, but seemingly universally liked.  Be ready to be asked what you&#x27;re using when you wear it!</li>
            <li> smells really good, gf love it aswell.</li>
            <li> My friend got the deluxe set of Avengers cologne back when The Avengers first came to theaters.

            <li> I got this for my fianc&amp;eacute;e who loves Ironman as an xmas stocking stuffer! This was an ideal item, arrived in time and it smells great!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells absolutely amazing, I was a little sceptikal at first but after getting it here, I am very glad I bought it, and it comes very well packaged so no worries about the glass being broken.</li>
            <li> This was not a toy thus I couldn&#x27;t rate it&#x27;s educational value. However, this is a great product! Smells great! Arrived promptly! I am very pleased with this purchase! :)</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling stuff ever!!! Which makes me torn on using it or keeping it as collectors item. My boyfriend loved the smell too. I&#x27;m most likely going to buy another one :) I would HIGHLY recommend getting this</li>
            <li> i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he LOVED it - great smell and he loved the &amp;#34;marvel&amp;#34; theme - i just got him the whole set too!</li>
            <li> Well first off to set the record straight ..I,m a GIRL.I bought the cologne for me .Yupe l love it and wear it everyday .People ask me all the time \\&quot; What is it \\&quot;.When I tell them what it is and that its a Mens Cologne and Iron man Mark 7.They say its a really nice scent .So there you have it .Women can wear Mark 7 and wish they were with Tony Stark...</li>
            <li> So delicious. Men love it because they want to smell as manly as Tony Stark. For sure a winner. Yum.</li>
            <li> Not a bad cologne.  Smells pretty good.  Wish the scent would last a little bit longer but all in all not bad.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend. Im picky When it comes to colognes and perfumes. But I love this one . The sme&#x27;ll is amazing. Im happy that he love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s smells great. All my co-workers and friends enjoy the smell of it. I like the idea that it is sold in a glass spray on bottle and not placstic. For any one that is a fan of Tony Stark, this would be a great product to purches. At the price though it doesn&#x27;t seem to much like an every day product. Buts its great and would be some thing to add to your Marvel snd or cologne collection.</li>
            <li> its okay. It smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t last long. I bought Thor too and it was about the same thing.</li>
            <li> The box was cool but the smell was not so great...</li>
            <li> I was a little wary about buying a cologne over the internet without knowing what it smelled like. However, when it got here, I loved it!

I&#x27;m considering buying the other ones in the line as well. You can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> Smells really good. Got it for myself cause my gf and i are both proud nerds. I like this one just as much as the Captain America Patriot cologne. I think I&#x27;ll be buying Thor next.</li>
            <li> nice cologne, light, fresh, citrusy  and cool bottle</li>
