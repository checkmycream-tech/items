            <li>For St. Ives, they&#x27;ve not only made strong cleansers for your body and face, but also have shown to be long-lasting from price and longevity.</li>

            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out nor does it aggrivate my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> and I was looking for a budget product that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a cleanser that didn&#x27;t break me out, but I have dry skin!  </li>
            <li> One of the bottles was leaking, another bottle had a rusted pump, and all three cleansers had a different shade of green soap inside.</li>
            <li> this product is not real, the labels are reprinted ,bye i dont know ,the product in side is some home made stuff its not st ives</li>
            <li> If I found one that cleansed well enough, it dried me out.  </li>
            <li> There is no question that it is very hard to find very few cleansers that can be well worth their money.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I found 3 for $13 on Amazon, but grossly disappointed when it actually arrived...    </li>
            <li> The other reviews says it worked for them.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products and then have to deal with the horrible breakouts!!!!  </li>
            <li> Does not clean my skin.</li>
            <li> It instantly dried my face out.</li>
            <li> I found a supplier on line who still had a few of them and bought them.  </li>
            <li> I can use this cleanser year round, it never dries my skin, nor does it cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, After 2 weeks, my neckline has cleared up and easier to shave, not to mention, no dry flaking!</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY disappointed and VERY SKEPTICAL about whether this is the actual St. Ives product and not just an empty bottle</li>

            <li> There is no question that it is very hard to find very few cleansers that can be well worth their money. For St. Ives, they&#x27;ve not only made strong cleansers for your body and face, but also have shown to be long-lasting from price and longevity. Their Elements Olive Cleanser is a simple and convient way of cleaning your face, with a little dab from the pump, and a sping of water, it does a real good on your skin, without being too hard or abrasive on your skin. It really also lasts longer per bottle than other skin cleansers like Noxemma or plain soap and water. I really have enjoyed using St. Ives Elements Olive Cleanser, and it really is one of those few that definitely is more that just pitted olives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: B+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanses: B+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: B+</li>
            <li> I could no longer find this cleanser in a regular brick-and-mortar store, so I turned to Amazon.  Found it!!  A review of the ingredients shows that St. Ives has changed the formula slightly from the original, but I found that the cleanser works just as well.  One pump is just enough to get the job done.  My skin is sensitive and somewhat oily (ESP in the summer).  The cleanser does not leave my skin feeling tight or dry, just soft and smooth all year &#x27;round.  It gently removes water-based mascara, and I&#x27;ve even used it occasionally with my Clarisonic!  Better than a more expensive cleanser that is constantly changing their formula (good-bye to Philosophy).  Great Product.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DON&#x27;T BUY    This is my favorite product, and I&#x27;ve looked all over to find this specific cleanser in stores. I was excited when I found 3 for $13 on Amazon, but grossly disappointed when it actually arrived...    One of the bottles was leaking, another bottle had a rusted pump, and all three cleansers had a different shade of green soap inside. Not only that, but the soap smelled MUCH different from the normal St. Ives Olive Cleanser--it smelled a lot more like dish washing soap.    I am EXTREMELY disappointed and VERY SKEPTICAL about whether this is the actual St. Ives product and not just an empty bottle they have filled with a cheaper soap to make money.</li>
            <li> I began using St. Ives olive cleanser a few years ago, and was first able to get this product at my local big box store, however, for some unknown reason- this chain of stores has now replaced this with the similar tea tree cleanser- which I do not like as well. So glad to find this online, for a great price, and in a bundle pkg.</li>
            <li> amazing cleanser.. gets rid of oil,makeup, acne without parabens. non-irritating works wonders for acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Definitely worth giving a try!!</li>
            <li> I do not know who you think us people are who order from amazon ,or whos leg your pulling you should be a shame of your self, will never order again this product is not real, the labels are reprinted ,bye i dont know ,the product in side is some home made stuff its not st ives .threw it out you are not worth,of my time to sent it back. hope others see this so they will not bye it.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this cleanser works beautifully. Doesn&#x27;t make my oily areas break out or my dry areas any drier. I use a lot of St. Ives products since they don&#x27;t animal test.</li>
            <li> not this product. It instantly dried my face out. It smelled &amp; felt like cheap dish detergent. I&#x27;ve used St. Ives products for years and I&#x27;ve come to trust their products. However, this one for me was a loser. Unfortunately I ordered 3 bottles as part of the auto ship program - today I cancelled my subscription. I gave it 2 stars because as another reviewer said it can be used as a hand soap - I guess.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this on sale at my local grocery store.  I thought, what the heck, it&#x27;s good packaging.  Until that purchase, I&#x27;d been using Mary Kay, Neutragena, Clinique, Elizabeth Arden, Olay - all of them.  I kept giving half-used bottles away to friends. I couldn&#x27;t find a cleanser that didn&#x27;t break me out, but I have dry skin!  If I found one that cleansed well enough, it dried me out.  If it was gentle, like a cream cleanser, it broke me out.  This was an impulse buy in desperation, and it&#x27;s been great!  My skin is balanced, my pores are smaller, I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I started using this 6 months ago.  When my grocery store stopped selling it I ordered the 3-pack from Amazon.  It is cheaper to do that than buy it in single bottles from the store, because the price was $7.99 per bottle locally.  I think this cleanser is as good as, or better (for me) than cleansers more than twice it&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> This is a great item for morning and night time facial cleansing.  If you have oily skin it is especially refreshing and leaves you with a wonderful clean feeling.  I have ordered it before and it last for quite some time.  Use it daily and you will be surprised with how clean and natural it keeps your skin.</li>
            <li> In very plain words, this product dried my skin out very very quickly. I know the packaging says it wouldn&#x27;t, and that it would actually moisturize, but it took away all the oils. After two weeks of using it, I had to eventually stop because my skin started developing fine lines. I was pretty horrified so I stopped using it. Now my skin isn&#x27;t that dry at all, but after using this, it became waaay too dry.     The other reviews says it worked for them. And all I can say is that I guess this product works for some people and doesn&#x27;t for others.</li>
            <li> I bought this at CVS once and loved it.  I generally don&#x27;t like fragrance in my facial products, but this only has a slightly mild and pleasant scent so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I have normal to dry skin and it leaves my face soft and moist.  I really haven&#x27;t found a cleanser I like better.  When I went to buy more, I couldn&#x27;t find it ANYWHERE.  I&#x27;d been on the lookout for it for close to a year  hadn&#x27;t been able to find it so I decided that it must have been discontinued. Out of curiousity (and desperation) I checked on Amazon and was thrilled to find it!  I ordered three so that it will last me awhile.</li>
            <li> all 3 bottles are funny colored. one is cloudy. none of them match the original 3 I ordered months ago. I&#x27;m not sure if they are authentic. perhaps they changed color because of age?  I&#x27;m hesitant to use them. I tired to attach a photo but was unsuccessful</li>
            <li> St. Ives products are not expensive but they are really nice products.  The Olive Oil cleansers works great.  Feels nice after washing and leaves your skin soft and healthly looking.  Use this all the time.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, sensitive skin you need to try this.  I have tried so many different products and then have to deal with the horrible breakouts!!!!  This is great, no breakouts and my skin does not feel like I have walked through the desert... I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been using it for a while now and it doesn&#x27;t dry out nor does it aggrivate my oily skin.  I feel very smooth and clean after using.  I especially like it with my Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> Again the manufacturer stopped making this - much to my disappointment.  I found a supplier on line who still had a few of them and bought them.  This should hold me for awhile!</li>
            <li> It dried my skin, has a strong fragrance. Does not clean my skin. My teenage son said it smells as laundry detergent. Just cheap hand soap. We are using it as hand soap. I went back to Purpose cleanser.</li>
            <li> I bought this 3 pack from Impossible Discounts. The bottles were dirty with rusty pumps and the labels were worn. The cleanser itself was cloudy and I believe it is not truly St. Ives product. Do not buy from this distributor. No, no, no.</li>
            <li> I have not found a product that my skin enjoys more than St.Ives Olive Cleanser and I was always able to purchase it locally until Ultra discontinued carrying the product.  I looked all over the place to no avail.  Someone, thankfully, suggested I try Amazon, which I did.  There was my favorite skin cleanser!  I am forever gratefully. My skin is happy again and so am I.    Thank you,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a GREAT price comes with 3 of them. I can never get 3 packs at this price anywhere else. It leaves your skin moist and clean unlike soaps. I never use soap again when I clean my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man in my 30&#x27;s and I was looking for a budget product that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I have sensitive skin and typically use all natural high end products, but simply don&#x27;t want to continue paying those amounts. I already use the St. Ives apricot scrub, so I decided to try St. Ives products. After research and reading reviews I cam across this Olive cleanser. Needless to say, After 2 weeks, my neckline has cleared up and easier to shave, not to mention, no dry flaking! If you think you have sensitive or dry skin, I would recommend you give this product a try. I&#x27;m enjoying it.  Gave 4 stars because I will do a follow up in a couple months as I&#x27;m using this product daily. So let&#x27;s see!</li>
            <li> most effective gentle cleanser for sensitive skin.  Too bad they discontinued this product.  I hope they bring it back</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I tend to have dry skin, and spend a lot of time in a pool and out in the sun, in a place with extreme temps and low humidity. I can use this cleanser year round, it never dries my skin, nor does it cause breakouts. Some people dislike the scent, but I prefer it to perfumey scents. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 years now, and will never use anything else.</li>
