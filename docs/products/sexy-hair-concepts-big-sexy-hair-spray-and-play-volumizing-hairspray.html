            <li> The item wouldn&#x27;t spray, it was jammed or something but I had to throw it out because it wouldn&#x27;t work. never even got to try the product.</li>
            <li> I use this as a travel size product.  It is fabulous for hair that loses its style easily with humid conditions.</li>
            <li> I like the product and the small container is easy to carry in a purse</li>
            <li> I am usually adverse to various hair styling products because they are crazy sticky or they smell awful or they don&#x27;t work. Not with this! I really like this hair spray. It holds my style very well, I don&#x27;t have to saturate it either and it has a good smell! Only hair spray I&#x27;ll buy.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product.  Love the product, and, the travel size is perfect for motorcycle trip packing.</li>
            <li> Again ordered by my son - but he says it is really good and likes the product.</li>
            <li> Hair stays in place but you can play with it all you want.  Best hairspray I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a small travel size. Full-size Big Sexy products take up a lot of luggage space.</li>
            <li> Bought this in a grocery store.  Liked the travel size.  But it was so bad and useless, I threw it out.  The spray came out super strong and concentrated, and even when I washed the nozzle several times (and tried to build up and coat the nozzle with spray), I could never get it to come out evenly or nicely dispersed.  So it messed up my hairstyle ever time.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the smell okay.</li>
            <li> I purchased this specifically for travel to Turks &amp; Caicos. I was hoping this would work in the humid climate but my hair did not stay in place.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Now I can travel with the smaller size on planes in carry on luggage. . Very happy. Husband likes it too!!</li>
            <li> it did give me volume and it did hold my hair, but the thing that annoys me is that as soon as i apply it on my hair after it dries, it made my hair feel hard and it wasn&#x27;t a nice feeling,</li>
            <li> Should be a little cheaper</li>
            <li> This made my hair kind of sticky, but it brushes out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll try a different spray next time.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I was happy to find a travel size.  This hairspray is wonderful for lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> Works as it should and nice travel size</li>
            <li> Great hair spray &amp; size, especially perfect for traveling and only having a carry-on bag. Holds my fine hair in place better than any others.</li>

            <li> Perfect travel size! Great hold!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!!  Holds hair in place ALL day, but there&#x27;s no helmet head!!!</li>
            <li> Iam growing out my hair and needed something that would hold a crappy haircut. This product is great and I will order larger bottle!</li>
            <li> Love this travel size.</li>
            <li> perfect size for travel!!</li>
            <li> This hairspray is great. Has good holding effect.  Not too sticky.  Increases volume of hair by not weighing it down.  The only thing I do not like is the extreme high cost for the travel size item.  I have the regular size as well and the price is good fof that but travel items seem to be so pricey.</li>
            <li> Hold my style great and I have very fine hair.  It does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I love having the same hairspray in my travel bag that I use when I am at home.  I love the fact that I do not have to carry my huge can with me.</li>
