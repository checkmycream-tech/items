            <li>The best color match I have found.</li>
            <li>This was the perfect color for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>, I think that&#x27;s awesome, but I don&#x27;t like the color.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to know I could find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>so I was happy to find them online.</li>
            <li>Does not go on easy but matches perfect</li>
            <li>and none of them were as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>Great price, nice having two pencils and a sharper</li>
            <li>The color is perfect as I am very fair skinned, it&#x27;s just not real dark or too light, love it !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>i like covergirl products an this is amazing.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and filled in my eyebrows perfectly.</li>
            <li>Eyebrows are nice and prim with this pencil</li>
            <li>I have platinum to very light hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that this didn&#x27;t put any color at all on my very light eyebrows, even when I kept putting on more layers.  </li>
            <li>Perfect blonde eyebrow pencils!</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a sharpener</li>
            <li>and I love how this goes on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect blonde color.</li>
            <li>Very adequate eyebrow pencils for the price.</li>
            <li>color too light.  </li>
            <li>The color is too light to be seen</li>
            <li>I guess because the color is so light</li>
            <li>This would be great if it was actually blonde when it went on my brows</li>
            <li>I liked these, but they were a bit lighter than I thought, so you might just want to buy a shade darker than you would normally use.</li>
            <li>this does the trick nicely and looks very natural</li>
            <li>The color is great, but the product seems kind of dried out, is it too old?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this one since middle school - love it!</li>
            <li>This by far my favorite line of eyebrow pencil/</li>
            <li>If I sharpen it to maybe get to some fresh pencil, nothing.</li>
            <li>Pencil is nice and soft and the blonde color is perfect for my mostly grey brows and my daughter&#x27;s blonde.</li>
            <li>It goes on much lighter than I expected, and I&#x27;m a pretty light complected and light haired girl.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really matter anyway as these were inexpensive, and had free shipping, and will last for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that my eyebrows have so much color</li>
            <li>I compare this to trying to color my brows with concrete!  </li>
            <li>A good color for cool blonds and while not soft, not uncomfortablely hard either.</li>
            <li>color is more strawberry blonde than blonde</li>
            <li>I would recommend a shade darker than your normal.</li>
            <li>What I received in the order was two pencils and a sharpener in a package like those sold in drugstores plus a small cardboard box with two more identical sets.</li>
            <li>Not too light and not too dark!</li>
            <li>its ok  but hard to use</li>
            <li>Goes on easily,looks natural, lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Mmmmm to blonde and hard to see where you are putting the color, it is cheap then other brands like stila, but stila has better color</li>
            <li>This eye pencil is very &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; in composition and color is way off for blonde compared to other pencils that glide on with the right color tint.  </li>
            <li>Most other brands are much too dark to be considered blonde.</li>
            <li>I found that I really needed to press down to get the color I desired.</li>
            <li>I use these for a brow liner, and they work pretty well, but it is a lighter harder to apply than expected.  </li>
            <li>it is also soft &amp; hard to get the &amp;#34;pointed&amp;#34; tip I need without the whole end falling off every time I try to sharpen it.</li>

            <li> I liked these, but they were a bit lighter than I thought, so you might just want to buy a shade darker than you would normally use.</li>
            <li> I ordered lots of this product to share with my daughter since we can&#x27;t find it in our local stores.  Before ordering, I purchased 3 other &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; eyebrow pencils from other companies from our local Walgreens and spent about $6 each and none of them were as good as this one.  Pencil is nice and soft and the blonde color is perfect for my mostly grey brows and my daughter&#x27;s blonde.</li>
            <li> I have very light brown/golden blonde hair - finally found a pencil that doesn&#x27;t look fake!</li>
            <li> color too light.  Pencil too hard to apply</li>
            <li> I use these for a brow liner, and they work pretty well, but it is a lighter harder to apply than expected.  I found that I really needed to press down to get the color I desired.</li>
            <li> Perfect blonde eyebrow pencils! The best color match I have found. Most other brands are much too dark to be considered blonde.</li>
            <li> The color is too light to be seen and I have pale skin. Needs to be a tad darker</li>
            <li> Does not go on easy but matches perfect</li>
            <li> The pencil was what I expected but i found it hard to sharpen. I guess because the color is so light it is also soft &amp; hard to get the &amp;#34;pointed&amp;#34; tip I need without the whole end falling off every time I try to sharpen it. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchaser from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Great price, nice having two pencils and a sharper</li>
            <li> This was the perfect color for my eyebrows. It went on smoothly and filled in my eyebrows perfectly. Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> its ok  but hard to use</li>
            <li> color is more strawberry blonde than blonde</li>
            <li> I have platinum to very light hair. i&#x27;ve always hated that harsh brown and heaven for bed black eyebrows look on blonde women this does the trick nicely and looks very natural</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these in the stores anywhere so I was happy to find them online. They are just what I needed. I ordered two (2).  What I received in the order was two pencils and a sharpener in a package like those sold in drugstores plus a small cardboard box with two more identical sets. So I got three sets. I don&#x27;t know if that means I got an extra set or if I should have had four sets. Doesn&#x27;t really matter anyway as these were inexpensive, and had free shipping, and will last for years.</li>
            <li> I ordered the blond color, and it didn&#x27;t show up at all on my eyebrows.  It&#x27;s not that my eyebrows have so much color that this isn&#x27;t necessary;  it&#x27;s that this didn&#x27;t put any color at all on my very light eyebrows, even when I kept putting on more layers.  If I were to order this again, I&#x27;d definitely go for the next darker color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this one since middle school - love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried these out, and I like them, but I&#x27;m still not sure about the color.</li>
            <li> No color actually was applied to my skin.  The color center of the pencil is very hard and does not apply on the skin. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It goes on much lighter than I expected, and I&#x27;m a pretty light complected and light haired girl. I love that it comes with a sharpener, I think that&#x27;s awesome, but I don&#x27;t like the color. I would recommend a shade darker than your normal.</li>
            <li> This by far my favorite line of eyebrow pencil/ I am a makeup artist and I love how this goes on. Not too light and not too dark!</li>
            <li> Mmmmm to blonde and hard to see where you are putting the color, it is cheap then other brands like stila, but stila has better color</li>
            <li> Eyebrows are nice and prim with this pencil</li>
            <li> I just wanted to try a different, inexpensive blonde eyebrow pencil. This does not have any pigment at all. Even when I draw a line on my hand, nothing. If I press hard, nothing. If I sharpen it to maybe get to some fresh pencil, nothing.</li>
            <li> Very hard.  Discomfort when trying to use them</li>
            <li> Plain and simple...if you&#x27;re a blonde, this is the ticket. It&#x27;s the perfect blonde color. I have been purchasing the pencils for years and I can&#x27;t always find them. Price won me over. These brow pencils are so inexpensive, so why spend time driving to get them. I was very happy to know I could find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very adequate eyebrow pencils for the price. A good color for cool blonds and while not soft, not uncomfortablely hard either.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily,looks natural, lasts all day.  Hard to find color that works well for blondes.</li>
            <li> Was not &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; made my eyebrows orange. The page didn&#x27;t say anything about it being a two pack so when I purchased the item I purchased two thinking I would get two pencils. Instead I got 4. This would be great if it was actually blonde when it went on my brows but it&#x27;s orange...</li>
            <li> The color is great, but the product seems kind of dried out, is it too old?</li>
            <li> i like covergirl products an this is amazing.</li>
