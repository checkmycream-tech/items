            <li>all fine.. good quality..</li>
            <li>Ok... it depends every skin...</li>
            <li>, it was really fast, I am really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This is his favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>Colors has been my favorite cologne for over 20 years.</li>
            <li>A lot of retailers don&#x27;t carry it any more</li>
            <li>This is his favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Great gift for my adult grandson.</li>
            <li>Colors by benetton smells some what like the original but it will need many sprays to make it happen.  </li>
            <li>And I was surprised that I had the good packaging to avoid being hurt the product.</li>
            <li>Smells good but could last longer....</li>
            <li>I like it very much and still enjoy it as my cologne of choice today.</li>
            <li>This is not a refreshing, light, or attractive scent.</li>
            <li>Its not to strong and is sweet enough for the me.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the first thing I thought when I smelled this.</li>
            <li>I used to wear this on a regular basis many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I think this actual bottle was on a shelf for sale that many years ago.</li>
            <li>I have bought these before in stores, and always worked fine, this one stopped working after about 20 uses, so at 85% bottle left the sprayer</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon.com, its now within my fingers reach.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fragrance is very well tolerated.  </li>
            <li>I was very disappioned</li>
            <li>I really like the perfume.</li>
            <li>He gets more compliments on this than any other fragrance.</li>
            <li>It has a juvenile aroma and it can use it daily, the aroma is pleasant and durable.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, a little bit longer after de night shower (i clean myself very well!!9.</li>
            <li>Drakkar Noir is still very strong and manly and only needs one very small spray to do the whole day plus!</li>
            <li>This is not the same fragrance that I got for Christmas many years ago when it was sold in a black splash bottle.</li>
            <li>Maybe I got an old bottle but the stuff was dank.</li>
            <li>Colors has been my favorite cologne since the late 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>/&gt;as strong as usual.</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected, recommended</li>
            <li>These modern day formulations are weak and do not have the balls that they had when they first came on the market.  </li>
            <li>When you first smell you get the old woman scent, then it slowly turns into a bug spray-esque smell.</li>

            <li> but in my case, it last all day long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of colors for a very long time, but when I got the two bottles from this&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been a big fan of this product, reminds me of the Canada Dry Ginger Ale jingle,\\&quot;its not to sweet\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fond of Colors for a long time.</li>
            <li> I do not like sales because the product came without the plastic that usually bring perfumes when they are new.</li>
            <li> I will have to apply this fragrance the same way as I apply Ralph Lauren Polo green.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other cologne, this one is on the musky side.</li>
            <li> , you could tell that both bottles had been water down and not&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this spray as it is honestly one of the worst scent&#x27;s</li>

            <li> At least Colors is sold for a lot less money these days.</li>
            <li> Not sure..</li>
            <li> Both these fragrances only needed one small application at one time sadly</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the cologne is not available in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Very hard stuff to find these days</li>
            <li> My second wife hated it!</li>
            <li> The longevity is now disappointing too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad these fragrances are not like Drakkar Noir.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s terrible</li>

            <li> This smells awesome! Just like it smelled when my brother was a teenager and was I a baby girl.</li>

            <li> I have bought these before in stores, and always worked fine, this one stopped working after about 20 uses, so at 85% bottle left the sprayer does not work..........  Maybe its this bottle, maybe its bcos its a tester, Not sure..</li>
            <li> I have been a big fan of this product, reminds me of the Canada Dry Ginger Ale jingle,\\&quot;its not to sweet\\&quot;.  Used it for years,but getting more difficult to find in local stores.  Thanks to Amazon.com, its now within my fingers reach.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance on my hubby! He gets more compliments on this than any other fragrance.</li>
            <li> Colors has been my favorite cologne for over 20 years. This stuff is amazing. A lot of retailers don&#x27;t carry it any more and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great scent! I have been using it for decades! My girlfriend loves it! My second wife hated it! Very hard stuff to find these days so jump on it!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the first thing I thought when I smelled this. It&#x27;s so bad. Don&#x27;t bother with this spray as it is honestly one of the worst scent&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever experienced. When you first smell you get the old woman scent, then it slowly turns into a bug spray-esque smell. it&#x27;s terrible</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fond of Colors for a long time. Unfortunately, the cologne is not available in stores anymore. Excellent value for my money.</li>
            <li> This perfume has nice fragrance. And good product for a nic eprice.  Lasts for around 4 hrs and a good product from a good brand.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always like the way Colors smelled.  Its not to strong and is sweet enough for the me.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and lasts. My husband really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will order it again. You have a very good product, hope it stay around.</li>
            <li> I gave this EDT to my 15 year-old son and he loved. It has a juvenile aroma and it can use it daily, the aroma is pleasant and durable. Their friends have liked it. I recommend it</li>
            <li> Colors by United of Benetton is One of the best scents ever!  I would purchase this again for myself and as a gift.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this for years.  He has tried others but always goes back to Colors By United Colors of Benetton For Men.  Fragrance is very well tolerated.  Some colognes you can smell the scent before the wearer enters the room.</li>
            <li> Pleasant perfume for women and good for a gift too.</li>
            <li> Excellent 100% Recommended</li>
            <li> Colors by benetton smells some what like the original but it will need many sprays to make it happen.  This is not the same fragrance that I got for Christmas many years ago when it was sold in a black splash bottle. The longevity is now disappointing too.  I will have to apply this fragrance the same way as I apply Ralph Lauren Polo green.  These modern day formulations are weak and do not have the balls that they had when they first came on the market.  So they get us using up the bottle faster and then buying another one sooner! At least Colors is sold for a lot less money these days. As for Polo green there is no discount.  Both these fragrances only needed one small application at one time sadly those days are gone. Too bad these fragrances are not like Drakkar Noir. Drakkar Noir is still very strong and manly and only needs one very small spray to do the whole day plus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of colors for a very long time, but when I got the two bottles from this&lt;br /&gt;distributor I was very disappioned, you could tell that both bottles had been water down and not&lt;br /&gt;as strong as usual. when I got these two I still had a bottle I had purchased from the mall, and&lt;br /&gt;you could tell the different. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Colors has been my favorite cologne since the late 1980&#x27;s.I like it very much and still enjoy it as my cologne of choice today.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this on a regular basis many years ago.  I think this actual bottle was on a shelf for sale that many years ago.</li>
            <li> oh does this smell so good.  a fellow at work was wearing this and i asked him what it was.  he told me and i thought , where can i get it at.  amazon had it and at a good price so i gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I do not like sales because the product came without the plastic that usually bring perfumes when they are new.</li>
            <li> all fine.. good quality.. i liked</li>
            <li> Great gift for my adult grandson. This is his favorite scent. The value was super great.</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected, recommended</li>
            <li> I really like the perfume. And I was surprised that I had the good packaging to avoid being hurt the product. Greetings.</li>
            <li> I bought it for Christmas gifts for the men in my life last Christmas.  They all wanted it again this year.  Great fragrance</li>
