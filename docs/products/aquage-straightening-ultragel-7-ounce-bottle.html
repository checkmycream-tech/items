            <li>Thanks for the Awesome service.</li>

            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Its very light, and</li>
            <li>At around $20, it seems pricey, but I probably don&#x27;t use more than two tubes a year.</li>
            <li>but OK ... does not have side effects like others I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, but the cap came cracked on the bottle since it was winter.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist introduced me to this product many years ago.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>I love Aquage products.  </li>
            <li>I love this, it works.</li>
            <li>I straighten my hair after blow drying with the product and it makes it 2x&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many others received their package like this</li>
            <li>My hairdresser convinced me to buy it, and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more Aquage.</li>
            <li>I love this straightening gel.  </li>
            <li>I have bought this product before, i love it.</li>
            <li>he said he wouldnt be able to pay me in $$</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I love this product, because my hair stylist used this once to straighten my hair</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>love it, works to straighten or to curl.</li>
            <li>I personally love this product.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my wavy, slightly coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Came in a timely matter, and I love the product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you want smooth, straight hair!</li>
            <li>, so it didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to do for me, but the product is still pretty good.</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and still have beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>but it is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>Be cautious if you use to much hair is lifeless and doesn&#x27;t look so good on day two or three :)</li>
            <li>Fantastic for fine, curly hair!  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, don&#x27;t use any more than that.  </li>
            <li>This product helps protect my hair and keeps it looking healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and fresh too.  </li>
            <li>have tried other products, but nothing else compares, Truly is the best.</li>
            <li>Easy to style as the brush glides through</li>
            <li>The best product I&#x27;ve tried, so far is the tresseme 7 day straight.</li>
            <li>What first attracted me to this product was its nice scent when my stylist used it.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but stubborn and voluminous.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser suggested that I get this to help with getting my fine hair to get the \\&quot;just after being at the salon\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li>Wife tells me this works fine.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and it controls my fly-aways.  </li>
            <li>a nickel to quarter size squeeze will be more than adequate.</li>
            <li>I have dry, semi-curly hair and the gel works great to soften my hair and make it more manageable.</li>
            <li>I really love this gel because it is exactly right for my type of hair - fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>The quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and does fade though...</li>
            <li>and it light as air.</li>
            <li>I suggested, as I was happy and had received 75% of the order that only 25% of the purchase price be refunded.</li>
            <li>The aquage shine spray for use with a flat irons works nicely together if you need your hair to stay poker straight and beautifully glossy (i.e. for a special occasion).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this product for myself after the salon i was at put it in my hair</li>
            <li>Originally got this on the recommendation of my stylist.  </li>
            <li>Once my hair is dry and I run my fingers though it, my hair stays curly, not frizzy, and looks great.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this product works great for straightening my hair with straight iron.</li>
            <li>I use a pea sized drop on wet hair, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>As promised, a note came on Monday morning with an apology for the lack of fullness and the offer to have me keep the product as well as receive a full refund.</li>
            <li>I use it constantly with good results.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair underneath &amp; straight on top.</li>
            <li>i cannot say enough about how good this product is.</li>
            <li>As noted in other reviews, you do not need to use a great deal of this...</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>So, if I want my hair to look its best, I use the Aquage the day before, then shampoo and use only styling lotion on the following day.</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair.</li>
            <li>It is sleek and shiny, and feels wonderful and soft, not greasy like with other straightening gels.  </li>
            <li>As long as I can find it on line, I&#x27;m good.  </li>
            <li>This product works for me, it feels great not weighted down</li>
            <li>Easy to rinse out; really tames the frizz; use with a blow dryer and you will see results; will buy again.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used the product and I am sold on it!</li>
            <li>This product keeps my hair so very smooth and soft for both straightening and wearing it curly.  </li>
            <li>, I was so happy with the result - great hold and curl definition without hard strands and absolutely no frizz.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy at all and has a lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>A dime size is all you need, so worth the price.</li>
            <li>This product although, it does have a scent the smell does go away after the product is absorbed into your hair.</li>
            <li>Does really good on the frizzies - my hair is naturally very wavy and will frizz over flat anything.  </li>
            <li>This has held its own both in keeping my curly hair from frizzing when I wear it curly (along with argan oil) as well as when I flat iron it (including in a humid climate - HI, east coast summers).  </li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>It also adds the right amount of sheen without making your hair look greasy.  </li>
            <li>and it make it super smooth and soft once I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, doesn&#x27;t look greasy, and I still get good volume when I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my hair was much easier, and the results were smooth and straight</li>
            <li>Best for moderately wavy hair when blown dried straight!</li>
            <li>Typically I find a product that works pretty good, but for some reason eventually stops working as well on my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff if you have curly hair!!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, many of the local salons stopped carrying it including the salon I was going to, so I now have to order it online.</li>
            <li>This stuff does work, but I personally like my moroccan argon oil better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for four years and it provides consistent results</li>
            <li>Works great to straighten my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Much better price here than you can find locally!</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try it for free</li>
            <li>Aquage cuts the nonsense right out and leaves me with sleek straight hair.  </li>
            <li>awesome especially if you are trying to grow your hair out and dont want to get it cut, will totally prevent dry and split ends.</li>
            <li>In fact, as I have continued to use it, my hair has become more shinny, less prone to frizzes, more manageable, soft, and over all easier to style.</li>
            <li>It looked nice when I finished styling my hair, but the second I was exposed to the outside world (when it wasn&#x27;t even a super humid day)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Clean Sculpting Gel.</li>
            <li>Not be perfect at standing up to southern humidity but at least it holds the curls.</li>
            <li>This was above and beyond the expected reaction: I was happy with the product but just wondered about the large air pocket.</li>
            <li>My Styist used this and highly recommend, she&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>Super soft hair.</li>
            <li>But it wasn&#x27;t strong enough for my hair type.</li>
            <li>and I wanted my hair to be shiny and straight.  </li>
            <li>straight and doing hairs very glossy and silky</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t straight as it is said...</li>
            <li>You do not need to apply too much or it feels too think-</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this product to me, but it didn&#x27;t keep my curly hair from being very frizzy after a blow-dry.</li>
            <li>I have hair that wants to curl/wave and can tend to frizz when I try to straighten.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and have been using it for about two years now.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling much healthier.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very temperamental....</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re next door neighbor which is a hairdresser was moving out and gave them a box filled with hair goodies.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>For a person with very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, this Ultragel works alright not as well as I had hoped for straightening.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair and Aquage Straightening Ultragel working like a dream when I want to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>this product really does it&#x27;s job in protecting my hair.</li>
            <li>It gives hairs so much body and shine,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Aquage makes my hair shiny, straight and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34; so much as it smooths the texture, allowing the waves to do their thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old and when people see me from behind they think I&#x27;m just a girl because my hair looks so beautiful full, soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Just loved this product, as I mixed it with the silkening oil while my hair was wet.  </li>
            <li>This gel gives it just the right amount of hold so my hair stays curly but not stiff.</li>
            <li>this makes your hair feel so soft!!!</li>
            <li>My wavy-frizzy hair was noticably straighter, less frizy and more manageable the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>then flat iron and my hair is smooth like glass.  </li>
            <li>use to wet hair , blow or air dry &amp; then use hot iron, excellent, soft &amp; not much damage noted</li>
            <li>I have more hair then cousin itt and is super thick.</li>
            <li>but this is one item that I splurge on because I just can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Enjoyed the nice discount especially due to the low shipping fee...would recommend to others and will shop again in the future.</li>
            <li>I have found, too, that the results, oddly, are better, the day after I&#x27;ve used it and shampooed again.</li>
            <li>in my case, less is more.</li>
            <li>As I get older</li>
            <li>This gel works great during the in between months when the curls are slowly coming back.  </li>
            <li>This really makes your hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy and really controls my hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely a product worth trying.</li>
            <li>With our Florida humidity I&#x27;m normally wavy, frizzy and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>I love this gel it takes my normally wavey hair and helps me to tame it</li>
            <li>every since then i can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I just ran out of the second bottle last week, and again tried another product (because I&#x27;m cheap and didn&#x27;t want to spend $20+ on hair gel).  </li>
            <li>But it works really nicely by itself as well just applied to towel dried hair and left alone to set.</li>
            <li>I can even let my hair air dry without the \\&quot;golden retriever\\&quot; wavy look that I would normally get.</li>
            <li>makes it look like i just got back from the beach but very hydrated and shiny!</li>
            <li>This works wonders on my ultra fine, slightly curly hair.  </li>
            <li>but it is like baby hair, very fine and not that thick.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that straightens very curly hair even in high humidity.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and tends toward being a little frizzy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thick and wavy and it does not weigh it down, yet provides a good aid in blow-drying my hair straight.</li>
            <li>I recently went to a very humid city (New Orleans) and my hair remained almost as straight as it was when I just finished flat ironing it.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft and shiny too,  .</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and straigthen it everday.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding my hair gets duller with the coloring that I do, so this really puts back a youthful glow.</li>
            <li>And it arrived a day early.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading reviews from others with naturally curly hair &amp; hoped that it would tame &amp; smooth my locks.</li>
            <li>It only takes a tiny bit of these right after towel drying to tame those flyaways into a smooth do.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair smooth and silky when I dry it with a blow drier..or let it dry naturally and use a straightening iron.  </li>
            <li>But, this stuff does help because I don&#x27;t have to flat iron as much.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to use the flat iron as much.  </li>
            <li>This product works wonderfully on my long, straight, semi-frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I could not tell that this product did anything more than any other typical gel product.  </li>
            <li>or if I choose to dry my hair straight</li>
            <li>I use it on damp hair and it really smoothes out frizz, also works on dry hair.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair feeling silky and soft, not dry.  </li>
            <li>Second thing is when used on damp hair, there is absolutely no crunch, no stiff, but it is firm, kind of reminiscent of a pomade, only there is ZERO oily/greasy</li>
            <li>I wash my hair twice a week as it is very dry and colored, it really helps.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use much at once, so I expect it to last a long time!</li>
            <li>After the first bottle, I tried a couple of other products, then went back to Aquage because the others just don&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li>The box clearly didn&#x27;t have enough air packets (only one) and one of them was deflated.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because suddenly one side of my head is curly and the other side is straight.  </li>
            <li>My hair dresser uses this and it really calms down the cuticle in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have real curly frizzy hair and it calms it down.</li>
            <li>I have dry curly hair and this product makes it feel so hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>product has worked very well on my thick, fairly coarse, straight/barely wavy hair that is highly prone to frizzes.</li>
            <li>If I use this and dry it completely, my hair will last for two or three days before frizzing.  </li>
            <li>Be careful though, too much of this or too much of the other oil with it and your hair os a greasy mess.</li>

            <li> Thanks for the Awesome service.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the hair with any kind of residue and yet the hair is silky but without any gloss.</li>
            <li> Great pricing &amp; quick shipping</li>
            <li> This product has a good feel and scent and works well to smooth my hair.</li>

            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Its very light, and</li>
            <li> At around $20, it seems pricey, but I probably don&#x27;t use more than two tubes a year.</li>
            <li> but OK ... does not have side effects like others I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but the cap came cracked on the bottle since it was winter.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist introduced me to this product many years ago.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> I love Aquage products.  </li>
            <li> I love this, it works.</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair after blow drying with the product and it makes it 2x&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many others received their package like this</li>
            <li> My hairdresser convinced me to buy it, and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more Aquage.</li>
            <li> I love this straightening gel.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product before, i love it.</li>
            <li> he said he wouldnt be able to pay me in $$</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I love this product, because my hair stylist used this once to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> love it, works to straighten or to curl.</li>
            <li> I personally love this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my wavy, slightly coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely matter, and I love the product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want smooth, straight hair!</li>
            <li> , so it didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to do for me, but the product is still pretty good.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and still have beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> but it is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Be cautious if you use to much hair is lifeless and doesn&#x27;t look so good on day two or three :)</li>
            <li> Fantastic for fine, curly hair!  </li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, don&#x27;t use any more than that.  </li>
            <li> This product helps protect my hair and keeps it looking healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and fresh too.  </li>
            <li> have tried other products, but nothing else compares, Truly is the best.</li>
            <li> Easy to style as the brush glides through</li>
            <li> The best product I&#x27;ve tried, so far is the tresseme 7 day straight.</li>
            <li> What first attracted me to this product was its nice scent when my stylist used it.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, but stubborn and voluminous.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser suggested that I get this to help with getting my fine hair to get the \\&quot;just after being at the salon\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li> Wife tells me this works fine.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and it controls my fly-aways.  </li>
            <li> a nickel to quarter size squeeze will be more than adequate.</li>
            <li> I have dry, semi-curly hair and the gel works great to soften my hair and make it more manageable.</li>
            <li> I really love this gel because it is exactly right for my type of hair - fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> The quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and does fade though...</li>
            <li> and it light as air.</li>
            <li> I suggested, as I was happy and had received 75% of the order that only 25% of the purchase price be refunded.</li>
            <li> The aquage shine spray for use with a flat irons works nicely together if you need your hair to stay poker straight and beautifully glossy (i.e. for a special occasion).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product for myself after the salon i was at put it in my hair</li>
            <li> Originally got this on the recommendation of my stylist.  </li>
            <li> Once my hair is dry and I run my fingers though it, my hair stays curly, not frizzy, and looks great.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this product works great for straightening my hair with straight iron.</li>
            <li> I use a pea sized drop on wet hair, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> As promised, a note came on Monday morning with an apology for the lack of fullness and the offer to have me keep the product as well as receive a full refund.</li>
            <li> I use it constantly with good results.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair underneath &amp; straight on top.</li>
            <li> i cannot say enough about how good this product is.</li>
            <li> As noted in other reviews, you do not need to use a great deal of this...</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> So, if I want my hair to look its best, I use the Aquage the day before, then shampoo and use only styling lotion on the following day.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair.</li>
            <li> It is sleek and shiny, and feels wonderful and soft, not greasy like with other straightening gels.  </li>
            <li> As long as I can find it on line, I&#x27;m good.  </li>
            <li> This product works for me, it feels great not weighted down</li>
            <li> Easy to rinse out; really tames the frizz; use with a blow dryer and you will see results; will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used the product and I am sold on it!</li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair so very smooth and soft for both straightening and wearing it curly.  </li>
            <li> , I was so happy with the result - great hold and curl definition without hard strands and absolutely no frizz.  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy at all and has a lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> A dime size is all you need, so worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product although, it does have a scent the smell does go away after the product is absorbed into your hair.</li>
            <li> Does really good on the frizzies - my hair is naturally very wavy and will frizz over flat anything.  </li>
            <li> This has held its own both in keeping my curly hair from frizzing when I wear it curly (along with argan oil) as well as when I flat iron it (including in a humid climate - HI, east coast summers).  </li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> It also adds the right amount of sheen without making your hair look greasy.  </li>
            <li> and it make it super smooth and soft once I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, doesn&#x27;t look greasy, and I still get good volume when I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair was much easier, and the results were smooth and straight</li>
            <li> Best for moderately wavy hair when blown dried straight!</li>
            <li> Typically I find a product that works pretty good, but for some reason eventually stops working as well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff if you have curly hair!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, many of the local salons stopped carrying it including the salon I was going to, so I now have to order it online.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work, but I personally like my moroccan argon oil better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for four years and it provides consistent results</li>
            <li> Works great to straighten my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Much better price here than you can find locally!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try it for free</li>
            <li> Aquage cuts the nonsense right out and leaves me with sleek straight hair.  </li>
            <li> awesome especially if you are trying to grow your hair out and dont want to get it cut, will totally prevent dry and split ends.</li>
            <li> In fact, as I have continued to use it, my hair has become more shinny, less prone to frizzes, more manageable, soft, and over all easier to style.</li>
            <li> It looked nice when I finished styling my hair, but the second I was exposed to the outside world (when it wasn&#x27;t even a super humid day)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Clean Sculpting Gel.</li>
            <li> Not be perfect at standing up to southern humidity but at least it holds the curls.</li>
            <li> This was above and beyond the expected reaction: I was happy with the product but just wondered about the large air pocket.</li>
            <li> My Styist used this and highly recommend, she&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> Super soft hair.</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t strong enough for my hair type.</li>
            <li> and I wanted my hair to be shiny and straight.  </li>
            <li> straight and doing hairs very glossy and silky</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t straight as it is said...</li>
            <li> You do not need to apply too much or it feels too think-</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product to me, but it didn&#x27;t keep my curly hair from being very frizzy after a blow-dry.</li>
            <li> I have hair that wants to curl/wave and can tend to frizz when I try to straighten.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product and have been using it for about two years now.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling much healthier.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very temperamental....</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re next door neighbor which is a hairdresser was moving out and gave them a box filled with hair goodies.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> For a person with very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, this Ultragel works alright not as well as I had hoped for straightening.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and Aquage Straightening Ultragel working like a dream when I want to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> this product really does it&#x27;s job in protecting my hair.</li>
            <li> It gives hairs so much body and shine,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Aquage makes my hair shiny, straight and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34; so much as it smooths the texture, allowing the waves to do their thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old and when people see me from behind they think I&#x27;m just a girl because my hair looks so beautiful full, soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> Just loved this product, as I mixed it with the silkening oil while my hair was wet.  </li>
            <li> This gel gives it just the right amount of hold so my hair stays curly but not stiff.</li>
            <li> this makes your hair feel so soft!!!</li>
            <li> My wavy-frizzy hair was noticably straighter, less frizy and more manageable the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> then flat iron and my hair is smooth like glass.  </li>
            <li> use to wet hair , blow or air dry &amp; then use hot iron, excellent, soft &amp; not much damage noted</li>
            <li> I have more hair then cousin itt and is super thick.</li>
            <li> but this is one item that I splurge on because I just can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the nice discount especially due to the low shipping fee...would recommend to others and will shop again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have found, too, that the results, oddly, are better, the day after I&#x27;ve used it and shampooed again.</li>
            <li> in my case, less is more.</li>
            <li> As I get older</li>
            <li> This gel works great during the in between months when the curls are slowly coming back.  </li>
            <li> This really makes your hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy and really controls my hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely a product worth trying.</li>
            <li> With our Florida humidity I&#x27;m normally wavy, frizzy and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> I love this gel it takes my normally wavey hair and helps me to tame it</li>
            <li> every since then i can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I just ran out of the second bottle last week, and again tried another product (because I&#x27;m cheap and didn&#x27;t want to spend $20+ on hair gel).  </li>
            <li> But it works really nicely by itself as well just applied to towel dried hair and left alone to set.</li>
            <li> I can even let my hair air dry without the \\&quot;golden retriever\\&quot; wavy look that I would normally get.</li>
            <li> makes it look like i just got back from the beach but very hydrated and shiny!</li>
            <li> This works wonders on my ultra fine, slightly curly hair.  </li>
            <li> but it is like baby hair, very fine and not that thick.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that straightens very curly hair even in high humidity.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and tends toward being a little frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wavy and it does not weigh it down, yet provides a good aid in blow-drying my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I recently went to a very humid city (New Orleans) and my hair remained almost as straight as it was when I just finished flat ironing it.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair soft and shiny too,  .</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and straigthen it everday.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding my hair gets duller with the coloring that I do, so this really puts back a youthful glow.</li>
            <li> And it arrived a day early.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews from others with naturally curly hair &amp; hoped that it would tame &amp; smooth my locks.</li>
            <li> It only takes a tiny bit of these right after towel drying to tame those flyaways into a smooth do.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair smooth and silky when I dry it with a blow drier..or let it dry naturally and use a straightening iron.  </li>
            <li> But, this stuff does help because I don&#x27;t have to flat iron as much.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to use the flat iron as much.  </li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully on my long, straight, semi-frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I could not tell that this product did anything more than any other typical gel product.  </li>
            <li> or if I choose to dry my hair straight</li>
            <li> I use it on damp hair and it really smoothes out frizz, also works on dry hair.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair feeling silky and soft, not dry.  </li>
            <li> Second thing is when used on damp hair, there is absolutely no crunch, no stiff, but it is firm, kind of reminiscent of a pomade, only there is ZERO oily/greasy</li>
            <li> I wash my hair twice a week as it is very dry and colored, it really helps.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use much at once, so I expect it to last a long time!</li>
            <li> After the first bottle, I tried a couple of other products, then went back to Aquage because the others just don&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li> The box clearly didn&#x27;t have enough air packets (only one) and one of them was deflated.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because suddenly one side of my head is curly and the other side is straight.  </li>
            <li> My hair dresser uses this and it really calms down the cuticle in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have real curly frizzy hair and it calms it down.</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair and this product makes it feel so hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> product has worked very well on my thick, fairly coarse, straight/barely wavy hair that is highly prone to frizzes.</li>
            <li> If I use this and dry it completely, my hair will last for two or three days before frizzing.  </li>
            <li> Be careful though, too much of this or too much of the other oil with it and your hair os a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> and this really helps to tame the wave.</li>
            <li> Hard to find too, so thanks to amazon for carrying it!</li>
            <li> and it keeps it from getting damaged by my flat iron</li>
            <li> On My second bottle, just a lil bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Flat iron not always needed</li>
            <li> Makes flat ironing a lot easier.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long almost to my waist and its thick and wavy and frizzy (if i blowdry it) you only need a little tiny bit even if you do have alot of hair like me and it leaves it SO smooth</li>
            <li> I only have slightly curly hair if I let my hair dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> Feels thick but goes on light and let&#x27;s me straighten with a round brush and blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I wish it weren&#x27;t so pricey, but it&#x27;s one of the few that I&#x27;ve found that tames my curly hair down and still doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like it has sticky product in it which I really don&#x27;t like!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but lasts a long time -</li>
            <li> Back to the 4\\&quot; wide straightening iron and \\&quot;Spikes\\&quot; gel that costs $1.50 in grocery store hair products aisle!</li>
            <li> This includes the roots/flyaways that start to curl when my flat ironed hair gets wet from sweat.  </li>
            <li> and it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> With this product I blow dry</li>
            <li> which is dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I put a dime sized amount in my hair before I dry it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about the fact that it is called straightening gel, it just seems to hold my curls loosely.</li>
            <li> Having very thick, coarse &amp; curly hair I am always looking for new products.</li>
            <li> only a little is needed.  </li>
            <li> You only have to use a little</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> The trick is to apply it on damp to wet hair and distribute evenly.  </li>
            <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t have that wet, greasy look.</li>
            <li> I use it on wet hair after shampooing with no additional holding product.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly (not just wavy) hair that gets wildly frizzy if I put nothing in it.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how many products I have bought for my curly hair and been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have bought other hair products from salons, nothing comes close to the results I get with this product.  </li>
            <li> I will be trying other Aquage products.</li>
            <li> Not too tight, not too loose.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair and don&#x27;t want it destroyed from using the flat iron</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it in my hair like other straightening balms that weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would help the curly side behave and lay down</li>
            <li> Smooths down the fly-aways for a finished and polished look.</li>
            <li> Even in our dry climate hair remained frizzy as usual.</li>
            <li> I think they are intended for thick frizzy hair, because they completely weigh my hair down and make it look dull.  </li>
            <li> ... wish it were sold for a bit less.</li>
            <li> The price here is about 30% less than the salon.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the bottle was not full - it was about 75% - and sent the seller a note and photo of the packaging and product.</li>
            <li> Im Caucasian with long thick semi course hair....</li>
            <li> I am on a tight budget</li>
            <li> \\&quot;A little dab&#x27;ll do ya.\\</li>
            <li> it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> It also adds a little volume to my hair.  </li>
            <li> It also makes my hair feel gooey and heavy.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy build up.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Also does not have a heavy scent, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> This product had very little hold leaving my curls a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> My hair is relatively medium and tends to be frizzy with random little waves by my ears that I could never master before this straightening gel.</li>
            <li> It also left my hair feeling gooey and oily which is VERY weird considering that my hair is generally dry.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, tight, frizzy curls that I chemically straighten twice a year.</li>
            <li> I found that I was using so many products to deal with the curls and frizz that my hair felt awful.</li>
            <li> But when my hairstylist used it combined with a small bit of styling oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that something this expensive doesn&#x27;t even work as well as a cheap gel I can buy at the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Is hard finding a product that doesn&#x27;t add weight  and yet straighten.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly (some might say frizzy) hair</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair that reacts TERRIBLY to humidity</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s just too bad it can only be purchased through high-end salons or online --</li>
            <li> I have the bad Asian hair....slightly wavy and frizzy.....  </li>
            <li> my hair reacted as it always does... not good.</li>
            <li> It is especially difficult to keep my hair straight in the summer and after swimming.</li>
            <li> However after receiving it i opened the package and the bottle was broken and leaking.</li>
            <li> I wish she would have just told me to buy an expensive hair straightener instead.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser always uses this on my hair and it was expensive to purchase at the salon.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel dirty and didn&#x27;t help with the frizzies.</li>
            <li> Again, disappointment.</li>
            <li> Crazy about the fragrance though.</li>
            <li> In an attempt to get a salon finish to my impossibly cowlicked hair, I bought some and didn&#x27;t like it until I learned how to use it.</li>
            <li> (swells, puffs, frizzes and bad wavy)</li>
            <li> Impossible to style!</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Like you you just got out of the shower, not all oily and nasty smelling.</li>
            <li> This is why this product deserves one star for its horrible packaging.</li>
            <li> NASTY stuff.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair looking and feeling disgusting</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Having very thick, coarse &amp; curly hair I am always looking for new products. The Aquage line is amazing. Definitely a product worth trying. Great pricing &amp; quick shipping</li>
            <li> Makes your hair look amazing.  I&#x27;m old and when people see me from behind they think I&#x27;m just a girl because my hair looks so beautiful full, soft and silky.  Use it, it  works!</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t strong enough for my hair type. Perhaps for others... I&#x27;m of Sicilian descent, and I got my grandmothers curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would recommend this product to others. The quality is fantastic. I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now, as just a leave in smoothing/conditioner (and not straightening with it) and my hair feels nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things that are impressive about this product is the smell, which is clean and light! Like you you just got out of the shower, not all oily and nasty smelling. The smell is light and does fade though... Second thing is when used on damp hair, there is absolutely no crunch, no stiff, but it is firm, kind of reminiscent of a pomade, only there is ZERO oily/greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so it didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to do for me, but the product is still pretty good. I might try others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a type 2 - 3 hair. My hair is fine, but stubborn and voluminous.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! use to wet hair , blow or air dry &amp; then use hot iron, excellent, soft &amp; not much damage noted</li>
            <li> My hair dresser suggested that I get this to help with getting my fine hair to get the \\&quot;just after being at the salon\\&quot; look.  I wish she would have just told me to buy an expensive hair straightener instead.  I was having frizzy fly aways and I wanted my hair to be shiny and straight.  This product makes my hair feel dirty and didn&#x27;t help with the frizzies.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! straight and doing hairs very glossy and silky</li>
            <li> This is the only product that straightens very curly hair even in high humidity. I have tried many products and this one is the best for me.  It leaves hair soft and shiny too,  .</li>
            <li> I really love this gel because it is exactly right for my type of hair - fine curly hair. I have really curly hair but it is like baby hair, very fine and not that thick. This gel gives it just the right amount of hold so my hair stays curly but not stiff. Once my hair is dry and I run my fingers though it, my hair stays curly, not frizzy, and looks great. I highly recommend this stuff if you have curly hair!! Don&#x27;t worry about the fact that it is called straightening gel, it just seems to hold my curls loosely. Not too tight, not too loose.</li>
            <li> What first attracted me to this product was its nice scent when my stylist used it. In an attempt to get a salon finish to my impossibly cowlicked hair, I bought some and didn&#x27;t like it until I learned how to use it. Now, after consulting with my stylist, before blow-drying I use Paul Mitchell styling lotion closer to the roots and Aquage straightening gel only on the tips of my hair (it seems fussy to do, but you get used to it), and that does the trick. I have found, too, that the results, oddly, are better, the day after I&#x27;ve used it and shampooed again. So, if I want my hair to look its best, I use the Aquage the day before, then shampoo and use only styling lotion on the following day. At around $20, it seems pricey, but I probably don&#x27;t use more than two tubes a year. \\&quot;A little dab&#x27;ll do ya.\\&quot; It&#x27;s just too bad it can only be purchased through high-end salons or online -- no discounts I can find.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and within 2 days I had it on my mailbox. Thanks for the Awesome service. Will use you again. The price is right too.</li>
            <li> This product has a good feel and scent and works well to smooth my hair. I don&#x27;t need to use much at once, so I expect it to last a long time!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t straight as it is said... but OK ... does not have side effects like others I&#x27;ve bought gave me some dandruff...</li>
            <li> Im Caucasian with long thick semi course hair.... When air dryed my hair is fuzzy and wavy.  With this product I blow dry then flat iron and my hair is smooth like glass.  Be cautious if you use to much hair is lifeless and doesn&#x27;t look so good on day two or three :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but the cap came cracked on the bottle since it was winter. Didn&#x27;t feel like waiting another week for it to come and deal with the returning part of it, but works great</li>
            <li> I have \\&quot;Jewish,\\&quot; frizzy hair and have tried dozens of anti-friz products over the years and none, including this one worked even though it was $24, others were $10-15. Even in our dry climate hair remained frizzy as usual. Don&#x27;t spend the $ on it.  Back to the 4\\&quot; wide straightening iron and \\&quot;Spikes\\&quot; gel that costs $1.50 in grocery store hair products aisle!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser gave me a sample to use and I wish I had tried it sooner.  My wavy-frizzy hair was noticably straighter, less frizy and more manageable the first time I used it.  You do not need to apply too much or it feels too think- only a little is needed.  Love it.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist introduced me to this product many years ago. Unfortunately, many of the local salons stopped carrying it including the salon I was going to, so I now have to order it online. I have dry, semi-curly hair and the gel works great to soften my hair and make it more manageable. It even adds shine.</li>
            <li> works good on curly hair to straighten when blow drying</li>
            <li> this makes your hair feel so soft!!! and especially when in chlorine, it doesnt make your hair feel straw like, and prevents damage. awesome especially if you are trying to grow your hair out and dont want to get it cut, will totally prevent dry and split ends.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product to me, but it didn&#x27;t keep my curly hair from being very frizzy after a blow-dry. It also makes my hair feel gooey and heavy. Don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this gel! I have naturally wavy, hard to manage hair. It is especially difficult to keep my hair straight in the summer and after swimming. With Aquage, these problems have been cured! I can even let my hair air dry without the \\&quot;golden retriever\\&quot; wavy look that I would normally get. I tried this product based on reviews and now I can write my own for how much I LOVE this gel! My hair has never been softer, straighter, and sleeker. THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> Great. Love this product</li>
            <li> I love Aquage products.  I have naturally curly hair and straigthen it everday.  This product helps protect my hair and keeps it looking healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this, it works. It leaves my hair feeling sleek and hydrated.  I straighten my hair after blow drying with the product and it makes it 2x&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used the product and I am sold on it!</li>
            <li> This stuff does work, but I personally like my moroccan argon oil better.  It straightens my hair and leaves it softer than this gel does.  But, this stuff does help because I don&#x27;t have to flat iron as much.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have hair that wants to curl/wave and can tend to frizz when I try to straighten.  Aquage cuts the nonsense right out and leaves me with sleek straight hair.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but when straight is what I want, Aquage is what I use.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair so very smooth and soft for both straightening and wearing it curly.  It also adds the right amount of sheen without making your hair look greasy.  The trick is to apply it on damp to wet hair and distribute evenly.  I&#x27;ve been using it for four years and it provides consistent results be it humid or arid climate conditions.  As I get older I&#x27;m finding my hair gets duller with the coloring that I do, so this really puts back a youthful glow.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and have been using it for about two years now.  I wish it weren&#x27;t so pricey, but it&#x27;s one of the few that I&#x27;ve found that tames my curly hair down and still doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like it has sticky product in it which I really don&#x27;t like!  It smells nice and fresh too.  Like I mentioned, the only problem is the cost... wish it were sold for a bit less.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product for myself after the salon i was at put it in my hair and i loved it. However after receiving it i opened the package and the bottle was broken and leaking. The box clearly didn&#x27;t have enough air packets (only one) and one of them was deflated. This is why this product deserves one star for its horrible packaging. I don&#x27;t know how many others received their package like this but i&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just loved this product, as I mixed it with the silkening oil while my hair was wet.  Blow drying and styling my hair was much easier, and the results were smooth and straight</li>
            <li> My hair dresser uses this and it really calms down the cuticle in my hair. It is not heavy at all and has a lovely fragrance. I wash my hair twice a week as it is very dry and colored, it really helps.</li>
            <li> My Styist used this and highly recommend, she&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s a great product. I have the bad Asian hair....slightly wavy and frizzy.....  This product works for me, it feels great not weighted down and I like blow drying my hair now. Easy to style as the brush glides through and it light as air. A dime size is all you need, so worth the price. Hard to find too, so thanks to amazon for carrying it!</li>
            <li> Easy to rinse out; really tames the frizz; use with a blow dryer and you will see results; will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair and this product makes it feel so hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hair stylist.  It is a great product.  Leaves your hair feeling much healthier.  Feels like silk.</li>
            <li> Like this product. Use as a gel for curly hair also. Super soft hair.</li>
            <li> Typically I find a product that works pretty good, but for some reason eventually stops working as well on my hair. Whether my hair gets \\&quot;used to\\&quot; the product or the company changes it&#x27;s formula, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;This product has worked very well on my thick, fairly coarse, straight/barely wavy hair that is highly prone to frizzes. It is still working after about 9 months of use. In fact, as I have continued to use it, my hair has become more shinny, less prone to frizzes, more manageable, soft, and over all easier to style. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, doesn&#x27;t look greasy, and I still get good volume when I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Update: 4-21-2014)&lt;br /&gt;Still works great. I also wanted to let others know that this is not the only product I use to control frizzes. I&#x27;ve used the same regimen for over a year now. The shampoo, conditioner, and semi permanent hair coloring that I use is by Ion. The shampoo and conditioner is Ion Keratin Smoothing. This regimen has been the key to my frizz-less life.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair. My stylist recommended this gel because I wanted to straighten my hair on occasion without damaging it. It works great!!! I put it on in sections as I blow out my hair and it keeps it from getting damaged by my flat iron and it make it super smooth and soft once I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully on my long, straight, semi-frizzy hair.  It is sleek and shiny, and feels wonderful and soft, not greasy like with other straightening gels.  I am on a tight budget but this is one item that I splurge on because I just can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I have to add my two bits to the reviews for Aquage straightening ultragel.  My hair is fine and tends toward being a little frizzy.  My hairdresser convinced me to buy it, and I LOVE it.  After the first bottle, I tried a couple of other products, then went back to Aquage because the others just don&#x27;t compare.  I think they are intended for thick frizzy hair, because they completely weigh my hair down and make it look dull.  I just ran out of the second bottle last week, and again tried another product (because I&#x27;m cheap and didn&#x27;t want to spend $20+ on hair gel).  Again, disappointment. I&#x27;m buying more Aquage. It&#x27;s pricey, but lasts a long time - I use a pea sized drop on wet hair, and it works great.  If you have fine hair, don&#x27;t use any more than that.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This really makes your hair soft and shiny.  It is not heavy and really controls my hair.</li>
            <li> On My second bottle, just a lil bit goes a long way. Hair doesn&#x27;t have that wet, greasy look.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair that reacts TERRIBLY to humidity (swells, puffs, frizzes and bad wavy), I&#x27;ve tried a lot of straightening products, but this one did nothing for my hair. It looked nice when I finished styling my hair, but the second I was exposed to the outside world (when it wasn&#x27;t even a super humid day) my hair reacted as it always does... not good. The best product I&#x27;ve tried, so far is the tresseme 7 day straight. I recently went to a very humid city (New Orleans) and my hair remained almost as straight as it was when I just finished flat ironing it. This product just didn&#x27;t work on my type of hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly (some might say frizzy) hair and this really helps to tame the wave. As noted in other reviews, you do not need to use a great deal of this... a nickel to quarter size squeeze will be more than adequate. I have tried a very large variety of taming/controlling products and this works wonderfully well.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was excellent - shipped in a bubble envelope with the product cap secured with packing tape. The was no leakage whatsoever. And it arrived a day early. I noticed that the bottle was not full - it was about 75% - and sent the seller a note and photo of the packaging and product. I received a prompt response (and this was over a weekend) with a promise to follow up on Monday when the seller&#x27;s business was open. As promised, a note came on Monday morning with an apology for the lack of fullness and the offer to have me keep the product as well as receive a full refund. This was above and beyond the expected reaction: I was happy with the product but just wondered about the large air pocket. I suggested, as I was happy and had received 75% of the order that only 25% of the purchase price be refunded. Done deal. I received the refund notice within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again and I would definitely recommend the seller.</li>
            <li> Wife tells me this works fine.  She is not supper happy with the sent but it works well enough that that she can get over that.</li>
            <li> My hair is very temperamental....never know what&#x27;s going to work for it, but 9 times out of ten, it responds well to this gel. Soothes my hair out, lessens frizz, and adds shine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  No issues.  Lower cost than in the store.</li>
            <li> So glad Amazon carries this product!!  My hairdresser always uses this on my hair and it was expensive to purchase at the salon.  Great price here.  This product is light and smells great!  I use it each time I wash my hair..which is dry and frizzy.  This product makes my hair smooth and silky when I dry it with a blow drier..or let it dry naturally and use a straightening iron.  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how many products I have bought for my curly hair and been disappointed.  This product does not straighten your hair, but it defines the curls and gets rid of the frizz.  I found that I was using so many products to deal with the curls and frizz that my hair felt awful. Y the end of one day.  I tried using just this and am very happy with the results and the feel of the product and my hair</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years. Would not use anything else. Beauty operators are amazed by it, always want to know where I get it.</li>
            <li> I use it constantly with good results.  Hair doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the nice discount especially due to the low shipping fee...would recommend to others and will shop again in the future.</li>
            <li> Feels thick but goes on light and let&#x27;s me straighten with a round brush and blow dryer. Flat iron not always needed</li>
            <li> Fantastic for fine, curly hair!  What a find and I wouldn&#x27;t have known because it says &amp;#34;straightening gel&amp;#34; on it.  But when my hairstylist used it combined with a small bit of styling oil (Joico K-Pak), I was so happy with the result - great hold and curl definition without hard strands and absolutely no frizz.  This stuff works and smells great!</li>
            <li> I have really thick, tight, frizzy curls that I chemically straighten twice a year. This gel works great during the in between months when the curls are slowly coming back.  Makes flat ironing a lot easier.</li>
            <li> I love this straightening gel.  I have thick, curly (not just wavy) hair that gets wildly frizzy if I put nothing in it.  This has held its own both in keeping my curly hair from frizzing when I wear it curly (along with argan oil) as well as when I flat iron it (including in a humid climate - HI, east coast summers).  This includes the roots/flyaways that start to curl when my flat ironed hair gets wet from sweat.  Doesn&#x27;t happen with this stuff!  Its very light, and I don&#x27;t feel it in my hair like other straightening balms that weigh my hair down.  The aquage shine spray for use with a flat irons works nicely together if you need your hair to stay poker straight and beautifully glossy (i.e. for a special occasion).</li>
            <li> I have curly hair underneath &amp; straight on top. Impossible to style! This Straightening gel works great &amp; smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have bought other hair products from salons, nothing comes close to the results I get with this product.  Love the shine!</li>
            <li> So happy, best product ever for curly hair to straight</li>
            <li> This is a very good product - does well in humidity</li>
            <li> Love this product! Makes my hair manageable! I have real curly frizzy hair and it calms it down. You only have to use a little and it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before, i love it. I have unruly curly frizzy hair and this does wonders when straightening.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that tames my hair!</li>
            <li> I only have slightly curly hair if I let my hair dry naturally.  But I use this product to control fly-aways and especially humid days when our hair is everywhere.  This product feels like a liquid silk and makes your hair feel silky.  I use it to manage my hair and to get that great feel it gives your hair.  Use sparingly and massage into scalp.  I am 51 years old and still have beautiful hair. Must have and try</li>
            <li> Did not straighten it made it curly. Wish I could send this stuff back. NASTY stuff.</li>
            <li> I came across this product last summer when my boyfriends brother asked me to babysit for him he said he wouldnt be able to pay me in $$ but he had something to compensate me with. They&#x27;re next door neighbor which is a hairdresser was moving out and gave them a box filled with hair goodies. When he came home he took the box out and made me pick out whatever i wanted from shampoos to conditioners and THE AQUAGE GEL. every since then i can&#x27;t live without it. I was lucky enough to try it for free it is a little pricey but it is worth every penny!! My hair is very long almost to my waist and its thick and wavy and frizzy (if i blowdry it) you only need a little tiny bit even if you do have alot of hair like me and it leaves it SO smooth you won&#x27;t want to stop playing with your hair. It&#x27;s so good you wont even have to style after hair dries makes it look like i just got back from the beach but very hydrated and shiny! ( and not greasy) i cannot say enough about how good this product is. i love it</li>
            <li> Great product and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because suddenly one side of my head is curly and the other side is straight.  I thought this would help the curly side behave and lay down but my hairdresser told me that it was designed to work on longer hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this product works great for straightening my hair with straight iron. I also use it when I wear my hair curly as a anti frizz gel and it helps with fly-aways.It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is Obsolutely amazing and works wonders for me! I have more hair then cousin itt and is super thick. Is hard finding a product that doesn&#x27;t add weight  and yet straighten. This product although, it does have a scent the smell does go away after the product is absorbed into your hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave the hair with any kind of residue and yet the hair is silky but without any gloss. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This works wonders on my ultra fine, slightly curly hair.  Without help, my hair flies all over the place.  Especially in winter!  It only takes a tiny bit of these right after towel drying to tame those flyaways into a smooth do.</li>
            <li> For a person with very curly hair. I love this product, because my hair stylist used this once to straighten my hair and it didn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy build up. It smells fresh and clean. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used to get this in my salon, but they stopped carrying it.  I love it. Can&#x27;t live without it. As long as I can find it on line, I&#x27;m good.  I put a dime sized amount in my hair before I dry it. Not too heavy. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair too frizzy. Styles just as I want it to. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> The best gel I have used ever. Not greasy but shiny and leave my hair glowing.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Keeps my hair from frizzing..</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want smooth, straight hair! Best for moderately wavy hair when blown dried straight!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, this Ultragel works alright not as well as I had hoped for straightening. But it works really nicely by itself as well just applied to towel dried hair and left alone to set. Smells great for a hair gel.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Great service!</li>
            <li> Just use a nickel-sized dab before blow drying. Smooths down the fly-aways for a finished and polished look. I&#x27;ve used Aquage for three years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years... i am almost 50 and it helps keep the frizzies away big time</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and Aquage Straightening Ultragel working like a dream when I want to straighten my hair.  The gel helps straighten my hair when I&#x27;m using  the hair dryer so I don&#x27;t have to use the flat iron as much.  It also leaves my hair feeling silky and soft, not dry.  Best hair straightening product I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> This Hair product is Awesome I have very long thick hair and don&#x27;t want it destroyed from using the flat iron this product really does it&#x27;s job in protecting my hair. I would tell anyone about this Product it&#x27;s very worth the money.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair looking and feeling disgusting</li>
            <li> This is a great product for smoothing/straightening curly or wavy hair. The price here is about 30% less than the salon.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and it controls my fly-aways.  It also adds a little volume to my hair.  You will need to experiment with the amount of product you use...in my case, less is more.</li>
            <li> Magic!!!the best product ever for frizzy hair!!!!!!! love it, works to straighten or to curl. It gives hairs so much body and shine,&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products, but nothing else compares, Truly is the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews from others with naturally curly hair &amp; hoped that it would tame &amp; smooth my locks. This product had very little hold leaving my curls a frizzy mess. It also left my hair feeling gooey and oily which is VERY weird considering that my hair is generally dry. I&#x27;m disappointed that something this expensive doesn&#x27;t even work as well as a cheap gel I can buy at the supermarket. I&#x27;m going back to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Clean Sculpting Gel. It may. Not be perfect at standing up to southern humidity but at least it holds the curls.</li>
            <li> I love this gel it takes my normally wavey hair and helps me to tame it or if I choose to dry my hair straight I can do it with ease!</li>
            <li> I have fairly wavy hair I could not tell that this product did anything more than any other typical gel product.  Crazy about the fragrance though.</li>
            <li> Originally got this on the recommendation of my stylist.  Does really good on the frizzies - my hair is naturally very wavy and will frizz over flat anything.  If I use this and dry it completely, my hair will last for two or three days before frizzing.  I consider that a win.,  Also does not have a heavy scent, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> I personally love this product. My hair stylist used it on me once and I have been hooked ever since. My hair is relatively medium and tends to be frizzy with random little waves by my ears that I could never master before this straightening gel. I get out of the shower and run about a nickel sized drop through my hair (my hair reaches mid back) and brush it out. Sometimes I still have a bit of frizz that I take care of with the tiniest amount of any silkening oil like biosilk or after party. Be careful though, too much of this or too much of the other oil with it and your hair os a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> This product helps to seal the hair cuticle to help in straightening the hair.  My hair is thick and wavy and it does not weigh it down, yet provides a good aid in blow-drying my hair straight.</li>
            <li> makes my hair shine and great straightener.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> With our Florida humidity I&#x27;m normally wavy, frizzy and unmanageable.  Aquage makes my hair shiny, straight and manageable.  I will be trying other Aquage products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product daily for about 11 years and I love using it for straightening my hair; it&#x27;s not greasy and it keeps my hair nice and hydrated every day</li>
            <li> Perfect for my wavy, slightly coarse hair. Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34; so much as it smooths the texture, allowing the waves to do their thing. Eliminates frizz and adds bounce and shine. I use it on wet hair after shampooing with no additional holding product.</li>
            <li> Works great to straighten my thick hair.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff! Much better price here than you can find locally!</li>
            <li> works great! I use it on damp hair and it really smoothes out frizz, also works on dry hair.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely matter, and I love the product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my fine hair .  It helps keep the style in place and holds up well throughout the day.</li>
