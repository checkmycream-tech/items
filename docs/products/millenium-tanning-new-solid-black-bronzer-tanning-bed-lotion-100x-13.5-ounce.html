            <li>HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Millennium products have always been a favorite of mine as they never streak, they do the job and the fragrance is always great!</li>
            <li>Great works good..</li>
            <li>The lotion has a pleasant fragrance and leaves a gorgeous gold tan.  </li>
            <li>Great tanning lotion, with an amazing smell</li>
            <li>I loved the price</li>
            <li>good luck...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m normally fair skinned.</li>
            <li>It smells really good</li>
            <li>so I guess a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>It works good.  </li>
            <li>but it is good, even for a man.  </li>
            <li>I started off with Jwoww and it worked fairly well but wasn&#x27;t giving me the tan</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion, and on top of that it has a great smell too!</li>
            <li>Im an experienced tanner and have tried many lotions.</li>
            <li>Used it today for the first time and got AWESOME color!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love the results!</li>
            <li>Love these types of gifts and always seem to give them to others!</li>
            <li>and I liked it 100% better!</li>
            <li>with 100x accelerator on the bottle i was expecting something amazing.</li>
            <li>amazing</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this kind again.</li>
            <li>Nice try though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now and it gave me a nice bronze color as opposed to orange.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything spectacular for me.  </li>
            <li>It will stain your hands if you don&#x27;t wash them good after applying but most bronzing lotions will.</li>
            <li>so I use it often and it has given me a nice bronze glow.  </li>
            <li>It gave me a nice color but the orange tint was there</li>
            <li>If you want a great color, a great moisturizer, a wonderful bronzer that leaves you a nice golden brown without streaking, then THIS IS DEFINITELY FOR YOU!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Smells great, no bad after tan smell.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for a super price.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion is just ok, I was already kind of tan when I got it</li>
            <li>So far this one has been the best.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>This is the top of their auto darkening line.</li>
            <li>sure you&#x27;ll get tan</li>
            <li>and it does work better than going into the bed without accelerator, but there&#x27;s so many better options on the market.</li>
            <li>i kinda think it leaves a more orange tan than a bronze tan.</li>
            <li>5 STARS BABY :)</li>
            <li>and i tryed it lastnight when i went tanning and its awsome!i love</li>
            <li>After my tan was started it did much better</li>
            <li>Definitely the best bronzer I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>and it keeps getting better after every use.  </li>
            <li>I am sooo glad I did.</li>
            <li>I LOVE them.</li>
            <li>This is an okay lotion</li>
            <li>Looks tan and if applied evenly like anything with bronzers youll be streak free!</li>
            <li>I love the results I received from this tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is an excellent price for the big size too!  </li>
            <li>I love to tan</li>
            <li>it will streak if not blended well and make sure to wash your hands after application to avoid discolored palms.</li>
            <li>So glad i made the purchase.</li>
            <li>Just like what Ive bought for alot more at tanning centers..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve NEVER tanned, I&#x27;m either white or burnt, with this product I have an awesome tan and</li>
            <li>This stuff has way too many bronzers for you to be able to tan evenly.</li>
            <li>SO I WONT BE BUYING FROM THE SALON ANY MORE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of an orange than brown color.</li>
            <li>but with this one I am a nice golden brown!</li>
            <li>Lotion goes on silky smooth and smells nice, best of all, no after itching or dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Ok, So ...I tan easily...</li>
            <li>I enjoy bronzing lotions more than tingle lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is safe and secure website.</li>
            <li>I tan fairly easily</li>
            <li>I am an easy tanner</li>
            <li>Unable to get at my salon and was happy to see that I could still get this wonderful bronzer.</li>
            <li>glad i did not pay full salon price for this stuff.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Black Storm\\&quot; and \\&quot;Paint it Black\\&quot; are also some of their best auto darkeners!</li>
            <li>so I like to see results quickly!  </li>
            <li>I would NOT recommend this for very fair or pink skin tones than cannot pull off a bronze look because it may look somewhat orange/fake.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product several times and hasn&#x27;t experienced a problem until today.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough great things about it.</li>
            <li>Feels silky smooth and helps you darken...</li>
            <li>Smell is fair but the bronzers are a MAJOR</li>
            <li>But the overall color is amazing!</li>
            <li>In fact, I had gotten excited because after my spray tan faded</li>
            <li>the price point for this is amazing and it works really well too, especially in a high pressure bed.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different tanning lotions and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>it designer skin, which is alot more money, but you really do get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i already have a good tan going on back, stomach and legs..</li>
            <li>Personally I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad, but you might not like to sit around afterwards without showering.</li>
            <li>I took a chance on getting this since it was new for 2011 instead of getting the more costly lotion i got last year which was good as well.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice an after tanning smell and am able to go run errands right after tanning without worrying about stinking.  </li>
            <li>This is great for people who are already dark.</li>
            <li>For the first time ever in my life!  </li>
            <li>It gave me a nice dark, rich tan in no time !  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Smile</li>
            <li>and I gave it away when the bottle was still pretty full.</li>
            <li>This will give you that golden tan you are looking for.</li>
            <li>For the price i would say it is worth a try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to compare it with Designer Skin&#x27;s \\&quot;Smile</li>
            <li>Certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li>This came through the mail pretty quick.</li>
            <li>You have to find the right site to order from, as always Amazon.com was the site that had it the cheapest.   </li>
            <li>The main attraction for me was the price and the bronzers but an added bonus was when my skin felt smooth and moisturized after tanning.      </li>
            <li>black 100x bronzer over all i was pleased i love the smell</li>
            <li>Cause i tryed the dark night tanning lotion with 60x bronzers and i loved it</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;after\\&quot; smell was good till about 3 hours later the old stink came out.</li>
            <li>and it really does darken you up pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Solid Black tanning lotion by millenium is awesome, it works very well and gives you the summer tan you have always wanted.</li>
            <li>it was definitely just okay.</li>
            <li>I used this tanning lotion for the first time today and at first I was like it was not working.</li>
            <li>I tan a lot and through the years I have tried many different lotions.</li>
            <li>i used this for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li>, You&#x27;re Dark\\&quot; and see which works better and probably stick with that one, but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again,</li>
            <li>but I get a really greak bronze with it!</li>
            <li>really works!</li>
            <li>I am an avid tanner and I have used plenty of lotions</li>
            <li>I overdid it my first week going in the bed for 15 minutes</li>
            <li>As far as my skin type goes, I&#x27;m white, but I don&#x27;t burn too easily, nor do I tan too easily either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of tanning lotions and Solid Black has been the best by far.</li>
            <li>Avid tanner who takes finding the perfect lotion very seriously!  </li>
            <li>It has given me the exact results I was looking for, a nice dark even tan.  </li>
            <li>It works as good or better than the expensive tanning lotions sold at my tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to my other stuff where I see great results.</li>
            <li>I am one that can get dark, just not the nice brown (as I am fair),BUT</li>
            <li>It gives you a beautiful bronze tan even on the lower level beds after only a few visits.</li>
            <li>good scent and long lasting</li>
            <li>No orange tint, pure bonze.</li>
            <li>Millenium Tanning New Solid Black Tanning Bronzer 100x is the best tanning product I have found yet by far.</li>
            <li>Solid Black works great.</li>
            <li>I go the tanning bed towards the end of winter every year to get ready for the spring.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li>Every inch of me is sooooo much darker than before tanning.</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t need to use lotion</li>
            <li>very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this lotion for moderate-experienced tanners!</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t do a whole lot.</li>
            <li>I have been very please with this tanning product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try Ed Hardy&#x27;s Jet Setter next as that works for my daughter but for now, this product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I really like how it makes my skin feel after tanning</li>
            <li>For any new tanner I&#x27;d highly recommendthis lotion!!</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;ll work better for other skin types.</li>
            <li>Nice, natural dark tan...nice smell, not as overpowering as some I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>and I was primarily interested in the level of bronzing action this lotion advertised.  </li>
            <li>It says 100x bronzer, well if you multiply by zero, then it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I love the bronzer in it and it makes look darker than any other lotion that I&#x27;ve used before!</li>
            <li>Now that I am getting older</li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ve used lotions with high bronzers but never had it look like i just got a spray tan...</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion it will get you dark real fast!!</li>
            <li>just wish this one smelled little better</li>
            <li>As far as tanning goes, I don&#x27;t see much of a bronzing effect.</li>
            <li>I used this product a few times just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t something else, but it was definately this product that was making me orange and blotchy.</li>
            <li>I am a blond man with a normal tanning ability.  </li>
            <li>and it gives me such a golden look.</li>
            <li>About every  6 months, I go searching for the new \\&quot;best\\&quot; and this one is it as of December 2010..</li>
            <li>Its a little too strong afterwards too.  </li>
            <li>The only down side is that you must make sure to rub the lotion in well before tanning or it will leave some spots darker than others.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the results of Solid Black.  </li>
            <li>I have not had an issue with the bronzer leaving dark stains on my palms or between my fingers, but then I use the towel provided and spray some of the bed cleaner on it and wipe my hands clean before hopping into the bed.</li>
            <li>I have tried other lotions and previously Black Storm, but this Solid Black is awesome!  </li>
            <li>, you still kinda smell like the tanning bed, but i haven&#x27;t got burnt using this lotion and usually ill get a little burn when using lotion, so i was very happy about that.</li>
            <li>bronzer sounds a little scary but this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>You can pretty much go anywhere and not be noticed for going tanning (except that dark Brazilian tan you just got).</li>
            <li>This lotion does work well as far</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>well, leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>Last a long time and give me a nice dark tan.</li>
            <li>and I felt so white, but I used this and my color came right back.  </li>
            <li>The scent is exotic but not overwhelming!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you want dark brown, not fake orange.  </li>
            <li>Also Solid Black left my skin silky and smooth but not greasy!</li>
            <li>I already have a great base tan, but after using it once I am so much darker!</li>
            <li>I started tanning with a friend, who chose a \\&quot;high quality\\&quot; sample from the salon, and she was baffled at the difference in my color (especially since hers hadn&#x27;t changed).</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND, especially for the price!!</li>
            <li>The smell is not very good but for only using it a couple times the color is okay.</li>
            <li>The only difference between this time and all the others was that I went to bed still smelly from the tan where I would have normally showered.  </li>
            <li>made me super dark!</li>
            <li>Always use a rich moisturizer in between tanning sessions, for a long lasting tan, with no peeling or dry skin.</li>
            <li>but I have gotten a darker better color from the millenium products in less time and for half the price.</li>
            <li>the reviews of the tingle lotions which allegedly help with stubborn areas are promising</li>
            <li>The smell is okay, not great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m caucasian  and blonde and was pretty dark within 3 (10 minute) sessions.</li>
            <li>It gives you a fast even dark tan.</li>
            <li>This is probably the first one that I&#x27;ve disliked.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to everyone who wants a deep dark tan in a hurry.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The lotion has a pleasant fragrance and leaves a gorgeous gold tan.  </li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion, with an amazing smell</li>
            <li> I loved the price</li>
            <li> good luck...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m normally fair skinned.</li>
            <li> It smells really good</li>
            <li> so I guess a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li> It works good.  </li>
            <li> but it is good, even for a man.  </li>
            <li> I started off with Jwoww and it worked fairly well but wasn&#x27;t giving me the tan</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion, and on top of that it has a great smell too!</li>
            <li> Im an experienced tanner and have tried many lotions.</li>
            <li> Used it today for the first time and got AWESOME color!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love the results!</li>
            <li> Love these types of gifts and always seem to give them to others!</li>
            <li> and I liked it 100% better!</li>
            <li> with 100x accelerator on the bottle i was expecting something amazing.</li>
            <li> amazing</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this kind again.</li>
            <li> Nice try though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now and it gave me a nice bronze color as opposed to orange.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything spectacular for me.  </li>
            <li> It will stain your hands if you don&#x27;t wash them good after applying but most bronzing lotions will.</li>
            <li> so I use it often and it has given me a nice bronze glow.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a nice color but the orange tint was there</li>
            <li> If you want a great color, a great moisturizer, a wonderful bronzer that leaves you a nice golden brown without streaking, then THIS IS DEFINITELY FOR YOU!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Smells great, no bad after tan smell.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for a super price.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is just ok, I was already kind of tan when I got it</li>
            <li> So far this one has been the best.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> This is the top of their auto darkening line.</li>
            <li> sure you&#x27;ll get tan</li>
            <li> and it does work better than going into the bed without accelerator, but there&#x27;s so many better options on the market.</li>
            <li> i kinda think it leaves a more orange tan than a bronze tan.</li>
            <li> 5 STARS BABY :)</li>
            <li> and i tryed it lastnight when i went tanning and its awsome!i love</li>
            <li> After my tan was started it did much better</li>
            <li> Definitely the best bronzer I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> and it keeps getting better after every use.  </li>
            <li> I am sooo glad I did.</li>
            <li> I LOVE them.</li>
            <li> This is an okay lotion</li>
            <li> Looks tan and if applied evenly like anything with bronzers youll be streak free!</li>
            <li> I love the results I received from this tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> It is an excellent price for the big size too!  </li>
            <li> I love to tan</li>
            <li> it will streak if not blended well and make sure to wash your hands after application to avoid discolored palms.</li>
            <li> So glad i made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Just like what Ive bought for alot more at tanning centers..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER tanned, I&#x27;m either white or burnt, with this product I have an awesome tan and</li>
            <li> This stuff has way too many bronzers for you to be able to tan evenly.</li>
            <li> SO I WONT BE BUYING FROM THE SALON ANY MORE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of an orange than brown color.</li>
            <li> but with this one I am a nice golden brown!</li>
            <li> Lotion goes on silky smooth and smells nice, best of all, no after itching or dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Ok, So ...I tan easily...</li>
            <li> I enjoy bronzing lotions more than tingle lotion.  </li>
            <li> It is safe and secure website.</li>
            <li> I tan fairly easily</li>
            <li> I am an easy tanner</li>
            <li> Unable to get at my salon and was happy to see that I could still get this wonderful bronzer.</li>
            <li> glad i did not pay full salon price for this stuff.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Black Storm\\&quot; and \\&quot;Paint it Black\\&quot; are also some of their best auto darkeners!</li>
            <li> so I like to see results quickly!  </li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this for very fair or pink skin tones than cannot pull off a bronze look because it may look somewhat orange/fake.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product several times and hasn&#x27;t experienced a problem until today.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough great things about it.</li>
            <li> Feels silky smooth and helps you darken...</li>
            <li> Smell is fair but the bronzers are a MAJOR</li>
            <li> But the overall color is amazing!</li>
            <li> In fact, I had gotten excited because after my spray tan faded</li>
            <li> the price point for this is amazing and it works really well too, especially in a high pressure bed.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different tanning lotions and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> it designer skin, which is alot more money, but you really do get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i already have a good tan going on back, stomach and legs..</li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad, but you might not like to sit around afterwards without showering.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on getting this since it was new for 2011 instead of getting the more costly lotion i got last year which was good as well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice an after tanning smell and am able to go run errands right after tanning without worrying about stinking.  </li>
            <li> This is great for people who are already dark.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever in my life!  </li>
            <li> It gave me a nice dark, rich tan in no time !  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Smile</li>
            <li> and I gave it away when the bottle was still pretty full.</li>
            <li> This will give you that golden tan you are looking for.</li>
            <li> For the price i would say it is worth a try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to compare it with Designer Skin&#x27;s \\&quot;Smile</li>
            <li> Certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li> This came through the mail pretty quick.</li>
            <li> You have to find the right site to order from, as always Amazon.com was the site that had it the cheapest.   </li>
            <li> The main attraction for me was the price and the bronzers but an added bonus was when my skin felt smooth and moisturized after tanning.      </li>
            <li> black 100x bronzer over all i was pleased i love the smell</li>
            <li> Cause i tryed the dark night tanning lotion with 60x bronzers and i loved it</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;after\\&quot; smell was good till about 3 hours later the old stink came out.</li>
            <li> and it really does darken you up pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Solid Black tanning lotion by millenium is awesome, it works very well and gives you the summer tan you have always wanted.</li>
            <li> it was definitely just okay.</li>
            <li> I used this tanning lotion for the first time today and at first I was like it was not working.</li>
            <li> I tan a lot and through the years I have tried many different lotions.</li>
            <li> i used this for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li> , You&#x27;re Dark\\&quot; and see which works better and probably stick with that one, but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again,</li>
            <li> but I get a really greak bronze with it!</li>
            <li> really works!</li>
            <li> I am an avid tanner and I have used plenty of lotions</li>
            <li> I overdid it my first week going in the bed for 15 minutes</li>
            <li> As far as my skin type goes, I&#x27;m white, but I don&#x27;t burn too easily, nor do I tan too easily either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of tanning lotions and Solid Black has been the best by far.</li>
            <li> Avid tanner who takes finding the perfect lotion very seriously!  </li>
            <li> It has given me the exact results I was looking for, a nice dark even tan.  </li>
            <li> It works as good or better than the expensive tanning lotions sold at my tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to my other stuff where I see great results.</li>
            <li> I am one that can get dark, just not the nice brown (as I am fair),BUT</li>
            <li> It gives you a beautiful bronze tan even on the lower level beds after only a few visits.</li>
            <li> good scent and long lasting</li>
            <li> No orange tint, pure bonze.</li>
            <li> Millenium Tanning New Solid Black Tanning Bronzer 100x is the best tanning product I have found yet by far.</li>
            <li> Solid Black works great.</li>
            <li> I go the tanning bed towards the end of winter every year to get ready for the spring.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> Every inch of me is sooooo much darker than before tanning.</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t need to use lotion</li>
            <li> very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this lotion for moderate-experienced tanners!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do a whole lot.</li>
            <li> I have been very please with this tanning product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try Ed Hardy&#x27;s Jet Setter next as that works for my daughter but for now, this product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I really like how it makes my skin feel after tanning</li>
            <li> For any new tanner I&#x27;d highly recommendthis lotion!!</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;ll work better for other skin types.</li>
            <li> Nice, natural dark tan...nice smell, not as overpowering as some I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> and I was primarily interested in the level of bronzing action this lotion advertised.  </li>
            <li> It says 100x bronzer, well if you multiply by zero, then it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I love the bronzer in it and it makes look darker than any other lotion that I&#x27;ve used before!</li>
            <li> Now that I am getting older</li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;ve used lotions with high bronzers but never had it look like i just got a spray tan...</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion it will get you dark real fast!!</li>
            <li> just wish this one smelled little better</li>
            <li> As far as tanning goes, I don&#x27;t see much of a bronzing effect.</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t something else, but it was definately this product that was making me orange and blotchy.</li>
            <li> I am a blond man with a normal tanning ability.  </li>
            <li> and it gives me such a golden look.</li>
            <li> About every  6 months, I go searching for the new \\&quot;best\\&quot; and this one is it as of December 2010..</li>
            <li> Its a little too strong afterwards too.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that you must make sure to rub the lotion in well before tanning or it will leave some spots darker than others.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the results of Solid Black.  </li>
            <li> I have not had an issue with the bronzer leaving dark stains on my palms or between my fingers, but then I use the towel provided and spray some of the bed cleaner on it and wipe my hands clean before hopping into the bed.</li>
            <li> I have tried other lotions and previously Black Storm, but this Solid Black is awesome!  </li>
            <li> , you still kinda smell like the tanning bed, but i haven&#x27;t got burnt using this lotion and usually ill get a little burn when using lotion, so i was very happy about that.</li>
            <li> bronzer sounds a little scary but this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> You can pretty much go anywhere and not be noticed for going tanning (except that dark Brazilian tan you just got).</li>
            <li> This lotion does work well as far</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> well, leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> Last a long time and give me a nice dark tan.</li>
            <li> and I felt so white, but I used this and my color came right back.  </li>
            <li> The scent is exotic but not overwhelming!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you want dark brown, not fake orange.  </li>
            <li> Also Solid Black left my skin silky and smooth but not greasy!</li>
            <li> I already have a great base tan, but after using it once I am so much darker!</li>
            <li> I started tanning with a friend, who chose a \\&quot;high quality\\&quot; sample from the salon, and she was baffled at the difference in my color (especially since hers hadn&#x27;t changed).</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND, especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> The smell is not very good but for only using it a couple times the color is okay.</li>
            <li> The only difference between this time and all the others was that I went to bed still smelly from the tan where I would have normally showered.  </li>
            <li> made me super dark!</li>
            <li> Always use a rich moisturizer in between tanning sessions, for a long lasting tan, with no peeling or dry skin.</li>
            <li> but I have gotten a darker better color from the millenium products in less time and for half the price.</li>
            <li> the reviews of the tingle lotions which allegedly help with stubborn areas are promising</li>
            <li> The smell is okay, not great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m caucasian  and blonde and was pretty dark within 3 (10 minute) sessions.</li>
            <li> It gives you a fast even dark tan.</li>
            <li> This is probably the first one that I&#x27;ve disliked.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to everyone who wants a deep dark tan in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell how much this helped considering I&#x27;ve been switching this off and on with Swedish Beauty&#x27;s Pink Diamond, Black Storm, and Designer Skin&#x27;s Bombshell, but I&#x27;m definitely darker over the last few days, and I actually missed a couple days.  </li>
            <li> I achieved a color in less then 2 weeks that normally would take me over a month to get.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t stain as much; however you do loose the Dark tanning effect.</li>
            <li> The salon I go to has it as well as the new Black Cherry</li>
            <li> I still am dark after showering and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li> The worker got a little testy with me and exclaimed mine was probably an old expired bottle and wouldn&#x27;t work as well, if at all.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent tanner and this lotion gets me so dark after just one tan!</li>
            <li> For pro tanners, \\&quot;Insanely Black\\&quot; is great if you want both a high tingle as well as a dark tan.</li>
            <li> I am hooked and now a life long customer.</li>
            <li> this gives me the deep dark tan that I have always envied of others, I bought my 2nd bottle before I was half done with my first bottle and the price is unbelievable, shipping and product 18.00.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see any difference than any other middle of the road product.  </li>
            <li> I prefer hollywood by Ed Hardy to this, which I had tried a sample of the other day at the salon (same price range).  </li>
            <li> Last night I went back to the bed after having been on hiatus for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the newer auto darkening lotions and at 100x, is definitely a very deep, dark tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> After the 2nd time of using it in the bronzer tanning bed, i was dark.</li>
            <li> I have now tried insanely black and solid black and alternate between them</li>
            <li> Solid black goes on evenly and the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> so I did some research and decided on Solid Black.  </li>
            <li> First I have to say who ever says this is not a good product lies!  </li>
            <li> I rely on reviews heavily for my purchases and this lotion was no different.  </li>
            <li> well I have used it a few bottles now the only brand I use for tanning</li>
            <li> I take a wet towel to the beds with me and try to wipe all the places that it may stain, i.e. between fingers, around nails and toenails as well as the tender part of the arch..</li>
            <li> For years I have made fun of my daughter for \\&quot;fake baking\\&quot;....  </li>
            <li> I expected</li>
            <li> I received the lotion 2 days sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Streaked my legs &amp; arms even after carefully applying.</li>
            <li> I have been using black storm to build a nice base tan and that exceeded all my expectations</li>
            <li> The Solid Black came out less than a year ago and the Black Cherry JUST came out.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try some of the other Millenium lotions.</li>
            <li> Now i put it on every other time i go instead of every time.</li>
            <li> EVERY OTHER DAY</li>
            <li> and I have never been as dark as I now with ANY other lotion.</li>
            <li> You wanna be dark.</li>
            <li> I look so dark</li>
            <li> and I am already dark.  </li>
            <li> it got me so dark</li>
            <li> ive never gottin as dark as this lotion has gotten me</li>
            <li> not worth it.</li>
            <li> and I am DARK.</li>
            <li> I have used it about 6 times now and I am dark brown, Not Orange.  </li>
            <li> IT BLACK</li>
            <li> but I did ad half of it to an existing bottle of lotion I already had</li>
            <li> (so you aint out in public without being all smelly a shower) and go again, using the lotion each time and you seriously wont believe the difference.  </li>
            <li> and Im a little tanner now</li>
            <li> I use all the upgraded beds at the tanning salon which are usually the 15 min extreme brozing and reddening bulb beds</li>
            <li> and I must have tried every product on the market at one time or another, often using the little tester packs.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute;  got a little jealous</li>
            <li> I have noticed a little bit of streaky/blotchy areas on my hands and wrists-do to washing my hands so often after tanning.  </li>
            <li> I am also impatient</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from green web inc, which took almost 2 weeks to get.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to tan everyday when I use this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is not strong.</li>
            <li> So I would definately recommend it to people that may feel they hit a plateu this will take you past it.  </li>
            <li> but i would rather buy my usual $40 lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tanned 4 times at my usual time and saw no difference than if I used a lotion without bronzer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for something to get me past that.  </li>
            <li> You feel icky, but I always feel icky after tanning even if I don&#x27;t use a lotion.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this lotion to anyone with a decent base tan.</li>
            <li> I decoded to try tanning because I&#x27;m sick of being pasty white all summer</li>
            <li> Now, as sick as it sounds, if you can skip a shower for ONE night and go again the results are unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> This product reminded me of one of those \\&quot;fake tan\\&quot; lotions that you buy over the counter.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> It doesnt leave a fake look</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I hate laying out...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I have used this product 2x now and I am orange and have horrible lines!&lt;br /&gt; I would NOT recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I go the tanning bed towards the end of winter every year to get ready for the spring.  I tan fairly easily and if I burn it turns into a tan without peeling.  I rely on reviews heavily for my purchases and this lotion was no different.  I loved the price and I was primarily interested in the level of bronzing action this lotion advertised.  I have used the lotion for a week and I absolutely love it.  Now that I am getting older I enjoy bronzing lotions more than tingle lotion.  I am also impatient so I like to see results quickly!  The lotion has a pleasant fragrance and leaves a gorgeous gold tan.  It does not leave you orange and have found no problem with streaking whatsoever. The main attraction for me was the price and the bronzers but an added bonus was when my skin felt smooth and moisturized after tanning.      I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> excelente producto! A muy buen precio. Ecelente tiempos de entrega y sumamente responsables! De uso exclusivo para camaras de bronceado!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of this lotion. Im an experienced tanner and have tried many lotions. This is probably the first one that I&#x27;ve disliked. The smell is horrible. The bronzer leaves streaks and is orangey. \\&quot;Smile your Darker\\&quot; is the lotion I used before this one and I liked it 100% better!</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Nice, natural dark tan...nice smell, not as overpowering as some I&#x27;ve tried.  Great Price!  Great shipping!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the results of Solid Black.  It has given me the exact results I was looking for, a nice dark even tan.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product smells so awful even after you take a shower. Worst lotion that I have ever tried. I regret buying it!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is just ok, I was already kind of tan when I got it and Im a little tanner now but it was only $20 bucks. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this kind again.The smell is lite not to overpowering. I would say the tanning lotion that has gotten me the tannest it designer skin, which is alot more money, but you really do get what you pay for.  PS I ordered this product from green web inc, which took almost 2 weeks to get. The estimated time i was suppose to get this lotion I didnt get until a week after . Just saying.</li>
            <li> I just bout this lotion off ebay about a week ago and have used it about a total of 5 times. I use all the upgraded beds at the tanning salon which are usually the 15 min extreme brozing and reddening bulb beds and I have never been as dark as I now with ANY other lotion. It is FEB and I constantly keep getting complemented on how tan I am. People keep asking me where I went for vacation. I&#x27;m like lol. I just like the tanning bed. My advice. You wanna be dark. Get this lotion on Ebay for under 25.00. MSRP and in salons go for around 120.00, but get this and maybe do one to two upgrade beds a week and I am telling you, you will be DARKKKK. good luck...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tanxpert</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t something else, but it was definately this product that was making me orange and blotchy. I did not like it at all and I gave it away when the bottle was still pretty full.</li>
            <li> Millenium Tanning New Solid Black Tanning Bronzer 100x is the best tanning product I have found yet by far. Not to mention the price on Amazon.com. This lotion runs any where from 85-100 dollars in your local tanning salon. I have recommended this product and Amazon website to tanners that I no. I look forward to purchasing from Amazon in the future. It is safe and secure website. Thank You!!!!</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion, with an amazing smell</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion.  Smells great, no bad after tan smell.  This lotion will get you darker.  The scent is neutral for men and women.</li>
            <li> This is one of the newer auto darkening lotions and at 100x, is definitely a very deep, dark tanning lotion. I prefer to put it on before I go to the salon and then again before I go onto the bed. I look so dark and I&#x27;m normally fair skinned. I&#x27;ve been doing indoor sun tanning for over 15 years and I must have tried every product on the market at one time or another, often using the little tester packs. Millennium products have always been a favorite of mine as they never streak, they do the job and the fragrance is always great! This is the top of their auto darkening line. For pro tanners, \\&quot;Insanely Black\\&quot; is great if you want both a high tingle as well as a dark tan. \\&quot;Black Storm\\&quot; and \\&quot;Paint it Black\\&quot; are also some of their best auto darkeners! Always use a rich moisturizer in between tanning sessions, for a long lasting tan, with no peeling or dry skin.</li>
            <li> This came through the mail pretty quick. It smells really good and it really does darken you up pretty quick. I dont tan all the time maybe a 2-3 times a week and i got for 25mins each time, you still kinda smell like the tanning bed, but i haven&#x27;t got burnt using this lotion and usually ill get a little burn when using lotion, so i was very happy about that. Its a great product and i would recomend to anyone who enjoys tanning!</li>
            <li> with 100x accelerator on the bottle i was expecting something amazing. it was definitely just okay. sure you&#x27;ll get tan and it does work better than going into the bed without accelerator, but there&#x27;s so many better options on the market. i kinda think it leaves a more orange tan than a bronze tan. maybe it&#x27;ll work better for other skin types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion only 3 times and I am already dark.  No streaking and no orange looking areas. People who are getting streaks are not applying this correctly.  This will give you that golden tan you are looking for.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different tanning lotions and this is by far the best.  It gives you immediate color and with its auto darkening formula 100X you get darker hours after you have tanned.  I couldn&#x27;t go tanning for a week and I felt so white, but I used this and my color came right back.  So I would definately recommend it to people that may feel they hit a plateu this will take you past it.  Its only for people wanting to get the darkest possible tan.</li>
            <li> This lotion does work well as far an the tan you get but im not too into the smell.  I will deal and use the rest of the bottle but i probably wont buy this brand again.  Its a little too strong afterwards too.  For the price i would say it is worth a try but i would rather buy my usual $40 lotion then this one just because im not fond of the smell.</li>
            <li> LOVE,LOVE,LOVE this lotion! The scent is exotic but not overwhelming! Used it today for the first time and got AWESOME color! I am a redhead and very fair skinned,,most lotions turn me orange,but with this one I am a nice golden brown! Also Solid Black left my skin silky and smooth but not greasy! 5 STARS BABY :)</li>
            <li> I used this tanning lotion for the first time today and at first I was like it was not working. Then a couple hours later I was like WHOA! I was 2 to 3 shades darker !! I love this tanning lotion, and on top of that it has a great smell too! I highly recommend this lotion it will get you dark real fast!!</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion 2 times now since i bought it from Amazon. I LOVE IT! Every inch of me is sooooo much darker than before tanning. My color was noticeable after the 1st use. I started tanning with a friend, who chose a \\&quot;high quality\\&quot; sample from the salon, and she was baffled at the difference in my color (especially since hers hadn&#x27;t changed). My fianc&amp;eacute;  got a little jealous so I came back here to order another bottle. The salon I go to has it as well as the new Black Cherry and they charge over $100 for them lol. When I was asked if I needed lotion I said no I already had some and stated what I paid for it. The worker got a little testy with me and exclaimed mine was probably an old expired bottle and wouldn&#x27;t work as well, if at all. HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! The Solid Black came out less than a year ago and the Black Cherry JUST came out. Nice try though. If you want a great color, a great moisturizer, a wonderful bronzer that leaves you a nice golden brown without streaking, then THIS IS DEFINITELY FOR YOU!&lt;br /&gt;******* I have not had an issue with the bronzer leaving dark stains on my palms or between my fingers, but then I use the towel provided and spray some of the bed cleaner on it and wipe my hands clean before hopping into the bed. Just in case, this may be a helpful tip to those smarties who chose to buy this. HAPPY TANNING!</li>
            <li> Avid tanner who takes finding the perfect lotion very seriously!  About every  6 months, I go searching for the new \\&quot;best\\&quot; and this one is it as of December 2010.. Does not burn or tingle. I&#x27;m caucasian  and blonde and was pretty dark within 3 (10 minute) sessions. Leaves the best bronze I&#x27;ve ever had in 10 years! The only thing that will beat this would be a bronzer over 100X....</li>
            <li> I Just got this lotion in the mail yesterday. Cause i tryed the dark night tanning lotion with 60x bronzers and i loved it it got me so dark so i thought i would try this lotion solid black 100x bronzer over all i was pleased i love the smell and i tryed it lastnight when i went tanning and its awsome!i love it!!!!!its amazing ive never gottin as dark as this lotion has gotten me i love it!!(&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I tan a lot and through the years I have tried many different lotions. So far this one has been the best. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now and it gave me a nice bronze color as opposed to orange. The smell is not strong. And best of all it does not leave your skin feeling slimy afterwards. This is going to be my go to lotion for awhile. And the price cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> Ok, So ...I tan easily...i really don&#x27;t need to use lotion but i&#x27;m told it helps...whatever..so i purchased this one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i already have a good tan going on back, stomach and legs..just need my arms to catch up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i used this for the first time yesterday came home showered after drying off i look like an oompa loompa from willy wonka...&lt;br /&gt;between my fingers are orange...my hands, its terrible...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve used lotions with high bronzers but never had it look like i just got a spray tan...&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m providing a picture of it as well this is day 2 it has not came off yet.. im very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad i did not pay full salon price for this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I love the bronzer in it and it makes look darker than any other lotion that I&#x27;ve used before! Great lotion!!!</li>
            <li> I had problems with streaking. This product reminded me of one of those \\&quot;fake tan\\&quot; lotions that you buy over the counter.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This is great for people who are already dark. I was just starting to tan so it did streak somewhat although not orange. After my tan was started it did much better and I would recommend it to everyone who wants a deep dark tan in a hurry. The smell and the feel of the lotion is awesome!</li>
            <li> At this time, I have used this lotion for 3 tanning sessions.  I am very pleased! The 100x bronzers definitely boost my color and the color continues to develop throughout the next 24 hrs (similar to a sunless tanning lotion - but not as orange and drastic).  Smell is fair but the bronzers are a MAJOR plus! I have noticed a little bit of streaky/blotchy areas on my hands and wrists-do to washing my hands so often after tanning.  But the overall color is amazing! Definitely the best bronzer I&#x27;ve ever used and it keeps getting better after every use.  I would NOT recommend this for very fair or pink skin tones than cannot pull off a bronze look because it may look somewhat orange/fake.  I have brown hair and blue/green eyes and I tan well - It works great for me!  Highly recommend this lotion for moderate-experienced tanners!</li>
            <li> Solid Black tanning lotion by millenium is awesome, it works very well and gives you the summer tan you have always wanted. I would recommend it to everyone. The only down side is that you must make sure to rub the lotion in well before tanning or it will leave some spots darker than others.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles of this b/c of the GREAT reviews. Doesn&#x27;t do anything spectacular for me.  I am an easy tanner and I don&#x27;t see any difference than any other middle of the road product.  It was on sale...so I guess a good value for the money.  DON\\&quot;T pay over 20.00 or so for this product....not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using black storm to build a nice base tan and that exceeded all my expectations so I decided to try some of the other Millenium lotions. I am sooo glad I did. I LOVE them. I am hooked and now a life long customer. I have now tried insanely black and solid black and alternate between them and I am DARK. I achieved a color in less then 2 weeks that normally would take me over a month to get. I used to use designer skin 14 karat gold and bombshell from designer skin but I have gotten a darker better color from the millenium products in less time and for half the price. The color is not orange it is brown. I still am dark after showering and my skin is soft. Solid black goes on evenly and the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering. I really don&#x27;t notice an after tanning smell and am able to go run errands right after tanning without worrying about stinking.  It will stain your hands if you don&#x27;t wash them good after applying but most bronzing lotions will. I would recommend this lotion to anyone with a decent base tan.</li>
            <li> It works as good or better than the expensive tanning lotions sold at my tanning salon. Need a great tan use this stuff.</li>
            <li> The is stuff is awesome.  I have tried other lotions and previously Black Storm, but this Solid Black is awesome!  I have used it about 6 times now and I am dark brown, Not Orange.  It works good.  I am a blond man with a normal tanning ability.  I highly recommend it if you want dark brown, not fake orange.  I will definitely be buying another bottle when this one is gone.  Oh and by the way the smell is awesome.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe it but it is good, even for a man.  And once you are done tanning there is none of that burnt skin or lotion smell.  You can pretty much go anywhere and not be noticed for going tanning (except that dark Brazilian tan you just got).</li>
            <li> This is an okay lotion but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. The smell is okay, not great. It makes my skin soft but that&#x27;s about it. As far as tanning goes, I don&#x27;t see much of a bronzing effect. I prefer hollywood by Ed Hardy to this, which I had tried a sample of the other day at the salon (same price range).  As far as my skin type goes, I&#x27;m white, but I don&#x27;t burn too easily, nor do I tan too easily either. I was hoping this would give me some boost but it didn&#x27;t do a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good product. It says 100x bronzer, well if you multiply by zero, then it&#x27;s true. I&#x27;ve tanned 4 times at my usual time and saw no difference than if I used a lotion without bronzer. The \\&quot;after\\&quot; smell was good till about 3 hours later the old stink came out. Very disappointed. I&#x27;ll go back to my other stuff where I see great results.</li>
            <li> Love this product! This is the third bottle that I have purchased and I will definitely purchase another one. Love the results!</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times and hasn&#x27;t experienced a problem until today.  In fact, I had gotten excited because after my spray tan faded I noticed I had tanned... For the first time ever in my life!  Last night I went back to the bed after having been on hiatus for a few weeks.  I applied as I thought I always had before.  The only difference between this time and all the others was that I went to bed still smelly from the tan where I would have normally showered.  I got this morning and immediately noticed orange streaks between my fingers.  I have never noticed this problem before.  I give 3 stars because the product works, and dropped it 2 because it should come with an application warning.</li>
            <li> Loved it!! Great product I will use it again!!  Helps give a great looking tan!!  I would recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in just one use. After a week I looked like I had been tanning for months!</li>
            <li> Gave me a bit of color after one session.  Looks tan and if applied evenly like anything with bronzers youll be streak free!</li>
            <li> I love the results I received from this tanning lotion.  It gave me a nice dark, rich tan in no time !  HIGHLY RECOMMEND, especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to tan everyday when I use this product. The smell is not bad, but you might not like to sit around afterwards without showering. You feel icky, but I always feel icky after tanning even if I don&#x27;t use a lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been very please with this tanning product.  It is an excellent price for the big size too!  I love to tan so I use it often and it has given me a nice bronze glow.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell how much this helped considering I&#x27;ve been switching this off and on with Swedish Beauty&#x27;s Pink Diamond, Black Storm, and Designer Skin&#x27;s Bombshell, but I&#x27;m definitely darker over the last few days, and I actually missed a couple days.  For this price I can&#x27;t complain.  I&#x27;m going to compare it with Designer Skin&#x27;s \\&quot;Smile, You&#x27;re Dark\\&quot; and see which works better and probably stick with that one, but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again, and of course, if I do, I&#x27;ll be using A-Z Wholesale Tanning.</li>
            <li> First I have to say who ever says this is not a good product lies!  I took a chance on getting this since it was new for 2011 instead of getting the more costly lotion i got last year which was good as well. This lotion has taken over 1st place with me. After the 2nd time of using it in the bronzer tanning bed, i was dark. Now i put it on every other time i go instead of every time. I would HIGHLY recommend this product. I will be buying it again after this is gone.</li>
            <li> I know 100x bronzer sounds a little scary but this product is wonderful. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it will streak if not blended well and make sure to wash your hands after application to avoid discolored palms. If you follow those steps though this product is wonderful. It gives you a beautiful bronze tan even on the lower level beds after only a few visits. Certainly worth the price. I can&#x27;t imagine the price you would pay at a solon for a product of this quality</li>
            <li> Like it well I have used it a few bottles now the only brand I use for tanning just wish this one smelled little better</li>
            <li> This is the best. So glad i made the purchase. Can&#x27;t say enough great things about it. This is a must buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS BASED ON THE PAINT IT BLACK I PUT IT ON EVENLY LIKE YOU ARE SUPPOSE TO, THIS IS THE WORST MILLENIUM PRODUCT EVER I TAN EVERY OTHER DAY AND IN BETWEEN YOU EXFOLIATE I TURNED BLOTCHY AND SPOTTY AND I WILL NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best! No orange tint, pure bonze. I am one that can get dark, just not the nice brown (as I am fair),BUT this gives me the deep dark tan that I have always envied of others, I bought my 2nd bottle before I was half done with my first bottle and the price is unbelievable, shipping and product 18.00. You have to find the right site to order from, as always Amazon.com was the site that had it the cheapest.   Stacy</li>
            <li> I am a frequent tanner and this lotion gets me so dark after just one tan! I dont even burn with it but I get a really greak bronze with it!</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer---I have used tanning beds for years and this product does stain your skin. I take a wet towel to the beds with me and try to wipe all the places that it may stain, i.e. between fingers, around nails and toenails as well as the tender part of the arch.. I won&#x27;t buy it again....but I did ad half of it to an existing bottle of lotion I already had and it doesn&#x27;t stain as much; however you do loose the Dark tanning effect.</li>
            <li> Just like what Ive bought for alot more at tanning centers.. Feels silky smooth and helps you darken... Thank You</li>
            <li> Point Blank the price point for this is amazing and it works really well too, especially in a high pressure bed.</li>
            <li> Great works good.. A+ A+ A+ A A A a aa a a a a a aa aaaa  aaa  a</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Purchased two and both were a hit at Christmas time! Love these types of gifts and always seem to give them to others!</li>
            <li> really works! made me super dark! good scent and long lasting</li>
            <li> Solid Black works great. I already have a great base tan, but after using it once I am so much darker! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a super price. Last a long time and give me a nice dark tan.</li>
            <li> I am an avid tanner and I have used plenty of lotions but I always come back to this one.It gives you a fast even dark tan.I will NOT be straying from this lotion ever  again-It is the BEST I have used!!!</li>
            <li> For years I have made fun of my daughter for \\&quot;fake baking\\&quot;....  well, I guess I can&#x27;t do that anymore... I decoded to try tanning because I&#x27;m sick of being pasty white all summer and I hate laying out... and summer gardening only tans exposed parts of you sooooo........... now I&#x27;m a regular tanner.  I started off with Jwoww and it worked fairly well but wasn&#x27;t giving me the tan I expected so I did some research and decided on Solid Black.  I immediately noticed a difference.  I&#x27;m using the stand up booth and started at 7 minutes for a week, then 8 minutes  and so on.  I&#x27;m now at 11 minutes and the results are great.  Lotion goes on silky smooth and smells nice, best of all, no after itching or dry skin.  Now, as sick as it sounds, if you can skip a shower for ONE night and go again the results are unbelievable.  So you go tanning in the morning, stay home all day (so you aint out in public without being all smelly a shower) and go again, using the lotion each time and you seriously wont believe the difference.  I&#x27;ve NEVER tanned, I&#x27;m either white or burnt, with this product I have an awesome tan and no longer worry about looking pasty white in summer clothing.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like, and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me, the booth or the lotion is that the front of my legs, below the knee just don&#x27;t get the color like the rest of me.  I&#x27;ve been told to try the tingle lotion but after reading the reviews I have no intention of torturing myself that way.  I overdid it my first week going in the bed for 15 minutes and then the stand up for 10 the next day and itched for 2 weeks... the reviews of the tingle lotions which allegedly help with stubborn areas are promising but I simply wont burn and itch for another week.  I&#x27;m going to try Ed Hardy&#x27;s Jet Setter next as that works for my daughter but for now, this product is fantastic.  It does everything it says but now that I&#x27;ve hit a plateau I&#x27;m looking for something to get me past that.  For any new tanner I&#x27;d highly recommendthis lotion!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of tanning lotions and Solid Black has been the best by far. I would recommend it to anyone. And the seller is absolutely great also. I received the lotion 2 days sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I loved it for awhile!! It gave me a nice color but the orange tint was there and I didn&#x27;t want to look orange. The smell is not very good but for only using it a couple times the color is okay. Also a type of lotion you could keep on over night and maximize your tan the next session.</li>
            <li> I really like how it makes my skin feel after tanning and it gives me such a golden look. It doesnt leave a fake look</li>
            <li> Unable to get at my salon and was happy to see that I could still get this wonderful bronzer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is CRAP!! Streaked my legs &amp; arms even after carefully applying. This stuff has way too many bronzers for you to be able to tan evenly.</li>
            <li> DOESNT SMELL LIKE ALL THE OTHERE  THE ONES AT THE SALON ARE A MINIMYM OF 78$  AND THIS ONE WAS ONLY 12 SO I WONT BE BUYING FROM THE SALON ANY MORE</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;tans well, leaves skin soft. I would recommend it to everyone to use. It does not leave any color discoloration on you or hands.</li>
            <li> It was too runny. It stains your hands. I did not like the color it gives me. It&#x27;s more of an orange than brown color.</li>
