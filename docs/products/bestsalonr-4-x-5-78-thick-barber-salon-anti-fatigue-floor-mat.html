I needed mat fast so instead of ordering from Professional Beauty Supplier, I fell for this one which was only about $20 cheaper, and am I ever sorry. Its hardening up where chair sets already, shows every little trace where you\\&quot;ve been on it.  Would love my money back....First time I\\&quot;m disappointed with anything at Amazon</li>

            <li> Highly recommend this! Very fast delivery, awesome mat, and great service. My previous mat I purchased at a beauty and barber supply house paying nearly $200, this one is far better than my previous one.

            <li> Bought 4 mats around christmas time last year. I am very happy with these mats and so are my feet. My stylists and any one who walks on them always comments how nice they feel. There are easy to clean,just follow their directions with windex they look like new. It now almost half way though 2012 and have been very happy need to buy another one for the extra station I had to put in. Thanks</li>
            <li> but keeping them clean is impossible!  They pick up every speck of dirt and the hair sticks to them.  Foot print imprints stay, they just look dirty.  Nice mats otherwise.</li>
            <li> Great size and thickness is perfect. The chair cut out is bigger so it allows the whole chair to fit vs half on and half off. The shipping was very fast. Overall very pleased!</li>
            <li> perfect !  It looks amazing in the salon, now our feet are happy and my back is much better !</li>

            <li> You want a comfortable. Mat that is DURABLE HUGE and AFFORDABLE?  this is it. I opened my own studio and needed a mat. They are so expensive and generally too thin. This is so thick and cushy,  but not so that you trip on edges. They are beveled flat to the floor. It was shipped super fast. I was super pleased and recommend. For anyone that stands on their feet all day. No fatigue for sure!</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.  So glad we got this for the salon.  It keeps the hair color from staining the floor and it is very soft.</li>

            <li> Great quality and terrific value!!</li>
            <li> The concrete floor was killing my feet.  This product helps my standing on a hard floor a lot more comfortable.  I do like this floor mat and would tell a friend to use one.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that my hairstylist, who happens to be a relative, says that she loves the cushion and it helps her stand longer without discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is it&#x27;s not black....it&#x27;s gray.</li>
            <li> Quality mat. Arrived in great condition. Wore heels the first day with no puncture marks in the mat. Everything I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> THE LADIES OF SALON REALLY ENJOY HAVING THIS MUCH CUSHION TO HELP THEM GET THRU THE DAY WITH LESS BACK STRAIN.</li>
