            <li>A .20 seems to be more equivalent to a .15</li>

            <li>I received them very quickly.</li>
            <li>Great quality with a low price</li>
            <li>But they are true to the labeled sizes, soft, and stay nicely curled.</li>
            <li>These Eyelashes Extensions are Very natural and easy to work with!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>The lashes are exactly as described!</li>
            <li>it is worth the money I paid for</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and very natural.</li>
            <li>I bought this set that comes sizes from 7 to 14, and it was so helpful because I have many different sizes to choose in one</li>
            <li>I have discovered that the lashes run a little bit more fine than pricier lashes.</li>
            <li>These are great for special occasions or photo shoots, too heavy for constant use though.</li>
            <li>definitely will buy more, and highly recommended to others.</li>
            <li>I thought it would look longer specially da biggger sizes but its pretty short..</li>
            <li>I really like these lashes.</li>
            <li>Thought I was upgrading, but apparently I just paid a lot more for the same thing in the kit!  </li>
            <li>I wish they had a better &amp;#34;length&amp;#34; chart do i could have actually purchased a slightly longer lash but for the price i am not unhappy!</li>
            <li>plus my clients have not complained...</li>
            <li>Product was good but arrived all broken up.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, product is as it was described, nice and soft lashes, little tough to get off the strip but other than that good product</li>
            <li>These mink lashes look totally natural!</li>
            <li>Most of the time they come off easily if I&#x27;m very careful, but when I have been in too big of a hurry when pulling the eyelash off, I have bent the eyelash.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid to have my eyelashes professionally extended a couple times and these eyelashes seem to be the exact same ones the salon uses.  </li>
            <li>lashes are not that soft though...</li>
            <li>They look so natural on.</li>
            <li>The curl also seems a bit less, a  c curl in these is more similar to a b curl in other lashes.</li>
            <li>These eyelashes have been great to use, except for one thing, they are sometimes a little difficult to get off of the sticky strip they are attached to.  </li>
            <li>super hard to put on yourself, I would not recommend it.</li>

            <li> These eyelashes have been great to use, except for one thing, they are sometimes a little difficult to get off of the sticky strip they are attached to.  Most of the time they come off easily if I&#x27;m very careful, but when I have been in too big of a hurry when pulling the eyelash off, I have bent the eyelash.  It is then unusable.

            <li> I was a little disapointed bcuz they look very short even tho they it has few different sizes. . I thought it would look longer specially da biggger sizes but its pretty short.. I guess sometimes in pictures it looks different.  I will finish using it but probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> it is worth the money I paid for</li>
            <li> Product was good but arrived all broken up. I messaged them to let them know but never heard back.</li>

            <li> I like these lashes, I&#x27;ve ordered several different curls in both the .15 and .2 thickness. I have discovered that the lashes run a little bit more fine than pricier lashes. A .20 seems to be more equivalent to a .15 in some other lashes. The curl also seems a bit less, a  c curl in these is more similar to a b curl in other lashes. I love these for the price and will continue to use them.</li>
