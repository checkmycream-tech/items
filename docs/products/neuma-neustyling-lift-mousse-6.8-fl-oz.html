            <li>Love the Neuma products.</li>

            <li>They are cruelty free - the main reason I tried them and discovered a great line.</li>
            <li>First off love love love Neuma products.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product for me as I have many allergies &amp; am not usually able to use hair products.</li>
            <li>and they work fantastic together - so much more natural looking volume for my fine hair!!</li>

            <li>great product for fine, limp hair</li>
            <li>Thank you for the quick shipment</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine textured hair</li>
            <li>My fine and straight hair gets amazing lift and volume that holds for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I would rather pay the higher price and get a product that does what it is made to do.</li>
            <li>I decided I would give it another try, and since then the product is exactly as it should be.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that goes limp with most volumizers.  </li>
            <li>I love it enough to order it online instead of buying one of the many similar products available at my local store.</li>
            <li>I have fine and very straight and thinnish short hair.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll never try others as long as this product is available online!</li>
            <li>It is the only styling product that gives my fine hair the body to hold the style throughout the day.</li>
            <li>plus I really appreciate ….</li>
            <li>it holds alot better then other ones I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I have had other mousses do this but also have had many that do not.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other products</li>
            <li>Finally, a mousse that is non-toxic and actually adds volume and texture to my fine hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter than most and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>It gives great volume without a sticky or oily texture, and it also controls random flyaways.</li>
            <li>I use to buy it directly from my hairdresser</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the product was old or defective</li>
            <li>My hair stays in place and looks soft.  </li>
            <li>Bought it in a very small town at a local salon out of necessity and ended up loving it.  </li>
            <li>You really only use about a 50 cent worth to style (short hair), so one bottle lasts several months.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, non greasy, non sticky and works well on wet or dry hair!</li>
            <li>Recommended by a hairdresser as kinder to sensitive skin &amp; eyes &amp; definitely fits that description.</li>
            <li>it does give you volume, but makes your hair a little funny feeling.  </li>
            <li>i have been using this mousse for the past few months--after trying many other products i found this one to be fantastic--it holds your hair for the entire day without leaving it stiff and dry--i use all the neuma products and love them all</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair.</li>
