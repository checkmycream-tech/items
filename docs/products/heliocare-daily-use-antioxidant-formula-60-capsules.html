            <li>I was hopeful as I&#x27;ve heard some people have great luck with this preventing their PMLE, but it did not for me.  </li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I noticed even fine lines diminished and my skin looked better!  </li>
            <li>I heard about this from the dermatologist;  but, to be honest, I can&#x27;t really verify anything, so, seems to be good.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than a month.  </li>
            <li>Turns out I have Polymorphous Light Eruption.</li>
            <li>I take two Heliocare pills, with one beta carotene and one dye free benadryl.</li>
            <li>It is great as a daily sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I originally got this from my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>Well to be completely honest, I don&#x27;t see any difference, but that&#x27;s probably because I don&#x27;t really go in the Sun as it is, but I do take a pill every single morning and have notice 0 side effects, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I took it exactly as indicated on the bottle (1 hour before</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it daily.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I found out about these and it has helped me so much.</li>
            <li>But, on a normal day, I just use heliocare.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and between this, sunscreen and hats..</li>
            <li>We live in AZ and are in the sun all the time.  </li>
            <li>too so mabe the combination of both, I live and work on beach in Miami, I will continue using this</li>
            <li>Repeat later in the day, sometimes I skip the beta carotene if I take a higher dosage.</li>
            <li>One of the bottles had a clearly punctured capsule (a hole) and the contents spilled inside.</li>
            <li>I also have naturally tan skin, but take this just in case.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to drive clear across town for the same thing.</li>

            <li> I ordered this a few years ago, then ordered from your closest (cheapest) competitor - until I saw that they use Titanium Dioxide in their pills, along with artificial colors. I went back to Heliocare, and ordered 3 bottles - and then saw that you now use heavy metals and artificial colors in your product as well!  I will ask for my money back and will take my chances with mineral sunscreens from now on.  Heavy metals and artificial colors - not great for people who are trying to clean up their bodies and take good care of themselves...what a shame.</li>
            <li> I originally got this from my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  Been using it for over a year and I have not even had a sunburn since.  Love it!</li>
            <li> good product.it works.</li>
            <li> Supposed to be an antioxidant......I hope it is good for something.</li>
            <li> hard to tell not like taking an asprin for a head ache</li>
            <li> As an everyday swimmer I try to protect my skin the best I can... No new spot sun marks !</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a couple of years and it does help my skin somewhat.  It was recommended by my dermatologist!</li>
            <li> seems to stop itching from the sun</li>
            <li> Well to be completely honest, I don&#x27;t see any difference, but that&#x27;s probably because I don&#x27;t really go in the Sun as it is, but I do take a pill every single morning and have notice 0 side effects, so that&#x27;s good. I also have naturally tan skin, but take this just in case. This is actually my second bottle, but summer is coming up and I plan on going to the beach a lot, so it&#x27;s always good to have added coverage because wrinkles and pre-mature aging? Not cute.</li>
            <li> I heard about this from the dermatologist;  but, to be honest, I can&#x27;t really verify anything, so, seems to be good.</li>
            <li> I wrote an updated review.</li>
            <li> Helps with preventing sunburns, although you still have to wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> A dermatology associate recommended this for me for my PMLE.  I took it exactly as indicated on the bottle (1 hour before and 2-3 hours after sun exposure) and even started several days prior to our beach vacation.  I was hopeful as I&#x27;ve heard some people have great luck with this preventing their PMLE, but it did not for me.  I got it as bad as I normally do.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I&#x27;m in the sun a lot and this really helps with protecting me.</li>
            <li> Exelent...fast delivery</li>
            <li> I am on my third jar and I am still not sure about this product.It is possible that Heliocare have helped spots on my face to get brighter on the inside.</li>
            <li> Read about this product and I find that it has minimized my melasma.</li>
            <li> say NO to skin cancer!</li>
            <li> Heliocare is a supplement I use year round to protect my skin from the sun. I have Lupus and get a red rash from even minimal sun exposure. Every morning, I take this and I apply a sunscreen with an SPF 50 containing zinc oxide. When I went on vacation in the Caribbean, I took 2 pills twice a day (along with wearing SPF 50 &amp; a hat &amp; staying out of the sun between 10 am and 3 pm) and I did not have an adverse reaction to the sun. I need any extra protection I can get. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Turns out I have Polymorphous Light Eruption. Which is basically being allergic to the sun. I found out about these and it has helped me so much. I take two in the morning for daily sun exposure and another two if I&#x27;m out longer in the sun. It seems to help lessen the rash I get later. I take two Heliocare pills, with one beta carotene and one dye free benadryl. Repeat later in the day, sometimes I skip the beta carotene if I take a higher dosage. This was my rash before I started taking these and I have yet to have this again after I started taking them. I have had reactions but nothing compared to this. Bad blisters, itching..terrible stuff. WILL CONTINUE TO BUY! So grateful for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you have or think you may have this problem if you&#x27;re on facebook here&#x27;s a great group for help https://www.facebook.com/groups/2357732435/</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommends Heliocare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the Heliocare Anitoxidant Suppliement for 6 months and I believe it works for me. I did not use sunscreen just to test it and after 2 hours in the pool, I had redness on my shoulders and face, but not a burn. The next day the redness was gone. I did use lotion on the redness that night to keep the area moisturized. This will be the last month I take it this year, but will start it again before next summer.</li>
            <li> after having mohs surgery this past june...I&#x27;m never without this. I live in Florida and between this, sunscreen and hats..I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> This supplement was recommended by my dermatologist.  We live in AZ and are in the sun all the time.  I have been taking it for 2 months now.  I have not burned at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it daily. It is great as a daily sunscreen. When I know I&#x27;m going to be out all day, I take two and also usually add some sunscreen. But, on a normal day, I just use heliocare. I live on a beach and am outside daily.</li>
            <li> Been taking one a day, melasma on face hasn&#x27;t gotten worse, I use zinc too so mabe the combination of both, I live and work on beach in Miami, I will continue using this</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3-years. It helps prevent my white skin from getting sunburned.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to drive clear across town for the same thing.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist told me about this product.  I have been using it for more than a month.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin,  but it works internally and I have good skin anyway, so I am not sure how you would judge this product. It is suppose to help protect your skin from the effects of the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used product for a while and it&#x27;s good.  My issue is w/the supplier.  One of the bottles had a clearly punctured capsule (a hole) and the contents spilled inside. The bottle was also contaminated w/unknown black particles which looked like droppings.</li>
            <li> After I started using these I noticed even fine lines diminished and my skin looked better!  My dermatologist recommended these and I started my husband on them also since he LOVES the sun.</li>
            <li> This product is great for sun-sensitive people. I believe it is even helping my vitiligo.</li>
