            <li>Love the fragrance and the way my hands feel after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>Purell is much better than soap  .  </li>
            <li>Note to GOJO: Our latest shipment seems to have an updated pump design and opened with ease.</li>
            <li>I like the aloe more than the regular.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My favorite is Mother&#x27;s Therapy Organic&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with product and delivery.</li>
            <li>I feel like it does better than water</li>
            <li>what more can can i say?  </li>
            <li>I credit the use of this stuff and making it mandatory that we scrub hands really good first thing in the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My fianc√© and I love Purell Advanced with Aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good and dries fast.</li>
            <li>The pump on the bottles of sanitizer work well and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>so they are easy to find.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use some of them because of the strong flower scent with my allergies, they don&#x27;t mix.  </li>
            <li>We bought a bottle of the CVS hand sanitizer waiting for the package of Purell to arrive, and found it to be too strong.</li>
            <li>My fingers are smooth without breaks.  </li>
            <li>Which I think is a preferable attribute in a company producing products where consumer safety is important.</li>
            <li>I asked a nurse if the solution was skin friendly</li>
            <li>but I was excited to see that they offered a variety with aloe vera.</li>
            <li>So easy, delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li>Better price than our supplier &amp; came fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After several weeks of using Purell, my hands are in good condition.  </li>
            <li>then I combine them into one and have nearly a full bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purell does have that alcohol smell, but it quickly fades.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and once dried there is a pleasant and light aloe</li>
            <li>I work in an elementary school</li>
            <li>I liked the regular Purell hand sanitizer</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, and have allergic reactions to many soaps and lotions.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is an amazing product and I have no major complaints.</li>
            <li>and she indicated that it was a special formula that was gentle on the hands while it removed germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is still pretty chemical and putrid.  </li>
            <li>The pump gives you exactly the amount you need.</li>
            <li>And the price is much better than what we can find locally.</li>
            <li>I quickly removed my bottle of Purrell Advanced Hand Sanitizer Aloe from my drawer and tossed it to him, telling him to liberally rub it all over his private parts.</li>
            <li>The fresh cucumber scent is amazing and my whole families hands are soft all year long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike similar products, Purell (with aloe) always leaves our hands feeling clean, moisturized and refreshed!</li>
            <li>This has a very settle smell.  </li>
            <li>I have used skin lotions, but additional washing tends to remove much of the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purell really helps.  </li>
            <li>Purell is gentle on my hands and may even be improving my skin while I use</li>
            <li>It really does kill the germs.</li>
            <li>the aloe is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I hope Amazon and/or GOJO continue offering S&amp;S we really appreciate the convenience and discounted</li>
            <li>work in a hotel, this is a much needed product for all the people/items we come in contact with.</li>
            <li>Really at these prices why buy anything else?</li>
            <li>This sanitizer has really worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>texture of this aloe version is similar to the original Purell hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>He did, and when he got checked out at the clinic two weeks later he was clean.</li>
            <li>and my hands are not dried out from it thanks to the aloe.</li>
            <li>first used the product does initially have a strong odor (probably the alcohol evaporating) if you smell your hands closely while they are still wet.</li>
            <li>Use many times on a daily basis &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry out the hands like others do.  </li>
            <li>Since I am invalid and do not move around very much this is a product that I use all day everyday to keep my hands clean.</li>
            <li>She has excessive skin drying from using any soap and water, leading to more troublesome issues.</li>
            <li>The aloe makes it less drying than traditional purell, and it does not irritate my hands with many uses per day.</li>
            <li>But it is much easier on the hands than regular Purell.  </li>
            <li>The only real difference aesthetically, is that the appearance of the aloe vera version has a green tint (the original Purell Sanitizer is clear).</li>
            <li>It has a faint pleasant scent that quickly fades and my hands feel soft, neither greasy nor dried out.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a bit tipsy, it would be nice if the smallest dimension of it&#x27;s foot print was increased 30-40% and height reduced 10-20% also making the bottom edges less round</li>
            <li>This size doesn&#x27;t fit into my purse, but I also buy the small travel-size version and take it with me</li>
            <li>I work in healthcare and have a new baby, so I am constantly washing and sanitizing my hands.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many new organic brands that are less harsh and use safer chemicals.  </li>
            <li>.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to my current health situation I must frequently wash my hands.  </li>
            <li>Our newborn developed a meningitis and gastroenteritis out of the blue and we decided to take extra precautions around her.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Purell for many years but when the plain type was not to be found at Walgreen&#x27;s a few months ago but the Purell with Aloe was sitting on the shelf, I bought a bottle.</li>
            <li>Also, we couldn&#x27;t push the pump down without dispensing way too much product.</li>

            <li> Also, we couldn&#x27;t push the pump down without dispensing way too much product.</li>
            <li> I also really like having the pump on these larger bottles, though it does make getting that last little bit out of the bottle harder sometimes.</li>
            <li> However being the critical person I am, I do have some minor complaints about the bottle and pump, but not the purell itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The alcohol contents in the Purell is high enough to sanitize, yet not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I use it several times throughout the day, and I want to save my hands from getting painfully dry.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my kid&#x27;s hands occasionally, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry their hands out</li>
            <li> We went through a whole year of preschool with only a few colds last year -- no stomach bug, no strep, no pink-eye -- nothing beyond a few colds.</li>
            <li> When I was in college, my roommate stumbled back into the room with his pants half zipped, his shirt buttoned crooked, and his hair all tussled.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands, no matter how often I use it-</li>
            <li> And my hands don&#x27;t dry out!</li>
            <li> In my opinion that means they are less likely to chase short-term profits at the expense of the consumers</li>
            <li> After comparing the aloe vera version, to the regular Purell sanitizer, I do feel like the aloe vera version is less drying on my hands.</li>
            <li> I also have one of the little one ounce containers that I am constantly refilling-</li>
            <li> The bottom of the bottle is indented, so like many other pump bottle products it is virtually impossible to dispense all of the purell.</li>
            <li> $45.48 there is a bit of price shock, but with subscribe and save knocking 15% off and the 12 pack lasting 2 heavy users 3 months it amounts to about $6-7/month per person.</li>
            <li> Otherwise if used as expected you won&#x27;t encounter an odor problem.</li>
            <li> I keep the nearly empty bottles around until I have 6 - 8 of themand</li>
            <li> small thing I have noticed is that frequent use between hand washing results in some build up of what I am guessing is the aloe which remains unnoticeable until introducing water at which point it feels like there is liquid soap in my hands for a few seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has the highest alcohol content (active ingredient) of any hand sanitizer you can buy in the drugstores.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and has helped to cut down on colds.</li>
            <li> The pump starts to sputter once there is about a half inch remaining.</li>
            <li> So, if you want to use a hand sanitizer but want a less drying option on your hands, then I recommend the Purell sanitizer with aloe vera.</li>
            <li> This seems like a waste of product and/or time.</li>
            <li> I slather my kids and myself in this stuff all year round</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Purrell actually killed any violent pathogens on my roommate&#x27;s special areas.</li>
            <li> The aloe then helps keep your skin from drying out the way it does with plain hand</li>
            <li> The pump head has been difficult to open at times almost requiring pliers to hold part of the neck from spinning.</li>
            <li> When I use this sanitizer frequently on my children&#x27;s delicate hands during the Winter they get chapped and make life a little uncomfortable for them!  </li>
            <li> getting a cold costs big money at the drugstore in Kleenex, saline spray, OTC meds, doctor visits, missed work and take-out when mom gets sick and isn&#x27;t cooking -- it&#x27;s worth anything to stay well.</li>
            <li> Because of this my hands become dry, cracked, and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Our local stores quit carrying it to sell their off-brand stuff which stinks.  </li>
            <li> I was in the hospital lately</li>
            <li> I thought it would dry my hands horribly (as the one my son has been using at school), but my hands appear normal after 1 month+ of use dozens of times/day.</li>
            <li> I caught one whiff of him as he came over to my desk and knew he had been with a lady of questionable hygiene.</li>
            <li> I use this all of the time at work where people come in sick in the winter (flu season) and you don&#x27;t have the ability to go and wash your hands all of the time.  </li>

            <li> When I was in college, my roommate stumbled back into the room with his pants half zipped, his shirt buttoned crooked, and his hair all tussled. I caught one whiff of him as he came over to my desk and knew he had been with a lady of questionable hygiene. I quickly removed my bottle of Purrell Advanced Hand Sanitizer Aloe from my drawer and tossed it to him, telling him to liberally rub it all over his private parts. He did, and when he got checked out at the clinic two weeks later he was clean. *Disclaimer* I don&#x27;t know if Purrell actually killed any violent pathogens on my roommate&#x27;s special areas. Historical trends to not guarantee future results.</li>
            <li> Now a days you can not have enough sanitizer on hand. Make sure you never ru out by buying bulk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the Purell aloe sanitizer. This is the same but a bit stronger and quicker drying.  Our local stores quit carrying it to sell their off-brand stuff which stinks.  Thankful Amazon carries this.</li>
            <li> Good price, quick delivery</li>
            <li> I have no complaints on the product, the ordering, or the price offered on Amazon. Good deal, esp if you have a newborn and want to turn your home into a hospital. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Purell for many years but when the plain type was not to be found at Walgreen&#x27;s a few months ago but the Purell with Aloe was sitting on the shelf, I bought a bottle. Love the fragrance and the way my hands feel after I&#x27;ve used it. It&#x27;s nothing but Purell with Aloe for me now. I bought a dozen bottles here on Amazon... So easy, delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for work!  Use many times on a daily basis &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry out the hands like others do.  I can&#x27;t use some of them because of the strong flower scent with my allergies, they don&#x27;t mix.  This has a very settle smell.  Better price than our supplier &amp; came fast.</li>
            <li> .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to my current health situation I must frequently wash my hands.  Because of this my hands become dry, cracked, and uncomfortable.  I have used skin lotions, but additional washing tends to remove much of the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was in the hospital lately I noticed that the medical personnel apply some sort of material to their hands after each patient.  Upon examination, I discovered that it was a product to wash and sanitize their hands.  I asked a nurse if the solution was skin friendly and she indicated that it was a special formula that was gentle on the hands while it removed germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I decided to try Purell.  Purell really helps.  I now rinse my hands instead of washing them with soap and water.  Purell is much better than soap  .  Purell is gentle on my hands and may even be improving my skin while I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several weeks of using Purell, my hands are in good condition.  I no longer have pain in  the skin at my joints.  My fingers are smooth without breaks.  Purell works for me.  I recommend Purell Hand Sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I work in an elementary school and I go through this stuff like water. I use it, I have the kids use it, I even squirt it on the desks when they sneeze and cough on the surfaces. Nothing works all the time, but I&#x27;m a lot healthier since I&#x27;ve been using Purell. It really does kill the germs. It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands, no matter how often I use it-the aloe is very moisturizing. It has a faint pleasant scent that quickly fades and my hands feel soft, neither greasy nor dried out. I also have one of the little one ounce containers that I am constantly refilling-I never leave home without Purell in my pocket.</li>
            <li> Smells good and dries fast. Use it daily!</li>
            <li> great smell. lasts 3-5 years. good buy.</li>
            <li> The smell is still pretty chemical and putrid.  But it is much easier on the hands than regular Purell.  If you are a Purell hater like me but need to get some out of necessity, go with the aloe type here.</li>
            <li> My wife has extensive skin sensitivities. She has excessive skin drying from using any soap and water, leading to more troublesome issues. For 4 years now, she has used this Purell with Aloe, But without vitamin e and has be irritation and rash free!!</li>
            <li> My fianc√© and I love Purell Advanced with Aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike similar products, Purell (with aloe) always leaves our hands feeling clean, moisturized and refreshed! We have been using it dozens of times per day for about 6 months and our hands actually feel smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $45.48 there is a bit of price shock, but with subscribe and save knocking 15% off and the 12 pack lasting 2 heavy users 3 months it amounts to about $6-7/month per person. I hope Amazon and/or GOJO continue offering S&amp;S we really appreciate the convenience and discounted pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When first used the product does initially have a strong odor (probably the alcohol evaporating) if you smell your hands closely while they are still wet. Otherwise if used as expected you won&#x27;t encounter an odor problem. It dries quickly and once dried there is a pleasant and light aloe scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small thing I have noticed is that frequent use between hand washing results in some build up of what I am guessing is the aloe which remains unnoticeable until introducing water at which point it feels like there is liquid soap in my hands for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps also noteworthy is that GOJO is a privately held family owned company as opposed to a publicly traded one. Which I think is a preferable attribute in a company producing products where consumer safety is important. In my opinion that means they are less likely to chase short-term profits at the expense of the consumers health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is an amazing product and I have no major complaints. However being the critical person I am, I do have some minor complaints about the bottle and pump, but not the purell itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1. The bottom of the bottle is indented, so like many other pump bottle products it is virtually impossible to dispense all of the purell. The pump starts to sputter once there is about a half inch remaining. I keep the nearly empty bottles around until I have 6 - 8 of themand then I combine them into one and have nearly a full bottle. This seems like a waste of product and/or time. If anyone from GOJO is reading please consider asking an engineer to redesign the bottle/pump to alleviate this, look at the clorox smart-tube for some ideas.&lt;br /&gt;  2. The bottle is a bit tipsy, it would be nice if the smallest dimension of it&#x27;s foot print was increased 30-40% and height reduced 10-20% also making the bottom edges less round would help.&lt;br /&gt;  3. The pump head has been difficult to open at times almost requiring pliers to hold part of the neck from spinning. Note to GOJO: Our latest shipment seems to have an updated pump design and opened with ease. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I use this all of the time at work where people come in sick in the winter (flu season) and you don&#x27;t have the ability to go and wash your hands all of the time.  This size doesn&#x27;t fit into my purse, but I also buy the small travel-size version and take it with me wherever I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purell does have that alcohol smell, but it quickly fades.  The aloe then helps keep your skin from drying out the way it does with plain hand sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you go through a lot of this, then buying a larger pack is definitely the way to go.  I also really like having the pump on these larger bottles, though it does make getting that last little bit out of the bottle harder sometimes.</li>
            <li> Our newborn developed a meningitis and gastroenteritis out of the blue and we decided to take extra precautions around her. We have a bottle of Purell in each room and use it constantly. I thought it would dry my hands horribly (as the one my son has been using at school), but my hands appear normal after 1 month+ of use dozens of times/day. We bought a bottle of the CVS hand sanitizer waiting for the package of Purell to arrive, and found it to be too strong. Also, we couldn&#x27;t push the pump down without dispensing way too much product. The alcohol contents in the Purell is high enough to sanitize, yet not overwhelming. The pump gives you exactly the amount you need. The aloe makes it gentler on your skin. And the price is much better than what we can find locally. Will keep ordering regularly.</li>
            <li> Purell can be pricy. this is a great deal! I like the aloe more than the regular.&lt;br /&gt;I work in a hotel, this is a much needed product for all the people/items we come in contact with.</li>
            <li> I know Purell has been around for years but I have to say it leaves a sticky residue on my hands.  When I use this sanitizer frequently on my children&#x27;s delicate hands during the Winter they get chapped and make life a little uncomfortable for them!  I had this bottle for about a week and the pump didn&#x27;t work anymore.  I had to take it off and it would pour all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many new organic brands that are less harsh and use safer chemicals.  My favorite is Mother&#x27;s Therapy Organic&#x27;s.  The fresh cucumber scent is amazing and my whole families hands are soft all year long.</li>
            <li> Pleased with product and delivery.</li>
            <li> Purell meets my needs. I am not always able to wash my hands and this works great.And my hands don&#x27;t dry out!</li>
            <li> This stuff helps prevent skin cracks in your fingers in winter. Must be the Aloe in the formula. Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and my wife and I use it all the time and has helped to cut down on colds.</li>
            <li> Purell is the best. Check out any independent testing. You actually want to consider a cheaper substitute? Go ahead: Save a penny and gain a germ. Really at these prices why buy anything else?</li>
            <li> I use the aloe vera Purell to sanitize my hands when I am on the go with my kids. I liked the regular Purell hand sanitizer but I was excited to see that they offered a variety with aloe vera. So, I bought the Purell with aloe vera to keep my hands from drying out after using the hand sanitizer. After comparing the aloe vera version, to the regular Purell sanitizer, I do feel like the aloe vera version is less drying on my hands. This is especially helpful because being on the go with kids I use it several times throughout the day, and I want to save my hands from getting painfully dry. I even use it on my kid&#x27;s hands occasionally, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry their hands out either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of this aloe version is similar to the original Purell hand sanitizer. The only real difference aesthetically, is that the appearance of the aloe vera version has a green tint (the original Purell Sanitizer is clear). The pump on the bottles of sanitizer work well and are easy to use. So, if you want to use a hand sanitizer but want a less drying option on your hands, then I recommend the Purell sanitizer with aloe vera.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It has the highest alcohol content (active ingredient) of any hand sanitizer you can buy in the drugstores. I slather my kids and myself in this stuff all year round and my hands are not dried out from it thanks to the aloe. I keep a pump in my car&#x27;s cup holder, several around the house, use them to fill up smaller bottles for my purse, my kid&#x27;s backpack, you name it. We went through a whole year of preschool with only a few colds last year -- no stomach bug, no strep, no pink-eye -- nothing beyond a few colds. I credit the use of this stuff and making it mandatory that we scrub hands really good first thing in the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When getting a cold costs big money at the drugstore in Kleenex, saline spray, OTC meds, doctor visits, missed work and take-out when mom gets sick and isn&#x27;t cooking -- it&#x27;s worth anything to stay well.</li>
            <li> Since I am invalid and do not move around very much this is a product that I use all day everyday to keep my hands clean. I have they setting every where in the bathroom, kitchen and by my chair so they are easy to find. I feel like it does better than water does for me.</li>
            <li> I work in healthcare and have a new baby, so I am constantly washing and sanitizing my hands.  I also have sensitive skin, and have allergic reactions to many soaps and lotions.  This sanitizer has really worked well for me.  The aloe makes it less drying than traditional purell, and it does not irritate my hands with many uses per day.</li>
            <li> Non sticky. Nice scent. Great feel to hands. Dries fast.</li>
            <li> I buy these about once a year for the office.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my office loves these.  I got a pack of 12 and everyone has one on their desk.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of hand sanitizers but the aloe in this one gives a nice fragrance and seems to be kinder to the hands.</li>
            <li> Why not buy it by the case?!  It does it&#x27;s job well.....what more can can i say?  three more words!  Ok!</li>
            <li> Had to stock up on these, i always run out and end up having to wait until next shopping trip. then i would forget to pick it up.  now i have 11 in the cupboard and use every day.</li>
