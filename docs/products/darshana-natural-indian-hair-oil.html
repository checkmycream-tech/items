            <li>I am completely satisfied with my results and Darshana</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this product is the smell.</li>
            <li>I love that the idea came from ancient rituals and is something they decided to modernized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>

            <li>At last a prince after kissing many frogs, thank you!!!</li>
            <li>Amazing product that is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>so i do not have a problem with my hair becoming oily.</li>
            <li>I love the light lemony scent, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an oil treatment like so many out there, nothing special.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old bi-racial (black/white) daughter has the most beautiful, curly hair; however it can can sometimes get very frizzy as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li>I have soft, shiny, and most importantly, healthy hair!  </li>
            <li>After using Darshana my hair is so smooth, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>It makes a great present too!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>My clients absolutely love the fragrance and it&#x27;s quickly become their new favorite as well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Darshana is an amazing all natural hair oil.</li>
            <li>you receive a personal note that go into detail about the product-i am always a fan of good customer service.</li>
            <li>this product is a true miracle</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not only good for your hair...</li>
            <li>Not only is the oil worth the money but the customer service is as good as the oil.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different products trying to find the best for my long, dyed, frizzy, damaged hair.</li>
            <li>And I love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>The oil, which has a nice citrusy smell and comes in a small bottle, is very runny and probably good for people with finer hair who don&#x27;t like the greasiness and heaviness of thicker oils.</li>
            <li>Although Darshana works great for curly hair (see other reviews), it also does wonders for my straight hair!  </li>
            <li>I really liked it and would definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Now with Darshana my hair is soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Love how soft and manageable</li>
            <li>Right after the first use my hair felt transformed!</li>
            <li>Worked beautiful on my African American chemical treated hair!!!!</li>
            <li>I can also go longer without washing my hair, how this is possible with an oil treatment I do not know, but it&#x27;s true!!</li>
            <li>that I would more than likely purchase</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for months and my hair is soft, smooth, and no flyaways.</li>
            <li>I soaked my hair in Darshana for 30 minutes the first time I used it and</li>
            <li>Funny thing is, it is so organic/natural that you CAN rub it on your skin.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the best oil for your hair, I suggest you experiment with the cheaper ones first before you get this expensive alternative.</li>
            <li>, i didn&#x27;t use any special product and hairdryer, my hair look and feel so alive, inspite of the fact</li>
            <li>this product and would recommend to anyone who cares about supporting a small business, using NATURAL products and wants great looking hair.</li>
            <li>What I love about Darshana and what separates it from other methods is that it leaves my hair light and soft without any product buildup.</li>
            <li>My hair was dry and damaged from dying my hair too many times.</li>
            <li>I have fine short hair and leave it on my hair for about 30 mins.</li>
            <li>Works very well and they sent a handwritten thank</li>
            <li>It already looks and feels so much healthier.</li>
            <li>you note which I really like.</li>
            <li>My scalp also feels very moisturized and not flaky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to Darshana</li>
            <li>I tend to mix it with a cream based product and it&#x27;s been really working well for me.</li>
            <li>I just work it through my hair, clip it up for an hour or so, and then it shampoos out really easily (no oily residue, but nicely conditioned).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products, and a major deciding factor is fragrance, and sheen.</li>
            <li>Personally, I didn&#x27;t see much of a result on my curly hair (3b), as it did little to improve frizz or detangling no matter how much I used, although I liked the smell.</li>
            <li>My curls are more tight, and defined.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products in the past to tame the frizz if my hair , nothing has been as effective until now .</li>
            <li>Since using it, I notice her curls stay more defined with little to no frizz.  </li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering and they sent it right away</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always had to use many products to try to tame it.  </li>
            <li>this leaves my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I have also had so much growth since I started using Darshana and get compliments daily!  </li>
            <li>With an overnight treatment using Darshana, my hair was soft and Shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using Darshana Hair oil, my hair is completely transformed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the shiniest it&#x27;s ever been and so soft to touch.</li>
            <li>I put Darshana for overnight, and rinsed soft shampoo in the morning</li>
            <li>She used to get dry scalp/dandruff, but now it is gone thanks to Darshana!  </li>
            <li>To me, definitely worth every penny spent on it!</li>
            <li>story behind the name is also very cool!</li>
            <li>my opinion, you could probably buy similar oils from the grocery store and mix something with similar effectiveness and consistency for a much lower price.</li>
            <li>One treatment also lasts for weeks, not just until the next wash like many other other oil treatments.</li>
            <li>Please note I have  natural hair that is just above my bra strap</li>
            <li>Earlier this morning I put my normal oil in my hair since it was so dry.  </li>
            <li>I started using a very small amount of Darshana in place of my night time lotion and have seen a significant improvement in my overall skin appearance and health.</li>
            <li>I purchased this all-natural product as a way to tame her hair and bring out those pretty curls.  </li>
            <li>Straight hair people will obviously use less than I have to FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that evening facial lotions would cause break outs, dry patches, and just didn&#x27;t do well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair - so the LAST thing you would think I need is a hair oil.</li>

            <li> One treatment also lasts for weeks, not just until the next wash like many other other oil treatments.</li>
            <li> Please note I have  natural hair that is just above my bra strap</li>
            <li> Earlier this morning I put my normal oil in my hair since it was so dry.  </li>
            <li> I started using a very small amount of Darshana in place of my night time lotion and have seen a significant improvement in my overall skin appearance and health.</li>
            <li> I purchased this all-natural product as a way to tame her hair and bring out those pretty curls.  </li>
            <li> Straight hair people will obviously use less than I have to FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that evening facial lotions would cause break outs, dry patches, and just didn&#x27;t do well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair - so the LAST thing you would think I need is a hair oil.</li>
            <li> I really like it and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I can wear my hair natural (slightly curly) and it will enhance my curls, or I can wear it blown out</li>
            <li> , I wish I had discovered this long time ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using Darshana as long as I have</li>
            <li> It is long, curly and frizzy</li>
            <li> /&gt;The $38 will last a really long time and you can use it for other purposes.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my hands when they are dry, and legs after shaving to sooth and help heal my skin.</li>
            <li> Her hair tends to get dry, so we condition with Darshana once a week.  </li>
            <li> I have used everything from morrocan oil, to olive oil, to coconut oil, to deep conditioning products, and even apple cider vinegar to tame it down and keep it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> and my hair will be less likely to frizz out at the slightest sign of moisture in the air.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount once a week as a leave in over night treatment to restore my hair and scalp from the daily damage of having color treated hair.</li>
            <li> The other day I used after I did my hair, and it took the frizz down also.</li>
            <li> I also use a very small amount as needed for friz or fly-aways after blow drying, especially on my damaged ends.</li>
            <li> and I notice less hair falling out when I brush/comb.</li>
            <li> while it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> As a biracial woman with natural hair, I was immediately skeptical of this product.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, but my hair is very thin and has gone through a lot of bleaching.</li>
            <li> but it would make my hair stiff and would cause damage and break off.  </li>
            <li> Whatever type of hair texture, you will not be let down!!</li>
            <li> So I decided to put a small amount in my hair as a leave in and see what happened...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just used darshana oil on my hair for the first time yesterday, and I loved it!! I have naturally curly hair, but my hair is very thin and has gone through a lot of bleaching. I feel like my hair looks and feels healthier than yesterday. The oil definitely helped control the frizz and gave my hair shine! I really liked it and would definitely recommend it!! And I love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> I love Darshana!  I have naturally curly hair and I&#x27;ve always had to use many products to try to tame it.  I used gel or mousse but it would make my hair stiff and would cause damage and break off.  Now with Darshana my hair is soft and healthy.  I have also had so much growth since I started using Darshana and get compliments daily!  I will never go without it!</li>
            <li> Just received this today and immediately applied to my hair.  Earlier this morning I put my normal oil in my hair since it was so dry.  When the darshana arrived I applied it in sections and as I did so the oil soaked in and restored the body and shine and softness my hair had as a child.  Oh my, how I already love this product.  I will update in a month after washing and continue using.  Thank you darshana, I believe this is what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and creators! Works very well and they sent a handwritten thank you note great stuff!!! Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different products trying to find the best for my long, dyed, frizzy, damaged hair. After using Darshana my hair is so smooth, silky and shiny. It already looks and feels so much healthier. I am really impressed. Their customer service is excellent, all my questions were answered and the shipping and presentation was superb. I am really glad that I tried this amazing product, and it sure will be a staple in my hair routine. It makes a great present too! If you are hesitating, just buy it, I wish I had discovered this long time ago. At last a prince after kissing many frogs, thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review products but I had to this time. This is the most amazing hair oil I have ever used. The smell, the feel, the outcome...just phenomenal! I am so taken back by the company and their detail. They mail the product with a hand written personalized &amp;#34;Thank You&amp;#34; card and the oil comes with a tag with your name on it. That alone has left me amazed!! Order this oil!! Whatever type of hair texture, you will not be let down!! I will be ordering again...and again...and again!!! Bravo!</li>
            <li> I use this oil every week and i love it! I have fine short hair and leave it on my hair for about 30 mins. It gives my hair lots of shine and softness! I totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Worked beautiful on my African American chemical treated hair!!!!</li>
            <li> Darshana is an amazing all natural hair oil. The best I&#x27;ve ever used and being a hairstylist I have used MANY! It is so lightweight which makes it perfect for ALL hair types. My clients absolutely love the fragrance and it&#x27;s quickly become their new favorite as well!&lt;br /&gt;A MUST BUY!!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that having naturally curly hair can be beautiful! Darshana works wonders!! Leaving it on at night, or putting a smidge on while my hair is wet, it makes my hair look soft and nourished.</li>
            <li> I have impossibly curly and frizzy hair... I started using Darshana as per the directions and leaving in for 30 and wash out and my hair looks shiny and lustrous ! So I decided to put a small amount in my hair as a leave in and see what happened... Threw the Biosilk out and now only use Darshana as my leave in.. Love how soft and manageable my hair looks after using it!! HIGHLY recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Darshana every time I wash my hair (3x/week)-- sometimes before I shampoo, sometimes after, sometimes both.  I notice the biggest improvement in my hair when I use it after shampooing to add body &amp; shine to the strands.  When I do use it before shampooing, it&#x27;s surprising how easy &amp; pleasant it is to apply- feels like olive oil (silky but not runny) &amp; smells like oranges!  I just work it through my hair, clip it up for an hour or so, and then it shampoos out really easily (no oily residue, but nicely conditioned).  I&#x27;m going to try leaving it in longer before shampooing (several hours) per the product recommendation for an even deeper conditioning!</li>
            <li> I have had an issue with psoriasis on my scalp and Darshana has cured it for me.  I tried prescription medication and nothing worked until I purchased Darshana.  I love this product!  My daughter has the same issue and I cannot wait to use it on her.  My hair is softer and shiny. :)</li>
            <li> I mix this with redken oil and use it as a leave in. this leaves my hair very soft and shiny. Please note I have  natural hair that is just above my bra strap so i do not have a problem with my hair becoming oily. The oil smells very nice. you receive a personal note that go into detail about the product-i am always a fan of good customer service. while it is a little pricey i find that it is a good product that I would more than likely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt; I would have given the product five stars however I have not had a chance to use it by itself as directed.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I hardly ever give reviews but I made an exception with this. Not only is the oil worth the money but the customer service is as good as the oil. This is my second time ordering and they sent it right away and they write you a personal thank you note which I really like. Great company great oil.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and damaged from dying my hair too many times. With an overnight treatment using Darshana, my hair was soft and Shiny. Thank you Darshana!</li>
            <li> this product is a true miracle</li>
            <li> I suffered from over-processed hair --- dryness, crispy ends, split end, you name it. My hair felt and looked dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Darshana Hair oil, my hair is completely transformed. It&#x27;s the shiniest it&#x27;s ever been and so soft to touch. My scalp also feels very moisturized and not flaky. People at work noticed a difference, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using it, it&#x27;s been easier to style and I notice less hair falling out when I brush/comb. I love the light lemony scent, too. It&#x27;s very refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using Darshana as long as I have hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Darashana@</li>
            <li> This is a very nice citrus smelling oil and it feels so nice and light on my hair I really like it and a little goes a long way. As of hair growth I haven&#x27;t noticed any but I like the light fragrance it gives making my hair smelling nice and it cuts some of the frizz. I will order again and recommend it to every body out there but I won&#x27;t run out any time soon</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for months and my hair is soft, smooth, and no flyaways. I would recommend this product. I am completely satisfied with my results and Darshana works on all hair types. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have the frizziest hair on earth. It is long, curly and frizzy and I straighten it every weekend. I soaked my hair in Darshana for 30 minutes the first time I used it and no kidding my frizz went away. My favorite part about this product is the smell. It sounds weird but I crave the smell of it sometimes and want to rub it on my skin. Funny thing is, it is so organic/natural that you CAN rub it on your skin. Woot woot! WIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The $38 will last a really long time and you can use it for other purposes. The other day I used after I did my hair, and it took the frizz down also. Straight hair people will obviously use less than I have to FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story behind the name is also very cool! I love that the idea came from ancient rituals and is something they decided to modernized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and would recommend to anyone who cares about supporting a small business, using NATURAL products and wants great looking hair.</li>
            <li> Right after the first use my hair felt transformed! I felt like I just came out of the Hair Salon... My hair was not frizzy and lifeless or dull. A must try!!! Even after the first use my hair felt and looked Beautiful for Days... When I use it I keep it in overnight. !!!!</li>
            <li> Nice product! I&#x27;ve used it one time and see the difference! Not greasy at all, more body at hair and volume, and wonderful mandarin aroma, mmmmmm, i love it!!! I put Darshana for overnight, and rinsed soft shampoo in the morning, i didn&#x27;t use any special product and hairdryer, my hair look and feel so alive, inspite of the fact I dye them every month))) thank you Darshana!!!</li>
            <li> Although Darshana works great for curly hair (see other reviews), it also does wonders for my straight hair!  Thanks to Darshana I have soft, shiny, and most importantly, healthy hair!  Plus it smells amazing!  Thank you Darshana!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products in the past to tame the frizz if my hair , nothing has been as effective until now . Darshana  is wonderful natural oil that can turn your frizzy hair into beautiful manageable hair. This product is definitely a must try! I love it!</li>
            <li> Was losing hair. Got a bottle and massaged the scalp thoroughly with Darshana after bath and cleaning hair with shampoo and leaving the oil in overnight. Noticing significant improvement when brushing not to mention the beautiful appearance and the heavenly smell that permeates through. Absolutely love it. To me, definitely worth every penny spent on it! As the saying goes, &amp;#34;Try it. You&#x27;ll like it!&amp;#34; if you haven&#x27;t yet!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair - so the LAST thing you would think I need is a hair oil. I thought the same thing and i was WRONG! This product is so amazing and versatile I can&#x27;t imagine NOT having it. I use a small amount once a week as a leave in over night treatment to restore my hair and scalp from the daily damage of having color treated hair. I also use a very small amount as needed for friz or fly-aways after blow drying, especially on my damaged ends. But it&#x27;s not only good for your hair... I found that evening facial lotions would cause break outs, dry patches, and just didn&#x27;t do well with my sensitive skin. I started using a very small amount of Darshana in place of my night time lotion and have seen a significant improvement in my overall skin appearance and health. I also use it on my hands when they are dry, and legs after shaving to sooth and help heal my skin. It absorbs well, never feels oily, and smells great! I can&#x27;t say enough about how amazing this product is!!!</li>
            <li> I have semi curly, frizzy, coarse, naturally red hair. I have used everything from morrocan oil, to olive oil, to coconut oil, to deep conditioning products, and even apple cider vinegar to tame it down and keep it soft and shiny. What I love about Darshana and what separates it from other methods is that it leaves my hair light and soft without any product buildup. One treatment also lasts for weeks, not just until the next wash like many other other oil treatments. I can also go longer without washing my hair, how this is possible with an oil treatment I do not know, but it&#x27;s true!! My hair feels healthy, not manipulated by a product to just appear healthy. I can wear my hair natural (slightly curly) and it will enhance my curls, or I can wear it blown out and my hair will be less likely to frizz out at the slightest sign of moisture in the air. Amazing product that is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> For me, at least, there was no magical transformation to my hair. The oil, which has a nice citrusy smell and comes in a small bottle, is very runny and probably good for people with finer hair who don&#x27;t like the greasiness and heaviness of thicker oils. The oil also came with a handwritten thank you note and a small sample pack of the hair oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, you could probably buy similar oils from the grocery store and mix something with similar effectiveness and consistency for a much lower price. Personally, I didn&#x27;t see much of a result on my curly hair (3b), as it did little to improve frizz or detangling no matter how much I used, although I liked the smell. I think its consistency is too thin for my hair. If you are looking for the best oil for your hair, I suggest you experiment with the cheaper ones first before you get this expensive alternative.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old bi-racial (black/white) daughter has the most beautiful, curly hair; however it can can sometimes get very frizzy as the day goes on.  I purchased this all-natural product as a way to tame her hair and bring out those pretty curls.  This product is wonderful!  Her hair tends to get dry, so we condition with Darshana once a week.  In addition, we use the product daily in her hair.  Since using it, I notice her curls stay more defined with little to no frizz.  She used to get dry scalp/dandruff, but now it is gone thanks to Darshana!  I feel great knowing this is an all-natural product and it smells refreshing.  I get a lof of compliments on how great her hair smells. I even use it on my hair from time to time and love the way it makes my hair feel and smell.  I am so thankful that we found Darshana and will continue to be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an oil treatment like so many out there, nothing special. It smells great, but it works as well as putting coconut oil on your hair.</li>
            <li> As a biracial woman with natural hair, I was immediately skeptical of this product. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products, and a major deciding factor is fragrance, and sheen. What I love most about Darshana is that is smells SO good AND, my hand doesn&#x27;t look like i just dipped it in grease. This aint #SOULGLOW from Coming to America. It&#x27;s 10000% better. I tend to mix it with a cream based product and it&#x27;s been really working well for me. My curls are more tight, and defined.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great for my 4c hair!</li>
            <li> Awesome hair product, and very personable company. The packaging made me feel like they put a lot of time and effort into their product and into their customers. As for the oil, I can say that it does what all hair oils should do. I think they went above and beyond with their product.</li>
