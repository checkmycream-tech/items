            <li>It felt good on my skin</li>
            <li>always a good thing.  </li>
            <li>, it is a good value.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good product, price, substance and results.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good product.</li>
            <li>Loved what I read about the ratings.</li>
            <li>I am over 40 with oily, acne prone skin and a fair amount of sun damage.</li>
            <li>I loved the price, but I liked--didn&#x27;t love--the product.</li>
            <li>After using this for several weeks, I started doing a side to side comparison with another product as the best way to figure out which was best for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with how it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is RARE for me to write a review for ANY product, and if I do, it MUST be good!!</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer, cruelty-free, effective and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Now, this is the first product that I&#x27;ve found with excellent ingredients and a price, we can justify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>bottle is large, and even though the pump doesn&#x27;t work the greatest, I do prefer it over a dropper or pour type bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>It has a nice cooling effect.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.</li>
            <li>My own experience was as follows:</li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>packaging is nice too.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have see or feel any spectacular difference on my skin after using it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff does a nice job of plumping up your skin and making it feel and look smoother.  </li>
            <li>I have aging skin that has seen many a sunbeam in the decades I&#x27;ve enjoyed the great outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this brand and look forward to trying more formulas.</li>
            <li>This has a cooling effect that on hot summer days feels so Good!  </li>
            <li>and I liked the consistency of this serum quite a bit more.  </li>
            <li>Not odor-free, there is a mild (and to me, pleasant) scent from the geranium oil,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not odor-free, there is a mild (and to me, pleasant) scent from the geranium oil,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it .</li>
            <li>Smooth and healthy!</li>
            <li>Love it because it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than Watts.</li>
            <li>I did find that this lotion made my face look better.  </li>
            <li>but I am pleased with how my face looks without makeup now.  </li>
            <li>There are much better brands out there.</li>
            <li>Did it make my hand look 20? :-)</li>
            <li>Using over time may have more effect, but what it did from the get go was nothing to sneeze at.</li>
            <li>Try it. :-)</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>The Magic &amp; the Madness&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Healing a Midlife Crisis on El Camino de Santiago</li>
            <li>I apply this after I shower and then put lotion on top of it</li>
            <li>and the tone is more even.  </li>
            <li>I love this hyaluronic acid product, but also the retinol serum, peptides etc.</li>
            <li>and I am complimented quite often on how healthy my skin is.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to moisturize after it has soaked in.</li>
            <li>I like this product much better than any over the counter beauty skin products I have used.  </li>
            <li>Love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I decided to keep using it for a couple of weeks to be able to give a valid review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hydrated skin is more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My skin looks brighter ,more even toned and has minimized my breakouts.</li>
            <li>Sodium ascorbyl phosphate isn&#x27;t the most potent form of vitamin C</li>
            <li>This seems appropriate for all skin types.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>My face just feels fantastic!</li>
            <li>More time will tell on those.  </li>
            <li>Better even than the prescription vitamin A also.</li>
            <li>Thank you Watts, and keep bringing these great products at reasonable prices to us &amp;#34;working folks!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Great for those of us 60 years and older.</li>
            <li>The Watts beauty brand is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff use it every night and at a good price keeps my skin looking better</li>
            <li>To me this is more important than products with anti-wrinkle ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love that it is vegan, 100% cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I am 41 years old, and I have been using this for about 5 months, and my skin looks better now than when I was 20!!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s too much of other ingredients to get the best from this mixture.  </li>
            <li>Very very good product,seeing results all the time,nearly time for a new purchase,prompt delivery....Would recommend to friends,Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and is refreshing and cool in the summer.</li>
            <li>It feels very light and absorbs quickly, leaving no greasy feel or shine.  </li>
            <li>Or, perhaps they had read the label and noted the fine ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this skin gel because I am in my mid-30s and beginning to see fine lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li>It plumps my skin from the inside and the fine lines  seem to disappear.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and easily...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid so far!  </li>
            <li>Argan oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>After almost a full-month I have noticed that my skin is smooth and even smoother.</li>
            <li>skin therapy products fantastic....</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the primary reason I&#x27;ve given this a 4 instead of a 5 rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is fabulous.</li>
            <li>so I looked it up on the Internet and according to Wikipedia it is an amino acid and the L form of the Arginine plays an important role in cell division, the healing of wounds, removing ammonia from the body, immune function, and the release of hormones.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and do enjoy applying it.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizing serum, it actually has a tightening effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This was not for me, the herbal infusion listed as the primary ingredient caused me to break out.</li>
            <li>This product is so light it doesn&#x27;t create pimples; I still had my one or two, no change there.</li>
            <li>after 2 weeks my skin feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>this is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Watt&#x27;s Beauty Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid Advanced Skin Gel, 2.0 Ounce by Watt&#x27;s Beauty is something I look forward to applying morning and night.</li>
            <li>Good stuff helps clear complexion</li>
            <li>/&gt;It keeps my skin soft for more than an hour (so many moisturizers are nice when you first put them on, then...nothing.)</li>
            <li>It keeps the skin hydrated, it is not necessary to use cream after applying it, I highly recommend it, I&#x27;m very happy for having bought.</li>
            <li>It does comfortably and adequately tighten the skin and leave it feeling smooth and comfortable, without having to use additional products.</li>
            <li>From the reviews I thought that this would adequately moisturize my skin and plump/revitalize the collagen in my cheeks to minimize the fine lines.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li>I used this on my face for about 6 weeks in the morning and evening - and this didn&#x27;t make a significant impact for me to purchase the product again.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any significant differences</li>
            <li>Just apply to clean skin and follow with a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love Pure Body Naturals vitamin C serum and their hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
            <li>But I swear that my skin tone seems more even (meaning the brown spots are lightening, I assume) and it definitely makes my skin more moist and plumped out, which reduces the fine</li>
            <li>in the bright sun...and was astonished at how much younger my face looked!!</li>
            <li>I always tell my true age proudly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also still get pimples; not bad, but it seems like I&#x27;ve always got one or two.</li>
            <li>ok, I gave this a 4 star because I feel a little tingling when I use this so it makes me think its doing something good for my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t any more even, and it definitely isn&#x27;t any more moisturized.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a strong or noticeable odor, goes on smoothly and under your normal moisturizer with no problem.  </li>

            <li>I really like the way this goes on smoothly, and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed without any residue or greasy feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is rare for me to find products that don&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to get (and keep) healthy, CLEAR.</li>
            <li>SO FAR, I AM SATISFIED.  </li>
            <li>Love it - its light gelish and non-sticky and it last forever!!!</li>
            <li>THAT was worth it for me...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much since the price is so reasonable, but this has helped my cystic rosacea more than anything else.</li>
            <li>Because of the size of the product, I thought it would have a positive impact on my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love how light this is, it sinks right in and hydrates.</li>
            <li>This small bottle provides 2.0 ou. of great moisturizer at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good hyaluronic acid will make your skin feel tight right after you put it on.  </li>
            <li>I have used an entire bottle and to be quite honest, I can’t really tell any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I find it does a good job on wrinkles, makes them appear smoother and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid gel is a key ingredient in many moisturizers.</li>
            <li>then it did Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>After the first application, my skin felt smoother...</li>
            <li>I have used it alone, this was the first time using it as an ingredient in a product.</li>
            <li>and I have been so pleased with the results: my skin definitely looks plumper and softer.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m back to order more.  </li>
            <li>I appear much younger than I am according to most folks.  </li>
            <li>Three weeks is a short time to test a product like this, which claims to lighten and even out skin tone as well as make the skin more elastic and increase collagen.</li>
            <li>this product is moisturizing enough that I can go without anything on top of it if I&#x27;m not going out in the sun.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty stable in a product.</li>
            <li>(so I could have a comparison :&amp;#62;).  </li>
            <li>The packing isn&#x27;t a pretty as others but the product is just as good if not better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I use this alone but have mixed it in with my moisturizer and had the same good results.  </li>
            <li>This hyaluronic acid serum makes my skin feel super soft!</li>
            <li>It comes shooting out pretty fast</li>
            <li>It comes shooting out pretty fast</li>
            <li>This is the first one that really made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Overall I would say that this was a good purchase when you consider how much this type of product can actually cost.  </li>
            <li>It is a very nice, subtle change.</li>
            <li>We live in a warm and very humid climate, so dry skin is not so pronounced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a truly great product, Apparently the TSA thought so too, because the product was missing</li>
            <li>Go with Pure Body Naturals instead.</li>
            <li>I have found that using the Watts argan oil right after seals it in really well, then follow up with your normal moisturizer.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;My &amp;#34;takeaway&amp;#34; is that one should use this very sparingly, and certainly in a smaller dose than comes using the bottle&#x27;s sprayer (although the spray is surprisingly precise).  </li>
            <li>just 3 days later when I applied my foundation, it went on so smoothly</li>

            <li>I really like the texture and look of my skin after using this for about a month.</li>
            <li>It has played very well with all of my skin care and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It is very silky and goes on the skin well.  </li>
            <li>and I can absolutely tell the difference in my skin and joints.</li>
            <li>Put one pump of Argon oil into the palm of my hand and mix it with my Absolute moisturizer from Amazon and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It moisturized my skin very well, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it did much to improve my skin&#x27;s condition otherwise.</li>
            <li>However, there was a very noticeable change in my skin after a couple weeks, and friends told me that my skin was looking much nicer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really reasonable price for a Vitamin C product.</li>
            <li>and I really try to avoid it.....</li>
            <li>Reasonable product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my  soft and fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I learned several years ago from a dermatologist that hydrated skin stays young and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Watts Beauty Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid is a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; of several popular pro-skin ingredients* that, according to the company, &amp;#34;works great pn aging skin, uneven skin tones, dry skin, blemishes and more.&amp;#34; Those popular ingredients include  a blend of unspecified organic herbs ( as an infusion), Aloe Vera, Hyaluronic Acid, Witch Hazel, MS), Organic Jojoba Oil, Green Tea, Geranium Essential Oil, and Vitamin C (as sodium ascorbyl phosphate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel this would be the perfect product for someone either younger or with less dry skin.</li>
            <li>A nice product that actually works, as long as you keep your expectations reasonable.</li>
            <li>but I like the consistency and smell of this Watts product and the way it leaves my skin feeling perhaps more than the other three products.  </li>
            <li>More like a gel rather than watery like other</li>
            <li>The other serum is more watery.  </li>
            <li>the gel works better than other hyaluronic products.  </li>
            <li>most probably works well for other people, but I think they should disclose the&lt;br /&gt;ingredients</li>
            <li>After three weeks of usage, I did not see any more acne breakout, did not get any skin irritations and the dark spots are going away.  </li>
            <li>you have non sensitive and normal to dry skin, this would probably work better for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>older.</li>
            <li>Most I just buy at random at the drugstore, but sometimes I try more costly things.</li>
            <li>The main thing makes me won&#x27;t buy it again because it contains</li>
            <li>The Watts Beauty serum leaves my skin feeling tight if I don’t add a moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this product for your stock beauty supplies.</li>
            <li>,highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, fair, sensitive skin and live in the high desert - which is an extremely dry climate.</li>
            <li>Be sure to splash a little water  on your face and neck before putting on the serum as it helps in application.  </li>
            <li>All tout themselves as natural and mainly organic but who knows what that really means.  </li>
            <li>Because we love the Watt&#x27;s Argan Oil for our hair, I wanted to see if this product would help reduce the dark spots as well as clear up some acne areas.  </li>
            <li>Normally I use it in the morning and in the evening followed by any makeup I might wear during the day and night cream at night.  </li>
            <li>They all seem pretty much the same to me.</li>
            <li>This is actually one of the rare, repeat-purchase ones!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A dropper would have been worth the extra time it takes to apply compared to the spray.  </li>
            <li>This is quite light, although minimally oily upon first application, this dries after a short time.</li>
            <li>If this is new to you, I suggest getting the 1 ounce size.  </li>
            <li>If this is new to you, I suggest getting the 1 ounce size.  </li>
            <li>It is similar in appearance to serums but it absorbs a lot faster; it is supposed to function like a moisturizer but--on my skin at least--it is absorbed so quickly that not much seems to happen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin, no problems at all with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reason I docked this product a star is that though it is called a gel it&#x27;s pretty watery.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first skincare product I&#x27;ve used that made such a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Especially around my mouth - which is exactly what I do not want to do.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I turned red and broke out.  </li>
            <li>I have used 100% HYALURONIC ACID before, so it must be the primary ingredients in this one, if you are not sure order the 100% pure version.</li>
            <li>While this doesn&#x27;t quite live up to being moisturizing, I have found that in conjunction with my daily SPF and nightly argan oil routines my skin has a certain luminosity it didn&#x27;t have before.</li>
            <li>Have gotten several compliments on my skin and will keep using this as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>The gel absorbs easily and is not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, in the past year, I&#x27;ve tried four hyaluronic acid serums (including this one) and have been pleased with them all.  </li>
            <li>quick search of Wikipedia cites two studies in which a minimal surgical procedure using Hyaluronic Acid reduced neck wrinkles, two cites on the use of Arginine in treating wounds, and that Vitamin C acts as an anti-oxidant (although it also acts as a pro-oxidant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this is NOT a scientific analysis, just as there has been no scientific double-blind studies of this product ( to my knowledge anyway).  </li>
            <li>B00GUTLC0C #1 PREMIUM Hyaluronic Acid Serum - 100% Pure, Undiluted &amp; No Fillers - Ultimate</li>
            <li>She found that it absorbs very easily, and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel dry and tight.</li>
            <li>I experienced a slight pulling sensation as well, perhaps due to the witch hazel; again, not really noticeable after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>old and after 3 yrs.</li>
            <li>But, maybe I am asking for too much, after all I have only used it for three weeks.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels incredibly soft after using &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is something that your body produces when it&#x27;s young that makes your skin soft and youthful looking.  </li>
            <li>They seem to refine my pores and leave the skin feeling soft and do not irritate or cause any breakouts.  </li>
            <li>helped clear up adult acne (which I never used to get), scars and heal skin/</li>
            <li>I have flaky , crusty patches under my eyes, near the bridge of my nose and between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Finally this seems to have really helped the situation.  </li>
            <li>I have seen real results with it as I have an age spot that appeared at my temple and it has definitely lightened it quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I like this product but as to the appearance of my skin, I can’t really tell any difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Negatives: Like another reviewer, I find the pump puts out WAY too much product, you only need about 1/2 what it needed.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and moisturized without the oily shine some intensive moisturizers give.</li>
            <li>and I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li>Today is my last day using it and finished the whole 2oz bottle....</li>
            <li>Once it dries it feels like there is nothing on your skin, yet you feel completely hydrated and</li>
            <li>so people who are chemically sensitive,  like myself ,can research the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I usually end up just buying any old thing the next time, since very few have has really impressed me enough to keep buying it.</li>
            <li>When I tried it on its own, I liked it, but it did not deliver for me the powerful effect I have had in the past with some other Hyaluronic Acid serums, which have suddenly doubled their price, or which are expensive.</li>
            <li>I love the thicker consistency and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less economical than the larger, but you won&#x27;t risk as much money upfront in case</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less economical than the larger, but you won&#x27;t risk as much money upfront in case</li>
            <li>I do usually put an oily-like cream over top to sort of &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it in, then just follow with my regular makeup.</li>
            <li>That said, my skin is very dry and while this product did  a perfectly adequate job of keeping my skin refreshed and &amp;#34;plumped up (left side of my face), it felt like I needed a  lot of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The other product (on the right side of my face) made my skin feel softer to the touch.</li>
            <li>The bottom line for me is that I order a new bottle when the current one is about half full to guarantee I don&#x27;t run out - I don&#x27;t want to go a day without</li>
            <li>In general, with good moisturization, wrinkles are less apparent, and skin less likely to crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might get the Watts Beauty 100% pure hyaluronic acid instead next time if I want to get the similar serum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin type is different, and the environment in which they live.</li>
            <li>The only thing that&#x27;s really bugging me is the pump - it gives you the very same amount every time whether you like it or not.</li>
            <li>&gt; The only thing that&#x27;s really bugging me is the pump - it gives you the very same amount every time whether you like it or not.</li>
            <li>It was subtle but other people have commented that I look &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34;, that&#x27;s good enough for</li>
            <li>I used the Watts product because I have had success with other similar formulations.</li>
            <li>I generally apply this after my morning shower and again at night when I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>Really helped keep m face in check and  pretty much cleared the blemishes left behind by the pimples.</li>
            <li>As far as wrinkles, time will tell if it makes a big difference.  </li>
            <li>Works well to reduce wrinkles, age spots, and hydrate sensitive skin using some basic nature-based ingredients instead of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Recently I Have been using on my hands.(62 year old hands)..</li>
            <li>other nice thing about this serum is that it only takes a little bit to cover my face and neck and after I apply it I only need about half as much moisturizer</li>
            <li>(Black American light brown color with a combination of oily and dry skin).  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I feel like I can forgoe makeup on some days and wear less of it</li>
            <li>If you had dry skin this would be a plus not a negative.</li>
            <li>I mention this because the conditions under which I tested this product are more extreme than the usual person&#x27;s might be.</li>
            <li>and I find that the thicker gel goes a little farther and feels a little more luxurious on my skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle instructs you to use a small amount, but my wife had to use about 4-5 pumps to adequately moisturize her face and neck.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars only because I wish it would do a little more to fade my dark spots.  </li>
            <li>As someone with aging skin and with a family history of melanoma and other skin cancers, I have much experience in caring for my skin.</li>
            <li>remember those PBS shows with Dr. Perricone emphasizing how effective hyaluronic acid was; however, for most of us, the cost was outrageous.  </li>
            <li>product did not have any negative affect on my sensitive skin so that is worth one star)</li>
            <li>I had high hopes that this product but have seen absolutely no improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>This bottle does seem to be lasting a long time, so I will finish it up, I just won&#x27;t be repurchasing a new one afterward.</li>
            <li>I like the skin gel, but I just switched back to my classic yellow moisturizer because I don&#x27;t like the constant flakey, dry skin -</li>
            <li>The gel has a bit of an odd feel; it tightens and pulls gently and dries shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recently hospitalized for 16 days and during that time I completely neglected my skin so it was unusually dry by the time I came home.</li>
            <li>I have extra dry skin, but this leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized even before I put on</li>
            <li>With the exception of those persistent sun spots (grrr), my skin looks young and healthy and feels soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> , it is a good value.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good product, price, substance and results.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> Loved what I read about the ratings.</li>
            <li> I am over 40 with oily, acne prone skin and a fair amount of sun damage.</li>
            <li> I loved the price, but I liked--didn&#x27;t love--the product.</li>
            <li> After using this for several weeks, I started doing a side to side comparison with another product as the best way to figure out which was best for me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with how it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is RARE for me to write a review for ANY product, and if I do, it MUST be good!!</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer, cruelty-free, effective and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Now, this is the first product that I&#x27;ve found with excellent ingredients and a price, we can justify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> bottle is large, and even though the pump doesn&#x27;t work the greatest, I do prefer it over a dropper or pour type bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> It has a nice cooling effect.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.</li>
            <li> My own experience was as follows:</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> packaging is nice too.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have see or feel any spectacular difference on my skin after using it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does a nice job of plumping up your skin and making it feel and look smoother.  </li>
            <li> I have aging skin that has seen many a sunbeam in the decades I&#x27;ve enjoyed the great outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this brand and look forward to trying more formulas.</li>
            <li> This has a cooling effect that on hot summer days feels so Good!  </li>
            <li> and I liked the consistency of this serum quite a bit more.  </li>
            <li> Not odor-free, there is a mild (and to me, pleasant) scent from the geranium oil,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not odor-free, there is a mild (and to me, pleasant) scent from the geranium oil,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Smooth and healthy!</li>
            <li> Love it because it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than Watts.</li>
            <li> I did find that this lotion made my face look better.  </li>
            <li> but I am pleased with how my face looks without makeup now.  </li>
            <li> There are much better brands out there.</li>
            <li> Did it make my hand look 20? :-)</li>
            <li> Using over time may have more effect, but what it did from the get go was nothing to sneeze at.</li>
            <li> Try it. :-)</li>

            <li> I apply this after I shower and then put lotion on top of it</li>
            <li> and the tone is more even.  </li>
            <li> I love this hyaluronic acid product, but also the retinol serum, peptides etc.</li>
            <li> and I am complimented quite often on how healthy my skin is.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to moisturize after it has soaked in.</li>
            <li> I like this product much better than any over the counter beauty skin products I have used.  </li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep using it for a couple of weeks to be able to give a valid review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hydrated skin is more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter ,more even toned and has minimized my breakouts.</li>
            <li> Sodium ascorbyl phosphate isn&#x27;t the most potent form of vitamin C</li>
            <li> This seems appropriate for all skin types.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> My face just feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> More time will tell on those.  </li>
            <li> Better even than the prescription vitamin A also.</li>
            <li> Thank you Watts, and keep bringing these great products at reasonable prices to us &amp;#34;working folks!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Great for those of us 60 years and older.</li>
            <li> The Watts beauty brand is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff use it every night and at a good price keeps my skin looking better</li>
            <li> To me this is more important than products with anti-wrinkle ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love that it is vegan, 100% cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I am 41 years old, and I have been using this for about 5 months, and my skin looks better now than when I was 20!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s too much of other ingredients to get the best from this mixture.  </li>
            <li> Very very good product,seeing results all the time,nearly time for a new purchase,prompt delivery....Would recommend to friends,Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and is refreshing and cool in the summer.</li>
            <li> It feels very light and absorbs quickly, leaving no greasy feel or shine.  </li>
            <li> Or, perhaps they had read the label and noted the fine ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this skin gel because I am in my mid-30s and beginning to see fine lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li> It plumps my skin from the inside and the fine lines  seem to disappear.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and easily...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid so far!  </li>
            <li> Argan oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> After almost a full-month I have noticed that my skin is smooth and even smoother.</li>
            <li> skin therapy products fantastic....</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the primary reason I&#x27;ve given this a 4 instead of a 5 rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is fabulous.</li>
            <li> so I looked it up on the Internet and according to Wikipedia it is an amino acid and the L form of the Arginine plays an important role in cell division, the healing of wounds, removing ammonia from the body, immune function, and the release of hormones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and do enjoy applying it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing serum, it actually has a tightening effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was not for me, the herbal infusion listed as the primary ingredient caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> This product is so light it doesn&#x27;t create pimples; I still had my one or two, no change there.</li>
            <li> after 2 weeks my skin feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> Watt&#x27;s Beauty Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid Advanced Skin Gel, 2.0 Ounce by Watt&#x27;s Beauty is something I look forward to applying morning and night.</li>
            <li> Good stuff helps clear complexion</li>
            <li> /&gt;It keeps my skin soft for more than an hour (so many moisturizers are nice when you first put them on, then...nothing.)</li>
            <li> It keeps the skin hydrated, it is not necessary to use cream after applying it, I highly recommend it, I&#x27;m very happy for having bought.</li>
            <li> It does comfortably and adequately tighten the skin and leave it feeling smooth and comfortable, without having to use additional products.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I thought that this would adequately moisturize my skin and plump/revitalize the collagen in my cheeks to minimize the fine lines.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> I used this on my face for about 6 weeks in the morning and evening - and this didn&#x27;t make a significant impact for me to purchase the product again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any significant differences</li>
            <li> Just apply to clean skin and follow with a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I love Pure Body Naturals vitamin C serum and their hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
            <li> But I swear that my skin tone seems more even (meaning the brown spots are lightening, I assume) and it definitely makes my skin more moist and plumped out, which reduces the fine</li>
            <li> in the bright sun...and was astonished at how much younger my face looked!!</li>
            <li> I always tell my true age proudly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also still get pimples; not bad, but it seems like I&#x27;ve always got one or two.</li>
            <li> ok, I gave this a 4 star because I feel a little tingling when I use this so it makes me think its doing something good for my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t any more even, and it definitely isn&#x27;t any more moisturized.</li>

            <li> I really like the way this goes on smoothly, and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed without any residue or greasy feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is rare for me to find products that don&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to get (and keep) healthy, CLEAR.</li>
            <li> SO FAR, I AM SATISFIED.  </li>
            <li> Love it - its light gelish and non-sticky and it last forever!!!</li>
            <li> THAT was worth it for me...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much since the price is so reasonable, but this has helped my cystic rosacea more than anything else.</li>
            <li> Because of the size of the product, I thought it would have a positive impact on my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love how light this is, it sinks right in and hydrates.</li>
            <li> This small bottle provides 2.0 ou. of great moisturizer at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good hyaluronic acid will make your skin feel tight right after you put it on.  </li>
            <li> I have used an entire bottle and to be quite honest, I can’t really tell any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I find it does a good job on wrinkles, makes them appear smoother and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid gel is a key ingredient in many moisturizers.</li>
            <li> then it did Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> After the first application, my skin felt smoother...</li>
            <li> I have used it alone, this was the first time using it as an ingredient in a product.</li>
            <li> and I have been so pleased with the results: my skin definitely looks plumper and softer.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m back to order more.  </li>
            <li> I appear much younger than I am according to most folks.  </li>
            <li> Three weeks is a short time to test a product like this, which claims to lighten and even out skin tone as well as make the skin more elastic and increase collagen.</li>
            <li> this product is moisturizing enough that I can go without anything on top of it if I&#x27;m not going out in the sun.</li>
            <li> but it is pretty stable in a product.</li>
            <li> (so I could have a comparison :&amp;#62;).  </li>
            <li> The packing isn&#x27;t a pretty as others but the product is just as good if not better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I use this alone but have mixed it in with my moisturizer and had the same good results.  </li>
            <li> This hyaluronic acid serum makes my skin feel super soft!</li>
            <li> It comes shooting out pretty fast</li>
            <li> It comes shooting out pretty fast</li>
            <li> This is the first one that really made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Overall I would say that this was a good purchase when you consider how much this type of product can actually cost.  </li>
            <li> It is a very nice, subtle change.</li>
            <li> We live in a warm and very humid climate, so dry skin is not so pronounced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a truly great product, Apparently the TSA thought so too, because the product was missing</li>
            <li> Go with Pure Body Naturals instead.</li>
            <li> I have found that using the Watts argan oil right after seals it in really well, then follow up with your normal moisturizer.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;My &amp;#34;takeaway&amp;#34; is that one should use this very sparingly, and certainly in a smaller dose than comes using the bottle&#x27;s sprayer (although the spray is surprisingly precise).  </li>
            <li> just 3 days later when I applied my foundation, it went on so smoothly</li>

            <li> I really like the texture and look of my skin after using this for about a month.</li>
            <li> It has played very well with all of my skin care and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It is very silky and goes on the skin well.  </li>
            <li> and I can absolutely tell the difference in my skin and joints.</li>
            <li> Put one pump of Argon oil into the palm of my hand and mix it with my Absolute moisturizer from Amazon and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It moisturized my skin very well, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it did much to improve my skin&#x27;s condition otherwise.</li>
            <li> However, there was a very noticeable change in my skin after a couple weeks, and friends told me that my skin was looking much nicer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really reasonable price for a Vitamin C product.</li>
            <li> and I really try to avoid it.....</li>
            <li> Reasonable product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my  soft and fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I learned several years ago from a dermatologist that hydrated skin stays young and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Watts Beauty Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid is a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; of several popular pro-skin ingredients* that, according to the company, &amp;#34;works great pn aging skin, uneven skin tones, dry skin, blemishes and more.&amp;#34; Those popular ingredients include  a blend of unspecified organic herbs ( as an infusion), Aloe Vera, Hyaluronic Acid, Witch Hazel, MS), Organic Jojoba Oil, Green Tea, Geranium Essential Oil, and Vitamin C (as sodium ascorbyl phosphate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel this would be the perfect product for someone either younger or with less dry skin.</li>
            <li> A nice product that actually works, as long as you keep your expectations reasonable.</li>
            <li> but I like the consistency and smell of this Watts product and the way it leaves my skin feeling perhaps more than the other three products.  </li>
            <li> More like a gel rather than watery like other</li>
            <li> The other serum is more watery.  </li>
            <li> the gel works better than other hyaluronic products.  </li>
            <li> most probably works well for other people, but I think they should disclose the&lt;br /&gt;ingredients</li>
            <li> After three weeks of usage, I did not see any more acne breakout, did not get any skin irritations and the dark spots are going away.  </li>
            <li> you have non sensitive and normal to dry skin, this would probably work better for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> older.</li>
            <li> Most I just buy at random at the drugstore, but sometimes I try more costly things.</li>
            <li> The main thing makes me won&#x27;t buy it again because it contains</li>
            <li> The Watts Beauty serum leaves my skin feeling tight if I don’t add a moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this product for your stock beauty supplies.</li>
            <li> ,highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, fair, sensitive skin and live in the high desert - which is an extremely dry climate.</li>
            <li> Be sure to splash a little water  on your face and neck before putting on the serum as it helps in application.  </li>
            <li> All tout themselves as natural and mainly organic but who knows what that really means.  </li>
            <li> Because we love the Watt&#x27;s Argan Oil for our hair, I wanted to see if this product would help reduce the dark spots as well as clear up some acne areas.  </li>
            <li> Normally I use it in the morning and in the evening followed by any makeup I might wear during the day and night cream at night.  </li>
            <li> They all seem pretty much the same to me.</li>
            <li> This is actually one of the rare, repeat-purchase ones!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A dropper would have been worth the extra time it takes to apply compared to the spray.  </li>
            <li> This is quite light, although minimally oily upon first application, this dries after a short time.</li>
            <li> If this is new to you, I suggest getting the 1 ounce size.  </li>
            <li> If this is new to you, I suggest getting the 1 ounce size.  </li>
            <li> It is similar in appearance to serums but it absorbs a lot faster; it is supposed to function like a moisturizer but--on my skin at least--it is absorbed so quickly that not much seems to happen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin, no problems at all with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I docked this product a star is that though it is called a gel it&#x27;s pretty watery.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first skincare product I&#x27;ve used that made such a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Especially around my mouth - which is exactly what I do not want to do.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I turned red and broke out.  </li>
            <li> I have used 100% HYALURONIC ACID before, so it must be the primary ingredients in this one, if you are not sure order the 100% pure version.</li>
            <li> While this doesn&#x27;t quite live up to being moisturizing, I have found that in conjunction with my daily SPF and nightly argan oil routines my skin has a certain luminosity it didn&#x27;t have before.</li>
            <li> Have gotten several compliments on my skin and will keep using this as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> The gel absorbs easily and is not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, in the past year, I&#x27;ve tried four hyaluronic acid serums (including this one) and have been pleased with them all.  </li>
            <li> quick search of Wikipedia cites two studies in which a minimal surgical procedure using Hyaluronic Acid reduced neck wrinkles, two cites on the use of Arginine in treating wounds, and that Vitamin C acts as an anti-oxidant (although it also acts as a pro-oxidant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this is NOT a scientific analysis, just as there has been no scientific double-blind studies of this product ( to my knowledge anyway).  </li>

            <li> She found that it absorbs very easily, and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel dry and tight.</li>
            <li> I experienced a slight pulling sensation as well, perhaps due to the witch hazel; again, not really noticeable after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> old and after 3 yrs.</li>
            <li> But, maybe I am asking for too much, after all I have only used it for three weeks.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels incredibly soft after using &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is something that your body produces when it&#x27;s young that makes your skin soft and youthful looking.  </li>
            <li> They seem to refine my pores and leave the skin feeling soft and do not irritate or cause any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> helped clear up adult acne (which I never used to get), scars and heal skin/</li>
            <li> I have flaky , crusty patches under my eyes, near the bridge of my nose and between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Finally this seems to have really helped the situation.  </li>
            <li> I have seen real results with it as I have an age spot that appeared at my temple and it has definitely lightened it quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I like this product but as to the appearance of my skin, I can’t really tell any difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Negatives: Like another reviewer, I find the pump puts out WAY too much product, you only need about 1/2 what it needed.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and moisturized without the oily shine some intensive moisturizers give.</li>
            <li> and I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li> Today is my last day using it and finished the whole 2oz bottle....</li>
            <li> Once it dries it feels like there is nothing on your skin, yet you feel completely hydrated and</li>
            <li> so people who are chemically sensitive,  like myself ,can research the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I usually end up just buying any old thing the next time, since very few have has really impressed me enough to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> When I tried it on its own, I liked it, but it did not deliver for me the powerful effect I have had in the past with some other Hyaluronic Acid serums, which have suddenly doubled their price, or which are expensive.</li>
            <li> I love the thicker consistency and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less economical than the larger, but you won&#x27;t risk as much money upfront in case</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less economical than the larger, but you won&#x27;t risk as much money upfront in case</li>
            <li> I do usually put an oily-like cream over top to sort of &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it in, then just follow with my regular makeup.</li>
            <li> That said, my skin is very dry and while this product did  a perfectly adequate job of keeping my skin refreshed and &amp;#34;plumped up (left side of my face), it felt like I needed a  lot of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The other product (on the right side of my face) made my skin feel softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> The bottom line for me is that I order a new bottle when the current one is about half full to guarantee I don&#x27;t run out - I don&#x27;t want to go a day without</li>
            <li> In general, with good moisturization, wrinkles are less apparent, and skin less likely to crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might get the Watts Beauty 100% pure hyaluronic acid instead next time if I want to get the similar serum.</li>

            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin type is different, and the environment in which they live.</li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s really bugging me is the pump - it gives you the very same amount every time whether you like it or not.</li>
            <li> &gt; The only thing that&#x27;s really bugging me is the pump - it gives you the very same amount every time whether you like it or not.</li>
            <li> It was subtle but other people have commented that I look &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34;, that&#x27;s good enough for</li>
            <li> I used the Watts product because I have had success with other similar formulations.</li>
            <li> I generally apply this after my morning shower and again at night when I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> Really helped keep m face in check and  pretty much cleared the blemishes left behind by the pimples.</li>
            <li> As far as wrinkles, time will tell if it makes a big difference.  </li>
            <li> Works well to reduce wrinkles, age spots, and hydrate sensitive skin using some basic nature-based ingredients instead of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Recently I Have been using on my hands.(62 year old hands)..</li>
            <li> other nice thing about this serum is that it only takes a little bit to cover my face and neck and after I apply it I only need about half as much moisturizer</li>
            <li> (Black American light brown color with a combination of oily and dry skin).  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I feel like I can forgoe makeup on some days and wear less of it</li>
            <li> If you had dry skin this would be a plus not a negative.</li>
            <li> I mention this because the conditions under which I tested this product are more extreme than the usual person&#x27;s might be.</li>
            <li> and I find that the thicker gel goes a little farther and feels a little more luxurious on my skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle instructs you to use a small amount, but my wife had to use about 4-5 pumps to adequately moisturize her face and neck.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars only because I wish it would do a little more to fade my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> As someone with aging skin and with a family history of melanoma and other skin cancers, I have much experience in caring for my skin.</li>
            <li> remember those PBS shows with Dr. Perricone emphasizing how effective hyaluronic acid was; however, for most of us, the cost was outrageous.  </li>
            <li> product did not have any negative affect on my sensitive skin so that is worth one star)</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this product but have seen absolutely no improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> This bottle does seem to be lasting a long time, so I will finish it up, I just won&#x27;t be repurchasing a new one afterward.</li>
            <li> I like the skin gel, but I just switched back to my classic yellow moisturizer because I don&#x27;t like the constant flakey, dry skin -</li>
            <li> The gel has a bit of an odd feel; it tightens and pulls gently and dries shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recently hospitalized for 16 days and during that time I completely neglected my skin so it was unusually dry by the time I came home.</li>
            <li> I have extra dry skin, but this leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized even before I put on</li>
            <li> With the exception of those persistent sun spots (grrr), my skin looks young and healthy and feels soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another brand of hyaluronic acid that she has used left her skin feeling much too tight and dry, and had to be used with another moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Several breakouts with adult acne produced areas of dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> dont waste your money on high priced skin creams &amp; syrums.</li>
            <li> But it did look quite noticeably smoother and less old lady, instantly.</li>
            <li> 98% natural, 72% organic with ingredients such as aloe, witch hazel, botanical hyaluronic acid, MSM, L-arginine, carrageenan, jojoba oil, green tea, geranium essential oils, vitamin C, vitamin E (and including the preservatives sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wet with no drag.</li>
            <li> After the serum dries, I apply an additional moisturizer such as an Oil of Olay or derma-e product because I have rather dry, aging skin that needs</li>
            <li> I almost immediately noticed the improved moisture of her skin, especially, in our very dry climate.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything negative to say because it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or break me out..</li>
            <li> so it saves me money in the long run...</li>
            <li> and it took a LONG time to soak into my skin.</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if  any other product would have produced the same results.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of putting egg white on my face, except not as extreme.</li>
            <li> I find that some days I have to skip using it because it can cause your skin to dry out.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin is still dry.</li>
            <li> I put this gel on after washing my face with soap and water, and allow it to dry before doing anything else.</li>
            <li> It seems to draw moisture to the skin so your face doesn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
            <li> Phenoxyethanol(a preservative usually found in natural products) in it</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 5 other brands of serum and did not get any real benefit.</li>
            <li> Has a very faint smell but nothing overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Then I saw an ad in a magazine for Hyaluronic  Acid/Vitamin C; was skeptical but did some research on it and was interested in it enough to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It feels less coarse than it did.</li>
            <li> second day I was a bit red but no more break outs (thankfully).</li>
            <li> Very dry.  </li>
            <li> The scent of witch hazel was a bit predominant, which isn&#x27;t great, but also isn&#x27;t horrible.</li>
            <li> You need only a small amount on your finger tip and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like the small bottle, which will last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is another issue I would like to mention: While the writing on the front of the bottle is perfectly legible, the text that appears on the rest of the label is so tiny that even with glasses and a lighted magnifying glass it was difficult to make out.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done anything I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no change in my skin.</li>
            <li> The amount of this project is not very generous.  </li>

            <li> I have only been using this product a few days, but I have already noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and you will notice tiny lines on your face disappear.  </li>

            <li> I am generally a pretty skeptical person when it comes to skincare &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; products, and I wouldn&#x27;t call the results miraculous, but they are noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other hyaluronic acid serums that have been a thicker gel</li>
            <li> This serum is in a pump whereas my other brand is in eye dropper form.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that is due to the hyaluronic acid or something else in the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Use it every morning and night.  Love it because it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Seriously better then any expensive lotion. Will only be using this from now on. I also use it with a micro needle.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid gel is a key ingredient in many moisturizers. It has a nice cooling effect. You need only a small amount on your finger tip and it goes a long way. The Watts beauty brand is pretty good. I have one of their other products. I like the small bottle, which will last a long time. I highly recommend getting this product for your stock beauty supplies.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all of the great reviews, but I&#x27;ve given it a try for about 3 months now and haven&#x27;t seen any difference. My skin isn&#x27;t any more even, and it definitely isn&#x27;t any more moisturized. I don&#x27;t really have anything negative to say because it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or break me out.. it simply didn&#x27;t do anything. This bottle does seem to be lasting a long time, so I will finish it up, I just won&#x27;t be repurchasing a new one afterward.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff use it every night and at a good price keeps my skin looking better then it did Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Really great value. I love the thicker consistency and a little goes a long way. Has a very faint smell but nothing overwhelming. I use this after cleansing and with my micro needling. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Very very good product,seeing results all the time,nearly time for a new purchase,prompt delivery....Would recommend to friends,Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> 1st time using Watts.  Purchased due to other reviews. Hope this works</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. I use it under a moisturizer because it actually makes my skin feel a little tight immediately after use.</li>
            <li> Several breakouts with adult acne produced areas of dark spots on my face.  Because we love the Watt&#x27;s Argan Oil for our hair, I wanted to see if this product would help reduce the dark spots as well as clear up some acne areas.  The company sent us a sample when we ordered their Argan Oil.  I was skeptical about using this everyday because my skin is very sensitive, so I used it on my face every other day, once in the morning.  After three weeks of usage, I did not see any more acne breakout, did not get any skin irritations and the dark spots are going away.  Now that I know it will not damage my skin, I plan to purchase it again.  (Black American light brown color with a combination of oily and dry skin).  I wish the company would include a directional sheet with the product, because I need to use a magnifying glass to read the label directions.</li>
            <li> The convenience of a combo serum makes my beauty routine shorter. It is absorbed without any residue or greasy feeling on my skin. Great for those of us 60 years and older.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Stop, don&#x27;t look any further. You have found the hyaluronic/ vit C combo you want. A great product for a very great price. The packing isn&#x27;t a pretty as others but the product is just as good if not better than others I have tried. I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> Good stuff helps clear complexion</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done anything I expected it to do. Absolutely no change in my skin. After a few weeks I expected some improvement. A big waste of money!</li>
            <li> ok, I gave this a 4 star because I feel a little tingling when I use this so it makes me think its doing something good for my skin.</li>
            <li> The amount of this project is not very generous.  Because of the size of the product, I thought it would have a positive impact on my skin quickly.  Not so.  I cannot tell that anything at all has improved with my use of this product. I was careful to read and follow the instructions.  I will not be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Not at all impressed with the Watts beauty line. Go with Pure Body Naturals instead. I love Pure Body Naturals vitamin C serum and their hyaluronic acid serum. Much better quality than Watts.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with pimples popping up on my face, hormonal and otherwise. Really helped keep m face in check and  pretty much cleared the blemishes left behind by the pimples. After a week or so of using it definitely saw a difference. For the first time in my life I feel like I can forgoe makeup on some days and wear less of it bc my skin literally glowed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 yrs. old and after 3 yrs. of continuous physical/emotional stress, my skin looked well-worn and 10 yrs. older. I tried products by L&#x27;Oreal, Covergirl, Revlon, Neutragena but none seemed to make a difference. Then I saw an ad in a magazine for Hyaluronic  Acid/Vitamin C; was skeptical but did some research on it and was interested in it enough to give it a try. After the first application, my skin felt smoother...just 3 days later when I applied my foundation, it went on so smoothly and I noticed an improvement in the texture. After a little over a week, I happened to look into my cars exterior mirror...in the bright sun...and was astonished at how much younger my face looked!! Smooth and healthy! Believe me, this stuff works and I&#x27;ll be buying another bottle when this one is half gone...maybe even TWO bottles! I can&#x27;t say enough for this &amp;#34;magic potion&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Some of the ones with added vitamin C are too acidic - this is not. There&#x27;s just a little tingle.</li>
            <li> I did find that this lotion made my face look better.  It seemed to be a little brighter and it did face my dark spots a little.  Have only been using it for about three weeks but I am pleased with how my face looks without makeup now.  Normally I use it in the morning and in the evening followed by any makeup I might wear during the day and night cream at night.  Overall I would say that this was a good purchase when you consider how much this type of product can actually cost.  I gave it four stars only because I wish it would do a little more to fade my dark spots.  But, maybe I am asking for too much, after all I have only used it for three weeks.  I am happy with my purchase though and I did buy it a second time and I will probably buy it gain.</li>
            <li> I have used several different brands of hyaluronic acid gel.  This is the worst!  It&#x27;s very thin.  It feels like you&#x27;ve put water on your skin.  I tried reading the ingredients.  The printing was so small I had to get a magnifying glass to read them.  Hyaluronic Acid is the 4th ingredient.  There&#x27;s too much of other ingredients to get the best from this mixture.  Good hyaluronic acid will make your skin feel tight right after you put it on.  This did not.  My skin feels incredibly soft after using &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; hyaluronic acid.  This one didn&#x27;t make it feel that way.  I will not be buying this.  There are much better brands out there.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. I tested it on the back of one hand so I could compare it to the other hand without the product on it. I am 64. Did it make my hand look 20? :-) Well, no, of course not. But it did look quite noticeably smoother and less old lady, instantly. And that effect continued for a couple days without re-application. Might have longer but it was time to review. Using over time may have more effect, but what it did from the get go was nothing to sneeze at. So. A nice product that actually works, as long as you keep your expectations reasonable. Try it. :-)</li>
            <li> I am somewhat impressed but not overwhelmed by the effectiveness of this gel. It is similar in appearance to serums but it absorbs a lot faster; it is supposed to function like a moisturizer but--on my skin at least--it is absorbed so quickly that not much seems to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recently hospitalized for 16 days and during that time I completely neglected my skin so it was unusually dry by the time I came home. I mention this because the conditions under which I tested this product are more extreme than the usual person&#x27;s might be. After using it exclusively for three weeks, my skin is improving. It feels less coarse than it did. However, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if  any other product would have produced the same results. I was expecting to be amazed, but I&#x27;m not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another issue I would like to mention: While the writing on the front of the bottle is perfectly legible, the text that appears on the rest of the label is so tiny that even with glasses and a lighted magnifying glass it was difficult to make out.</li>
            <li> I am all about keeping my skin hydrated. To me this is more important than products with anti-wrinkle ingredients. Argan oil is fantastic. I have used it alone, this was the first time using it as an ingredient in a product. I was very happy as it didn&#x27;t make me break out and makes my skin look great. I love that it is vegan, 100% cruelty free. I do still use coconut oil as I think that is a miracle product but this was great to use under makeup. I kept my skin hydrated but wasn&#x27;t oily and there were no problems applying make up. It is rare for me to find products that don&#x27;t make me break out. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this for a couple of weeks. It felt good on my skin and I was seeing results. It&#x27;s a truly great product, Apparently the TSA thought so too, because the product was missing and I found a TSA inspection card in my luggage. Oh well, in all fairness, the people inspecting my suitcase may have accidentally forgot to put it back. Or, perhaps they had read the label and noted the fine ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn&#x27;t Work&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Expats in Cuenca, Ecuador: The Magic &amp; the Madness&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Healing a Midlife Crisis on El Camino de Santiago&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;The Quilotoa Loop: Ecuador’s Hidden Treasure</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is something that your body produces when it&#x27;s young that makes your skin soft and youthful looking.  As we age we produce less and less of it and as a result our skin loses it&#x27;s luster.  I started using hyaluronic acid serum about a year ago and I have been so pleased with the results: my skin definitely looks plumper and softer.  I am generally a pretty skeptical person when it comes to skincare &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; products, and I wouldn&#x27;t call the results miraculous, but they are noticeable.  The bottom line for me is that I order a new bottle when the current one is about half full to guarantee I don&#x27;t run out - I don&#x27;t want to go a day without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other nice thing about this serum is that it only takes a little bit to cover my face and neck and after I apply it I only need about half as much moisturizer so it saves me money in the long run... always a good thing.  The only reason I docked this product a star is that though it is called a gel it&#x27;s pretty watery.  I&#x27;ve used other hyaluronic acid serums that have been a thicker gel and I find that the thicker gel goes a little farther and feels a little more luxurious on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer, cruelty-free, effective and not greasy.  I can&#x27;t detect a scent.  I use it at night, so I can&#x27;t say how well it acts as a base for makeup.  At the current price, just under fourteen dollars for 2 oz., it is a good value.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months on my neck, and the results are incredible. I apply this after I shower and then put lotion on top of it and it works great! I find that some days I have to skip using it because it can cause your skin to dry out. It may work different for you though! Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this took years off my looks or that it&#x27;s the Fountain of Youth, but after using this for 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin definitely looks brighter and smoother and the tone is more even.  It was subtle but other people have commented that I look &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34;, that&#x27;s good enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a strong or noticeable odor, goes on smoothly and under your normal moisturizer with no problem.  I have VERY sensitive skin, no problems at all with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this when I run out.  It&#x27;s the first skincare product I&#x27;ve used that made such a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, fair, sensitive skin and live in the high desert - which is an extremely dry climate. I wanted to try this skin gel because I am in my mid-30s and beginning to see fine lines around my mouth. From the reviews I thought that this would adequately moisturize my skin and plump/revitalize the collagen in my cheeks to minimize the fine lines. After almost a full-month I have noticed that my skin is smooth and even smoother. However, this skin gel dries out my face. Especially around my mouth - which is exactly what I do not want to do. I am supplementing with coconut oil and tried argon oil, but it made my skin sting. I like the skin gel, but I just switched back to my classic yellow moisturizer because I don&#x27;t like the constant flakey, dry skin - it&#x27;s embarrassing. This does work; however for me the tradeoff is not worth it.</li>
            <li> 98% natural, 72% organic with ingredients such as aloe, witch hazel, botanical hyaluronic acid, MSM, L-arginine, carrageenan, jojoba oil, green tea, geranium essential oils, vitamin C, vitamin E (and including the preservatives sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this, you apply it after washing and pat drying the face and, of course, after the application of any toners, if you use them.  After the serum dries, I apply an additional moisturizer such as an Oil of Olay or derma-e product because I have rather dry, aging skin that needs extra care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, in the past year, I&#x27;ve tried four hyaluronic acid serums (including this one) and have been pleased with them all.

All tout themselves as natural and mainly organic but who knows what that really means.  I just like the results I get from hyaluronic acid skin products.  They seem to refine my pores and leave the skin feeling soft and do not irritate or cause any breakouts.  These, of course, are just my personal results.  YMMV.just my personal results.  YMMV.</li>
            <li> I use different types of moisturizers. Most I just buy at random at the drugstore, but sometimes I try more costly things. They all seem pretty much the same to me. Even the expensive ones. I usually end up just buying any old thing the next time, since very few have has really impressed me enough to keep buying it. This is actually one of the rare, repeat-purchase ones!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my skin soft for more than an hour (so many moisturizers are nice when you first put them on, then...nothing.) I do usually put an oily-like cream over top to sort of &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it in, then just follow with my regular makeup. I really like the texture and look of my skin after using this for about a month. I also love that it isn&#x27;t some way over-priced thing!! It is definitely worth trying! and I for one will be getting this again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to get (and keep) healthy, CLEAR. Skin. I started using watts products... Amazing. I love this hyaluronic acid product, but also the retinol serum, peptides etc. helped clear up adult acne (which I never used to get), scars and heal skin/ scabs.&lt;br /&gt;their skin therapy products fantastic....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken me forever to finish this product and I&#x27;m back to order more.  My skin is dry.  Very dry.  I have flaky , crusty patches under my eyes, near the bridge of my nose and between my eyebrows. These area are usually considered the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone isn&#x27;t it?  Aren&#x27;t these areas supposed to be oily?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried various moisturizers.  I drink lots of water, my house has a humidifier in it and I don&#x27;t use soap to wash my face.  My skin is still dry. Finally this seems to have really helped the situation.  I&#x27;m seeing results.  If I use it daily my skin stays hydrated.  Miss it and I see the issue return so it&#x27;s doing what its supposed to do in my book.</li>
            <li> This small bottle provides 2.0 ou. of great moisturizer at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember those PBS shows with Dr. Perricone emphasizing how effective hyaluronic acid was; however, for most of us, the cost was outrageous.  Now, this is the first product that I&#x27;ve found with excellent ingredients and a price, we can justify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses this, and loves it.  I almost immediately noticed the improved moisture of her skin, especially, in our very dry climate.  She appreciates that her sensitve skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated or break out.  As far as wrinkles, time will tell if it makes a big difference.  In general, with good moisturization, wrinkles are less apparent, and skin less likely to crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product, price, substance and results.</li>
            <li> I could not believe the complements that I received from my friends after using this product. I thought that it improved my complexion, but it was the complements that I received that proved it!</li>
            <li> I learned several years ago from a dermatologist that hydrated skin stays young and healthy.  I drink water all day everyday and take supplements to keep my skin healthy.&lt;br /&gt; I take [[ASIN:B000QS10LY Neocell Hyaluronic Acid From Rooster Comb, 100 Mg, 60 Count]] and [[ASIN:B00028NGEC Neocell Super Collagen Type 1 and 3 plus Vitamin C Tablets, 250 Count]] daily and started using [[ASIN:B00720ITUE WattsBeauty 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Solution, Paraben &amp; Alcohol Free / Multi-use - 30ml]] last year as well.&lt;br /&gt;I will be 45 at the end of July and I am complimented quite often on how healthy my skin is.  I work outside, ocean front and have to contend with, sun, sand and salt air.  I appear much younger than I am according to most folks.  I always tell my true age proudly.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this gel from Watts Beauty and I&#x27;m very pleased with how it feels on my skin.  This has a cooling effect that on hot summer days feels so Good!  I generally apply this after my morning shower and again at night when I wash my face.  I use this alone but have mixed it in with my moisturizer and had the same good results.  Very pleased with this brand and look forward to trying more formulas.</li>
            <li> JUST STARTED USING YESTERDAY.  SO FAR, I AM SATISFIED.  WAITING FOR VISIBLE RESULTS TO REPORT ON LATER.</li>
            <li> Great Product. More like a gel rather than watery like other brands.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a definite improvement in skin tecture within a week.</li>
            <li> Watts Beauty Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid is a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; of several popular pro-skin ingredients* that, according to the company, &amp;#34;works great pn aging skin, uneven skin tones, dry skin, blemishes and more.&amp;#34; Those popular ingredients include  a blend of unspecified organic herbs ( as an infusion), Aloe Vera, Hyaluronic Acid, Witch Hazel, MS), Organic Jojoba Oil, Green Tea, Geranium Essential Oil, and Vitamin C (as sodium ascorbyl phosphate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick search of Wikipedia cites two studies in which a minimal surgical procedure using Hyaluronic Acid reduced neck wrinkles, two cites on the use of Arginine in treating wounds, and that Vitamin C acts as an anti-oxidant (although it also acts as a pro-oxidant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this is NOT a scientific analysis, just as there has been no scientific double-blind studies of this product ( to my knowledge anyway).  Watts, at least, knows enough science to package this in a dark-colored bottle, to prevent oxidation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that results, both positive and negative, will vary, and that your experience may be the best predictor of whether this will work for you.  That, and perhaps your expectations (this will may me look 10 years younger vs. lower expectations). My own experience was as follows: This is quite light, although minimally oily upon first application, this dries after a short time. I experienced a slight pulling sensation as well, perhaps due to the witch hazel; again, not really noticeable after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My &amp;#34;takeaway&amp;#34; is that one should use this very sparingly, and certainly in a smaller dose than comes using the bottle&#x27;s sprayer (although the spray is surprisingly precise).  I recommend spraying the hand, and then dipping one&#x27;s finger into it for application.  A dropper would have been worth the extra time it takes to apply compared to the spray.  That&#x27;s the primary reason I&#x27;ve given this a 4 instead of a 5 rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I&#x27;m reluctant to offer a testimonial about dermal outcomes (I think I just made up a word).  The organic, cruelty-free (not tested on animals-great!) ingredients should perhaps be compared to what you&#x27;ve used in the past.  If this is new to you, I suggest getting the 1 ounce size.  It&#x27;s less economical than the larger, but you won&#x27;t risk as much money upfront in case this either has undesired results, or does not produce the results you expect.

            <li> The go-to hyaluronic serum for my morning routine and post derma rolling! Be sure to moisturize after it has soaked in.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on expensive serums.  This is fabulous. Use a clarasonic, a 30% peel, and this product every day. Your skin will look very nice.</li>
            <li> I am always on the search for that fountain of youth in a bottle. Something to give my face a boost and keep the aging process at bay a little longer. While this doesn&#x27;t quite live up to being moisturizing, I have found that in conjunction with my daily SPF and nightly argan oil routines my skin has a certain luminosity it didn&#x27;t have before. It has played very well with all of my skin care and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is large, and even though the pump doesn&#x27;t work the greatest, I do prefer it over a dropper or pour type bottle.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has been clearer, it doesn&#x27;t make me shiner nor is it drying. Truly, this is as close to the fabled fountain as I&#x27;ve found! For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong giving it a try in your skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I like this Watts Beauty Hyaluronic Acid Serum enhanced with Vitamin C &amp; L-Arginine.  I had never heard of L-Arginine so I looked it up on the Internet and according to Wikipedia it is an amino acid and the L form of the Arginine plays an important role in cell division, the healing of wounds, removing ammonia from the body, immune function, and the release of hormones.  I had been using a different brand of serum with C + E + Ferulic Acid.  I have seen real results with it as I have an age spot that appeared at my temple and it has definitely lightened it quite a bit.  This serum is in a pump whereas my other brand is in eye dropper form.  I prefer this pump style and I liked the consistency of this serum quite a bit more.  It is very silky and goes on the skin well.  The other serum is more watery.  The Watts Beauty serum leaves my skin feeling tight if I don’t add a moisturizer on top.  I have used an entire bottle and to be quite honest, I can’t really tell any difference in my skin.  I do like the consistency and the ability to pump a small amount into my hand or on my fingers.  The eye dropper brand has a tendency to run like water of the skin or off my hands.  Overall, I like this product but as to the appearance of my skin, I can’t really tell any difference.</li>
            <li> I like this product much better than any over the counter beauty skin products I have used.  Works well to reduce wrinkles, age spots, and hydrate sensitive skin using some basic nature-based ingredients instead of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, with normal-dry skin. I try to treat it well but will admit I can be lazy with all the lotions and potions lately. I love how light this is, it sinks right in and hydrates. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and do enjoy applying it. But beyond that, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements. The only thing that&#x27;s really bugging me is the pump - it gives you the very same amount every time whether you like it or not. Sometimes I want a pump and 1/2 of the product and that&#x27;s nearly impossible. It comes shooting out pretty fast and I&#x27;ve wasted some because of that...So, while I do like the product for the hydration, I won&#x27;t buy anymore when I run out.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone and oily skin. I also tan. I have only been using this product a few days, but I have already noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance. This is a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product so you aren&#x27;t going to look like you had cosmetic surgery after you use this. It is a very nice, subtle change. The product feels great on your skin, it doesn&#x27;t affect my acne prone skin which is great. I also use it under grapeseed oil on my face overnight. I will continue using Watt&#x27;s products as I think they deliver results.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!  I will definitely be purchasing this oil on a regular basis--I can feel my skin &amp;#34;Drink&amp;#34; it in.  I have been taking Hyaluronic supplements for almost a year and I can absolutely tell the difference in my skin and joints.</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> As someone with aging skin and with a family history of melanoma and other skin cancers, I have much experience in caring for my skin. I used the Watts product because I have had success with other similar formulations. After using this for several weeks, I started doing a side to side comparison with another product as the best way to figure out which was best for me. That said, my skin is very dry and while this product did  a perfectly adequate job of keeping my skin refreshed and &amp;#34;plumped up (left side of my face), it felt like I needed a  lot of moisturizer. The other product (on the right side of my face) made my skin feel softer to the touch. I feel this would be the perfect product for someone either younger or with less dry skin. In fact I recommended it to a friend who was looking for something to rejuvenate her skin. I saw no difference in the appearance of the two sides and neither did anyone I asked to compare.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing serum, it actually has a tightening effect.&lt;br /&gt;I currently use tretinoin/hydroquione cream and it is drying, and this serum helps to fight lizard face.</li>
            <li> My wife tested this product, designed to hydrate the skin of your neck and face. The bottle instructs you to use a small amount, but my wife had to use about 4-5 pumps to adequately moisturize her face and neck. She found that it absorbs very easily, and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel dry and tight. It does comfortably and adequately tighten the skin and leave it feeling smooth and comfortable, without having to use additional products. Another brand of hyaluronic acid that she has used left her skin feeling much too tight and dry, and had to be used with another moisturizer. This Watts Beauty product works well for her alone, or underneath makeup. Everyone&#x27;s skin type is different, and the environment in which they live. We live in a warm and very humid climate, so dry skin is not so pronounced. She also prefers the pump dispenser on this product to a comparable brands&#x27; rubber dropper.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this for Vine review.  My skin: I&#x27;m in my lat 40s, with fair,sensitive, oily skin. I try a lot of product but often can&#x27;t use them because of sensitivity. That was the case with this product. The first time I used it, I turned red and broke out.  I decided to keep using it for a couple of weeks to be able to give a valid review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second day I was a bit red but no more break outs (thankfully). Every day I used it, I got red blotches. I don&#x27;t know if that is due to the hyaluronic acid or something else in the product. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: Like another reviewer, I find the pump puts out WAY too much product, you only need about 1/2 what it needed.  2: It feels like vegetable glycerin is the carrier for this and it took a LONG time to soak into my skin. If you had dry skin this would be a plus not a negative. 2nd: the print on the label is so small!!! I had to get a magnifying glass to read it because I couldn&#x27;t with my contacts and reading glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have non sensitive and normal to dry skin, this would probably work better for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The only thing that&#x27;s really bugging me is the pump - it gives you the very same amount every time whether you like it or not. Sometimes I want a pump and 1/2 of the product and that&#x27;s nearly impossible. It comes shooting out pretty fast and I&#x27;ve wasted some because of that...So, while I do like the product for the hydration, I won&#x27;t buy anymore when I run out.</li>
            <li> Hydrated skin is more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This product softens the appearance of lines and causes whatever else you&#x27;re using to work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleanse my face, use the serum.  Put one pump of Argon oil into the palm of my hand and mix it with my Absolute moisturizer from Amazon and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is nice too.  Practical.  No frills, just results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice a day for a few months now. I&#x27;m still not sure if it&#x27;s working. I just started putting it on my chest in the a.m. we shall see what happends......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been spending hundreds of dollars on department store skin care and my skin has improved more in 4 weeks than in 20 years using expensive brands. My skin is soft and moisturized without the oily shine some intensive moisturizers give. It plumps my skin from the inside and the fine lines  seem to disappear. I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> Recently I Have been using on my hands.(62 year old hands).. It is smoothing &amp; fading age spots... Every where I use it .. I am so pleased with the results!!</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different. I used this on my face for about 6 weeks in the morning and evening - and this didn&#x27;t make a significant impact for me to purchase the product again. I&#x27;ll be trying other formulas.</li>
            <li> Ordered the product not knowing anything about it.  Loved what I read about the ratings. This was an excellent choice and excellent price.  I do get positve comments about my skin.  I use it on my face, neck, upper body.  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Saw this advertised on Dr. Oz and I was really surprised.  Use it everyday and you will notice tiny lines on your face disappear.  Didn&#x27;t notice anything on the chin line or my hands, though.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money on high priced skin creams &amp; syrums. this stuff works. does what it promisses &amp; great for sensative skin.,highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> Love it - its light gelish and non-sticky and it last forever!!! Definitely will order next time.</li>
            <li> This has cleaned and reduced my pores , use it under moisturizer , it is exfoliating my skin because the bumps I had are gone and this has bring all my white heads to the surface. My skin looks brighter ,more even toned and has minimized my breakouts. The only thing that has inspired me to write a review about it .</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day in conjunction with other lotions and toner. When I tried it on its own, I liked it, but it did not deliver for me the powerful effect I have had in the past with some other Hyaluronic Acid serums, which have suddenly doubled their price, or which are expensive. I may continue exploring within the brand, once I finish this one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40s and have not noticed any difference, it may work on younger skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This was not for me, the herbal infusion listed as the primary ingredient caused me to break out. I have used 100% HYALURONIC ACID before, so it must be the primary ingredients in this one, if you are not sure order the 100% pure version.</li>
            <li> I am over 40 with oily, acne prone skin and a fair amount of sun damage. I bought the 2 oz. pump about 3 months ago and am just finishing the bottle. I loved the price, but I liked--didn&#x27;t love--the product. I did like the consistency, absorbency, and moisturizing qualities of the product. I had no concerns regarding the quality of the ingredients. The bottle and dispenser are also very good. The scent of witch hazel was a bit predominant, which isn&#x27;t great, but also isn&#x27;t horrible. I&#x27;m on the fence whether this helped or hurt with regards to breakouts. Finally, I wasn&#x27;t overwhelmed with the treatment impact. It moisturized my skin very well, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it did much to improve my skin&#x27;s condition otherwise. Very middle of the road product in my experience and for my skin. I may try another Watts product in the future, because they&#x27;re so affordable, but I think I&#x27;ll keep looking around for now.</li>
            <li> I know these type of products don&#x27;t work for everyone, and this one does not make you a teenager again. However, there was a very noticeable change in my skin after a couple weeks, and friends told me that my skin was looking much nicer.  Be sure to splash a little water  on your face and neck before putting on the serum as it helps in application.  You only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> It keeps the skin hydrated, it is not necessary to use cream after applying it, I highly recommend it, I&#x27;m very happy for having bought.</li>
            <li> Three weeks is a short time to test a product like this, which claims to lighten and even out skin tone as well as make the skin more elastic and increase collagen. These things don&#x27;t happen overnight. But I swear that my skin tone seems more even (meaning the brown spots are lightening, I assume) and it definitely makes my skin more moist and plumped out, which reduces the fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 59, have combination skin, and have sun damage from growing up in Southern California in the &#x27;60s. I also still get pimples; not bad, but it seems like I&#x27;ve always got one or two. I put this gel on after washing my face with soap and water, and allow it to dry before doing anything else. The gel has a bit of an odd feel; it tightens and pulls gently and dries shiny. It reminds me of putting egg white on my face, except not as extreme. At this time of year (summer) this product is moisturizing enough that I can go without anything on top of it if I&#x27;m not going out in the sun. This product is so light it doesn&#x27;t create pimples; I still had my one or two, no change there. It works well under a primer &amp; makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they gave the percentage of Vitamin C in the product. Sodium ascorbyl phosphate isn&#x27;t the most potent form of vitamin C but it is pretty stable in a product. I like that the product is not tested on animals and that it&#x27;s organic. It&#x27;s a really reasonable price for a Vitamin C product. I&#x27;m pretty happy with it .</li>
            <li> Today is my last day using it and finished the whole 2oz bottle....it lasted a 6 months with day and night using.  It is somewhat moisturizing but I don&#x27;t have see or feel any spectacular difference on my skin after using it.  It has very little of vitamin C in it which I definitely cannot feel it.  The main thing makes me won&#x27;t buy it again because it contains Phenoxyethanol(a preservative usually found in natural products) in it and I really try to avoid it.....though it&#x27;s really hard to find products not containing it.  It might get the Watts Beauty 100% pure hyaluronic acid instead next time if I want to get the similar serum.</li>
            <li> This stuff does a nice job of plumping up your skin and making it feel and look smoother.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> after 2 weeks my skin feels fantastic. some of my &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; spots have started fading and my husband said, hmmm...what&#x27;s different. THAT was worth it for me...he didn&#x27;t notice when I cut 4 inches off my hair.</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic product.  especially if you are micro-needling.  the gel works better than other hyaluronic products.  I use it often in combination w/other skin care products @ night.  very happy w/this-- have used it for 2 years.</li>
            <li> After using this gel underneath my regular moisturizer it seems this increases the radiance of your skin. The gel absorbs easily and is not greasy or heavy. It is easy to apply and is refreshing and cool in the summer. It seems to draw moisture to the skin so your face doesn&#x27;t feel dry. This seems appropriate for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> Reasonable product at a reasonable price.  Haven&#x27;t seen any significant differences but I do miss it when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic acid serum makes my skin feel super soft! I have tried at least 5 other brands of serum and did not get any real benefit. This is the first one that really made a difference in my skin. Skin feels hydrated. Not sure if having the vitamin c and l- arginine in the serum makes the difference but I love it. I use it before a few drops of argan oil. Keeps my  soft and fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Watt&#x27;s Beauty Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid Advanced Skin Gel, 2.0 Ounce by Watt&#x27;s Beauty is something I look forward to applying morning and night. It goes on so smoothly and easily...wet with no drag. It cools slightly and just melts into your skin effortlessly. Once it dries it feels like there is nothing on your skin, yet you feel completely hydrated and soothed.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have skin issues to repair; nothing to report as miraculously healed. BUT, I will say that I don&#x27;t want to run out of this stuff! My face just feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this - I must be allergic to whatever plant this is derived from!&lt;br /&gt;It most probably works well for other people, but I think they should disclose the&lt;br /&gt;ingredients so people who are chemically sensitive,  like myself ,can research the ingredients.  I was having a serious&lt;br /&gt;problem with my throat and swallowing - it was really scary.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this product but have seen absolutely no improvement in my skin.  I&#x27;ve used it on my neck and chest and one side of my face (so I could have a comparison :&amp;#62;).  I have aging skin that has seen many a sunbeam in the decades I&#x27;ve enjoyed the great outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to look for products that can help with damage control.&lt;br /&gt;(this product did not have any negative affect on my sensitive skin so that is worth one star)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid so far!  It feels very light and absorbs quickly, leaving no greasy feel or shine.  I have extra dry skin, but this leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized even before I put on my regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles are less noticeable, and I think my dark/sun spots have faded just slightly.  More time will tell on those.  With the exception of those persistent sun spots (grrr), my skin looks young and healthy and feels soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much since the price is so reasonable, but this has helped my cystic rosacea more than anything else. Better even than the prescription vitamin A also.</li>
            <li> It is RARE for me to write a review for ANY product, and if I do, it MUST be good!! But I have used several of the Watts serums and oils, and they all work wonders!!! This literally make your skin glow, decrease blemishes and pimples, and give an all-over firming appearance. After my cleanser, I use my toner, then apply this all over. I have found that using the Watts argan oil right after seals it in really well, then follow up with your normal moisturizer.  This serum of Hyaluronic acid/Vitamin C-L Arginine  is a great mix and my face has never looked better or healthier!! Note: I am 41 years old, and I have been using this for about 5 months, and my skin looks better now than when I was 20!! Thank you Watts, and keep bringing these great products at reasonable prices to us &amp;#34;working folks!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really like the way this goes on smoothly, and is quickly absorbed. I find it does a good job on wrinkles, makes them appear smoother and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Has made a noticeable  difference in skin texture and firmness.  Just apply to clean skin and follow with a moisturizer.  I use this morning and night.  Have gotten several compliments on my skin and will keep using this as long as it is available.</li>
