            <li>and I love them!</li>

            <li>its easy to pack on powder but not that great.</li>
            <li>great brushes, sheds lightly however one wash fixes that.</li>
            <li>, i would have liked to pay attention to the comments</li>
            <li>The brushes that are supposed to be nice n</li>
            <li>&amp; you&#x27;ll be happy with your purchase for sure : )</li>
            <li>I tossed the crappy 16 brushes and put my own brushes in it..</li>
            <li>The powder brushes are nice.</li>
            <li>it really isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>The brushes were nice quality and the case is nicer than the picture shows.</li>
            <li>The stiffness is the eye brushes are nice cause</li>
            <li>it is wonderful and came fast.</li>
            <li>But the brush case is really nice</li>
            <li>These r awesome can do many different looks of make up love this and very appropriate pricing!!!</li>
            <li>and I still ues them good to start with easy to use</li>
            <li>All these brushes have a very strong chemical odor to them.  </li>
            <li>if you want good cheap brushes stick with elfs studio line and</li>
            <li>These brushes suck, they&#x27;re very cheap and brittle.</li>
            <li>This product was very cheap in quality...</li>
            <li>and i feel confident about them</li>
            <li>The brushes were okay.</li>
            <li>I had to go and spend more money to get more brushes</li>
            <li>Love makeup n</li>
            <li>for the price of these brushes, it is a good deal but these brushes are more for like fun.</li>
            <li>I wish the case that it was in was better quality</li>
            <li>All of the brushes were losing so many bristles</li>
            <li>so many hairs fell out.</li>
            <li>and then il ll be able to use them.</li>
            <li>Planning on buying some more to give as gifts to the teenagers in the family.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>One of the eye brushes remind me of the MAC 217 eye brushes but a lot more inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The brushes are cute, but some broke off the handle already</li>
            <li>they look amazing and dont look cheap at all...</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay, apply the product well, there&#x27;s no complaining here.</li>
            <li>and i have to say it seemed like i paid much more for this set than I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will go away...</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t bother me anyways : )</li>
            <li>these brushes are ok, but i guess you could expect that based off the price.  </li>
            <li>She is going to love it</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>The make-up brushes from the dollar store are way better.</li>
            <li>They wash up very nicely and seem to be holding up very well.</li>
            <li>I really really like, the liner brush!!!!</li>
            <li>For the professional they do make wonderful &amp;#34;gut&amp;#34; brushes for special F/X.</li>
            <li>I like to buy my brushes in sets like this because you generally get a good amount of fairly good brushes.  </li>
            <li>And they are super cute too!  </li>
            <li>I like the brushes they&#x27;re really soft and blend really beautifully</li>
            <li>And just get good real techniques, Eco tools,  or if your in the mood to spend a lot Mac brushes!</li>
            <li>and they are pretty good.</li>
            <li>Pretty good brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>The pigment pick up is great and the brushes do such an amazing job at blending.</li>
            <li>I think the reason why people made good comments were because initially, they were good brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and flexible, meaning they won&#x27;t dig into your makeup (if that makes sense lol).</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product and the seller!</li>
            <li>but the brush for the eyes are great except the blending brush, its not fluffy..</li>
            <li>and the pink case is awesome</li>
            <li>But all in all I really do find them to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>I love them because the are very soft and carry a good amount of product.</li>
            <li>Okay so i was so excited to get these brushes</li>
            <li>but other than that the brushes are good quality!!</li>
            <li>But other than that great brushes !</li>
            <li>For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting all the brushes to be spectacular, but I was really expecting much better.</li>
            <li>They did come with a strong plastic smell that was gone within abpout two days.</li>
            <li>If you want inexpensive brushes that are actually soft &amp; good quality you&#x27;re better off looking into elf.</li>
            <li>First off, the brushes remind me of the ELF Cosmetic brushes - which I find amazing.</li>
            <li>They are cheaply made and they fall apart easily.</li>
            <li>Nice goodies for a smart price.</li>
            <li>The plastic smell is VERY strong when i first recieved, I just let it air out for a week or so before I wrapped it</li>
            <li>And most of them broke after about a weeks worth of use.</li>
            <li>They clean up easy.  </li>
            <li>they feel REALLY cheap</li>
            <li>I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the face brushes work great for cleaning my laptop keyboard.</li>
            <li>There good for price, Many different brushes has everything you need but they shed a lot, would not purchase again</li>
            <li>As a professional make-up artist, good brushes are a must.</li>
            <li>Very worth buying.</li>
            <li>This 20 pc set is exactly as advertised in a cute carrying case.</li>
            <li>but every other one is good!</li>
            <li>I was excited when I received this.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these brushes</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re excited for the stipple brush</li>
            <li>I love the pink case its like a soft faux leather and the brushes are extra soft and perfect for flawless applications.</li>
            <li>I just received this product and I must say, they have a strong smell almost like fresh paint.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>When I fist got these brushes, I was super excited.</li>
            <li>They dont blend the  shadow well at all, &amp; they&#x27;re just not as great as i had expected..</li>
            <li>The only thing is when you first get them they have a smell to them but still really great.</li>
            <li>my bed was even full of the hair</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this brush set was the convenient carrier bag and the foundation brush.</li>
            <li>: ) The handles are real sturdy.</li>
            <li>so I love it fast shipping</li>
            <li>i know have my own set of professional brushes that i have been wanting for sometime now</li>
            <li>The plastic smell really is not bad with these.</li>
            <li>I am positive it will come out with an easy wash.</li>
            <li>When I first got the brushes I was overly excited.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t expect much for the price of this set, but you are better off spending a little more on something better.</li>
            <li>but they are cute and soft.</li>
            <li>The stipple brush was the one I was most excited for, and is little more sparse than I imagined, as well as the fan brush.</li>
            <li>The brushes came right on time, with neat packaging and no damage.</li>
            <li>It is a really great product, it has a smell like new leather,and the pink case shimmers.</li>
            <li>but as money is tight right now and it does cost a lot to get good brushes, these work for me right now.</li>
            <li>These would probably be good for young teenager, who is just starting to use makeup.</li>
            <li>Anyway, they were shipped very fast</li>
            <li>Handles separated for brushes fairly quickly (first month of use).</li>
            <li>They do shed a bit at first, but that stops after the first use.</li>
            <li>I think you can find better brushes in the same price range.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes, definitely get them, you will be set for life!</li>
            <li>Exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li>And they had a funny smell to them when i got them.</li>
            <li>I regret buying these brushes and I would love my money back</li>
            <li>/&gt;Powder brushes are great, brow brushes are awesome, have only used like three-four eyeshadow brushes; the other ones i find them a little too big.</li>
            <li>, when it first came, I was so excited I told everyone that the bristels were soo soft</li>
            <li>Other than that, I honestly can&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li>it just shed a little too much so for the price i do not think it is fair</li>
            <li>I have to cut off some of excess hair on the brush, Most of the brushes are pretty dense, not soft..</li>
            <li>When washing them for the first time there was no shedding which was much appreciated because I didn&#x27;t lose any of the bristles.</li>
            <li>So I just got them in the mail today, and first of all...nice &amp; fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The only good brushes that came with this set was the foundation brush, the stifle brush, the eyebrow tools, and the flat synthetic eye brushes.</li>
            <li>The only problem that I had with the product was, when I opened it, it had a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very cheap &amp; rough.</li>
            <li>I use 2 brushes out of the whole thing.</li>
            <li>But they look really pretty(lol)</li>
            <li>Well i really like these brushes but whenmthey</li>
            <li>We are both very into our makeup and whatnot</li>
            <li>The reason it got 2 stars is because I do love the pink case and utilize 4 of the 20 brushes..</li>
            <li>They seemed like cheap paint brushes you used in a middle school art class.</li>
            <li>I got them fast</li>
            <li>You really get what you pay for with these brushes.</li>
            <li>so I absolutely adore</li>
            <li>They are really course</li>
            <li>They absorb way too much product.</li>
            <li>but other from that i love it</li>
            <li>the other brushes are ok</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had any issues with them except when I clean them, sometimes a few hairs on the brush will fall out but other than that, these are good.</li>
            <li>i clean them for next day use.</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re pretty and soft.</li>
            <li>100% nice&lt;br /&gt;excellent product, what I asked was expected, a quality 100 %  , quality at low cost, the finish is spectacular, I recommend this product to buyers, are you going to like, thanks ...</li>
            <li>They do lose a few bristles the first usage, but after a good cleaning with professional brush cleaner fixes that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely recommending this to everyone.</li>
            <li>My main problem with them is as soon as I took them out</li>
            <li>They are also very soft!</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a high quality brush, these won&#x27;t be what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>and I only used it twice, but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting super professional brushes</li>
            <li>Not only did the smell the first use the hairs started falling out every ware!</li>
            <li>soft are real soft...and the ones that are meant to be more firm are just that</li>
            <li>The face brushes work really well and are soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to get the smell out.  </li>
            <li>They were brand new and still had the plastic on the brush.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves her new brush set.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I would change, is to have more of a variety of eye brushes their seem to be 3 of the same eye shadow brush, but you could use them for different things so its not completely a negative thing.</li>
            <li>the brush hairs fall off quite a bit, and i don&#x27;t find them very soft.  </li>
            <li>the only thing is that they gave off a wieid smell when i first opened them...</li>
            <li>The colour washes out of the brushes very easily, and all these brushes make it so I don&#x27;t have to worry about messy application or mixed colours.</li>
            <li>Since I am the first review, I would like to say that based on what I experienced and have seen with the brushes, doesn&#x27;t mean that the next person who reviews it will have the same thoughts - they could be worse or better than mine.</li>
            <li>The pink case has a really strong paint smell enough to bother someone.</li>
            <li>They definitely aren&#x27;t super soft, and 5 of the brushes are basically the same brush (which could be a pro or con depending on what you are looking for).</li>
            <li>I cant use the eye brushes because they are way to hard but the face brushes are okay.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>Soft and seems well durable.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft, they are perf.  </li>
            <li>far there&#x27;s one brush</li>
            <li>brushes are soft and hold color well.</li>
            <li>The brushes got here 1 day early.</li>
            <li>so now I let my 5 year old play with them in her make-up kits.</li>
            <li>but I fixed them</li>
            <li>So far, none of them have shed or lost any hairs.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and my clients often ask where I got them.</li>
            <li>The pink holder that they arrived in is nice, it&#x27;s not top of the line</li>
            <li>Really like these brushes just what I have been looking for for a long time.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these brushes but it was a total let down.</li>
            <li>My daughter left it up to me to get her some new brushes</li>
            <li>The brushes are a lot more stiff then what I was expecting reading other reviews about them being soft.</li>
            <li>Do not do the same thing and do not buy this product unless you want to waste $11.11 (which is very ironic because this was very unlucky).</li>
            <li>So much fallout, the olive oil couldn&#x27;t help with how rough they were.</li>
            <li>really like the brushes, there is a pink brush that looks like a stippling brush, or one the the \\&quot;blush brushes\\&quot;, this one does NOT pick up makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The brushes were all full and fluffy - no sparseness in the larger ones.</li>
            <li>Received item much faster than expected!</li>
            <li>The pink fabric travel pack case  has cheap linings of plastic inside which don&#x27;t really firmly hold the brushes.</li>
            <li>and still some are still not dry</li>
            <li>they are a little rough and a few bristles fall out but for the price I cant complain its a nice addition to my collection.  </li>
            <li>Some of the brushes actually snapped in half, exposing hot glue dabs.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> these work great</li>
            <li> the brushes were great but they were already shedding.. and the stippling brush broke while I was trying to take it out of the case.</li>
            <li> Great buy</li>
            <li> These brushes are great.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> They eyeshadow brushes are great.</li>
            <li> The angled brush is great at lining the eye with shadow or liners.</li>
            <li> Anyway, It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> The brushes pick up color great &amp; don&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li> but when I got this like it did stink but nothing like Lysol couldn&#x27;t fix lol  </li>
            <li> i was really happy to recieve these brushes.</li>
            <li> They are a great assortment of brushes.  </li>
            <li> the brushes were not that great.</li>
            <li> the color was perfect and the bag was nice but not all the brushes came with brush covers</li>
            <li> I love everything about them!!</li>
            <li> Love them !!</li>

            <li> fairly fast!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> you do get a nice variety though which is great.  </li>
            <li> The brushes were not as good as I thought they were going to be.</li>
            <li> but they are good for the price.</li>
            <li> They pick up powder and do a good job getting the product on.</li>
            <li> Stipple brush works good but the bristles do kinda go all over the place.</li>
            <li> bery good</li>
            <li> This is a good gift for your girlfriend.</li>
            <li> She loved them.</li>
            <li> It works for me like it&#x27;s good for someone just started on this</li>
            <li> , I was delighted with it.</li>
            <li> Also good for beginners.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> they seemed to fall apart real easy.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes in a lovely case.  </li>
            <li> and when I was done washing the hairs sell out more!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love them!</li>
            <li> I have so many brushes, I don&#x27;t even know what to do with them!</li>
            <li> its easy to pack on powder but not that great.</li>
            <li> great brushes, sheds lightly however one wash fixes that.</li>
            <li> , i would have liked to pay attention to the comments</li>
            <li> The brushes that are supposed to be nice n</li>
            <li> &amp; you&#x27;ll be happy with your purchase for sure : )</li>
            <li> I tossed the crappy 16 brushes and put my own brushes in it..</li>
            <li> The powder brushes are nice.</li>
            <li> it really isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> The brushes were nice quality and the case is nicer than the picture shows.</li>
            <li> The stiffness is the eye brushes are nice cause</li>
            <li> it is wonderful and came fast.</li>
            <li> But the brush case is really nice</li>
            <li> These r awesome can do many different looks of make up love this and very appropriate pricing!!!</li>
            <li> and I still ues them good to start with easy to use</li>
            <li> All these brushes have a very strong chemical odor to them.  </li>
            <li> if you want good cheap brushes stick with elfs studio line and</li>
            <li> These brushes suck, they&#x27;re very cheap and brittle.</li>
            <li> This product was very cheap in quality...</li>
            <li> and i feel confident about them</li>
            <li> The brushes were okay.</li>
            <li> I had to go and spend more money to get more brushes</li>
            <li> Love makeup n</li>
            <li> for the price of these brushes, it is a good deal but these brushes are more for like fun.</li>
            <li> I wish the case that it was in was better quality</li>
            <li> All of the brushes were losing so many bristles</li>
            <li> so many hairs fell out.</li>
            <li> and then il ll be able to use them.</li>
            <li> Planning on buying some more to give as gifts to the teenagers in the family.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> One of the eye brushes remind me of the MAC 217 eye brushes but a lot more inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The brushes are cute, but some broke off the handle already</li>
            <li> they look amazing and dont look cheap at all...</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay, apply the product well, there&#x27;s no complaining here.</li>
            <li> and i have to say it seemed like i paid much more for this set than I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will go away...</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t bother me anyways : )</li>
            <li> these brushes are ok, but i guess you could expect that based off the price.  </li>
            <li> She is going to love it</li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> The make-up brushes from the dollar store are way better.</li>
            <li> They wash up very nicely and seem to be holding up very well.</li>
            <li> I really really like, the liner brush!!!!</li>
            <li> For the professional they do make wonderful &amp;#34;gut&amp;#34; brushes for special F/X.</li>
            <li> I like to buy my brushes in sets like this because you generally get a good amount of fairly good brushes.  </li>
            <li> And they are super cute too!  </li>
            <li> I like the brushes they&#x27;re really soft and blend really beautifully</li>
            <li> And just get good real techniques, Eco tools,  or if your in the mood to spend a lot Mac brushes!</li>
            <li> and they are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> The pigment pick up is great and the brushes do such an amazing job at blending.</li>
            <li> I think the reason why people made good comments were because initially, they were good brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and flexible, meaning they won&#x27;t dig into your makeup (if that makes sense lol).</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product and the seller!</li>
            <li> but the brush for the eyes are great except the blending brush, its not fluffy..</li>
            <li> and the pink case is awesome</li>
            <li> But all in all I really do find them to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> I love them because the are very soft and carry a good amount of product.</li>
            <li> Okay so i was so excited to get these brushes</li>
            <li> but other than that the brushes are good quality!!</li>
            <li> But other than that great brushes !</li>
            <li> For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting all the brushes to be spectacular, but I was really expecting much better.</li>
            <li> They did come with a strong plastic smell that was gone within abpout two days.</li>
            <li> If you want inexpensive brushes that are actually soft &amp; good quality you&#x27;re better off looking into elf.</li>
            <li> First off, the brushes remind me of the ELF Cosmetic brushes - which I find amazing.</li>
            <li> They are cheaply made and they fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> Nice goodies for a smart price.</li>
            <li> The plastic smell is VERY strong when i first recieved, I just let it air out for a week or so before I wrapped it</li>
            <li> And most of them broke after about a weeks worth of use.</li>
            <li> They clean up easy.  </li>
            <li> they feel REALLY cheap</li>
            <li> I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the face brushes work great for cleaning my laptop keyboard.</li>
            <li> There good for price, Many different brushes has everything you need but they shed a lot, would not purchase again</li>
            <li> As a professional make-up artist, good brushes are a must.</li>
            <li> Very worth buying.</li>
            <li> This 20 pc set is exactly as advertised in a cute carrying case.</li>
            <li> but every other one is good!</li>
            <li> I was excited when I received this.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these brushes</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re excited for the stipple brush</li>
            <li> I love the pink case its like a soft faux leather and the brushes are extra soft and perfect for flawless applications.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I must say, they have a strong smell almost like fresh paint.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> When I fist got these brushes, I was super excited.</li>
            <li> They dont blend the  shadow well at all, &amp; they&#x27;re just not as great as i had expected..</li>
            <li> The only thing is when you first get them they have a smell to them but still really great.</li>
            <li> my bed was even full of the hair</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this brush set was the convenient carrier bag and the foundation brush.</li>
            <li> : ) The handles are real sturdy.</li>
            <li> so I love it fast shipping</li>
            <li> i know have my own set of professional brushes that i have been wanting for sometime now</li>
            <li> The plastic smell really is not bad with these.</li>
            <li> I am positive it will come out with an easy wash.</li>
            <li> When I first got the brushes I was overly excited.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect much for the price of this set, but you are better off spending a little more on something better.</li>
            <li> but they are cute and soft.</li>
            <li> The stipple brush was the one I was most excited for, and is little more sparse than I imagined, as well as the fan brush.</li>
            <li> The brushes came right on time, with neat packaging and no damage.</li>
            <li> It is a really great product, it has a smell like new leather,and the pink case shimmers.</li>
            <li> but as money is tight right now and it does cost a lot to get good brushes, these work for me right now.</li>
            <li> These would probably be good for young teenager, who is just starting to use makeup.</li>
            <li> Anyway, they were shipped very fast</li>
            <li> Handles separated for brushes fairly quickly (first month of use).</li>
            <li> They do shed a bit at first, but that stops after the first use.</li>
            <li> I think you can find better brushes in the same price range.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, definitely get them, you will be set for life!</li>
            <li> Exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li> And they had a funny smell to them when i got them.</li>
            <li> I regret buying these brushes and I would love my money back</li>
            <li> /&gt;Powder brushes are great, brow brushes are awesome, have only used like three-four eyeshadow brushes; the other ones i find them a little too big.</li>
            <li> , when it first came, I was so excited I told everyone that the bristels were soo soft</li>
            <li> Other than that, I honestly can&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li> it just shed a little too much so for the price i do not think it is fair</li>
            <li> I have to cut off some of excess hair on the brush, Most of the brushes are pretty dense, not soft..</li>
            <li> When washing them for the first time there was no shedding which was much appreciated because I didn&#x27;t lose any of the bristles.</li>
            <li> So I just got them in the mail today, and first of all...nice &amp; fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The only good brushes that came with this set was the foundation brush, the stifle brush, the eyebrow tools, and the flat synthetic eye brushes.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I had with the product was, when I opened it, it had a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very cheap &amp; rough.</li>
            <li> I use 2 brushes out of the whole thing.</li>
            <li> But they look really pretty(lol)</li>
            <li> Well i really like these brushes but whenmthey</li>
            <li> We are both very into our makeup and whatnot</li>
            <li> The reason it got 2 stars is because I do love the pink case and utilize 4 of the 20 brushes..</li>
            <li> They seemed like cheap paint brushes you used in a middle school art class.</li>
            <li> I got them fast</li>
            <li> You really get what you pay for with these brushes.</li>
            <li> so I absolutely adore</li>
            <li> They are really course</li>
            <li> They absorb way too much product.</li>
            <li> but other from that i love it</li>
            <li> the other brushes are ok</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had any issues with them except when I clean them, sometimes a few hairs on the brush will fall out but other than that, these are good.</li>
            <li> i clean them for next day use.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re pretty and soft.</li>
            <li> 100% nice&lt;br /&gt;excellent product, what I asked was expected, a quality 100 %  , quality at low cost, the finish is spectacular, I recommend this product to buyers, are you going to like, thanks ...</li>
            <li> They do lose a few bristles the first usage, but after a good cleaning with professional brush cleaner fixes that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely recommending this to everyone.</li>
            <li> My main problem with them is as soon as I took them out</li>
            <li> They are also very soft!</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a high quality brush, these won&#x27;t be what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> and I only used it twice, but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting super professional brushes</li>
            <li> Not only did the smell the first use the hairs started falling out every ware!</li>
            <li> soft are real soft...and the ones that are meant to be more firm are just that</li>
            <li> The face brushes work really well and are soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to get the smell out.  </li>
            <li> They were brand new and still had the plastic on the brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves her new brush set.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I would change, is to have more of a variety of eye brushes their seem to be 3 of the same eye shadow brush, but you could use them for different things so its not completely a negative thing.</li>
            <li> the brush hairs fall off quite a bit, and i don&#x27;t find them very soft.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is that they gave off a wieid smell when i first opened them...</li>
            <li> The colour washes out of the brushes very easily, and all these brushes make it so I don&#x27;t have to worry about messy application or mixed colours.</li>
            <li> Since I am the first review, I would like to say that based on what I experienced and have seen with the brushes, doesn&#x27;t mean that the next person who reviews it will have the same thoughts - they could be worse or better than mine.</li>
            <li> The pink case has a really strong paint smell enough to bother someone.</li>
            <li> They definitely aren&#x27;t super soft, and 5 of the brushes are basically the same brush (which could be a pro or con depending on what you are looking for).</li>
            <li> I cant use the eye brushes because they are way to hard but the face brushes are okay.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Soft and seems well durable.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft, they are perf.  </li>
            <li> far there&#x27;s one brush</li>
            <li> brushes are soft and hold color well.</li>
            <li> The brushes got here 1 day early.</li>
            <li> so now I let my 5 year old play with them in her make-up kits.</li>
            <li> but I fixed them</li>
            <li> So far, none of them have shed or lost any hairs.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and my clients often ask where I got them.</li>
            <li> The pink holder that they arrived in is nice, it&#x27;s not top of the line</li>
            <li> Really like these brushes just what I have been looking for for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these brushes but it was a total let down.</li>
            <li> My daughter left it up to me to get her some new brushes</li>
            <li> The brushes are a lot more stiff then what I was expecting reading other reviews about them being soft.</li>
            <li> Do not do the same thing and do not buy this product unless you want to waste $11.11 (which is very ironic because this was very unlucky).</li>
            <li> So much fallout, the olive oil couldn&#x27;t help with how rough they were.</li>
            <li> really like the brushes, there is a pink brush that looks like a stippling brush, or one the the \\&quot;blush brushes\\&quot;, this one does NOT pick up makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The brushes were all full and fluffy - no sparseness in the larger ones.</li>
            <li> Received item much faster than expected!</li>
            <li> The pink fabric travel pack case  has cheap linings of plastic inside which don&#x27;t really firmly hold the brushes.</li>
            <li> and still some are still not dry</li>
            <li> they are a little rough and a few bristles fall out but for the price I cant complain its a nice addition to my collection.  </li>
            <li> Some of the brushes actually snapped in half, exposing hot glue dabs.</li>
            <li> other thing is I tried to clean the brushes and they were so hard to clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the smell, it does have that nasty plastic smell but that doesn&#x27;t make or break what I think about the brushes in general - just clean them with baby soap and they&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> i honestly only use the eye shadow brushes because i hate how the face brushes feel on my face, but good price for what you get i suppose.  </li>
            <li> The eye shadow brushes which are 9 are not soft at all</li>
            <li> The set has a few synthetic brushes that are pretty stiff</li>
            <li> Appears to have been sitting for a while, since glue was too dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting for them to dry</li>
            <li> so I did and it took them 2 day to fully dry</li>
            <li> I would advise that you wash the brushes BEFORE you use them to get all the loose hairs out of the way.  </li>
            <li> The rest were a big thumbs down.</li>
            <li> They are not high end brushes</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t bad brushes...not completely sure how long they are going to hold up though.  </li>
            <li> - never did and I tugged hard, even let my 1 year old pull on them.</li>
            <li> But it was huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> These brushes are terrible you will be better off getting it from a drug store they shed way too much</li>
            <li> The brushes are just so rough.</li>
            <li> They way they feel is rough</li>
            <li> I would have spent my money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Coarse, unevenly cut bristles.</li>
            <li> there where a few like the eyeliner brush and lip brush which where synthetic hairs that actually do work.....</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine everyday for the past month or so and they are still like new.  </li>
            <li> it doesent fall apart like other brush sets but the fibers in your makeup and eyeshadow</li>
            <li> They were packaged extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The brushes shed a little but not too bad or to keep me from buying more.</li>
            <li> The only brush that was a little too fluffy for me was the lip brush</li>
            <li> In addition to that these are very rough on the eyes.</li>
            <li> They looked fine and the baggy it comes in did not smell as bad as the other reviews were saying.</li>
            <li> It did take them a little longer than other products usually arrive, but I believe that is only due to the fact of where they were shipped from and it couldn&#x27;t be helped.  </li>
            <li> but I waited to late to even open them</li>
            <li> Not worth even the price of shipping.</li>
            <li> I mean it was only 11 bucks.</li>
            <li> The brushes had very little control and the eye brushes are just too rough.</li>
            <li> Some shedding is to be expected for the price, but this was excessive.</li>
            <li> it was a mess.</li>
            <li> Even though I clean the brushes and let them dry properly, they still have the worst odor imaginable.</li>
            <li> but when i opened them there was already a bit of hair in the little baggie they shed a lot</li>
            <li> Yes it does have a plastic-y smell when you take them out of the package, but I think that would go away with a little airing out.</li>
            <li> just thought they&#x27;d be a little softer.</li>
            <li> You could count the little hairs.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package it did smell a little like plastic</li>
            <li> The brushes have long handles, the metal barrel area was sturdy and didn&#x27;t have that shaky feeling; I tugged on the brushes to see if I would get any fall outs</li>
            <li> I saw a little shedding, nothing abnormal for me, I don&#x27;t feel like I wasted my money, because it applied the product well.</li>
            <li> They are also not that soft and they have a weird smell and some even broke.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to waste their money on these brushes though.</li>
            <li> I had a few bristles fall out during use as well as they didn&#x27;t leave the makeup looking even.</li>
            <li> A few fell apart</li>
            <li> It seems the the glue had dried out.</li>
            <li> When I did the usual thing and cleaned my makeup brushes, it allll went down hill .</li>
            <li> These brushes do, however shed a bit when you first get them, not too bad though.</li>
            <li> All the brush shed like crazy and aren&#x27;t very soft.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes are a little hard, but still work well.</li>
            <li> &quot; I read about when I opened the package, and it was there a bit...but its just the usual packaging smell you&#x27;d find with everything in plastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update my review once I&#x27;ve used them for a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I thought they were at least hold up a few weeks bit as soon as I took the out and touched the tip the hairs started falling.......</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes shed a little which was disappointing, so i just dont use them.</li>
            <li> They were not very good quality like I had hoped</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because the bigger brushes were the main reason I got the set.</li>
            <li> The website selling this product is scamming who ever they can out of customer&#x27;s hard earned money.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too late.</li>
            <li> i used once and the brushes fell apart DONT PURCHASE WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>

            <li> Not worth what I paid!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are so mashed, they&#x27;re useless.</li>
            <li> also the fan brush is very very thin</li>
            <li> They are prickly and hard and the bristles come out all into the makeup and sometimes in your eye which is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The pink case has a really strong paint smell enough to bother someone. The brushes shed and shed and shed. I would not advise anyone to buy this product when the bristles will be out of it in a month</li>
            <li> The price was awesome the quality is great the product is in excellent condition I am so happy and satisfied. Amazonis the greatest</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these brushes but it was a total let down. The brushes have a lot of fall out!!! They are also not that soft and they have a weird smell and some even broke. Regret spending my money on these brushes!</li>
            <li> its amazing its really cute also it comes nicely sealed to you won&#x27;t have to worry about dust!! but other from that i love it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. You can&#x27;t expect much for the price of this set, but you are better off spending a little more on something better.</li>
            <li> they smell terrible &amp; they are very ichy butttt some of them werent bad</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes worked alright. All of the brushes shed bristles. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to waste their money on these brushes though.</li>
            <li> the product is not good. I use 2 brushes out of the whole thing. I cant use the eye brushes because they are way to hard but the face brushes are okay. they shed like crazy! if you want good cheap brushes stick with elfs studio line and even there 1$ ones. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li> Okay so i was so excited to get these brushes but when i opened them there was already a bit of hair in the little baggie they shed a lot my bed was even full of the hair but it didn&#x27;t shed overly exaggerated it just shed a little too much so for the price i do not think it is fair, i would have liked to pay attention to the comments but if you want good brushes here is a link [...] i just ordered mine from there and i feel confident about them so hopefully this helps you decide!</li>
            <li> The brushes were okay. The eye shadow brushes work great. But the bigger brushes are terrible. I can&#x27;t even use them because the brush basically falls apart. After using them I feel like I have hair all over my face from the brush. I was very disappointed because the bigger brushes were the main reason I got the set.</li>
            <li> Brushes lose the threads</li>
            <li> All these brushes have a very strong chemical odor to them.  The entire case smells as if it was dipped in paint thinner.</li>
            <li> Appears to have been sitting for a while, since glue was too dry. Handles separated for brushes fairly quickly (first month of use). But they look really pretty(lol)</li>
            <li> I like these brushes. They do shed a bit at first, but that stops after the first use. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are just so rough. They dont blend the  shadow well at all, &amp; they&#x27;re just not as great as i had expected..</li>
            <li> I like the quantity I got for this price, but the brushes stay stained with the make up. The make up itself washes off, but brush tips were white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist, and these brushes are so great. I love everything about them!! Except for the fan brush, which wont go back in the packaging. I just leave it out.</li>
            <li> i used once and the brushes fell apart DONT PURCHASE WASTE OF MONEY!! I had to go and spend more money to get more brushes</li>
            <li> Love makeup n these work great</li>
            <li> the brushes were great but they were already shedding.. and the stippling brush broke while I was trying to take it out of the case. but other than that the brushes are good quality!!</li>
            <li> I have to cut off some of excess hair on the brush, Most of the brushes are pretty dense, not soft.. but the brush for the eyes are great except the blending brush, its not fluffy..but i would recommend this for beginners..</li>
            <li> for the price of these brushes, it is a good deal but these brushes are more for like fun. if you&#x27;re looking for a high quality brush, these won&#x27;t be what you are looking for. but as money is tight right now and it does cost a lot to get good brushes, these work for me right now. haven&#x27;t had any issues with them except when I clean them, sometimes a few hairs on the brush will fall out but other than that, these are good.</li>
            <li> They shed and get nasty when washed. I only use the eye brushes but they still shed after 5 months. No bueno.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes they&#x27;re really soft and blend really beautifully I wish the case that it was in was better quality But I still like the brushes themselves</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting these brushes. For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting all the brushes to be spectacular, but I was really expecting much better. Yes it does have a plastic-y smell when you take them out of the package, but I think that would go away with a little airing out. My main problem with them is as soon as I took them out they were shedding like crazy! Some shedding is to be expected for the price, but this was excessive. All of the brushes were losing so many bristles it was a mess. They definitely aren&#x27;t super soft, and 5 of the brushes are basically the same brush (which could be a pro or con depending on what you are looking for). I think you can find better brushes in the same price range. These would probably be good for young teenager, who is just starting to use makeup. I am returning these.</li>
            <li> The bristles are scratchy for these ones. When washing them for the first time there was no shedding which was much appreciated because I didn&#x27;t lose any of the bristles. The pigment pick up is great and the brushes do such an amazing job at blending.</li>
            <li> This 20 pc set is exactly as advertised in a cute carrying case. My 13 year old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I got mine in today, I have not used them yet. I&#x27;m deep cleaning them, in that process so many hairs fell out. I mean I saw the reviews and I knew it was going to happen so I&#x27;m not upset. I mean it was only 11 bucks. As my last process of cleaning. A lot let hairs were falling out. I&#x27;m waiting for them to dry and then il ll be able to use them. Ohhh one thing that I did notice is that none of the brushes or case smelt at all. Ill keep you updated. I gave 4 stars because I have not used the product yet.</li>
            <li> Well i really like these brushes but whenmthey come they smell bad but if u wash them the smell goes away also the fan brush is very very thin</li>
            <li> The brushes shed a lot. And most of them broke after about a weeks worth of use. Not the best product.</li>
            <li> I read all of the review and I STILL decided to buy it, when it first came, I was so excited I told everyone that the bristels were soo soft (that later changed) I tested all of the bristles out and there was no fallout, the smell wasn&#x27;t bad either !! When I did the usual thing and cleaned my makeup brushes, it allll went down hill . So much fallout, the olive oil couldn&#x27;t help with how rough they were. The brushes had very little control and the eye brushes are just too rough. I think the reason why people made good comments were because initially, they were good brushes. The only good thing about this brush set was the convenient carrier bag and the foundation brush. Other than that, I honestly can&#x27;t say. Please try it out for yourself but this is my utter review. You can see my makeup tutorials using these brushes at [...]</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes on a Monday and they got here Friday (standard shipping) and when I got them they smelt like something I can&#x27;t even describe because I have never smelted before! Not only did the smell the first use the hairs started falling out every ware! They smelt so bad I had to wash them so I did and it took them 2 day to fully dry and still some are still not dry and when I was done washing the hairs sell out more! I SUGGEST U DONT SPEND YOUR MONNEY ON THESE! And just get good real techniques, Eco tools,  or if your in the mood to spend a lot Mac brushes!</li>
            <li> I love it! Except one. a rounded brush. Every time i could touch the bristles, it would fall out. I&#x27;m definitely not going to use that brush but every other one is good!</li>
            <li> My brushes broke same day I got them worst experience ever I was looking forward to use them I sent them back and got my money back</li>
            <li> I was excited when I received this. They looked fine and the baggy it comes in did not smell as bad as the other reviews were saying. Within 2 weeks or so the brushes started coming off of the stick. I still use them though, they even out my makeup the way I like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this set to start building on to my collection.  I would advise that you wash the brushes BEFORE you use them to get all the loose hairs out of the way.  They aren&#x27;t bad brushes...not completely sure how long they are going to hold up though.  I&#x27;ve used mine everyday for the past month or so and they are still like new.  For the people that complain about the case smell...it&#x27;s plastic and it&#x27;s going to smell weird.  IF you don&#x27;t like it then I suggest taking a baby wipe and cleaning it up some.  It&#x27;s not hard to get the smell out.  All together I like the brushes.  Soft and seems well durable.  Planning on buying some more to give as gifts to the teenagers in the family.  :)</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I must say, they have a strong smell almost like fresh paint. I am positive it will come out with an easy wash. Anyway, they were shipped very fast I am very impressed. The brushes shed a little but not too bad or to keep me from buying more. They are also very soft! The only thing that I would change, is to have more of a variety of eye brushes their seem to be 3 of the same eye shadow brush, but you could use them for different things so its not completely a negative thing. Very worth buying. One of the eye brushes remind me of the MAC 217 eye brushes but a lot more inexpensive. I love these brushes, definitely get them, you will be set for life!</li>
            <li> The brushes are cute, but some broke off the handle already and I only used it twice, but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting super professional brushes</li>
            <li> they look amazing and dont look cheap at all...the only thing is that they gave off a wieid smell when i first opened them...but once i left it open the smell went away.now i use them all the time!</li>
            <li> These brushes are terrible you will be better off getting it from a drug store they shed way too much i hate them</li>
            <li> Just what i needed. These brushes are so soft, they are perf.  And they are super cute too!  Love them.</li>
            <li> There good for price, Many different brushes has everything you need but they shed a lot, would not purchase again</li>
            <li> The brushes are perfect! Exactly like the photo. They were brand new and still had the plastic on the brush. Great buy</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes shed a little which was disappointing, so i just dont use them. But other than that great brushes !</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. Purchased them for my wife, she is trying to become a makeup artist. The brushes are good quality. They arrived in perfect condition. No shedding of bristles and they have been used often . They clean up easy.  Shipping was 3 days quicker than projected. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these brushes but when I got them I was so disappointed! The eye shadow brushes which are 9 are not soft at all it feels like its scratching my face when I use them:/ the other brushes are ok I guess u get whatvu pay for!!</li>
            <li> I ordered on Dec. 12, 2012, got them on the 15th. Super fast shipping!!! I haven&#x27;t got a chance to use them, they&#x27;re pretty and soft. But they do smell, but its something that can be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I used them was on Dec. 28, 2012. They&#x27;re okay, apply the product well, there&#x27;s no complaining here. I am happy with the purchase. I saw a little shedding, nothing abnormal for me, I don&#x27;t feel like I wasted my money, because it applied the product well. I haven&#x27;t got a chance to use all of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 1/07/2013&lt;br /&gt;I really like the brushes, there is a pink brush that looks like a stippling brush, or one the the \\&quot;blush brushes\\&quot;, this one does NOT pick up makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use all the brushes, but I used plenty, and they work wonderfully!!!&lt;br /&gt;So far there&#x27;s one brush I really really like, the liner brush!!!! Works amazingly!&lt;br /&gt;Powder brushes are great, brow brushes are awesome, have only used like three-four eyeshadow brushes; the other ones i find them a little too big. But I will find a way to use them all.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the smell, it went away fairly fast!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product and the seller!</li>
            <li> Received item much faster than expected! Daughter loves this item and they work well for the price. They did come with a strong plastic smell that was gone within abpout two days.</li>
            <li> purchased this set for a christmas gift for my sister. We are both very into our makeup and whatnot and i have to say it seemed like i paid much more for this set than I did. brushes are soft and hold color well. The plastic smell is VERY strong when i first recieved, I just let it air out for a week or so before I wrapped it and my sister didn&#x27;t seem to notice the smell.</li>
            <li> Very good product and my niece loves it.  never realised its nicer than it looks from online.  the brushes feel like expensive ones according to my niece.  Nice goodies for a smart price.</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for about a week now and I love them! except for the powder brush it shed everytime I use it but rather then that great brushes for the price!!!</li>
            <li> So I just got them in the mail today, and first of all...nice &amp; fast delivery. I was waiting for that bad \\&quot;plastic smell\\&quot; I read about when I opened the package, and it was there a bit...but its just the usual packaging smell you&#x27;d find with everything in plastic. I&#x27;m sure it will go away...doesn&#x27;t bother me anyways : ) The brushes that are supposed to be nice n soft are real soft...and the ones that are meant to be more firm are just that : ) The handles are real sturdy. The case is alright too, but I&#x27;m not using it since I always just put my brushes in a holder on my vanity. I&#x27;ll use the case when I&#x27;m traveling or whatever. So I believe these are well made &amp; you&#x27;ll be happy with your purchase for sure : ) I&#x27;ll update my review once I&#x27;ve used them for a few weeks!</li>
            <li> these brushes are ok, but i guess you could expect that based off the price.  the brush hairs fall off quite a bit, and i don&#x27;t find them very soft.  you do get a nice variety though which is great.  i honestly only use the eye shadow brushes because i hate how the face brushes feel on my face, but good price for what you get i suppose.  just thought they&#x27;d be a little softer.</li>
            <li> The reason it got 2 stars is because I do love the pink case and utilize 4 of the 20 brushes.. The rest sucked.. They seemed like cheap paint brushes you used in a middle school art class. I had a few bristles fall out during use as well as they didn&#x27;t leave the makeup looking even. I tossed the crappy 16 brushes and put my own brushes in it.. Not worth what I paid!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just got them yesterday n OMG they smell so bad I washed them n some still smell bad n it was like their was glue on the hairs n even the pink bag smelled bad n they feel REALLY cheap n the hairs won&#x27;t stop falling out so don&#x27;t buy them</li>
            <li> These brushes stink!!!!!  Especially the fan brush. You could count the little hairs. They are cheaply made and they fall apart easily. You would be better off buying expensive ones.</li>
            <li> The brushes were not as good as I thought they were going to be. They were not very good quality like I had hoped</li>
            <li> They way they feel is rough and I don&#x27;t like that and it doesn&#x27;t have the name of the brush on the side so that&#x27;s another thing I don&#x27;t like about it.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is I tried to clean the brushes and they were so hard to clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these brushes</li>
            <li> **Stuff to know before buying&lt;br /&gt;I bought them thinking they wouldn&#x27;t be the best brushes and they are pretty good. They are not high end brushes but they are good for the price. The powder brushes are nice. They pick up powder and do a good job getting the product on. The stipple brush was the one I was most excited for, and is little more sparse than I imagined, as well as the fan brush. Stipple brush works good but the bristles do kinda go all over the place. They eyeshadow brushes are great. I love them because the are very soft and carry a good amount of product. I like to buy my brushes in sets like this because you generally get a good amount of fairly good brushes.  The set has a few synthetic brushes that are pretty stiff but I like them that way because I use them for things like gel liner. The angled brush is great at lining the eye with shadow or liners. These brushes do, however shed a bit when you first get them, not too bad though. If you&#x27;re excited for the stipple brush it really isn&#x27;t the best. I would rather try the ELF stipple brush. My only problem is it&#x27;s always sold out locally and double the price online! Anyway, It&#x27;s a great buy. I would recommend these to anyone. Oh! The plastic smell really is not bad with these. It&#x27;s almost nonexistent which is great! and the pink case is awesome but I&#x27;ll only use that when traveling.</li>
            <li> The brushes got here 1 day early. When I opened the package it did smell a little like plastic but it went away immediately. The brushes pick up color great &amp; don&#x27;t shed at all. Love them !!</li>
            <li> This came just in time for my best friends birthday!! The brushes came in tact and beautiful!! She is going to love it</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are garbage the hairs fall out even when u shake em.&lt;br /&gt;My 14 yr daughter don&#x27;t even like em. DON&amp;#34;T WASTE UR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter left it up to me to get her some new brushes so I purchased these solely on reviews and price.  She says they are wonderful.</li>
            <li> bery good 100% nice&lt;br /&gt;excellent product, what I asked was expected, a quality 100 %  , quality at low cost, the finish is spectacular, I recommend this product to buyers, are you going to like, thanks ...</li>
            <li> they weren&#x27;t the quality i were looking for, the bristles were not as soft as i expected. Also they fall out of the brush, so when i apply my make up there are a couple of bristles on my face EVERY time. And they had a funny smell to them when i got them. I have used them a couple of times, thinking i would get over it since i paid for them, but I am not on the hunt for another set of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a good gift for your girlfriend. The S&amp;H as well as the service was on point and my girlfriend loved it!</li>
            <li> These brushes are of horrible quality. They are prickly and hard and the bristles come out all into the makeup and sometimes in your eye which is terrible. The brushes don&#x27;t pick up makeup well at all. I should have returned them but I waited to late to even open them so now I let my 5 year old play with them in her make-up kits. DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> I got them fast I love the color they are a little rough and a few bristles fall out but for the price I cant complain its a nice addition to my collection.  Recommend for beginners</li>
            <li> You really get what you pay for with these brushes. If I had a do over I would have spent my money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> great brushes, sheds lightly however one wash fixes that. buying another one of these for my best friend for her birthday.</li>
            <li> A few fell apart but I fixed them and I still ues them good to start with easy to use</li>
            <li> This set was a gift. She loved them. The brushes were nice quality and the case is nicer than the picture shows.</li>
            <li> These brushes suck, they&#x27;re very cheap and brittle. The fibers are tangled and coarse, and when used there is a lot of fallout. Some of the brushes actually snapped in half, exposing hot glue dabs. The pink fabric travel pack case  has cheap linings of plastic inside which don&#x27;t really firmly hold the brushes. It makes it quite annoying upon putting brushes away</li>
            <li> the brushes were falling apart and were not good quality. I hate these brushes so much and when i got them they smelled really bad</li>
            <li> When I first got the brushes I was overly excited. But as I progressed and started using them they seemed to fall apart. Every time I would wash or use these brushes hairs fell off every stroke. In addition to that these are very rough on the eyes. Some of them the heads fell off. I regret buying these brushes and I would love my money back but it&#x27;s too late.</li>
            <li> The website selling this product is scamming who ever they can out of customer&#x27;s hard earned money. This is very unfair and I am sad to say I fell victim to this. Do not do the same thing and do not buy this product unless you want to waste $11.11 (which is very ironic because this was very unlucky).</li>
            <li> It works for me like it&#x27;s good for someone just started on this make up industry so I absolutely adore but when I got this like it did stink but nothing like Lysol couldn&#x27;t fix lol  so I love it fast shipping</li>
            <li> My daughter loves her new brush set. They wash up very nicely and seem to be holding up very well.</li>
            <li> So, I got the brushes in yesterday and had a chance to go over them thoroughly. First off, the brushes remind me of the ELF Cosmetic brushes - which I find amazing. The brushes have long handles, the metal barrel area was sturdy and didn&#x27;t have that shaky feeling; I tugged on the brushes to see if I would get any fall outs - never did and I tugged hard, even let my 1 year old pull on them. The brushes were all full and fluffy - no sparseness in the larger ones. The bristles are very soft and flexible, meaning they won&#x27;t dig into your makeup (if that makes sense lol). The only complaint I have is the smell, it does have that nasty plastic smell but that doesn&#x27;t make or break what I think about the brushes in general - just clean them with baby soap and they&#x27;re good to go. The pink holder that they arrived in is nice, it&#x27;s not top of the line but it serves its purpose...I like it. Since I am the first review, I would like to say that based on what I experienced and have seen with the brushes, doesn&#x27;t mean that the next person who reviews it will have the same thoughts - they could be worse or better than mine. But all in all I really do find them to be of good quality. The price and shipping were beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> The brushes came right on time, with neat packaging and no damage. So far, none of them have shed or lost any hairs. The colour washes out of the brushes very easily, and all these brushes make it so I don&#x27;t have to worry about messy application or mixed colours. I have so many brushes, I don&#x27;t even know what to do with them!</li>
            <li> I have purchased several different brush sets. This set is awesome!!! I love the pink case its like a soft faux leather and the brushes are extra soft and perfect for flawless applications. I recommend this brush set to anyone just starting their kit and would like to have affordable makeup brushes. The only brush that was a little too fluffy for me was the lip brush but I have several others so I wasn&#x27;t too concerned.</li>
            <li> I thought the brushes would be much bigger but they are cute and soft. I&#x27;m content with this product. (:</li>
            <li> This product was very cheap in quality... the brushes fell apart and everything wouldn&#x27;t recommend this vendor</li>
            <li> The brushes are a lot more stiff then what I was expecting reading other reviews about them being soft. They are really course so I can not use the face ones at all. The stiffness is the eye brushes are nice cause its easy to pack on powder but not that great. I am a Sigma brush girl and even like Mac brushes but wanted something comparable. This is not it.</li>
            <li> Only like about 2 brushes from the set. They&#x27;re very cheap &amp; rough. If you want inexpensive brushes that are actually soft &amp; good quality you&#x27;re better off looking into elf.</li>
            <li> Horrible. For a daily makeup artist they fall apart after about 3 uses and sanitation. They absorb way too much product. The bristles don&#x27;t fall off but the actually brush coming off the &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34; did suck. For the person  doing makeup at home using the same brushes on yourself these are probably perfect. For the professional they do make wonderful &amp;#34;gut&amp;#34; brushes for special F/X.</li>
            <li> Pieces  of  the  brush  keep  falling  off.</li>
            <li> i was really happy to recieve these brushes. i clean them for next day use. it was really bad! the sheding never stopps!!!!! dont get me wrong it doesent fall apart like other brush sets but the fibers in your makeup and eyeshadow will be enough to change your mind. dont do it!!! in this case you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It is a really great product, it has a smell like new leather,and the pink case shimmers. All in all it is wonderful and came fast.</li>
            <li> Just opened this product, all the brushes handles are broken.  It seems the the glue had dried out. I&#x27;m so Unsatisfied with product.</li>
            <li> Coarse, unevenly cut bristles. Some of the brushes are so mashed, they&#x27;re useless. Handles are breaking off at the ferrule and they&#x27;re non-stop shedding. I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the face brushes work great for cleaning my laptop keyboard. Not worth even the price of shipping.</li>
            <li> When I fist got these brushes, I was super excited. But it was huge disappointment. All the brush shed like crazy and aren&#x27;t very soft. The only good brushes that came with this set was the foundation brush, the stifle brush, the eyebrow tools, and the flat synthetic eye brushes. The rest were a big thumbs down. But the brush case is really nice and I like to use it for traveling, so there&#x27;s an upside! But still not the greatest.</li>
            <li> I thought they were at least hold up a few weeks bit as soon as I took the out and touched the tip the hairs started falling.......there where a few like the eyeliner brush and lip brush which where synthetic hairs that actually do work.....</li>
            <li> Really like these brushes just what I have been looking for for a long time. The only thing is when you first get them they have a smell to them but still really great.</li>
            <li> this set is beautiful.  i know have my own set of professional brushes that i have been wanting for sometime now</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes in a lovely case.  They were packaged extremely well.  It did take them a little longer than other products usually arrive, but I believe that is only due to the fact of where they were shipped from and it couldn&#x27;t be helped.  They are a great assortment of brushes.  You&#x27;ll find one to meet all of your needs.  The only problem that I had with the product was, when I opened it, it had a strong chemical smell.  I had to let the product air  out before I could use it.  Other than that, I was delighted with it.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money. Not only do they shed constantly, they stink - horribly!!!! Even though I clean the brushes and let them dry properly, they still have the worst odor imaginable. The make-up brushes from the dollar store are way better.</li>
            <li> These r awesome can do many different looks of make up love this and very appropriate pricing!!! Looking for nail art brushes now!!</li>
            <li> the brushes were not that great. they seemed to fall apart real easy. the color was perfect and the bag was nice but not all the brushes came with brush covers</li>
            <li> The face brushes work really well and are soft. The eyeshadow brushes are a little hard, but still work well. Pretty good brushes for the price. Also good for beginners.</li>
            <li> As a professional make-up artist, good brushes are a must. For the price, these exceeded my expectations. They are so soft and my clients often ask where I got them. They do lose a few bristles the first usage, but after a good cleaning with professional brush cleaner fixes that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely recommending this to everyone.</li>
