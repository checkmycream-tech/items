            <li>There are better applicators for keeping lashes separate.  </li>
            <li>I also love that Amazon has this on Subscribe and Save.  </li>
            <li>Lovely color,</li>
            <li>this is probably not going to be enough for you, but it is perfect for every day use.  </li>
            <li>what more can I say?</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my royal blue mascara.  </li>
            <li>everything perfect especially the deliver time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and have gotten so many complements.</li>
            <li>We both love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sort of electric, where the Cargo stuff I&#x27;d been using was more navy.</li>
            <li>i was no longer able to find it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand and color for many years.</li>
            <li>love the product.</li>
            <li>I use it the most.</li>
            <li>I used to buy the Great Lash Royal Blue with a curved wand, which I loved.</li>
            <li>Pleased &amp; Totally satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Love it that I&#x27;m on automatic 3 mo.</li>
            <li>Very fun for a weekend!</li>
            <li>It is good and not expensive.  </li>
            <li>Good product , I was looking for a blue mascara and found it at amazon this mascara is good because it doesn&#x27;t leave lumps on your lashes</li>
            <li>It will leave a light coating, but you might need to use a plumper or another mascara to go over it to add more volume.  </li>
            <li>This mascara doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on smoothly day after day, love the colors, and it doesn&#x27;t smear, but still comes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>good product, nice blue color..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as the $25 Lancome mascara I normally use.  </li>
            <li>This color is amazing - no need to wear any eye shadow because the color is so vibrant!</li>
            <li>guess the search continues, huge letdown.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find a better mascara than the Maybelline Colossal.</li>
            <li>It seems they do not focus on colorful mascaras any more</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find BLUE!</li>
            <li>Everyday use, looks amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li>This color goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>but I always come back to Mabelline Great Lash.</li>
            <li>Good product, but the shade of blue is rather too bright for normal every day make up application for me</li>
            <li>My favorite blue estee Lauder mascara was discontinued and this seemed to be an effective (and cheaper) alternative..</li>
            <li>I have to admit I was hoping for a brighter blue, but honestly this probably looks better than a really bright blue.</li>
            <li>and I use it on special occasions.</li>
            <li>It actually looks good on me.</li>
            <li>Overall, was delighted with product and would recommend</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if maybe it&#x27;s blue under a special kind of light</li>
            <li>Great Lash has changed over the years since the 70s when I first started using it, and it was GREAT back then - and now, even though my eyelashes aren&#x27;t as lush as back then, the formula has changed somehow - even my 22-year-old daughter says it does nothing for her lashes.</li>
            <li>and when I was applying it to my lashes can barely notice it and it clumps up my lashes and I was expecting a very bright blue effect on my lashes</li>
            <li>BUY, super fun color</li>
            <li>I am not a royal blue kind of girl.</li>
            <li>I right away thought about locating on Amazon and sure enough found it.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>She was so excited you would have thought I had given her a fantastic present.</li>
            <li>I gave it as a gift and the person just love the royal blue on their eyes.</li>
            <li>The only thing that could be better is the applicator brush.  </li>
            <li>much says it all !</li>
            <li>Love to wear blue mascara.  </li>
            <li>This was my first drugstore brand mascara, so even though I did love the color, I think I&#x27;ll have to go back to my luxury brands.</li>
            <li>In the sunlight the royal blue is stunning.</li>
            <li>The blue color is stunning.</li>
            <li>but I think that the color definitely makes my eyes pop more.</li>
            <li>It is really fun to wear the color with a more blue outfit because I think that it really ties everything</li>
            <li>I love this blue mascara.  </li>
            <li>plus I LOVE it in blue</li>
            <li>I love the blue.</li>
            <li>This stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li>As others have stated, it does appear dark,but I have had many people comment re the blue color on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>the color is pretty</li>
            <li>Love blue!  </li>
            <li>I get many compliments from this blue mascara.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I now found a similar color that&#x27;s great for less money.</li>
            <li>I love how easily the mascara washes away with just plain water.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be easier to notice in bright light, not so much in artificial light.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t 100% waterproof and certainly isn&#x27;t immune to rubbing</li>
            <li>Is there any woman (of a certain age?)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty, rich shade of blue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now a huge fan and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I really liek this mascara, esxpecially for the price.  </li>
            <li>ITs really blue and its light</li>
            <li>Very pricey at 15.99.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>ok product as expected</li>
            <li>Advertisement was VERY MISLEADING.  </li>
            <li>very clumpy and sticky, not like store bought.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>, the blue color is perfect , I dont give a 5 because after few hrs don&#x27;t look the same</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from the mascara</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really get that.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>The black of this brand is pretty good but blue?</li>
            <li>nice to be able to have something other than black or brown!</li>
            <li>I have had this product in the past and love it for a pop that is unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;Brings out the blue in my eyes :-)</li>
            <li>I use the same product but in black, which is good though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so refreshing to have an alternative to black.</li>
            <li>Much better than the more expensive brands</li>
            <li>The only reason I bought it was because Its the only one I found and it was my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>This particular one is a very pretty vibrant blue.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Maybelline New York Great Lash Royal Blue every day for at least 15 years.  </li>
            <li>I use this on top of a coat of black for extra fun.  </li>
            <li>wish you made it a little darker, like more navy in color</li>
            <li>The color is nice but when applying my eyes started watering and within seconds my eyes were burning mess and I had blue raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>I have blond eye lashes so the blue really stands out and pops more than it does on someone with dark eye lashes.  </li>
            <li>It is delivered to me every 3 months automatically, reminding me that it&#x27;s time to start using new mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Maybelline Mascara since I was a teenager, and I love the blue color ,it&#x27;s been harder , and harder to find it locally, I was so glad the Amazon had it for sell.</li>
            <li>I was excited due to the fact that I can not find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m first going to say that I have really black eyelashes, so the results will probably be different from people with light hair.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the brush, which is my biggest issue because I prefer a full, fluffy brush and this one is not that.</li>
            <li>I had to wash an older Loreal Voluminous mascara brush that is a regular size brush (which is a great inexpensive mascara for volume) and put  it into the Great Lash tube,but it doesn&#x27;t fit well enough for the cap to screw on and close up,so now I had to wrap heavy duty foil around it with rubber bands also around it and put it in a plastic storage bag and hope that it doesn&#x27;t dry up and or go bad!</li>
            <li>This mascara is so cute, royal blue and last long!</li>
            <li>A little more Blue than I</li>
            <li>The only problem is you need a lot of coats to make it really show.</li>
            <li>I am 33 years old, and a professional</li>
            <li>WOW-</li>
            <li>The color really comes out in your eyelashes, if you&#x27;re a blonde.  </li>
            <li>could be old product or just doesnt travel well in florida heat.</li>
            <li>This is very royal blue.</li>
            <li>The color is just what I was looking for, but the mascara itself seemed old and this mascara wand has the tiniest brush I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>When the color comes out of the tube it is a really electric blue and when you apply it to your eyes it looks that way too</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t bring out the blue as much</li>
            <li>but after it dried for a couple of seconds the color became more of a dark/navy blue.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a lot more fun than plain old black or brown mascara!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice change from everyday black or brown.</li>
            <li>I have very dark eyelashes, and I can see the blue in almost any light.</li>
            <li>I love the color, it&#x27;s hard to find!</li>
            <li>Very think brush and dry also.  </li>
            <li>Lately, I have been using MAC&#x27;s Prep &amp; Prime lash primer before using the Royal Blue Maybelline and it does help the lashes to separate better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a whole size smaller than a regular size mascara brush.</li>
            <li>I can see the color clearly on the mascara wand, but not so much on my lashes (which are a dark brown color naturally)...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad the product had to lose a star just for the applicator, since the product itself is so great.  </li>
            <li>I frequently get compliments on my blue eye lashes.  </li>
            <li>and I can barely see the color when I put the mascara on.  </li>
            <li>The last tube I bought at Walgreens and the one near my work no longer stocks &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; mascara.  </li>
            <li>this mascara goes on nicely, and my lashes look long and thin and not chunky.  </li>
            <li>I have very light blue eyes and black mascara looks harsh on me.</li>
            <li>it ended up looking like the same old black mascara, however, maybe in certain lights a difference might be noticed.</li>
            <li>if you actually do really want blue mascara and you have dark hair, than I would suggest also getting a mascara primer.  </li>
            <li>One of the very few companies that still produces the RIGHT blue color!</li>
            <li>*tiny* scimpy little brush,the smallest I have ever seen and had and your not going to get that much volume with it.</li>
            <li>I still like it, but it&#x27;s not as bold and heavy as other more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>Most people said it would turn out to be black, so I figured that if it was black, than I would just use it as black mascara, and that&#x27;s what happened.</li>
            <li>Overall, if you&#x27;re getting this for the color, I would say that its VERY subtle/nearly black, so make sure that is what you are looking for... in terms of a mascara, this is really not something that is going to give you a dramatic look in terms of fullness and length.</li>

            <li> It is good and not expensive.  </li>
            <li> Good product , I was looking for a blue mascara and found it at amazon this mascara is good because it doesn&#x27;t leave lumps on your lashes</li>
            <li> It will leave a light coating, but you might need to use a plumper or another mascara to go over it to add more volume.  </li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on smoothly day after day, love the colors, and it doesn&#x27;t smear, but still comes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> good product, nice blue color..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as the $25 Lancome mascara I normally use.  </li>
            <li> This color is amazing - no need to wear any eye shadow because the color is so vibrant!</li>
            <li> guess the search continues, huge letdown.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find a better mascara than the Maybelline Colossal.</li>
            <li> It seems they do not focus on colorful mascaras any more</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find BLUE!</li>
            <li> Everyday use, looks amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> This color goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> but I always come back to Mabelline Great Lash.</li>
            <li> Good product, but the shade of blue is rather too bright for normal every day make up application for me</li>
            <li> My favorite blue estee Lauder mascara was discontinued and this seemed to be an effective (and cheaper) alternative..</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was hoping for a brighter blue, but honestly this probably looks better than a really bright blue.</li>
            <li> and I use it on special occasions.</li>
            <li> It actually looks good on me.</li>
            <li> Overall, was delighted with product and would recommend</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if maybe it&#x27;s blue under a special kind of light</li>
            <li> Great Lash has changed over the years since the 70s when I first started using it, and it was GREAT back then - and now, even though my eyelashes aren&#x27;t as lush as back then, the formula has changed somehow - even my 22-year-old daughter says it does nothing for her lashes.</li>
            <li> and when I was applying it to my lashes can barely notice it and it clumps up my lashes and I was expecting a very bright blue effect on my lashes</li>
            <li> BUY, super fun color</li>
            <li> I am not a royal blue kind of girl.</li>
            <li> I right away thought about locating on Amazon and sure enough found it.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> She was so excited you would have thought I had given her a fantastic present.</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift and the person just love the royal blue on their eyes.</li>
            <li> The only thing that could be better is the applicator brush.  </li>
            <li> much says it all !</li>
            <li> Love to wear blue mascara.  </li>
            <li> This was my first drugstore brand mascara, so even though I did love the color, I think I&#x27;ll have to go back to my luxury brands.</li>
            <li> In the sunlight the royal blue is stunning.</li>
            <li> The blue color is stunning.</li>
            <li> but I think that the color definitely makes my eyes pop more.</li>
            <li> It is really fun to wear the color with a more blue outfit because I think that it really ties everything</li>
            <li> I love this blue mascara.  </li>
            <li> plus I LOVE it in blue</li>
            <li> I love the blue.</li>
            <li> This stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, it does appear dark,but I have had many people comment re the blue color on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> the color is pretty</li>
            <li> Love blue!  </li>
            <li> I get many compliments from this blue mascara.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I now found a similar color that&#x27;s great for less money.</li>
            <li> I love how easily the mascara washes away with just plain water.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be easier to notice in bright light, not so much in artificial light.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t 100% waterproof and certainly isn&#x27;t immune to rubbing</li>
            <li> Is there any woman (of a certain age?)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty, rich shade of blue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now a huge fan and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really liek this mascara, esxpecially for the price.  </li>
            <li> ITs really blue and its light</li>
            <li> Very pricey at 15.99.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> ok product as expected</li>
            <li> Advertisement was VERY MISLEADING.  </li>
            <li> very clumpy and sticky, not like store bought.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> , the blue color is perfect , I dont give a 5 because after few hrs don&#x27;t look the same</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from the mascara</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really get that.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> The black of this brand is pretty good but blue?</li>
            <li> nice to be able to have something other than black or brown!</li>
            <li> I have had this product in the past and love it for a pop that is unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;Brings out the blue in my eyes :-)</li>
            <li> I use the same product but in black, which is good though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so refreshing to have an alternative to black.</li>
            <li> Much better than the more expensive brands</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought it was because Its the only one I found and it was my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> This particular one is a very pretty vibrant blue.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Maybelline New York Great Lash Royal Blue every day for at least 15 years.  </li>
            <li> I use this on top of a coat of black for extra fun.  </li>
            <li> wish you made it a little darker, like more navy in color</li>
            <li> The color is nice but when applying my eyes started watering and within seconds my eyes were burning mess and I had blue raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> I have blond eye lashes so the blue really stands out and pops more than it does on someone with dark eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> It is delivered to me every 3 months automatically, reminding me that it&#x27;s time to start using new mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Maybelline Mascara since I was a teenager, and I love the blue color ,it&#x27;s been harder , and harder to find it locally, I was so glad the Amazon had it for sell.</li>
            <li> I was excited due to the fact that I can not find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m first going to say that I have really black eyelashes, so the results will probably be different from people with light hair.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the brush, which is my biggest issue because I prefer a full, fluffy brush and this one is not that.</li>
            <li> I had to wash an older Loreal Voluminous mascara brush that is a regular size brush (which is a great inexpensive mascara for volume) and put  it into the Great Lash tube,but it doesn&#x27;t fit well enough for the cap to screw on and close up,so now I had to wrap heavy duty foil around it with rubber bands also around it and put it in a plastic storage bag and hope that it doesn&#x27;t dry up and or go bad!</li>
            <li> This mascara is so cute, royal blue and last long!</li>
            <li> A little more Blue than I</li>
            <li> The only problem is you need a lot of coats to make it really show.</li>
            <li> I am 33 years old, and a professional</li>
            <li> WOW-</li>
            <li> The color really comes out in your eyelashes, if you&#x27;re a blonde.  </li>
            <li> could be old product or just doesnt travel well in florida heat.</li>
            <li> This is very royal blue.</li>
            <li> The color is just what I was looking for, but the mascara itself seemed old and this mascara wand has the tiniest brush I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> When the color comes out of the tube it is a really electric blue and when you apply it to your eyes it looks that way too</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t bring out the blue as much</li>
            <li> but after it dried for a couple of seconds the color became more of a dark/navy blue.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a lot more fun than plain old black or brown mascara!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice change from everyday black or brown.</li>
            <li> I have very dark eyelashes, and I can see the blue in almost any light.</li>
            <li> I love the color, it&#x27;s hard to find!</li>
            <li> Very think brush and dry also.  </li>
            <li> Lately, I have been using MAC&#x27;s Prep &amp; Prime lash primer before using the Royal Blue Maybelline and it does help the lashes to separate better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a whole size smaller than a regular size mascara brush.</li>
            <li> I can see the color clearly on the mascara wand, but not so much on my lashes (which are a dark brown color naturally)...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad the product had to lose a star just for the applicator, since the product itself is so great.  </li>
            <li> I frequently get compliments on my blue eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> and I can barely see the color when I put the mascara on.  </li>
            <li> The last tube I bought at Walgreens and the one near my work no longer stocks &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; mascara.  </li>
            <li> this mascara goes on nicely, and my lashes look long and thin and not chunky.  </li>
            <li> I have very light blue eyes and black mascara looks harsh on me.</li>
            <li> it ended up looking like the same old black mascara, however, maybe in certain lights a difference might be noticed.</li>
            <li> if you actually do really want blue mascara and you have dark hair, than I would suggest also getting a mascara primer.  </li>
            <li> One of the very few companies that still produces the RIGHT blue color!</li>
            <li> *tiny* scimpy little brush,the smallest I have ever seen and had and your not going to get that much volume with it.</li>
            <li> I still like it, but it&#x27;s not as bold and heavy as other more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> Most people said it would turn out to be black, so I figured that if it was black, than I would just use it as black mascara, and that&#x27;s what happened.</li>
            <li> Overall, if you&#x27;re getting this for the color, I would say that its VERY subtle/nearly black, so make sure that is what you are looking for... in terms of a mascara, this is really not something that is going to give you a dramatic look in terms of fullness and length.</li>
            <li> but I normally get black.</li>
            <li> You know, there are some women that just don&#x27;t look right with any other color on their lashes!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a color other than black.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a sucker for blue mascara and Maybelline never fail.</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s a stuggle just to get them thick, but when we use Maybelline New York Colossal mascara for about $6, both of our eyelashes are long, thick, and lush.</li>
            <li> This color definitely appears to be more subtle than black or dark brown.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle enough that you could wear it to the office and only those who were really paying attention would notice.</li>
            <li> if you would use blue mascara over your regular mascara, the red bloodshot eyes would be less noticable.</li>
            <li> Take the time to read the whole title, duh.</li>
            <li> It was probably out in the sun too long.</li>
            <li> and it did not really give off that much blue color.</li>
            <li> I can only assume that it is due to the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> The royal blue color never seemed to smudge on me like the other colors did.</li>
            <li> I found the mascara almost dry not intensive .</li>
            <li> I have cronic dry eyes that are always bloodshot.</li>
            <li> It was so dry that I could not get any on my lashes.</li>
            <li> when people notice it, it is always followed by a compliment, however, Royal blue is getting near impossible to find in stores, there is every shade of black under the sun but rarely Royal Blue.</li>
            <li> So to all the dark haired humans, I got the blue mascara after reading the comments.  </li>
            <li> Been wearing this color and using this brand for a very long time!</li>
            <li> and this is blue on the wand (as others have stated) but looks black on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I thought only black was the color to wear.</li>
            <li> A few friends with dark lashes have tried the blue and it doesn&#x27;t look the same as it does on me.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother because every single store has discontinued plain BLUE mascara.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I wear this shade, since it accentuates my blue eyes without making me look like Mimi from the Drew Carey Show, or that crazy bus driver from elementary school.</li>
            <li> , it turned dark blue almost black.</li>
            <li> but when I ordered mine, it was not as liquid as other mascaras</li>
            <li> : The Royal Blue doesn&#x27;t show as much as Green Envy!</li>
            <li> The blue color is subtle when dries, just enough color to brighten my hazel green eyes.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores this color blue.</li>
            <li> I have dark blue/grey eyes</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this color for at least 10 years, I like it because it is different and</li>
            <li> but maybe this isn&#x27;t for dark eyelashes?  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing Maybelline since I was 13 (dark ages)</li>
            <li> No amount of double and triple coating makes it a thick mascara.</li>
            <li> Also on my medium dark brown lashes the blue hardly shows up even with 2 coats,it looks almost black but not as black as black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In terms of a mascara&#x27;s purpose- to define, elongate and thicken, I would have to give this mascara a thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara for the color... wanted something other than black, but still subtle enough for every day wear.</li>
            <li> As quite a few people have said on here,youtube,and other make up review sites</li>
            <li> I look terrible with black or brown mascara and there are many people like m who like dark blue mascara -</li>
            <li> I use their over the counter black mascara</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, they only people that noticed were ones talking to me face to face.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s brown and black mascara after all, why shouldn&#x27;t we have&lt;br /&gt;blue to match or contrast with our eyes?</li>
            <li> Also, it does not wash away or run down my face with a few tears.  </li>
            <li> No special products needed for removal.  </li>
            <li> However, black is too harsh on me</li>
            <li> my little sister Nancy has used Maybelline blue mascara for 25 years and over the past few years has been unable to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> I have very dark eyelashes</li>
            <li> I have green eyes.</li>
            <li> It was somewhat dried out.</li>
            <li> But from a few feet away, no, it&#x27;s not noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have green eyes</li>
            <li> now all one can by is black, very black and serious black - does not make sense.</li>
            <li> I use a white base coat from Lancome and my lashes did not not show a hint of blue due to it being dried out.</li>
            <li> It makes my green eyes pop!</li>
            <li> I usually use Lancome mascara</li>
            <li> Very few manufacturers make it.</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe</li>
            <li> That is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s thin and goes on that way.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but it is disappointing.</li>
            <li> It does show up on my brown lashes but doesn&#x27;t look silly.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong color by accident.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this mascara for years, every so often I go crazy and buy something else</li>
            <li> This mascara was a bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Too bad for my wallet.</li>
            <li> I was soon very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I gave it as a gift and the person just love the royal blue on their eyes. I had to buy three for her.</li>
            <li> I have green eyes. This is my go to mascera. It makes my green eyes pop! If I could just find a nice violet Id be set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m first going to say that I have really black eyelashes, so the results will probably be different from people with light hair.  So to all the dark haired humans, I got the blue mascara after reading the comments.  Most people said it would turn out to be black, so I figured that if it was black, than I would just use it as black mascara, and that&#x27;s what happened. Some people noticed the blue, but even when I looked closely, I couldn&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;So if you actually do really want blue mascara and you have dark hair, than I would suggest also getting a mascara primer.  I didn&#x27;t try that, but before the mascara dries, it actually did look really blue, so I think that primer would help.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this mascara since 1996. I love it and get complements all the time on them. I have dark blue/grey eyes and it&#x27;s a great match. This isn&#x27;t 100% waterproof and certainly isn&#x27;t immune to rubbing but it holds up well all day. When I apply to my lower lashes I tap my lower lids and smudge so it doubles as a smokey liner. I&#x27;m nearing 20 years with this product...I clearly love it and am thrilled it&#x27;s offered with subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> I believe this colour has been discontinued, but Amazon had some!</li>
            <li> I love these colored mascaras! This particular one is a very pretty vibrant blue. The only problem is you need a lot of coats to make it really show.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Maybelline New York Great Lash Royal Blue every day for at least 15 years.  I frequently get compliments on my blue eye lashes.  I have blond eye lashes so the blue really stands out and pops more than it does on someone with dark eye lashes.  A few friends with dark lashes have tried the blue and it doesn&#x27;t look the same as it does on me.  I love how easily the mascara washes away with just plain water.  No special products needed for removal.  Also, it does not wash away or run down my face with a few tears.  The only thing that could be better is the applicator brush.  There are better applicators for keeping lashes separate.  Lately, I have been using MAC&#x27;s Prep &amp; Prime lash primer before using the Royal Blue Maybelline and it does help the lashes to separate better.  It&#x27;s too bad the product had to lose a star just for the applicator, since the product itself is so great.  I also love that Amazon has this on Subscribe and Save.  It is delivered to me every 3 months automatically, reminding me that it&#x27;s time to start using new mascara.</li>
            <li> Great Lash has changed over the years since the 70s when I first started using it, and it was GREAT back then - and now, even though my eyelashes aren&#x27;t as lush as back then, the formula has changed somehow - even my 22-year-old daughter says it does nothing for her lashes. She says it&#x27;s a stuggle just to get them thick, but when we use Maybelline New York Colossal mascara for about $6, both of our eyelashes are long, thick, and lush. Can&#x27;t find a better mascara than the Maybelline Colossal. Great Lash just isn&#x27;t what it used to be.</li>
            <li> Lovely color, but it makes my eyes itch.</li>
            <li> Very think brush and dry also.  I use their over the counter black mascara and it is great.  It seems they do not focus on colorful mascaras any more</li>
            <li> I really liek this mascara, esxpecially for the price.  The blue color is subtle when dries, just enough color to brighten my hazel green eyes.  I am 33 years old, and a professional so I wanted something age-appropriate- this mascara goes on nicely, and my lashes look long and thin and not chunky.  If you want something to add a ton of volume and color this is probably not going to be enough for you, but it is perfect for every day use.  I love it and plan to buy it again!</li>
            <li> For the price, its great.  Much better than the more expensive brands and I use it on special occasions.</li>
            <li> I got the washable for my gran-daughters. It is hard to believe&lt;br /&gt;I got them (pre-teens) the same brand mascara I used &amp;#34;secretly&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;in my teens and still do. WOW- what more can I say? That&lt;br /&gt;pretty much says it all !</li>
            <li> Love to wear blue mascara.  The price is very reasonable.  A tube lasts forever.</li>
            <li> ITs really blue and its light u don&#x27;t feel it on ur eyebrows. I get a lots of compliments on it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Maybelline mascara for 20 years and I love it!</li>
            <li> It was somewhat dried out. It was probably out in the sun too long. Plastic was yellowish. The only reason I bought it was because Its the only one I found and it was my favorite mascara. Very pricey at 15.99. Luckily I now found a similar color that&#x27;s great for less money.</li>
            <li> I found the mascara almost dry not intensive . also it supposed to be navy blue and it was when I applied it but after 10 minutes, it turned dark blue almost black.</li>
            <li> Wear this color every day to work.  I get a lot of compliments and people constantly asking me what color I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> If you like Great Lash, then you will like this. It&#x27;s a pretty, rich shade of blue. It does show up on my brown lashes but doesn&#x27;t look silly. It&#x27;s subtle, they only people that noticed were ones talking to me face to face. But from a few feet away, no, it&#x27;s not noticeable. If you want a bigger pow, try layering a white lash primer underneath. It&#x27;s a nice change from everyday black or brown.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find BLUE!</li>
            <li> I usually use Lancome mascara but I was looking for a mascara in blue.  I thought I&#x27;d give this a try and I&#x27;m happy I did.  It&#x27;s just as good as the $25 Lancome mascara I normally use.  I&#x27;m now a huge fan and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> wish you made it a little darker, like more navy in color</li>
            <li> I heard great reviews about it but when I ordered mine, it was not as liquid as other mascaras and it did not really give off that much blue color. I use the same product but in black, which is good though.</li>
            <li> I have cronic dry eyes that are always bloodshot. I read somewhere if you would use blue mascara over your regular mascara, the red bloodshot eyes would be less noticable. I ried and it did make a differerence for me. No store had blue mascara so I got it here. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I use this on top of a coat of black for extra fun.  It is good and not expensive.  I am happy that they still make it.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this color for at least 10 years, I like it because it is different and when people notice it, it is always followed by a compliment, however, Royal blue is getting near impossible to find in stores, there is every shade of black under the sun but rarely Royal Blue. Thank you Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I remember when I used to use this brand as a teenager and loved it.  I still like it, but it&#x27;s not as bold and heavy as other more expensive brands.  It will leave a light coating, but you might need to use a plumper or another mascara to go over it to add more volume.  Still a great buy and good for the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; eyelashes look.</li>
            <li> The color is nice but when applying my eyes started watering and within seconds my eyes were burning mess and I had blue raccoon eyes. This has never happened to me before so I can only assume that it is due to the quality of the product. This was my first drugstore brand mascara, so even though I did love the color, I think I&#x27;ll have to go back to my luxury brands. Too bad for my wallet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this mascara for years, every so often I go crazy and buy something else and I always regret it and end up going back to Maybelline.  This mascara doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on smoothly day after day, love the colors, and it doesn&#x27;t smear, but still comes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> ok product as expected</li>
            <li> Advertisement was VERY MISLEADING.  I paid $15 for ONE tube, it was advertised as quantity of 3, or so I thought I understood.  That is ridiculous.  I&#x27;m assuming, now, that that meant there was a quantity of 3 left to be purchased, not $15 for 3 tubes of mascara.  I will never purchase this way again.</li>
            <li> I have had this product in the past and love it for a pop that is unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;Brings out the blue in my eyes :-)</li>
            <li> The color really comes out in your eyelashes, if you&#x27;re a blonde.  I have very dark eyelashes and I can barely see the color when I put the mascara on.  When my friends wear it, it is so beautiful.</li>
            <li> Good product, but the shade of blue is rather too bright for normal every day make up application for me</li>
            <li> I thought it was Navy blue; I guess I purchased in error. The actual product is not at fault though.</li>
            <li> very clumpy and sticky, not like store bought. could be old product or just doesnt travel well in florida heat.</li>
            <li> This is very royal blue. Fantastic! I wear it all the time and get lots of compliments on it. The color is bright and it even looks good with my brown eyes.</li>
            <li> This mascara was a bit of a disappointment. The color is just what I was looking for, but the mascara itself seemed old and this mascara wand has the tiniest brush I&#x27;ve ever seen. Sort of like what they used to sell in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> was supposed to be 2 tubes for 16.98 I only got one, no way I would pay that much for one tube plus it was open, and dried out</li>
            <li> I love the color, it&#x27;s hard to find! Very few manufacturers make it. That being said, it&#x27;s thin and goes on that way. No amount of double and triple coating makes it a thick mascara. I only use it when I MUST have this color.</li>
            <li> good product, nice blue color..</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my royal blue mascara.  The colour is good and not too bright which is great for every day.  I like the brush which does not clog my eyelashes.  I cannot understand why they no longer sell blue mascara in Australia.  I look terrible with black or brown mascara and there are many people like m who like dark blue mascara - now all one can by is black, very black and serious black - does not make sense.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed great. My favorite blue estee Lauder mascara was discontinued and this seemed to be an effective (and cheaper) alternative..but just 2 weeks later my eyelids feel as if they&#x27;re on fire and by the end of the day they&#x27;re swollen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the search continues, huge letdown.</li>
            <li> The only mascara that doesn&#x27;t run for me (but it has to be the royal blue shade)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother because every single store has discontinued plain BLUE mascara. Not sure why, but it is disappointing. My mom has beautiful blue eyes &amp; this mascara has always looked so beautiful on her. Glad I can get it for her on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Is there any woman (of a certain age?) who has not worn this mascara at some point in her life?  There&#x27;s brown and black mascara after all, why shouldn&#x27;t we have&lt;br /&gt;blue to match or contrast with our eyes? Perfect for any time of day  or night- gives your eyes that added bit of oomph - Use it always...</li>
            <li> my little sister Nancy has used Maybelline blue mascara for 25 years and over the past few years has been unable to find in local stores. I right away thought about locating on Amazon and sure enough found it. I ordered 2 and gave them to her for Christmas. She was so excited you would have thought I had given her a fantastic present. made me feel good that she was so happy.</li>
            <li> This color is amazing - no need to wear any eye shadow because the color is so vibrant! The mascara stays on until I wash it off and it gives great length and volume to my lashes.</li>
            <li> everything perfect especially the deliver time.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of comments when I wear this mascara.  In the sunlight the royal blue is stunning.</li>
            <li> So glad I can still find this mascara...have been using since I was a teenager!</li>
            <li> As quite a few people have said on here,youtube,and other make up review sites,it&#x27;s a *tiny* scimpy little brush,the smallest I have ever seen and had and your not going to get that much volume with it. The  Maybelline describes it as adding length and volume.Also on my medium dark brown lashes the blue hardly shows up even with 2 coats,it looks almost black but not as black as black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a whole size smaller than a regular size mascara brush.I had to wash an older Loreal Voluminous mascara brush that is a regular size brush (which is a great inexpensive mascara for volume) and put  it into the Great Lash tube,but it doesn&#x27;t fit well enough for the cap to screw on and close up,so now I had to wrap heavy duty foil around it with rubber bands also around it and put it in a plastic storage bag and hope that it doesn&#x27;t dry up and or go bad!</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing! It&#x27;s so refreshing to have an alternative to black. I&#x27;ve received several compliments on it because it&#x27;s different and brightens up your eyes! I want to get all different colors!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: The Royal Blue doesn&#x27;t show as much as Green Envy!</li>
            <li> Excellent non-clumping mascara that makes your lashes long and beautiful. The blue color is stunning. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and have gotten so many complements.</li>
            <li> It works when applied but doesn&#x27;t  help your eyelashes since it makes your lashes fall out.</li>
            <li> I bought mine in blue. Very fun for a weekend!</li>
            <li> This is the type of mascara I always use but I normally get black. However, black is too harsh on me so I decided to try blue. It works! It actually looks good on me. Yay!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Maybelline Mascara since I was a teenager, and I love the blue color ,it&#x27;s been harder , and harder to find it locally, I was so glad the Amazon had it for sell.</li>
            <li> Hello!!! This mascara is so cute, royal blue and last long! Everyday use, looks amazing!!!!! Try it, so good for shure!</li>
            <li> I got this because I saw it in a magazine and wanted to try it out. When the color comes out of the tube it is a really electric blue and when you apply it to your eyes it looks that way too but after it dried for a couple of seconds the color became more of a dark/navy blue. I have green eyes so they don&#x27;t bring out the blue as much but I think that the color definitely makes my eyes pop more. It is really fun to wear the color with a more blue outfit because I think that it really ties everything together.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT BUY, super fun color</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, always get MANY compliments on it!</li>
            <li> I love this blue mascara.  This is my first time trying a color other than black.  Try it, you will like it.</li>
            <li> This color goes on so smoothly.  I have blue/green eyes so it compliments my eyes nicely.  I hope they never quit making this color.</li>
            <li> I keep trying different brands but I always come back to Mabelline Great Lash. I ordered the wrong color by accident. Take the time to read the whole title, duh. I am not a royal blue kind of girl. Well ... not since the 80&#x27;s, that is.</li>
            <li> I bought two because one of the girls I e&lt;br /&gt;Work with had said she could not find it in stores. If you have blue eyes,this is for you. We both love it</li>
            <li> Another product I have used for years. It does everything it&#x27;s advertised to do plus I LOVE it in blue--it makes one&#x27;s eyes look brighter.</li>
            <li> I love the blue. It&#x27;s sort of electric, where the Cargo stuff I&#x27;d been using was more navy. I prefer the electric blue. This stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li> Great product.  A little more Blue than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;You can not find Blue Mascara anywhere in the stores,&lt;br /&gt;or online, so this worked out great.</li>
            <li> I have used maybelline mascara for 35 years.  Royal blue was my color of choice.  After moving to ct from tx i was no longer able to find it. My daughter suggested I try amazon and i did.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand and color for many years.I have very light blue eyes and black mascara looks harsh on me.As others have stated, it does appear dark,but I have had many people comment re the blue color on my eyelashes.It seems to be easier to notice in bright light, not so much in artificial light. This color definitely appears to be more subtle than black or dark brown. Also,I wear  contacts and have had no problems in that area. This doesn&#x27;t leave me with raccoon eyes. I really like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara for the color... wanted something other than black, but still subtle enough for every day wear. I can see the color clearly on the mascara wand, but not so much on my lashes (which are a dark brown color naturally)...it ended up looking like the same old black mascara, however, maybe in certain lights a difference might be noticed. In terms of a mascara&#x27;s purpose- to define, elongate and thicken, I would have to give this mascara a thumbs down. I really don&#x27;t like the brush, which is my biggest issue because I prefer a full, fluffy brush and this one is not that. The mascara isn&#x27;t clumpy, which is probably the only plus I found, but I needed to apply three or four coats to get my desired result. Overall, if you&#x27;re getting this for the color, I would say that its VERY subtle/nearly black, so make sure that is what you are looking for... in terms of a mascara, this is really not something that is going to give you a dramatic look in terms of fullness and length. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to make my blue eyes POP and this is blue on the wand (as others have stated) but looks black on my lashes.  I don&#x27;t know if maybe it&#x27;s blue under a special kind of light but maybe this isn&#x27;t for dark eyelashes?  I couldn&#x27;t see any blue on mine..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a sucker for blue mascara and Maybelline never fail. love the product. the color is pretty</li>
            <li> This product is great,  goes on smoothly and no clumps. Delivered on time as stated, and priced within a nice range.  Perhaps Maybelline will offer Purple again in the color mascaras.  Overall, was delighted with product and would recommend</li>
            <li> Love blue!  Been wearing this color and using this brand for a very long time!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want blue, but this is what they sent. The black of this brand is pretty good but blue? I wasn&#x27;t looking for Halloween makeup and I&#x27;m not going to any raves soon. They wouldn&#x27;t take returns so I guess I&#x27;m stuck with this.</li>
            <li> When I received this  I was excited due to the fact that I can not find it in stores anymore.I was soon very disappointed. It was so dry that I could not get any on my lashes. I use a white base coat from Lancome and my lashes did not not show a hint of blue due to it being dried out. I do NOT recommend ordering this product on line from this seller.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments from this blue mascara.  I use it the most.</li>
            <li> this is the easiest mascara to wash off.  it&#x27;s the only one i buy.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the Great Lash Royal Blue with a curved wand, which I loved. The royal blue color never seemed to smudge on me like the other colors did. And if it did, it looked artistic or blended in with my veins or something, which was great! I&#x27;m sad that I can&#x27;t find this in my town any more.</li>
            <li> nice to be able to have something other than black or brown! I have very dark eyelashes, and I can see the blue in almost any light. (outside or inside)</li>
            <li> This mascara look very nice and very easy to wash , the blue color is perfect , I dont give a 5 because after few hrs don&#x27;t look the same but still I  like the color ,</li>
            <li> When I started wearingmakeup I thought only black was the color to wear. Then I found the royal blue, to experiment. Gorgeous color on. You can really only notice the blue when outside in the sunlight. I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> The last tube I bought at Walgreens and the one near my work no longer stocks &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; mascara.  Love this color and was so happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from the mascara but it was very light and when I was applying it to my lashes can barely notice it and it clumps up my lashes and I was expecting a very bright blue effect on my lashes and I didn&#x27;t really get that.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. I have to admit I was hoping for a brighter blue, but honestly this probably looks better than a really bright blue. It&#x27;s subtle enough that you could wear it to the office and only those who were really paying attention would notice. It is what it says it is - a royal blue. But I think it does accentuate my blue eyes. And it&#x27;s a lot more fun than plain old black or brown mascara!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Maybelline since I was 13 (dark ages)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find any blue mascara in stores, so I&#x27;ve resorted to ordering online. I always get compliments when I wear this shade, since it accentuates my blue eyes without making me look like Mimi from the Drew Carey Show, or that crazy bus driver from elementary school. I don&#x27;t spend a lot on makeup, but even when I&#x27;m wearing nothing else on my face, this mascara is a MUST.</li>
            <li> Good product , I was looking for a blue mascara and found it at amazon this mascara is good because it doesn&#x27;t leave lumps on your lashes</li>
            <li> Another winner! This was a replacement of a product I&#x27;ve been using. One of the very few companies that still produces the RIGHT blue color! You know, there are some women that just don&#x27;t look right with any other color on their lashes!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump.  It gives that perfect hint of color. I love this mascara! Pleased &amp; Totally satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores this color blue. Love it that I&#x27;m on automatic 3 mo. shipment.  I don&#x27;t have to remember to purchase it because I buy it for a friend who can&#x27;t afford to always go out and buy any extra personal things for her self.&lt;br /&gt;She loves the surprise when she opens her mailbox. THX</li>
