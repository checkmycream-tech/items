            <li>This is a lovely fall color and it feels nice on.</li>
            <li>Love love love the shade!</li>
            <li>Ok product.</li>
            <li>The color was darker and more like a neutral color once it arrived.</li>
            <li>Already a favorite and</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more to keep as spares.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth when you apply.</li>
            <li>Buy this, and more, since you don&#x27;t ever want to run out.</li>
            <li>I can see myself purchasing more of these colors (the purple</li>
            <li>but I would consider this color more of a stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the color was very rich looking..did recieve alot of complements.</li>
            <li>Its a perfect kind of brown/mauve without being too dark.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous shades and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied will order again if givem the opportunity, thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare that I ever find a reddish match for my skin complexion but this color is winning.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth</li>
            <li>Nice color to wear with black or a nice beige, easy to lighten with a dab of a tissue.</li>
            <li>Despite the cool color, this is a miss for me for this reason.  </li>
            <li>that this color doesn&#x27;t need a liner to look full</li>
            <li>Was not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Loreal lipsticks smell funny</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last at all on the lips and that smell and taste are wacky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m bringing sexy back.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s unusual for me to buy a lipstick with a scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll pass on Loreal lipstick, despite the really cool colors.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty color and the picture looks exactly like the color, but I like long lasting lipstick that glides on with one application and this product does not do it.</li>
            <li>It this price I did not expect much, pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise nice color and the only complaint I have for this brand is the smell</li>
            <li>difficulty I have with this is that it has small sparkles inside of the lipstick that clump easily on your lips.</li>
            <li>I thought this color would be more like a brownish/darker color, which it is, but it also has a subtle hint of a deep purple with it too.</li>
            <li>It has a smell that I do not like, It&#x27;s not overly powerful, very subtle and almost pleasant (I am just annoyed by anything with scents</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am a black female, deep dark, so finding a red that doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve been punched in the mouth and bleeding rainbows is rare.&lt;br</li>
            <li> read the reviews about how dark this color was, then some that stated that it wasn&#x27;t dark enough and took my chance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shiny, dark bronze color, not what I was expecting but</li>
            <li> The one complaint I have is the weird perfume smell but the color is worth it.</li>
            <li> I recommend applying a small touch of lip balm/chapstick over this product or before usage.</li>
            <li> it at least lasts a while on the lips.</li>
            <li> The color does not go on very thick and you need to keep applying to your lips in order for it to look like you have color.</li>
            <li> Maybe one of the cherry flavored balms would work for me, I&#x27;m not sure, but I can tell you that Loreal lipsticks,in general, are awful.  </li>
            <li> nothing bad either.&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Ok product. Was not bad for the price. Just didnt like the shade.</li>
            <li> Nice color to wear with black or a nice beige, easy to lighten with a dab of a tissue. Otherwise nice color and the only complaint I have for this brand is the smell but it stops bothering after a bit of wearing the color .. it at least lasts a while on the lips.</li>
            <li> I thought this color would be more like a brownish/darker color, which it is, but it also has a subtle hint of a deep purple with it too. Applies very nicely and goes well with a more fall season type of look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only difficulty I have with this is that it has small sparkles inside of the lipstick that clump easily on your lips. I recommend applying a small touch of lip balm/chapstick over this product or before usage.</li>
            <li> The color was darker and more like a neutral color once it arrived. I didn&#x27;t like it but gave it to my grandmother and it looks awesome on her</li>
            <li> I love the color was very rich looking..did recieve alot of complements. I would recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS LIPSTICK! Shipping was fast and the product was perfectly protected! Love love love the shade! I need to get a back up of this shade...maybe two. Already a favorite and I haven&#x27;t even worn it out yet.</li>
            <li> Girls, if you&#x27;re into that shade of lipstick don&#x27;t miss this one.  I will be ordering more to keep as spares.</li>
            <li> This color is great! Its a perfect kind of brown/mauve without being too dark. The one complaint I have is the weird perfume smell but the color is worth it.</li>
            <li> Loved the shades from the collection &amp;#34;Project Runway&amp;#34; and will collect all 4. Gorgeous shades and very moisturizing. Excellent seller as well.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely fall color and it feels nice on.It&#x27;s a great value; I think I will buy it again before this color is discontinued.</li>
            <li> This lipstick was on my daughter&#x27;s wish list (go figure).  I purchased it for her, along with several other items on her list.  She loves the color and is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth when you apply. Lots of color and people will stare as the color brings out your beautiful face. I need all the help I can get. Buy this, and more, since you don&#x27;t ever want to run out.</li>
            <li> I love this color!  This lipstick shines and looks great on lips.  I would definitely recommend this product and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Loreal lipsticks smell funny and I can taste the perfume.  This is unacceptable in a lipstick.  Despite the cool color, this is a miss for me for this reason.  I can&#x27;t understand a cosmetic company that puts fragrance in a lipstick.  Maybe one of the cherry flavored balms would work for me, I&#x27;m not sure, but I can tell you that Loreal lipsticks,in general, are awful.  They don&#x27;t last at all on the lips and that smell and taste are wacky.  Next time, I&#x27;ll pass on Loreal lipstick, despite the really cool colors.</li>
            <li> It this price I did not expect much, pleasantly surprised.  Very satisfied will order again if givem the opportunity, thanks.</li>
            <li> The color does not go on very thick and you need to keep applying to your lips in order for it to look like you have color. It is a pretty color and the picture looks exactly like the color, but I like long lasting lipstick that glides on with one application and this product does not do it. I do like the blush products from this line.</li>
            <li> Not as described,horrible texture</li>
            <li> -The lipstick arrived sooner than I thought so that was good.&lt;br /&gt;- It goes on smooth and the pigment is great. It&#x27;s a shiny, dark bronze color, not what I was expecting but nothing bad either.&lt;br /&gt;- It has a smell that I do not like, It&#x27;s not overly powerful, very subtle and almost pleasant (I am just annoyed by anything with scents so it&#x27;s unusual for me to buy a lipstick with a scent.&lt;br /&gt;- I can see myself purchasing more of these colors (the purple one)&lt;br /&gt;-I especially like that this color doesn&#x27;t need a liner to look full</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare that I ever find a reddish match for my skin complexion but this color is winning. I just received it today and put it on and HELLO! I&#x27;m bringing sexy back. I am a black female, deep dark, so finding a red that doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve been punched in the mouth and bleeding rainbows is rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews about how dark this color was, then some that stated that it wasn&#x27;t dark enough and took my chance. It&#x27;s actually darker than the photo. It goes on smooth but I would consider this color more of a stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprise! I didn&#x27;t have to pay 15 bucks for it</li>
