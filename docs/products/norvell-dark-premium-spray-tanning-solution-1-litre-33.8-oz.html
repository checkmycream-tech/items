            <li>Love love love this solution!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE the color.</li>
            <li>plus this is a great price, one spary tan would cost as much as this one bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but not my favorite to spray with.</li>
            <li>My clients love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, fades like a tan not blotchy like store bought</li>
            <li>Very nice natural looking tan for my medium skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I had to schedule you again, and spray Her for free.</li>
            <li>I bought it after hearing what a great product it was and how all the big tanning businesses use it.</li>
            <li>This product requires an individual knowledgable in regard to the application of sunless tanning products for successful application.  </li>
            <li>even a full day after applying.</li>
            <li>When I received the bottle it didn&#x27;t seem full.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars right now.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, leaves the skin moisturized and product came sealed</li>
            <li>, this is my second bottle love</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard this brand is really good, however, I&#x27;ve done a few spray tans with this product and there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any skin color change</li>
            <li>It was cool color looks natural</li>
            <li>Goes on fast.</li>
            <li>Looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li>Left my fair skinned clients a little orange.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few spray tan solutions this past year &amp; so far Norvell has been the best.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>However, it does provide a very natural color when  the correct pre sunless tanning application regimen is carried out.</li>
            <li>Gives a very natural sunkisses glow</li>
            <li>I felt the color has too much orange in it and will be searching for a different brand or color.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a spray tan machine and a tent because this solution is very hard to get off if you get it on furniture</li>

            <li> i have tired lots.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful color. Works beautifully</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, leaves the skin moisturized and product came sealed</li>
            <li> According to my customer, it was sticky up until the time she washed it off, and when she did wash it off... with it was the entire tan. I had to schedule you again, and spray Her for free. The shipping was great, just wished the product worked.</li>
            <li> Very nice natural looking tan for my medium skin tone.  I only left on for 8 hours before showering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars right now. I&#x27;ve heard this brand is really good, however, I&#x27;ve done a few spray tans with this product and there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any skin color change even a full day after applying.

            <li> awesome thank you, this is my second bottle love you guys!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the color. i have tired lots. plus this is a great price, one spary tan would cost as much as this one bottle.</li>
            <li> Goes on dark because of the instant&lt;br /&gt;Bronzer. A lot of the color washes off even after 12-24 hours of being on. It could be the color I chose, next time I&#x27;m trying the double dark.</li>
            <li> love love love this color! by far the best solution i have ever used! so glad i purchased this brand! the color is amazing and after i sprayed i wasn&#x27;t sticky at all and it smelt really good!!</li>
            <li> Great solution! Gives great color! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> It was cool color looks natural</li>
            <li> Great product and sent on time! Very Happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few spray tan solutions this past year &amp; so far Norvell has been the best. I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but not my favorite to spray with. I bought it after hearing what a great product it was and how all the big tanning businesses use it. Ho hum for me. Left my fair skinned clients a little orange. Not the look you&#x27;re going for in a spray tan...</li>
            <li> very good color, feels good, does not stink. I wish it would last a little longer. I have to respray every few days.</li>
            <li> Great color for pastey people!</li>
            <li> Purchased norvell tanning solution like I always do. Noticed the product expired 03/2015. Ordered it in April and its may and haven&#x27;t even opened up yet to use.&lt;br /&gt;I have a spray tan on Thursday and my products no good.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> This product requires an individual knowledgable in regard to the application of sunless tanning products for successful application.  It is unfortunately not foolproof, and it&#x27;s application can produce negative results.  However, it does provide a very natural color when  the correct pre sunless tanning application regimen is carried out.</li>
            <li> My clients love this product.  Gives a very natural sunkisses glow</li>
            <li> Love it! Drys fast but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out as bad as others. Lasts longer also. Goes on fast. Use less. Looks like a real tan. Brown not orange.</li>
            <li> Sprays evenly without splotching. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love love love this solution! Honestly don&#x27;t know what I would do without this in the tanning world! This is my number one go to any day of the week! There&#x27;s no orange color at all! It&#x27;s the perfect golden color for anyone!! Just make sure you have a spray tan machine and a tent because this solution is very hard to get off if you get it on furniture but if you have windex, it&#x27;ll come off instantly! Wouldn&#x27;t change a thing about this product, it has absoultley no flaws! You can either have spray tan machine or just pour solution onto a 5 dollar tanning mitt and rub it on your skin! Just waiting this product to get back in stock :/</li>
            <li> When I received the bottle it didn&#x27;t seem full. The seal was intact, but it felt like there was a lot of air in the bottle. Overall, I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> works great smells great.... highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, fades like a tan not blotchy like store bought</li>
            <li> Nice color, didnt turn clients orange! I love the smell of it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! Pleasant smell</li>
