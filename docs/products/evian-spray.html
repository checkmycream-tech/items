            <li>I love, love this spray</li>
            <li>These are perfect for dry skin or just for anytime you need to feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li>The Evian facial spray works great.</li>
            <li>It helps make your shadows more pigmented if you lightly spray your brush first.</li>
            <li>I did not buy it myself at first; it was gifted to me.</li>
            <li>but you stay cool for awhile</li>
            <li>But it provides a quick cooling mist to my face.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly  </li>
            <li>I love to take them on plane trips to make you feel better in the dry environment of the plane.</li>
            <li>It gives you a fresh look, and I like how the spray evenly apply on your face.</li>
            <li>it also good on dry skin,and wakes me up when I feel exhausted I leave this in the fridge because it is so much more refreshing when its cold,great for winter when the heats dry and great for summer when it is so hot.</li>
            <li>At first I never thought it could have such a great effect as it looked like simple water, but it proved to be far more than that.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it gets pretty humid in the summer here.</li>
            <li>Its just water in a can and looks pretty to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years, probably about 15 years ;-)</li>
            <li>but it is sooooooooo refreshing to spray your face when you are tired, or warm...  </li>
            <li>This thing is small but works good.  </li>
            <li>The handy travel size means you can easily pop them into your bag and despite the small size, I found mine lasted a surprisingly long time.  </li>
            <li>I keep one of the smaller travel size bottles in my purse just to cool off.  </li>
            <li>I live in the south , this is a real treat when placed in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>While it is not the cheapest product around, I like the quality of it and the sturdiness of the bottle - I&#x27;ve had an older one in the car for over a year with no degradation in form or function regardless of heat/cold changes.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use it for my eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li>Especially in high heat environments the mist instantly cools and refreshes.</li>
            <li>I live in the South and we have some stifling summers.  </li>
            <li>It does feel refreshing when you spray it on your face, however, this bottle is so small.</li>
            <li>as it keeps her cool and entertained as the spritz of water adds a little excitement.  </li>

            <li> If, like me, you wilt in the heat, then this is the product for you. I used mine during the height of a summer heatwave and life was a lot easier (and cooler) as a result.  &lt;br /&gt;The second the mist hits, you&#x27;ll feel cooler immediately. The handy travel size means you can easily pop them into your bag and despite the small size, I found mine lasted a surprisingly long time.  &lt;br /&gt;Just what you need for an instant cooldown.</li>
            <li> A must for spring and summer to hydrate skin. I live in the south , this is a real treat when placed in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> I am always refreshed and hydrated with this!</li>
            <li> I live in the South and we have some stifling summers.  I keep one of the smaller travel size bottles in my purse just to cool off.  My husband keeps a similar one in his bat bag for when he plays baseball.  We have another we keep in the bag we take out on our boat.  Definitely \\&quot;must haves\\&quot; for travelling too.  We spend a lot of time in the Caribbean and Mexico.  A couple of spritzes and you feel you can keep on going in the 100+ degree heat!</li>
            <li> I was shopping for a product to hydrate/tone my skin. The Evian facial spray works great. Especially in high heat environments the mist instantly cools and refreshes.</li>
            <li> This thing is small but works good.  Sorry, but this is why I am giving it only a two star.</li>
            <li> It does feel refreshing when you spray it on your face, however, this bottle is so small. I thought it would have been larger. For the price I don&#x27;t think I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it gets pretty humid in the summer here. However, this product for me served no purpose. I didnt like the way my makeup looked upon drying. I will not buy this because it was an unnecessary purchase. Its just water in a can and looks pretty to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> Awesome water mist spray! I purchased this to do bodyscape photography and the the water droplets this generates is great.</li>
            <li> it was okay. i use it but i wasnt to fasinatined by it. it feel like i was spraying water on on my face</li>
            <li> I dont know why i bought this. The spray stoppes working after a few uses and just drips out. Dont buy it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I held off on ordering having trouble justifying the cost for just basically water. But it provides a quick cooling mist to my face. It dries quickly  but you stay cool for awhile</li>
            <li> These are perfect for dry skin or just for anytime you need to feel refreshed.  I love to take them on plane trips to make you feel better in the dry environment of the plane.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Loosens tight skin in dry heat from furnace . Refreshing.recommend this to women of all ages. Great gift too</li>
            <li> Good but why am bi spritzing overpriced water on my face?</li>
            <li> This Evian spray is my favorite spray of all brands. It gives you a fresh look, and I like how the spray evenly apply on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff on and off for years, but recently discovered that my toddler loves it too!  On long road trips it&#x27;s a must for her as it keeps her cool and entertained as the spritz of water adds a little excitement.  While it is not the cheapest product around, I like the quality of it and the sturdiness of the bottle - I&#x27;ve had an older one in the car for over a year with no degradation in form or function regardless of heat/cold changes.  I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Too much money for water, but it feels great.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my wife who won&#x27;t use anything else when working with her make-up or her hair -- Must be good ...</li>
            <li> What I like about this spray is after my make up is on this sets it also good on dry skin,and wakes me up when I feel exhausted I leave this in the fridge because it is so much more refreshing when its cold,great for winter when the heats dry and great for summer when it is so hot.Also I love this size because I could carry this in my purse.</li>
            <li> leaves your face dewy</li>
            <li> I love, love this spray (it&#x27;s just water of some sorts).....but it is sooooooooo refreshing to spray your face when you are tired, or warm...  I especially love it in the summer.  I&#x27;ve used it for years, probably about 15 years ;-)</li>
            <li> This is a very refreshing and good product. I mainly use it for my eyeshadow brushes. It helps make your shadows more pigmented if you lightly spray your brush first.</li>
            <li> I love this evian spray! Yessssss buy it, buy it , buy it. Its like a primer also and setting spray.</li>
            <li> Great way to cool off during a hot flash!!</li>
            <li> I did not buy it myself at first; it was gifted to me. But as I tried it, I liked it a great lot. At first I never thought it could have such a great effect as it looked like simple water, but it proved to be far more than that. I will be using this product again and again, and recommend it for both men and women.</li>
