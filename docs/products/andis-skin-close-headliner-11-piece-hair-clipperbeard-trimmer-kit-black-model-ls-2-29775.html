            <li>His beard always looks neat and he does a good job trimming his hair as well.  </li>
            <li>My son absolutely loved this product.</li>
            <li>These are good</li>
            <li>But God showed how much he loved us by having Christ die for us, even though we were sinful.</li>
            <li>does not feel cheap and great price!!</li>
            <li>but this is also a good addition to the lineup.</li>
            <li>I totally  loved it and</li>
            <li>Good Clippers.  </li>
            <li>good dual use trimmer</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>It is advertised as a trimmer and shaver (which it does a great job), but they also allow you to cut the top.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with trimmer, performs as described,does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li>i am very pleased.</li>
            <li>worth every penny and more!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe to say I should have purchased it from the moment I saw it!  </li>
            <li>you will love owning this item!</li>
            <li>He was interested in this brand and of course it was priced best on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this clipper!</li>
            <li>this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>I tried, it was a amazing cut.</li>
            <li>The results were amazing.</li>
            <li>However, if you want to use it for a shape up its not as effective.</li>
            <li>In fact, I decided to use the clipper for my beard instead of shaving as it gives a nice 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really great product I am more than satisfied by my buy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buzzing my own hair for a dozen years or so now.</li>
            <li>Compared to the silver Andis machine I have this is a nice substitute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own line up for years now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any problems with ingrown hair, therefore I decided to own my own pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>My husband now cuts his own hair, and it also has attachments for him to cut his beard and trim his mustache.</li>
            <li>Its a really nice trimer at Grate</li>
            <li>/&gt;i use it to do line up on my self work really nice.</li>
            <li>Have a friend who has it and needed a product that would cut closely to finish my hairstyles off nicely.</li>
            <li>it comes in handy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my own head once a week with a Wahl contour for 8 years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice shave.</li>
            <li>Really all it takes is one swipe &amp; you have a perfect line for your face</li>
            <li>Nice clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it to touch up the edges after clipping my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Brought these as a replacement for the pair I already own for years because the power cord has a worn spot on them ...</li>
            <li>trust me it will come in handy.</li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy and durable feeling.</li>
            <li>I am able to have my wife cut my hair in our home as good as when she had to take me to the barber.</li>
            <li>These work great for beard trimming and getting a nice smooth shave on your face.</li>
            <li>I had my own set of clipperd, but needed ssomething to shape up my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Andis Headliner because its a cheaper T-liner.</li>
            <li>, it has a nice shape to it</li>
            <li>and really handy work</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;dont use any of the guards but the brush is handy for cleaning</li>
            <li>The shape ups are really nice and clean using these trimmers, they give you a very nice close cut.</li>
            <li>The best way is to probably use the smallest size guard and trim your hair, if you don&#x27;t mind a little stuble, it will most certaintly be the best way to stop any type of bump or skin irritation problem.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great trimmer that comes with a variety of attachments combs and the best of all the bear brush that help prevent ingrown hair (dry shaving).  </li>
            <li>These clippers are great and they come in handy when you need a quick lining.</li>
            <li>, strong motor, good for the price.</li>
            <li>but a great value shipped really quick</li>
            <li>This is a great option to get a super close shave.</li>
            <li>It was a good buy, even came with a strong carrying case for travel.</li>
            <li>Great to have in case I need a quick replacement.  </li>
            <li>nice clippers and blades its all around a good quality product for the price i also like the light weight and style of the clipper.</li>
            <li>Blake makes trimming in between haircuts very easy and cuts almost bald.</li>
            <li>Great for lining up your hairline/styling your beard, great for a close shave, and great for trimming down your hair on your head/beard.</li>
            <li>It feels like a high quality trimmer and even though many wont use this for shaving their face, I found it to be perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>The best value for the money in hair trimmers, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I am also pleased with the handy storage bag for the trimmer and accessories.</li>
            <li>Cheap and good .</li>
            <li>leaves a very fine finish too and a close skin shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and handles great.</li>
            <li>these clippers are awesome.. way better than my old ones (remington)..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with with product and highly recommended as a very effective and affordable method for shaving and trimming.</li>
            <li>I was a full not to buy a good hair cutter before.</li>
            <li>, the clippers seem too good to be true.</li>
            <li>But they are too good to be true.</li>
            <li>It works nicely and gives you a nice clean line.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable - close cuts</li>
            <li>you can wear with you anywhere very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have gone through many machines of this kind, however this one is more reliable and works better, after a while the machine&#x27;s noise elevated, I oiled and still the motor is making more noise than it should.</li>
            <li>I have a beard that I like to get creative with.. and the om/off switch makes it easy to stop and check the progress of my latest design without worrying about messing it up because of a mistake handleing the trimmer!</li>
            <li>good quality  light weight and easy to use     </li>
            <li>It surely is satisfying.</li>
            <li>This gave me one of the most easiest shaves ever.</li>
            <li>My efforts produced smiles and giggles from my wife and daughter, but my wife finished the job for me and everyone is pleased.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it about 2 weeks now and have had nothing but outstanding results on my beard and neckline</li>
            <li>If I took care of them better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they would have lasted longer.</li>
            <li>I just got these clippers in the mail today (august 13,2010) - I love them.</li>
            <li>No big deal, works great!!!!!</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more reliable because it was a plug-in, rather than battery.</li>
            <li>Relatively much more lighter than the one I have.</li>
            <li>but if u want more weight and a edgier shape up go for the silver one.</li>
            <li>the more you keep them running, the hotter they will get.</li>
            <li>Overall, great clippers!  </li>
            <li>One more opened product and</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>They trim up facial hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It DOESN&#x27;T feel real light and cheap either.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the biggest guard is more than a #2...?</li>
            <li>I love  this trimmer.</li>
            <li>i realy love the clippers they work like the gray ones that they use at the barber</li>
            <li>Well it&#x27;s great at outlining but it heats up way fast</li>
            <li>I recommended this product to anyone that love keeping their haircut.</li>
            <li>It cuts very close and is great for shaping up my beard, mustache and hair line.</li>
            <li>far as the cut theses trimmers get you a good close shave with no guard and cut fairly even with the guard.</li>
            <li>made me love these trimmers</li>
            <li>These clippers work better than advertised.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is just ok</li>
            <li>Better value that buying one at the stores.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>He is totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>CANT ASK FOR ANYTHING BETTER</li>
            <li>great product, a groomer every real man should have in their bathroom or locker.</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d suggest you pay $20 dollars more for a better version.</li>
            <li>i  love  this  trimmer  </li>
            <li>enjoying his shaving now</li>
            <li>For the price of these edgers you are better off purchasing the (Andis T-Outliner 04710).</li>
            <li>I have owned many types of clippers</li>
            <li>I love the bag it came in as all pieces can stay together and be kept in order.</li>
            <li>Mostly for sideburns, getting around the ears,</li>
            <li>a nice a smooth and even cut with one pass maybe two..</li>
            <li>i love them..</li>
            <li>You are better off with a more costly headliner.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li>researched back then and came to the conclusion that Andis was the best option.</li>
            <li>Then it got progressively noisier the more I used it.</li>
            <li>It took 15 mins to do what most barbers do in an hour</li>
            <li>and I did a better job.</li>
            <li>Great very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this is great and gives a really close shave without causing any irritation.</li>
            <li>but I was able to pick it up on amazon for $19.  </li>
            <li>I love the Andis trimmers.</li>
            <li>Love It...</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth for shaving my face.</li>
            <li>it gives a really nice and clean cut.</li>
            <li>Great price, Great product..Received them fast and hassle free.. THANKS</li>
            <li>the product get hot after a while, but its a good product.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these for 2 years now, and they still run as good as when I first purchased them.</li>
            <li>They started out pretty good.</li>
            <li>Works great, comes in a handy carrying case with accessories for different hair styles.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive areas!</li>
            <li>They can be adjusted with a screw driver, good eyes and a steady hand!</li>
            <li>so I got this one because it was fairly cheap and had pretty good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It makes a great razor alternative if your skin is to sensitive for razors, which mine is.</li>
            <li>No one is really willing to die for an honest person, though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person.   </li>
            <li>works fantastic, just make sure u order oil and keep it oiled well,</li>
            <li>whole point of buying this was to save money and maintain a good, quality, groomed look.</li>
            <li>It s a good product, you can get a good shave in dry</li>
            <li>many shaves now great for bodybuilders or anyone who hates body hair and wants a very fast shave.</li>
            <li>and he seems extremely excited about it and is still enjoying it.</li>
            <li>If I could combine these with the Wahl edgers I have, which are too sharp, they would be perfect.</li>
            <li>so you can take it with you and store it really easy</li>
            <li>I do not razor shave because of irritation and haven&#x27;t clean shaved for a many years.</li>
            <li>With these clippers its soooo easy to cut</li>
            <li>It is easy and convenient for travel....</li>
            <li>and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is now Jan 30, 2013, and this shaver is still going strong.</li>
            <li>My Dad bought this product almost 2 years ago and it has been going strong since that day.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommended for those like me that get razor bumps.</li>
            <li>The right and left edges of the clipper work best for lining up!!!</li>
            <li>These clippers worked great the first time used, however they become hot very quickly and the blades seems to be cheap.</li>
            <li>These T clippers are pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>So make sure to purchase the Andis Cool Care Plus</li>
            <li>Awesome product, cuts real close, long power cord and power source, just what I needed to make nice, clean lines.</li>
            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>But everything looks fine.     </li>
            <li>Otherwise it works fine.  </li>
            <li>The electric shaver seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect product and brand name for black men.</li>
            <li>he says its smooth and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>I tried it and it worked fine</li>
            <li>Trimmer cut excellent the only problem was I had to stop twice because of the motor running too hot</li>
            <li>I tried the snap on attachments to attempt to lighten my goatee, not only was this usable, but it looked great and was quite easy to do.</li>
            <li>These, however, are so smooth</li>
            <li>Still great considering over 2 years of use, entire body shaves, head</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a relatively cheap hair trimmer, this is the one.</li>
            <li>The motor on these clippers is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product for its price.</li>
            <li>your like me and get haircuts and shape ups every few weeks, this is perfect for those inbetween time.</li>
            <li>I cam across these because the only time I would get a great shave was at the barber.</li>
            <li>and I liked it so much that I went and bought for my house.</li>
            <li>These clippers are great for those who have short hair but still care for it.</li>
            <li>this thing is great if your never gonna use an attachment and your only gonna use it for 5min.</li>
            <li>For years I used a combination of a Remington foil shaver (the one with the tipple foil) and a cheap cordless norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li>It also works great to outline a beard or trim your beard,it comes with different size length guards.</li>
            <li>Great overall buy</li>
            <li>The clippers dont cut or burn they work fabulous</li>
            <li>Cut smooth like a razor with irritation.</li>
            <li>The unit is light and ergonomic in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I shave with this every day or two and it keeps me free of ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>but it wasnt a smooth cut.</li>
            <li>It was smooth and made my waves stand out.</li>
            <li>Good quality, complete set.</li>
            <li>The cut is good and looks like when it&#x27;s professionally done.</li>
            <li>over all so far it is doing a good job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update! 5/23/2013 Still going strong by far the best shaver I have owned very fast and very close</li>
            <li>but he blade gets pretty warm quickly.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I am sure that they work great.</li>
            <li>Recommended purchase, very useful for the price it is listed under.</li>
            <li>Its very smooth and cuts everything off on the first shot.-[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Once you got things as smooth as you can with the clippers, bring in the electric shaver to do the clean up duty.</li>
            <li>Also good for trimming hair just about anywhere - the blade is pretty gentle on the skin compared to others I&#x27;ve tried, but gets the job done well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They cut very close and they are very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This clipper gets very close to the skin, and does a great job considering it is not commercial, and is very cheap.</li>
            <li>THESE CLIPPERS GET VERY HOT VERY QUICKLY.    </li>
            <li>, the new trimmer (same model) works great!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the product so far.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m as satisfied as the day I first used it.</li>
            <li>This trimmer has a lot more power and is a much higher quality than any trimmer you could get for under $50 in a store.</li>
            <li>and i recommend this to anyone and everyone who needs to get a fresh fade!</li>
            <li>I recanted my original post about the buzzing.</li>
            <li>Many reviewers note that the clippers run hot.</li>
            <li>with practice i am sure i can get pretty close</li>
            <li>you better practice first.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I chose this one as my first one</li>
            <li>I just keep them clean with clipper spray and oiled.</li>
            <li>Luckily these were available, and I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep them clean and they will keep you clean.</li>
            <li>GO TO THE STORE AND ASK WHICH ONE IS THE MOST POPULAR AND COME BACK AND BUY THAT ONE ONLINE.</li>
            <li>Keep them clean and oiled up...</li>
            <li>I am a firefighter and my job requires that we stay clean shaven.</li>
            <li>These help me stay clean between barber visits.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut as clean and pinches my skin when I use it in my travels.</li>
            <li>The secret to any great haircut is a good go-to clipper for detailing.</li>
            <li>This product meets all my needs for a clean shaven head.</li>
            <li>THIS CLIPPER CUTS VERY CLOSE AND IS ALSO VERY COMFORTABLE.      </li>
            <li>Another great thing about this product is that it is not as easily heated as other brands!</li>
            <li>other than that this is an amazing trimmer for an amazing price.</li>
            <li>just cuz, right!, and Instantly appeared in the mirror, after some Fine detailing,minor touch ups, and good looking results I can say they are worth the buy</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap (though not as cheap as they used to be) and they cut through hair like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>this is good if you want short hair 1/16 1/8 1/4 3/6</li>
            <li>However be ready to pay $30 more.</li>
            <li>I have found so many that leave too much</li>
            <li>They also work good for trimming up short hair.  </li>
            <li>it would be much wiser to save 25 more dollars and buy an updated brand</li>
            <li>ii ave been looking for a good linen-er for a while and really only got the because it was Andis</li>
            <li>thats because i did use them for a full hair cut basically.</li>
            <li>Clean lines, makes quick work of a beard cleanup.</li>
            <li>He thanks me all the time , this was a birthday gift for him &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Overall These are a good set for home use.</li>
            <li>ONLY good in the beginning/</li>
            <li>Not a bad trimmer for the money if you don&#x27;t mind taking it apart and cleaning/maintaining it.  </li>
            <li>The first one is still running strong since 2011.</li>
            <li>It cuts fine but becomes hot after awhile.</li>
            <li>its compact, powerful and cuts clean.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t ready to pay that much for trimmers just to do my hairline during my own haircuts.</li>
            <li>It gets really close, really easy to clean and was a bargain.</li>
            <li>The trimmers work well and they arrived fairly quick.</li>
            <li>my older one was better</li>
            <li>super efficient.</li>
            <li>Este trimer es super comodo y util, en lo que tengo comprando via</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommended to anyone who has a problem with razor bumps or looking for the closest cut for shaping up, shaving or styling hair.</li>
            <li>This beats all the other cordless ones I have owned, and some were fairly nice, and the price was better than some of the cordless as well.  </li>
            <li>and it gets very hot</li>
            <li>Feels smooth and no irritation and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this item.y attachments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough to hold for a reasonable amount of time and the blades give good results.</li>
            <li>these baby&#x27;s give a nice close clean shave so long as you keep them oiled and clean.</li>
            <li>That said, I really think it could get a tad closer and still be effective but believe me thats not really a complaint.</li>
            <li>So far this machine has held up and works even better once you keep it oiled, which will bring out the products full capabilities.</li>
            <li>I have had an Andis trimmer in the past, it wore out after many years of good use</li>
            <li>and they go through my hair like a hot knife in butter!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a pretty close shave!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use.. powerful.. and the on/off switch is very convienient when using it</li>
            <li>Works great for little detail areas, would buy again.</li>
            <li>I adjusted the blade a little and the trimmers performed great.</li>
            <li>Clipper does heat up a little, but it cuts great.</li>
            <li>This item works really good but shaking little more and sound loud a bit but doing job and for this price</li>
            <li>This machine is what I have been looking for a loong time, Iwasso glad to find it and find it at a low price, but the machine works great love cutting my son and my own hair with it.</li>
            <li>The cut is very close and smooth.</li>
            <li>: Cheap, reliable, works very well, gets close to the skin</li>
            <li>but I could only imagine it to be amazing.</li>
            <li>Most professional clippers have a rounded type cord that prevents it from getting tangled up.  </li>
            <li>Have tried a few Andis products and this by far has given me the best and closest shave utilizing hair clippers.  </li>
            <li>in my old one, the hair used to collect on top of the blade. ]</li>
            <li>worth every penny, would buy it again in a haertbeat</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clipper so its going to make noise and with any powerful clipper, it&#x27;s going to get hotter as time goes by</li>
            <li>So worth the money and delivers well.</li>
            <li>This shaver works well and cuts close and is the good value that I expected.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who likes to do their own shape-ups and have different beard styles they like to try</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but these are worth a try.</li>
            <li>compared to the old one (located at the top), I&#x27;ve found myself turning it off accidentally.</li>
            <li>It makes my wifes job harder in fading my hair because it doesn&#x27;t have a good intermediary between the 1/16 and</li>
            <li>it worth every penny you pay for it...</li>
            <li>worth the money?</li>
            <li>powerful motor as well.</li>
            <li>it works really good, is really strong and it is small</li>
            <li>I bought this item mainly as a beard trimmer and neck cleaner-upper, so it will work fine for me.</li>
            <li>The T-Outliners never dull and are a lot more sturdy and comfortable to hold in your hand, professional barbers use them all the time.</li>
            <li>the trimmer arrived yesterday and used it right away.</li>
            <li>I recieved another set of combs right away, no charge, from the company.  </li>
            <li>Just got this trimmer in the mail yesterday and put it right to work.  </li>
            <li>One thing I must mention is that right out of the box, they dont cut that close.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>This product comes with all the the right tools and accessories.</li>
            <li>Like some reviewrs have posted, the unit does get a bit hot, but i prefer the unit to get hot and still deliver a great close shave, than those other products that dont get hot and have razor bumps to deal with afterward.   </li>
            <li>worked great the first few times.</li>
            <li>I have been using these for almost 10 years now, and no other set is more balanced.</li>
            <li>They get SUPER hot fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth a look, if you&#x27;re in the market for your first &amp;#34;line</li>
            <li>this one is light weight, cuts close, doesn&#x27;t heat up, comes in any easy to store bag that isn&#x27;t bulky and you won&#x27;t need to keep scraping your head to catch every last strand of hair because this catches it in the first couple of runs..   </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t neglect to clean and maintain these properly, there are also videos online that show you exactly how to clean it as well as what is required to  clean the clippers.</li>
            <li>I was able to correct any uneven mistakes I may have made and was able to get it so close that there was no shadow for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to handle and clean, and comes with a bunch of short guides.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it does get warm after a few minutes of use, but on both the sound and heating issues, I don&#x27;t let it run continuosly.</li>
            <li>It shaves pretty clean and I love the carry bag that came with it which makes it very portable for my overseas trips which I occasionally take.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair as well as other family members and was comfortable doing an entire cutdown and line up easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheap and the only maintainence is clipper oil.</li>
            <li>Quick, simple, and easy.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it describes.</li>
            <li>As has been mentioned the clipper runs hot.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m giving the review on the shipping first which is 5 STARS, I have yet to try the trimmers yet.</li>
            <li>I dropped it the first day and the 3/8 comb snaped off.</li>
            <li>Purchased these clippers after Andis t-outliner finally wore out after more than 8 years of use.</li>
            <li>first one lasted for 11 month.</li>
            <li>They get you pretty close to bald, and they are inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head once a week, and the first pair of these clippers I had lasted 4 years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;EDIT: 3 years later (aug 2014)</li>
            <li>I bought this to actually shave my cat with, but instead decided it would be put to better use to shave my face/cut my hair with (fancy that).</li>
            <li>My first one went out and Andis replaced it with no cost to me.</li>
            <li>Honestly I&#x27;ve REALLY got my money&#x27;s worth out of this clipper.</li>
            <li>*Re-updated November 2010 - I dropped my original Andis on my tile floor from several feet, causing some damage to the original teeth/ clipper part.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found a better deal yet, and I don&#x27;t feel any need to upgrade to anything better (more expensive).</li>
            <li>it has 3/8, 1/8, 1/16 and one more bigger one.</li>
            <li>When I first got this I would have rated it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>this trimmer is as close as i need, very close!</li>
            <li>I also love that the different sized guards that come with this allow me to trim body hair, my beard, side burns...</li>
            <li>I purchased these clippers on 1 March 2012 for many reasons, one being the reputation that Andis has, one being my barber recommended it, and one being friends that regularly use it recommended it.  </li>
            <li>Prior to that they were ok, and</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>first blush</li>
            <li>/&gt;Furthermore, with the most recent 40% increase in price (from $24 to $34), I can no longer justify this as a \\&quot;value\\&quot; purchase.</li>
            <li>Has more then enough accessories and attachments.</li>
            <li>Hubby absolutely loves this Andis!</li>
            <li>I first came across Andis products from a friend of mine who cuts my hair.</li>
            <li>No matter what I use to shave, my neck is most irritated and with this product it&#x27;s no different.  </li>
            <li>i tried this the first time, for some reason</li>
            <li>Gets hot after 5 mins</li>
            <li>I bought this exact set from Walmart</li>
            <li>I oiled them before the first use and the preciseness in the cut was just as any barber</li>
            <li>i purchased these same clippers many years ago and they cut so close</li>
            <li>There are videos online that show you exactly how to preform this  </li>
            <li>They cut very close and give a powerful cut.</li>
            <li>The kit did exactly as it was advertized.  </li>
            <li>I love this Andis headliner and for the price point I will be buying another one next week just as a backup.</li>
            <li>Very reliable!</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive!</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it had a better attachment beyond the 1/16 to help in the fade...like a 1/32...</li>
            <li>first it seemed to be quality, but it does not perform reliably.</li>
            <li>Package arrived exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>trimmer is an absolute piece of garbage in terms of quality, for a few dollars more you can get some thing much better.</li>
            <li>My hairline and chin line were both crisp.</li>
            <li>First trimmer I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>SAVE you&#x27;re money and don&#x27;t buy this PRODUCT at all, I have tried a couple more of their product and they all ended up the same, OVER</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really  good and  not so heavy</li>
            <li>The only complaints I have are that it does get hot rather quickly, but you can buy the Cool Down spray for that (that stuff smells good; makes it smell like a real barbershop!)</li>
            <li>So Like Many other Andis Products I got, I didn&#x27;t have a trimmer or Professional outliners the Barbers be using to give that fresh smooth feeling shave after a visit, so I figure why not, looks like it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Especially if you do any type of line-ups, its quick and precise.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a while since I had such a nice clean short cut.</li>
            <li>Great product, allows for a crisp line up, works better than all of the other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>and/or razor burn, yet shaves almost as close as a normal razor!!</li>
            <li>On the very flat areas of my face it seemed to cut ok, but on any curve it did nothing.  </li>
            <li>But where it matters most, it still does a great job of cutting hair.</li>
            <li>I find that it gets clogged, needs to be taken apart to be clean and oiled quite frequently.  </li>
            <li>i was really easy on this clipper too and yet after only 3 months and most likely around 20 uses the thing died on me during my morning cleanup.</li>
            <li>Last a good while when maintained properly.</li>
            <li>So me, being cheap, I&#x27;ve gone through several of these cheaper clipper sets over the years - Remingtons, Wahls, Conairs, all without much success.</li>
            <li>very quiet, this trimmer does exactly what you need it to do, I like to shave designs into hair, and these work fabulous , no cutting of the skin, quiet, and easily takes out that line when trying to fade.</li>
            <li>It cuts as sharp as the old one but doesn&#x27;t get warm up as quick</li>
            <li>I love the different trimming edges as well, they have come in handy quite a few times.</li>
            <li>but you can still get a fairly crisp, straight line.</li>
            <li>The reason i didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is because they heat up pretty fast, but</li>
            <li>Clippers get hot  too fast and cuts off in five minutes ..</li>
            <li>so hot in fact they will burn you even with ample amounts of oil and too much oil</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m looking real G. ;-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used an Andis T-ouliner before (the more professional and powerful barbershop type of this one) and there isn&#x27;t too much different.  </li>
            <li>and I can even do a quick shave with just the bare trimmer right across my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>My first one lasted me 5 years and its actually still working fine.  </li>
            <li>Cuts sharp lines and is very easy to control.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it heats up very quickly, but this won&#x27;t happen if you are just tightening your hairline.</li>
            <li>Besides making a strange buzzing sound, maybe because it&#x27;s new and needs a little oil,  I am free to be my own barber.  </li>
            <li>Recently I bought another pair just for dry shaving because I remember how good they worked for me.  </li>
            <li>These clippers seem very high quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Has a nice little pouch so you can carry it on the go...</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended for anybody that is interested in it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these clippers and pretty much</li>
            <li>The clippers get a little hot after using for a length of time, other than that , a good product!</li>
            <li>And I select standard free shipping.</li>
            <li>it was very well&lt;br</li>
            <li>work¬¥s very well..!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s cheap enough to buy it again</li>
            <li>the shaves are so close and fast</li>
            <li>I am usually very picky on these things and decided to take the chance with this.</li>
            <li>and it works really well for what I bought it for (to shave my husband&#x27;s neck.)  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li>These clippers get really close to the skin when doing a line up.  </li>
            <li>I actually really like the way this cuts.</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave, and no razor bumpors.</li>
            <li>VERY CLOSE</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t like a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It gets real close and my face looks like a shave less-than-a-day-old.</li>
            <li>buy this because I can not spend my razor and this worked very well to keep the beauty of the face without irritation controlled</li>
            <li>The Andis cutting tool is the best hair liner I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>This product shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Apply the oil ready to go.</li>
            <li>My neck is the real problem when shaving, my hairs grow every which way, ingrown hairs, some bumps.  </li>
            <li>This item was shipped fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve been very please with the performanance and build quality.</li>
            <li>the item is oil picture is for whole set with attachments.</li>
            <li>It cuts very well &amp; really close.  </li>
            <li>The guides were very sturdy as well.</li>
            <li>Evened my whole beard with ease.</li>
            <li>They get very close to the skin.</li>
            <li>It has too much complications.</li>
            <li>the blades don&#x27;t quite match up level to cut real close.</li>
            <li>I never use a straight razor on my face because I breakout.</li>
            <li>broke on me toooooo fast</li>
            <li>and  it  get  real  </li>
            <li>The T-Blade trimmers are just perfect from angling all the way to precision cutting.</li>
            <li>VERY well and close.</li>
            <li>Very close shave, but no skin burn like I would get with a straight razor</li>
            <li>gave a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>This trimmer makes so much noise that you need ear plugs to get your hair trimmed.</li>
            <li>For now I will stick with this one, as it does work very well for everything else I need.</li>
            <li>Nothing intense.</li>
            <li>Cord is cheap but that&#x27;s the only problem .</li>
            <li>u must adjust the blades to get real close</li>
            <li>they get hot, really hot with continuous use of more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Cuts really close.</li>
            <li>It really doesn‚Äôt matter whether you go with rotary or foil, it‚Äôs really preference.</li>
            <li>clippers are fairly quiet and quite light.</li>
            <li>The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the cheap short power chord.  </li>
            <li>So you can do the math on how much use you&#x27;ll get out of it.</li>
            <li>I got this trimmer at walmart to try out,  shaving leaves me irritated and decided to get a real trimmer to replace those bead trimmers.</li>
            <li>These clippers gives me a very close shave.</li>
            <li>and i only use liners to give me a close and smooth shave....</li>
            <li>If you need a close shave and can&#x27;t use straight razors like me, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>I had used razors that gave me razor bumps which really made me irate but after using this, the bumps don&#x27;t show as much as they would when I used the razors.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>Actually I would probably spend more money and get a nicer Andis professional version, or a cordless version.</li>
            <li>Only thing is that it does get hot quick, but wasnt much of a problem.</li>
            <li>If you are buying these or any new type of clipper for the first time, research on how to use them(youtube).</li>
            <li>Same original blade for me; just some clipper oil before &amp; after every cut.     </li>
            <li>I thougt about the more expensive, but I am glad I got these first.</li>
            <li>Reason it doesn&#x27;t get my 5 star rating is because after a month or so it shuts off, so you need to get a screw driver and open the blades to clean the hair out of the machines.</li>
            <li>Every now and again I would just open it and clean it with a towel and a brush.</li>
            <li>I was surprise how clean it left my face.</li>
            <li>but I‚Äôm usually looking for the next great pair of clippers by that point so</li>
            <li>You should also open it up and clean out the hairs after a while, you can realign the blades by pushing them into a mirror at a 90 degree angle.</li>
            <li>To me these are better for shaving than the professional grey outliners.  </li>
            <li>Some parts looked a little cheap, but the cutter is tremendous for shaving off the fuzz on my balding husband&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>you manage to work around the heat issue, by either working quickly or by taking breaks to allow the machine to cool down, there is the additional issue of durability.</li>
            <li>These clippers are just not that sharp, which is pretty important for \\&quot;headliner\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve long known that if you want a really smooth shave, there isn&#x27;t just one device that will do the job.</li>
            <li>It gets warm and always has, but it still cuts nice and for a guy who shaves his head and face...not bad.</li>
            <li>They are definitely better than some of the cheaper ones i have used previously.</li>
            <li>I had my previous pair for about 8 years and now have purchased this item and love it.</li>
            <li>realistic?</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re in the market for a decent shaver, you might want to keep looking.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I packed my backup clippers but those do not cut nearly as short as the Andis.</li>
            <li>I use them primarily to cut my hair (I am a 40+ yr old male), while my son uses them as trimmers to taper and edge.</li>
            <li>But as far as cutting quality, it is the best!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Afircan American and my beard is coarse and curly, sometimes with many razor</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more Andis products in the future.</li>
            <li>many African american males</li>
            <li>they still do a decent job.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE DECENT FOR THE PRICE.    </li>
            <li>anyone know where I can find a replacement cord for my older pair on amazon??</li>
            <li>I love these, this is actually the second set I bought.</li>
            <li>I‚Äôve had this particular set for two years, but I‚Äôve been using these types of clippers for about 7 years.</li>
            <li>Once it arrived this morning I instantly broke open the box, I made sure \\&quot;Not\\&quot; to shave till it gets here,</li>
            <li>It is a very professional and durable piece of equipment!</li>
            <li>The only downside is they get very hot after a while.</li>
            <li>My old clipper could clean my whole head in 2 minutes flat and it would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this trimmer and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>These clippers don&#x27;t have the high level of material quality, but for the cost they can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>then those highly advertized wireless beard</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this trimmer and the Andis brand to anyone.</li>
            <li>As far as I can see the quality looks the same as my original one</li>
            <li>I love this little kit.</li>
            <li>Only issue I have, the clippers get hot after a certain period of time.  </li>
            <li>this Andis Trimmer came SUPER FAST like a day and a half fast!</li>
            <li>They are not as good as the t edgers, and I&#x27;ve found that it takes a little longer to achieve the same result as my professional trimmers.  </li>
            <li>They do shake pretty hard just fyi, its not terrible to the extent they cant be used</li>
            <li>highly recommend these clippers and pretty much the entire Andis line.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, the experience with these clippers were great.</li>
            <li>Normally tho I just use the peanut unless I want a closer shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a white male in my early 30s with thin/ thinning hair on top.</li>
            <li>Save you lots of money as you don&#x27;t need to visit the barber as often as you normally would have.  </li>
            <li>First few times it was a pain in the butt because I couldn&#x27;t find a screw driver that fit.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t seem powerful enough to cut a head of hair.</li>
            <li>I thought this was normal considering the price of the product.</li>
            <li>I have no complaint.  </li>
            <li>the other two had chords that were very user friendly..  </li>
            <li>I use these to line up my own facial hair and they have not let me down.</li>
            <li>I used them, I kept them clean, never dropped it, treated it like a limited edition hall of fame baseball card...</li>
            <li>It definitely gets closer than the rechargeable trimmers that I am used to and has the power to easily work through my coarse beard hair.  </li>
            <li>And I always said I had to get a good trimmer for my beard because every of other trimmer I had either didn&#x27;t cut my hair low enough or would cause razor bumps on my face.</li>
            <li>Again I love these clippers, but for my 2nd purchase, they just don&#x27;t last long enough for me to really enjoy them.</li>
            <li>The noise, while a bit loud, was not uncomfortable, and pretty much what I expected.</li>
            <li>does what i bought it for gets pretty close&lt;br /&gt;close enough to do a decent shape up</li>
            <li>I have used other brands before, but compared to the Andis are like cheap knockoffs .</li>
            <li>Cheaply built and not at all sharp.</li>
            <li>It gives you a sharp shave for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>IF you don&#x27;t won&#x27;t the Blades too sharp and still gives that smooth Barber Feel when you slap on the alcohol...</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time, it had everything inside the box and all the equipment looked new.</li>
            <li>New Andis Company 11pc Headliner Shave Trim</li>
            <li>It does bother me that it is not cordless, but i can live with that</li>
            <li>I find myself looking for something new after about 6 months, because a routine beard trim has turned into a 45 minute cleaning disassembling job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: After receiving my new Andis, I have not noticed any decrease in quality.</li>
            <li>its on you if you want to upgrade or just put in new blades.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>He used them and when he purchased a new set, he passed them on to my son.</li>
            <li>The only problems is that it does get extremely hot after a short amount of use and it actually stopped working on me after owning it for about 7 months while cutting a friend&#x27;s and my own fair every 3 weeks or so.</li>
            <li>perhaps your new batch wont use such cheap plastic...go back to what worked...</li>
            <li>One thing though, the trimmer does get warm after extended use (30mins) but nothing too serious.  </li>
            <li>Incidentally, the alleged 29% savings on this product (as of June 19, 2012) is questionable at best.</li>
            <li>Again, I use it to keep all my facial hair and what&#x27;s left on my head, trimmed, shaped and cut, I have no problems with sound or heat.</li>
            <li>The box makes that very clear, but I didn&#x27;t think that was very clear in the product description.</li>
            <li>First time, the clippers died out on me mid cut, and I was in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>I have tried many beard trimmers and usually would shave with the pop up shaver on electric shavers.</li>
            <li>If your trimming up, or looking for a pretty short cut with out having to worry about razer burn these are the T trimmer for you!  </li>
            <li>The first time i purchased this item it stopped working after only one use!</li>
            <li>I have not had a set last for longer than six months, the most recent one surviving only two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>3rd degree burn hot.</li>
            <li>The only con to these would be how hot they get after about 20 mins.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd purchase, my first one lasted about one year.</li>
            <li>This is my first Andis product but definitely won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li>purchased this because I&#x27;ve had too many rechargeable clippers in the past that eventually lose the ability to hold a charge and become garbage.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re accustomed to a battery-charged trimmer, you&#x27;ll have some work to do to get accustomed to working around an electrical cord, especially with out-maneuvering the cord to position the cutter just so to get the exact results you&#x27;re wanting.</li>
            <li>The first pair lasted about 7 years with constant use.  </li>
            <li>I totally praise the product itself cuts exactly like it should...</li>
            <li>Doesnt make sharp edges like the original.</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit in Oct. &#x27;13 and that coincides with the last time I visited the barbershop ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reason I bought another one is because I threw away the clip attachments on my first one and now I need them.  </li>
            <li>Much better than other regular clippers that I have tried.</li>
            <li>If you keep your blades oiled, clean and adjust them regularly they will last along time without sacrificing the quality of the cut.</li>
            <li>With these here, I will not be going to the barbershop every other week &amp; kicking out a lot of money to keep a clean &amp; neat shape up.</li>
            <li>but the guys out there need to know that this thing is far more practical, especially for the money, than a beard trimmer or even a much more expensive electric razor</li>
            <li>I used it maybe 2-3 times, and my old Andis, with its dull blade did a better job than this thing brand new!</li>
            <li>So far, this new clipper set is proving itself to be every bit the measure of the t-liner, and then some.</li>
            <li>This product is a huge improvement over my previous trimmer, a Conair.</li>
            <li>Most clipper sets in this price range only go down to 1/8.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep the new Andis clippers for when I want to remove hair completely or almost completely.</li>
            <li>Its a sexy black finish and very solid and sturdy in hand, and comes with extras as described.</li>
            <li>After 5 years and many razor bumps later, with the advice of my barber; I decided to upgrade my electric razor to something that will not break out my skin and this baby does the job and costs alot less.</li>
            <li>great little trimmer,cord is a little short for me.</li>
            <li>Edging is quick, sharp and done in one stroke, no matter the location.</li>
            <li>Even with the initial high functionality of the Andis, its overall performance is marred by the fact that the body of the clippers runs extremely hot after 10+ minutes of use.</li>
            <li>It is professional</li>
            <li>The old trimmer did not do this.</li>
            <li>The reasonably priced LS2 is simple to operate and does the job well.</li>
            <li>I looked everywhere on the page and there is nowhere to find an E-mail or chat that I can contact directly.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on it.</li>
            <li>Got very noise after second use.</li>
            <li>My old hair clipper broke</li>
            <li>I also love that it comes with a super-short 1/16\\&quot; &amp; 1/8\\&quot; guards (or at least mine did).</li>
            <li>- I was looking at my reviews and saw this from almost 2 years ago (and it was probably 2 years old at the time).</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important to not have a heavy hand when lining someone&#x27;s edge up.  </li>
            <li>I pulled out my old but faltering Wahl, turned it on</li>
            <li>Kelly-K of Shiftn Steel Sport Riderz says get those professional cuts like the barber in the comfort of your home</li>
            <li>There hair cuts always look professional when I do it.</li>
            <li>I wish my old lady could shake like this...</li>
            <li>I am going to try and order the professional model and am going to return this one.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this if your looking for a complete hair cut kit.</li>
            <li>So much so, I would have to stroke the same area two or three time before I got the desired cut.</li>
            <li>Price\\&quot; near fifty dollars in years.</li>
            <li>and so far no effect has been seen</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too early to tell I guess.  </li>
            <li>I had just had a professional shave</li>
            <li>Then something else surprised me.</li>
            <li>I took my 30+ year-old American-made Wahl clippers apart and fixed them.</li>
            <li>I tried using a blade to actually shave my head even closer, and noticed it does make much of a difference because this product already gets close</li>
            <li>A bit loud and</li>
            <li>it also comes with a complete set of accessories.</li>
            <li>My barber was surprised; he could not tell that I did it myself.</li>
            <li>did not like the fact of having to buy another blade that is almost the same price of the whole trimmer</li>
            <li>I recommend it and will buy it again to replace this one when it gets old.</li>
            <li>But after 15 minutes or so the clippers completely stops working.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and works just like my old pair</li>
            <li>you will of course not get as close as a razor, but you will get far closer</li>
            <li>Andis the only trimmer I have found to give a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>The in-and-out chain barbers do a terrible job, and if you want a good cut from a real barber, it&#x27;ll cost you more.</li>
            <li>but they stay cool long enough to shave my face and touch up my mustache.</li>
            <li>it wont heat up on you in the short period it requires to shave or trim, especially if you switch it off when brushing/combing hair and not cutting</li>
            <li>At first I found them getting really hot after using them for a while, but I figured out later that it was mostly due to my inexperience with these types of electric trimmers -</li>
            <li>I mean just ok.</li>
            <li>Smooth and quiet, I can trim my hair every other morning without waking my wife(truly a blessing in itself).</li>
            <li>I use them to dry shave with and they cut pretty close with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Although it comes with a variety of cheap plastic snap-on attachments to do fades, buzz-cuts, and other super-short styles, I bought these to use only as balding clippers.</li>
            <li>even with oiling it and keeping it clean the blades get really loud then don&#x27;t cut until I turn it on and off a few times.</li>
            <li>its only the first cut but its definitely as close as an electric.</li>
            <li>unless your using the shotty plastic hair guides, its a pretty rough cut near or on the face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommeded for simple all around cuts!</li>
            <li>The heat generated within the device brings the plastic housing to such a high temperature that one must hold it strategically (by the fingertips in alternating locations) in order to avoid self-inflicted burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>I contacted amazon and applied for an exchange, the new trimmer came even before i sent the old one back!</li>
            <li>He has used the Andis name brand for a long time and wants nothing else.</li>
            <li>and it would still be super patchy with little clumps of hair everywhere.  </li>
            <li>, it does hum a little, even though to me its no different than the sound I hear when I am in the barber&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li>This trimmer isn&#x27;t as sharp or strong as I expected from Andis.</li>
            <li>So I trudged back to the Wal Mart and bought a new Andis clipper for appx $30.</li>
            <li>great product for hair balding and very short cutting....</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how close it actually shaved me without causing any irritation whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>product was priced higher than other like items.</li>
            <li>just like anything else, as long as you take care of this item and keep it oield and clean, it will last you a long time!!</li>
            <li>Also, surprisingly, the guards all still work and haven&#x27;t broken like some other cheaper brands I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re older than fifty, it will remind you of the old-fashioned barbers&#x27; clippers: wicked effective hair cutting that sounds like a fan jet parking on your shoulder.</li>
            <li>With that being said, this unit was clearly design to shape up trim edges and facial hair.</li>
            <li>and I cut myself if I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li>So far my 2nd one has lasted</li>
            <li>been two so far that quit around the same time</li>
            <li>They barely work.</li>
            <li>K Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer]]</li>
            <li>I buzz my head frequently to keep my hair short.</li>
            <li>This machine uses the same style blade that the professional t-outliners use.</li>
            <li>just bare blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These use the same blades as the professional grade t-outliners and with any blade like this you have to adjust it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen it in my life before but this trimmer is so poorly manufactured that while the motor will continue to run, the connecting rubber and plastic will no longer be able to vibrate the blade, meaning that it does not cut.</li>
            <li>If you have thick hair and want to use this to keep your hair short, you are better off using a proper hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, because it&#x27;s a much close shave than the typical elctric razors by brands such as Braun and Norelic.</li>
            <li>I recommend a dry shave and while these clippers alone will get you really close they won‚Äôt be enough.</li>
            <li>I am not sure why it dies out and just doesn&#x27;t work so quickly?    </li>
            <li>Anyways, I think this is definitely a useful tool for the price, a quality product, and it beats paying the barber everytime you want to get trimmed up or shaved and it beats using wet and dirty and irritating manual razor shaving methods or ineffective electric razor methods, so it works best for me.  </li>
            <li>usually the type of hair cut i get is about a 3 with tapering the sides and back along with a clean lining.</li>
            <li>if you can call it that), when you clip your hair because it&#x27;s not a very wide clipping blade, the hair will fall of the side.</li>
            <li>It shaped the burns up very well just like any other quality shape up tool.</li>
            <li>Not a single piece of hair fell from my head.    </li>
            <li>My old ones recently died so I ordered the same set as a replacement.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a good set of close cutting clippers.</li>
            <li>With my old one I could cut mine and my three boys hair all in one sitting, but with this I have to stop half way through one head just to let it cool down.</li>
            <li>I used these clippers for about 8 months and they do not have the same sharp outlining capabilities as when i first bought them, even when properly oiled and lubricated.</li>
            <li>There is a loud buzzing noise that makes it really hard and frustrating to have a good shave.</li>
            <li>And, apparently, I either received a totally different product or something&#x27;s changed drastically since these reviews were written.    </li>
            <li>: Not good at fading between bare blade and the 1/16.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: If someone told me another trimmer did do a better job between the bare blade and 1/16 in assisting with a fade, I would return this product for the other one...</li>
            <li>cuts so close though my first one died after a few times using it</li>
            <li>My only issue is that it gets a little hot after about 15-20 minutes continuous use</li>
            <li>It obviously gets a little bit hot after using it for a while</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real sharp when it comes down to it and highly precise.</li>
            <li>I used it for dry shaving and it doesn&#x27;t cut nearly close enough.</li>
            <li>I purchased the new model which has the same blades as the old model but the housing for the clippers now has a high gloss black down the middle.</li>
            <li>Those short lengths are usually hard to find on these bargain-priced models as most only go down to 1/4\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li>so I guess I&#x27;ll be looking at other brands for a new shaving machine.</li>
            <li>These clippers were very loud and not even sharp.</li>
            <li>I like to either keep my beard tight like a 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow or a little longer and this trimmer gives me the ability to do that better than any other trimmer i&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li> I also have a wahl peanut which is very nice, but the advantage of this clipper is that you can adjust the blade but on the wahl peanut you cannot.  </li>

            <li> These are great for a good price too</li>

            <li> just used this clipper and lines up the beard just like the barber shop not as good but</li>
            <li> His beard always looks neat and he does a good job trimming his hair as well.  </li>
            <li> My son absolutely loved this product.</li>
            <li> These are good</li>
            <li> But God showed how much he loved us by having Christ die for us, even though we were sinful.</li>
            <li> does not feel cheap and great price!!</li>
            <li> but this is also a good addition to the lineup.</li>
            <li> I totally  loved it and</li>
            <li> Good Clippers.  </li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> It is advertised as a trimmer and shaver (which it does a great job), but they also allow you to cut the top.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with trimmer, performs as described,does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li> i am very pleased.</li>
            <li> worth every penny and more!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe to say I should have purchased it from the moment I saw it!  </li>
            <li> you will love owning this item!</li>
            <li> He was interested in this brand and of course it was priced best on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this clipper!</li>
            <li> this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> I tried, it was a amazing cut.</li>
            <li> The results were amazing.</li>
            <li> However, if you want to use it for a shape up its not as effective.</li>
            <li> In fact, I decided to use the clipper for my beard instead of shaving as it gives a nice 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really great product I am more than satisfied by my buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buzzing my own hair for a dozen years or so now.</li>
            <li> Compared to the silver Andis machine I have this is a nice substitute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own line up for years now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any problems with ingrown hair, therefore I decided to own my own pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> My husband now cuts his own hair, and it also has attachments for him to cut his beard and trim his mustache.</li>
            <li> Its a really nice trimer at Grate</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use it to do line up on my self work really nice.</li>
            <li> Have a friend who has it and needed a product that would cut closely to finish my hairstyles off nicely.</li>
            <li> it comes in handy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my own head once a week with a Wahl contour for 8 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice shave.</li>
            <li> Really all it takes is one swipe &amp; you have a perfect line for your face</li>
            <li> Nice clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it to touch up the edges after clipping my own hair.  </li>
            <li> Brought these as a replacement for the pair I already own for years because the power cord has a worn spot on them ...</li>
            <li> trust me it will come in handy.</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy and durable feeling.</li>
            <li> I am able to have my wife cut my hair in our home as good as when she had to take me to the barber.</li>
            <li> These work great for beard trimming and getting a nice smooth shave on your face.</li>
            <li> I had my own set of clipperd, but needed ssomething to shape up my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Andis Headliner because its a cheaper T-liner.</li>
            <li> , it has a nice shape to it</li>
            <li> and really handy work</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;dont use any of the guards but the brush is handy for cleaning</li>
            <li> The shape ups are really nice and clean using these trimmers, they give you a very nice close cut.</li>
            <li> The best way is to probably use the smallest size guard and trim your hair, if you don&#x27;t mind a little stuble, it will most certaintly be the best way to stop any type of bump or skin irritation problem.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great trimmer that comes with a variety of attachments combs and the best of all the bear brush that help prevent ingrown hair (dry shaving).  </li>
            <li> These clippers are great and they come in handy when you need a quick lining.</li>
            <li> , strong motor, good for the price.</li>
            <li> but a great value shipped really quick</li>
            <li> This is a great option to get a super close shave.</li>
            <li> It was a good buy, even came with a strong carrying case for travel.</li>
            <li> Great to have in case I need a quick replacement.  </li>
            <li> nice clippers and blades its all around a good quality product for the price i also like the light weight and style of the clipper.</li>
            <li> Blake makes trimming in between haircuts very easy and cuts almost bald.</li>
            <li> Great for lining up your hairline/styling your beard, great for a close shave, and great for trimming down your hair on your head/beard.</li>
            <li> It feels like a high quality trimmer and even though many wont use this for shaving their face, I found it to be perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> The best value for the money in hair trimmers, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I am also pleased with the handy storage bag for the trimmer and accessories.</li>
            <li> Cheap and good .</li>
            <li> leaves a very fine finish too and a close skin shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and handles great.</li>
            <li> these clippers are awesome.. way better than my old ones (remington)..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with with product and highly recommended as a very effective and affordable method for shaving and trimming.</li>
            <li> I was a full not to buy a good hair cutter before.</li>
            <li> , the clippers seem too good to be true.</li>
            <li> But they are too good to be true.</li>
            <li> It works nicely and gives you a nice clean line.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable - close cuts</li>
            <li> you can wear with you anywhere very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have gone through many machines of this kind, however this one is more reliable and works better, after a while the machine&#x27;s noise elevated, I oiled and still the motor is making more noise than it should.</li>
            <li> I have a beard that I like to get creative with.. and the om/off switch makes it easy to stop and check the progress of my latest design without worrying about messing it up because of a mistake handleing the trimmer!</li>
            <li> good quality  light weight and easy to use     </li>
            <li> It surely is satisfying.</li>
            <li> This gave me one of the most easiest shaves ever.</li>
            <li> My efforts produced smiles and giggles from my wife and daughter, but my wife finished the job for me and everyone is pleased.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it about 2 weeks now and have had nothing but outstanding results on my beard and neckline</li>
            <li> If I took care of them better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they would have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I just got these clippers in the mail today (august 13,2010) - I love them.</li>
            <li> No big deal, works great!!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more reliable because it was a plug-in, rather than battery.</li>
            <li> Relatively much more lighter than the one I have.</li>
            <li> but if u want more weight and a edgier shape up go for the silver one.</li>
            <li> the more you keep them running, the hotter they will get.</li>
            <li> Overall, great clippers!  </li>
            <li> One more opened product and</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> They trim up facial hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It DOESN&#x27;T feel real light and cheap either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the biggest guard is more than a #2...?</li>
            <li> I love  this trimmer.</li>
            <li> i realy love the clippers they work like the gray ones that they use at the barber</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s great at outlining but it heats up way fast</li>
            <li> I recommended this product to anyone that love keeping their haircut.</li>
            <li> It cuts very close and is great for shaping up my beard, mustache and hair line.</li>
            <li> far as the cut theses trimmers get you a good close shave with no guard and cut fairly even with the guard.</li>
            <li> made me love these trimmers</li>
            <li> These clippers work better than advertised.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is just ok</li>
            <li> Better value that buying one at the stores.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> He is totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> CANT ASK FOR ANYTHING BETTER</li>
            <li> great product, a groomer every real man should have in their bathroom or locker.</li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d suggest you pay $20 dollars more for a better version.</li>
            <li> i  love  this  trimmer  </li>
            <li> enjoying his shaving now</li>
            <li> For the price of these edgers you are better off purchasing the (Andis T-Outliner 04710).</li>
            <li> I have owned many types of clippers</li>
            <li> I love the bag it came in as all pieces can stay together and be kept in order.</li>
            <li> Mostly for sideburns, getting around the ears,</li>
            <li> a nice a smooth and even cut with one pass maybe two..</li>
            <li> i love them..</li>
            <li> You are better off with a more costly headliner.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li> researched back then and came to the conclusion that Andis was the best option.</li>
            <li> Then it got progressively noisier the more I used it.</li>
            <li> It took 15 mins to do what most barbers do in an hour</li>
            <li> and I did a better job.</li>
            <li> Great very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this is great and gives a really close shave without causing any irritation.</li>
            <li> but I was able to pick it up on amazon for $19.  </li>
            <li> I love the Andis trimmers.</li>
            <li> Love It...</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth for shaving my face.</li>
            <li> it gives a really nice and clean cut.</li>
            <li> Great price, Great product..Received them fast and hassle free.. THANKS</li>
            <li> the product get hot after a while, but its a good product.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for 2 years now, and they still run as good as when I first purchased them.</li>
            <li> They started out pretty good.</li>
            <li> Works great, comes in a handy carrying case with accessories for different hair styles.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive areas!</li>
            <li> They can be adjusted with a screw driver, good eyes and a steady hand!</li>
            <li> so I got this one because it was fairly cheap and had pretty good reviews.  </li>
            <li> It makes a great razor alternative if your skin is to sensitive for razors, which mine is.</li>
            <li> No one is really willing to die for an honest person, though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person.   </li>
            <li> works fantastic, just make sure u order oil and keep it oiled well,</li>
            <li> whole point of buying this was to save money and maintain a good, quality, groomed look.</li>
            <li> It s a good product, you can get a good shave in dry</li>
            <li> many shaves now great for bodybuilders or anyone who hates body hair and wants a very fast shave.</li>
            <li> and he seems extremely excited about it and is still enjoying it.</li>
            <li> If I could combine these with the Wahl edgers I have, which are too sharp, they would be perfect.</li>
            <li> so you can take it with you and store it really easy</li>
            <li> I do not razor shave because of irritation and haven&#x27;t clean shaved for a many years.</li>
            <li> With these clippers its soooo easy to cut</li>
            <li> It is easy and convenient for travel....</li>
            <li> and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is now Jan 30, 2013, and this shaver is still going strong.</li>
            <li> My Dad bought this product almost 2 years ago and it has been going strong since that day.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommended for those like me that get razor bumps.</li>
            <li> The right and left edges of the clipper work best for lining up!!!</li>
            <li> These clippers worked great the first time used, however they become hot very quickly and the blades seems to be cheap.</li>
            <li> These T clippers are pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> So make sure to purchase the Andis Cool Care Plus</li>
            <li> Awesome product, cuts real close, long power cord and power source, just what I needed to make nice, clean lines.</li>
            <li> Works fine</li>
            <li> But everything looks fine.     </li>
            <li> Otherwise it works fine.  </li>
            <li> The electric shaver seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect product and brand name for black men.</li>
            <li> he says its smooth and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and it worked fine</li>
            <li> Trimmer cut excellent the only problem was I had to stop twice because of the motor running too hot</li>
            <li> I tried the snap on attachments to attempt to lighten my goatee, not only was this usable, but it looked great and was quite easy to do.</li>
            <li> These, however, are so smooth</li>
            <li> Still great considering over 2 years of use, entire body shaves, head</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a relatively cheap hair trimmer, this is the one.</li>
            <li> The motor on these clippers is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product for its price.</li>
            <li> your like me and get haircuts and shape ups every few weeks, this is perfect for those inbetween time.</li>
            <li> I cam across these because the only time I would get a great shave was at the barber.</li>
            <li> and I liked it so much that I went and bought for my house.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great for those who have short hair but still care for it.</li>
            <li> this thing is great if your never gonna use an attachment and your only gonna use it for 5min.</li>
            <li> For years I used a combination of a Remington foil shaver (the one with the tipple foil) and a cheap cordless norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li> It also works great to outline a beard or trim your beard,it comes with different size length guards.</li>
            <li> Great overall buy</li>
            <li> The clippers dont cut or burn they work fabulous</li>
            <li> Cut smooth like a razor with irritation.</li>
            <li> The unit is light and ergonomic in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I shave with this every day or two and it keeps me free of ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> but it wasnt a smooth cut.</li>
            <li> It was smooth and made my waves stand out.</li>
            <li> Good quality, complete set.</li>
            <li> The cut is good and looks like when it&#x27;s professionally done.</li>
            <li> over all so far it is doing a good job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update! 5/23/2013 Still going strong by far the best shaver I have owned very fast and very close</li>
            <li> but he blade gets pretty warm quickly.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I am sure that they work great.</li>
            <li> Recommended purchase, very useful for the price it is listed under.</li>
            <li> Its very smooth and cuts everything off on the first shot.-[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Once you got things as smooth as you can with the clippers, bring in the electric shaver to do the clean up duty.</li>
            <li> Also good for trimming hair just about anywhere - the blade is pretty gentle on the skin compared to others I&#x27;ve tried, but gets the job done well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They cut very close and they are very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This clipper gets very close to the skin, and does a great job considering it is not commercial, and is very cheap.</li>
            <li> THESE CLIPPERS GET VERY HOT VERY QUICKLY.    </li>
            <li> , the new trimmer (same model) works great!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product so far.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m as satisfied as the day I first used it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a lot more power and is a much higher quality than any trimmer you could get for under $50 in a store.</li>
            <li> and i recommend this to anyone and everyone who needs to get a fresh fade!</li>
            <li> I recanted my original post about the buzzing.</li>
            <li> Many reviewers note that the clippers run hot.</li>
            <li> with practice i am sure i can get pretty close</li>
            <li> you better practice first.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I chose this one as my first one</li>
            <li> I just keep them clean with clipper spray and oiled.</li>
            <li> Luckily these were available, and I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep them clean and they will keep you clean.</li>

            <li> Keep them clean and oiled up...</li>
            <li> I am a firefighter and my job requires that we stay clean shaven.</li>
            <li> These help me stay clean between barber visits.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as clean and pinches my skin when I use it in my travels.</li>
            <li> The secret to any great haircut is a good go-to clipper for detailing.</li>
            <li> This product meets all my needs for a clean shaven head.</li>
            <li> THIS CLIPPER CUTS VERY CLOSE AND IS ALSO VERY COMFORTABLE.      </li>
            <li> Another great thing about this product is that it is not as easily heated as other brands!</li>
            <li> other than that this is an amazing trimmer for an amazing price.</li>
            <li> just cuz, right!, and Instantly appeared in the mirror, after some Fine detailing,minor touch ups, and good looking results I can say they are worth the buy</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap (though not as cheap as they used to be) and they cut through hair like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> this is good if you want short hair 1/16 1/8 1/4 3/6</li>
            <li> However be ready to pay $30 more.</li>
            <li> I have found so many that leave too much</li>
            <li> They also work good for trimming up short hair.  </li>
            <li> it would be much wiser to save 25 more dollars and buy an updated brand</li>
            <li> ii ave been looking for a good linen-er for a while and really only got the because it was Andis</li>
            <li> thats because i did use them for a full hair cut basically.</li>
            <li> Clean lines, makes quick work of a beard cleanup.</li>
            <li> He thanks me all the time , this was a birthday gift for him &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Overall These are a good set for home use.</li>
            <li> ONLY good in the beginning/</li>
            <li> Not a bad trimmer for the money if you don&#x27;t mind taking it apart and cleaning/maintaining it.  </li>
            <li> The first one is still running strong since 2011.</li>
            <li> It cuts fine but becomes hot after awhile.</li>
            <li> its compact, powerful and cuts clean.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t ready to pay that much for trimmers just to do my hairline during my own haircuts.</li>
            <li> It gets really close, really easy to clean and was a bargain.</li>
            <li> The trimmers work well and they arrived fairly quick.</li>
            <li> my older one was better</li>
            <li> super efficient.</li>
            <li> Este trimer es super comodo y util, en lo que tengo comprando via</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommended to anyone who has a problem with razor bumps or looking for the closest cut for shaping up, shaving or styling hair.</li>
            <li> This beats all the other cordless ones I have owned, and some were fairly nice, and the price was better than some of the cordless as well.  </li>
            <li> and it gets very hot</li>
            <li> Feels smooth and no irritation and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this item.y attachments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough to hold for a reasonable amount of time and the blades give good results.</li>
            <li> these baby&#x27;s give a nice close clean shave so long as you keep them oiled and clean.</li>
            <li> That said, I really think it could get a tad closer and still be effective but believe me thats not really a complaint.</li>
            <li> So far this machine has held up and works even better once you keep it oiled, which will bring out the products full capabilities.</li>
            <li> I have had an Andis trimmer in the past, it wore out after many years of good use</li>
            <li> and they go through my hair like a hot knife in butter!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a pretty close shave!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use.. powerful.. and the on/off switch is very convienient when using it</li>
            <li> Works great for little detail areas, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I adjusted the blade a little and the trimmers performed great.</li>
            <li> Clipper does heat up a little, but it cuts great.</li>
            <li> This item works really good but shaking little more and sound loud a bit but doing job and for this price</li>
            <li> This machine is what I have been looking for a loong time, Iwasso glad to find it and find it at a low price, but the machine works great love cutting my son and my own hair with it.</li>
            <li> The cut is very close and smooth.</li>
            <li> : Cheap, reliable, works very well, gets close to the skin</li>
            <li> but I could only imagine it to be amazing.</li>
            <li> Most professional clippers have a rounded type cord that prevents it from getting tangled up.  </li>
            <li> Have tried a few Andis products and this by far has given me the best and closest shave utilizing hair clippers.  </li>
            <li> in my old one, the hair used to collect on top of the blade. ]</li>
            <li> worth every penny, would buy it again in a haertbeat</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clipper so its going to make noise and with any powerful clipper, it&#x27;s going to get hotter as time goes by</li>
            <li> So worth the money and delivers well.</li>
            <li> This shaver works well and cuts close and is the good value that I expected.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who likes to do their own shape-ups and have different beard styles they like to try</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but these are worth a try.</li>
            <li> compared to the old one (located at the top), I&#x27;ve found myself turning it off accidentally.</li>
            <li> It makes my wifes job harder in fading my hair because it doesn&#x27;t have a good intermediary between the 1/16 and</li>
            <li> it worth every penny you pay for it...</li>
            <li> worth the money?</li>
            <li> powerful motor as well.</li>
            <li> it works really good, is really strong and it is small</li>
            <li> I bought this item mainly as a beard trimmer and neck cleaner-upper, so it will work fine for me.</li>
            <li> The T-Outliners never dull and are a lot more sturdy and comfortable to hold in your hand, professional barbers use them all the time.</li>
            <li> the trimmer arrived yesterday and used it right away.</li>
            <li> I recieved another set of combs right away, no charge, from the company.  </li>
            <li> Just got this trimmer in the mail yesterday and put it right to work.  </li>
            <li> One thing I must mention is that right out of the box, they dont cut that close.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> This product comes with all the the right tools and accessories.</li>
            <li> Like some reviewrs have posted, the unit does get a bit hot, but i prefer the unit to get hot and still deliver a great close shave, than those other products that dont get hot and have razor bumps to deal with afterward.   </li>
            <li> worked great the first few times.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for almost 10 years now, and no other set is more balanced.</li>
            <li> They get SUPER hot fast!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth a look, if you&#x27;re in the market for your first &amp;#34;line</li>
            <li> this one is light weight, cuts close, doesn&#x27;t heat up, comes in any easy to store bag that isn&#x27;t bulky and you won&#x27;t need to keep scraping your head to catch every last strand of hair because this catches it in the first couple of runs..   </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t neglect to clean and maintain these properly, there are also videos online that show you exactly how to clean it as well as what is required to  clean the clippers.</li>
            <li> I was able to correct any uneven mistakes I may have made and was able to get it so close that there was no shadow for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to handle and clean, and comes with a bunch of short guides.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it does get warm after a few minutes of use, but on both the sound and heating issues, I don&#x27;t let it run continuosly.</li>
            <li> It shaves pretty clean and I love the carry bag that came with it which makes it very portable for my overseas trips which I occasionally take.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair as well as other family members and was comfortable doing an entire cutdown and line up easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cheap and the only maintainence is clipper oil.</li>
            <li> Quick, simple, and easy.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it describes.</li>
            <li> As has been mentioned the clipper runs hot.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m giving the review on the shipping first which is 5 STARS, I have yet to try the trimmers yet.</li>
            <li> I dropped it the first day and the 3/8 comb snaped off.</li>
            <li> Purchased these clippers after Andis t-outliner finally wore out after more than 8 years of use.</li>
            <li> first one lasted for 11 month.</li>
            <li> They get you pretty close to bald, and they are inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head once a week, and the first pair of these clippers I had lasted 4 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;EDIT: 3 years later (aug 2014)</li>
            <li> I bought this to actually shave my cat with, but instead decided it would be put to better use to shave my face/cut my hair with (fancy that).</li>
            <li> My first one went out and Andis replaced it with no cost to me.</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;ve REALLY got my money&#x27;s worth out of this clipper.</li>
            <li> *Re-updated November 2010 - I dropped my original Andis on my tile floor from several feet, causing some damage to the original teeth/ clipper part.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found a better deal yet, and I don&#x27;t feel any need to upgrade to anything better (more expensive).</li>
            <li> it has 3/8, 1/8, 1/16 and one more bigger one.</li>
            <li> When I first got this I would have rated it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is as close as i need, very close!</li>
            <li> I also love that the different sized guards that come with this allow me to trim body hair, my beard, side burns...</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers on 1 March 2012 for many reasons, one being the reputation that Andis has, one being my barber recommended it, and one being friends that regularly use it recommended it.  </li>
            <li> Prior to that they were ok, and</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> first blush</li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, with the most recent 40% increase in price (from $24 to $34), I can no longer justify this as a \\&quot;value\\&quot; purchase.</li>
            <li> Has more then enough accessories and attachments.</li>
            <li> Hubby absolutely loves this Andis!</li>
            <li> I first came across Andis products from a friend of mine who cuts my hair.</li>
            <li> No matter what I use to shave, my neck is most irritated and with this product it&#x27;s no different.  </li>
            <li> i tried this the first time, for some reason</li>
            <li> Gets hot after 5 mins</li>
            <li> I bought this exact set from Walmart</li>
            <li> I oiled them before the first use and the preciseness in the cut was just as any barber</li>
            <li> i purchased these same clippers many years ago and they cut so close</li>
            <li> There are videos online that show you exactly how to preform this  </li>
            <li> They cut very close and give a powerful cut.</li>
            <li> The kit did exactly as it was advertized.  </li>
            <li> I love this Andis headliner and for the price point I will be buying another one next week just as a backup.</li>
            <li> Very reliable!</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it had a better attachment beyond the 1/16 to help in the fade...like a 1/32...</li>
            <li> first it seemed to be quality, but it does not perform reliably.</li>
            <li> Package arrived exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> trimmer is an absolute piece of garbage in terms of quality, for a few dollars more you can get some thing much better.</li>
            <li> My hairline and chin line were both crisp.</li>
            <li> First trimmer I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> SAVE you&#x27;re money and don&#x27;t buy this PRODUCT at all, I have tried a couple more of their product and they all ended up the same, OVER</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really  good and  not so heavy</li>
            <li> The only complaints I have are that it does get hot rather quickly, but you can buy the Cool Down spray for that (that stuff smells good; makes it smell like a real barbershop!)</li>
            <li> So Like Many other Andis Products I got, I didn&#x27;t have a trimmer or Professional outliners the Barbers be using to give that fresh smooth feeling shave after a visit, so I figure why not, looks like it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Especially if you do any type of line-ups, its quick and precise.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I had such a nice clean short cut.</li>
            <li> Great product, allows for a crisp line up, works better than all of the other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> and/or razor burn, yet shaves almost as close as a normal razor!!</li>
            <li> On the very flat areas of my face it seemed to cut ok, but on any curve it did nothing.  </li>
            <li> But where it matters most, it still does a great job of cutting hair.</li>
            <li> I find that it gets clogged, needs to be taken apart to be clean and oiled quite frequently.  </li>
            <li> i was really easy on this clipper too and yet after only 3 months and most likely around 20 uses the thing died on me during my morning cleanup.</li>
            <li> Last a good while when maintained properly.</li>
            <li> So me, being cheap, I&#x27;ve gone through several of these cheaper clipper sets over the years - Remingtons, Wahls, Conairs, all without much success.</li>
            <li> very quiet, this trimmer does exactly what you need it to do, I like to shave designs into hair, and these work fabulous , no cutting of the skin, quiet, and easily takes out that line when trying to fade.</li>
            <li> It cuts as sharp as the old one but doesn&#x27;t get warm up as quick</li>
            <li> I love the different trimming edges as well, they have come in handy quite a few times.</li>
            <li> but you can still get a fairly crisp, straight line.</li>
            <li> The reason i didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is because they heat up pretty fast, but</li>
            <li> Clippers get hot  too fast and cuts off in five minutes ..</li>
            <li> so hot in fact they will burn you even with ample amounts of oil and too much oil</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m looking real G. ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an Andis T-ouliner before (the more professional and powerful barbershop type of this one) and there isn&#x27;t too much different.  </li>
            <li> and I can even do a quick shave with just the bare trimmer right across my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted me 5 years and its actually still working fine.  </li>
            <li> Cuts sharp lines and is very easy to control.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it heats up very quickly, but this won&#x27;t happen if you are just tightening your hairline.</li>
            <li> Besides making a strange buzzing sound, maybe because it&#x27;s new and needs a little oil,  I am free to be my own barber.  </li>
            <li> Recently I bought another pair just for dry shaving because I remember how good they worked for me.  </li>
            <li> These clippers seem very high quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Has a nice little pouch so you can carry it on the go...</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended for anybody that is interested in it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these clippers and pretty much</li>
            <li> The clippers get a little hot after using for a length of time, other than that , a good product!</li>
            <li> And I select standard free shipping.</li>
            <li> it was very well&lt;br</li>
            <li> work¬¥s very well..!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I am usually very picky on these things and decided to take the chance with this.</li>
            <li> and it works really well for what I bought it for (to shave my husband&#x27;s neck.)  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> These clippers get really close to the skin when doing a line up.  </li>
            <li> I actually really like the way this cuts.</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave, and no razor bumpors.</li>
            <li> VERY CLOSE</li>

            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It gets real close and my face looks like a shave less-than-a-day-old.</li>
            <li> buy this because I can not spend my razor and this worked very well to keep the beauty of the face without irritation controlled</li>
            <li> The Andis cutting tool is the best hair liner I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> This product shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Apply the oil ready to go.</li>
            <li> My neck is the real problem when shaving, my hairs grow every which way, ingrown hairs, some bumps.  </li>
            <li> This item was shipped fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve been very please with the performanance and build quality.</li>
            <li> the item is oil picture is for whole set with attachments.</li>
            <li> It cuts very well &amp; really close.  </li>
            <li> The guides were very sturdy as well.</li>
            <li> Evened my whole beard with ease.</li>
            <li> They get very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> It has too much complications.</li>
            <li> the blades don&#x27;t quite match up level to cut real close.</li>
            <li> I never use a straight razor on my face because I breakout.</li>
            <li> broke on me toooooo fast</li>
            <li> and  it  get  real  </li>
            <li> The T-Blade trimmers are just perfect from angling all the way to precision cutting.</li>
            <li> VERY well and close.</li>
            <li> Very close shave, but no skin burn like I would get with a straight razor</li>
            <li> gave a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> This trimmer makes so much noise that you need ear plugs to get your hair trimmed.</li>
            <li> For now I will stick with this one, as it does work very well for everything else I need.</li>
            <li> Nothing intense.</li>
            <li> Cord is cheap but that&#x27;s the only problem .</li>
            <li> u must adjust the blades to get real close</li>
            <li> they get hot, really hot with continuous use of more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Cuts really close.</li>
            <li> It really doesn‚Äôt matter whether you go with rotary or foil, it‚Äôs really preference.</li>
            <li> clippers are fairly quiet and quite light.</li>
            <li> The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the cheap short power chord.  </li>
            <li> So you can do the math on how much use you&#x27;ll get out of it.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer at walmart to try out,  shaving leaves me irritated and decided to get a real trimmer to replace those bead trimmers.</li>
            <li> These clippers gives me a very close shave.</li>
            <li> and i only use liners to give me a close and smooth shave....</li>
            <li> If you need a close shave and can&#x27;t use straight razors like me, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I had used razors that gave me razor bumps which really made me irate but after using this, the bumps don&#x27;t show as much as they would when I used the razors.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> Actually I would probably spend more money and get a nicer Andis professional version, or a cordless version.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it does get hot quick, but wasnt much of a problem.</li>
            <li> If you are buying these or any new type of clipper for the first time, research on how to use them(youtube).</li>
            <li> Same original blade for me; just some clipper oil before &amp; after every cut.     </li>
            <li> I thougt about the more expensive, but I am glad I got these first.</li>
            <li> Reason it doesn&#x27;t get my 5 star rating is because after a month or so it shuts off, so you need to get a screw driver and open the blades to clean the hair out of the machines.</li>
            <li> Every now and again I would just open it and clean it with a towel and a brush.</li>
            <li> I was surprise how clean it left my face.</li>
            <li> but I‚Äôm usually looking for the next great pair of clippers by that point so</li>
            <li> You should also open it up and clean out the hairs after a while, you can realign the blades by pushing them into a mirror at a 90 degree angle.</li>
            <li> To me these are better for shaving than the professional grey outliners.  </li>
            <li> Some parts looked a little cheap, but the cutter is tremendous for shaving off the fuzz on my balding husband&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> you manage to work around the heat issue, by either working quickly or by taking breaks to allow the machine to cool down, there is the additional issue of durability.</li>
            <li> These clippers are just not that sharp, which is pretty important for \\&quot;headliner\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long known that if you want a really smooth shave, there isn&#x27;t just one device that will do the job.</li>
            <li> It gets warm and always has, but it still cuts nice and for a guy who shaves his head and face...not bad.</li>
            <li> They are definitely better than some of the cheaper ones i have used previously.</li>
            <li> I had my previous pair for about 8 years and now have purchased this item and love it.</li>
            <li> realistic?</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re in the market for a decent shaver, you might want to keep looking.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I packed my backup clippers but those do not cut nearly as short as the Andis.</li>
            <li> I use them primarily to cut my hair (I am a 40+ yr old male), while my son uses them as trimmers to taper and edge.</li>
            <li> But as far as cutting quality, it is the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Afircan American and my beard is coarse and curly, sometimes with many razor</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more Andis products in the future.</li>
            <li> many African american males</li>
            <li> they still do a decent job.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE DECENT FOR THE PRICE.    </li>
            <li> anyone know where I can find a replacement cord for my older pair on amazon??</li>
            <li> I love these, this is actually the second set I bought.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve had this particular set for two years, but I‚Äôve been using these types of clippers for about 7 years.</li>
            <li> Once it arrived this morning I instantly broke open the box, I made sure \\&quot;Not\\&quot; to shave till it gets here,</li>
            <li> It is a very professional and durable piece of equipment!</li>
            <li> The only downside is they get very hot after a while.</li>
            <li> My old clipper could clean my whole head in 2 minutes flat and it would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this trimmer and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> These clippers don&#x27;t have the high level of material quality, but for the cost they can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> then those highly advertized wireless beard</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this trimmer and the Andis brand to anyone.</li>
            <li> As far as I can see the quality looks the same as my original one</li>
            <li> I love this little kit.</li>
            <li> Only issue I have, the clippers get hot after a certain period of time.  </li>
            <li> this Andis Trimmer came SUPER FAST like a day and a half fast!</li>
            <li> They are not as good as the t edgers, and I&#x27;ve found that it takes a little longer to achieve the same result as my professional trimmers.  </li>
            <li> They do shake pretty hard just fyi, its not terrible to the extent they cant be used</li>
            <li> highly recommend these clippers and pretty much the entire Andis line.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the experience with these clippers were great.</li>
            <li> Normally tho I just use the peanut unless I want a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white male in my early 30s with thin/ thinning hair on top.</li>
            <li> Save you lots of money as you don&#x27;t need to visit the barber as often as you normally would have.  </li>
            <li> First few times it was a pain in the butt because I couldn&#x27;t find a screw driver that fit.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t seem powerful enough to cut a head of hair.</li>
            <li> I thought this was normal considering the price of the product.</li>
            <li> I have no complaint.  </li>
            <li> the other two had chords that were very user friendly..  </li>
            <li> I use these to line up my own facial hair and they have not let me down.</li>
            <li> I used them, I kept them clean, never dropped it, treated it like a limited edition hall of fame baseball card...</li>
            <li> It definitely gets closer than the rechargeable trimmers that I am used to and has the power to easily work through my coarse beard hair.  </li>
            <li> And I always said I had to get a good trimmer for my beard because every of other trimmer I had either didn&#x27;t cut my hair low enough or would cause razor bumps on my face.</li>
            <li> Again I love these clippers, but for my 2nd purchase, they just don&#x27;t last long enough for me to really enjoy them.</li>
            <li> The noise, while a bit loud, was not uncomfortable, and pretty much what I expected.</li>
            <li> does what i bought it for gets pretty close&lt;br /&gt;close enough to do a decent shape up</li>
            <li> I have used other brands before, but compared to the Andis are like cheap knockoffs .</li>
            <li> Cheaply built and not at all sharp.</li>
            <li> It gives you a sharp shave for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> IF you don&#x27;t won&#x27;t the Blades too sharp and still gives that smooth Barber Feel when you slap on the alcohol...</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, it had everything inside the box and all the equipment looked new.</li>
            <li> New Andis Company 11pc Headliner Shave Trim</li>
            <li> It does bother me that it is not cordless, but i can live with that</li>
            <li> I find myself looking for something new after about 6 months, because a routine beard trim has turned into a 45 minute cleaning disassembling job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After receiving my new Andis, I have not noticed any decrease in quality.</li>
            <li> its on you if you want to upgrade or just put in new blades.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He used them and when he purchased a new set, he passed them on to my son.</li>
            <li> The only problems is that it does get extremely hot after a short amount of use and it actually stopped working on me after owning it for about 7 months while cutting a friend&#x27;s and my own fair every 3 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> perhaps your new batch wont use such cheap plastic...go back to what worked...</li>
            <li> One thing though, the trimmer does get warm after extended use (30mins) but nothing too serious.  </li>
            <li> Incidentally, the alleged 29% savings on this product (as of June 19, 2012) is questionable at best.</li>
            <li> Again, I use it to keep all my facial hair and what&#x27;s left on my head, trimmed, shaped and cut, I have no problems with sound or heat.</li>
            <li> The box makes that very clear, but I didn&#x27;t think that was very clear in the product description.</li>
            <li> First time, the clippers died out on me mid cut, and I was in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> I have tried many beard trimmers and usually would shave with the pop up shaver on electric shavers.</li>
            <li> If your trimming up, or looking for a pretty short cut with out having to worry about razer burn these are the T trimmer for you!  </li>
            <li> The first time i purchased this item it stopped working after only one use!</li>
            <li> I have not had a set last for longer than six months, the most recent one surviving only two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 3rd degree burn hot.</li>
            <li> The only con to these would be how hot they get after about 20 mins.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase, my first one lasted about one year.</li>
            <li> This is my first Andis product but definitely won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li> purchased this because I&#x27;ve had too many rechargeable clippers in the past that eventually lose the ability to hold a charge and become garbage.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re accustomed to a battery-charged trimmer, you&#x27;ll have some work to do to get accustomed to working around an electrical cord, especially with out-maneuvering the cord to position the cutter just so to get the exact results you&#x27;re wanting.</li>
            <li> The first pair lasted about 7 years with constant use.  </li>
            <li> I totally praise the product itself cuts exactly like it should...</li>
            <li> Doesnt make sharp edges like the original.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit in Oct. &#x27;13 and that coincides with the last time I visited the barbershop ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought another one is because I threw away the clip attachments on my first one and now I need them.  </li>
            <li> Much better than other regular clippers that I have tried.</li>
            <li> If you keep your blades oiled, clean and adjust them regularly they will last along time without sacrificing the quality of the cut.</li>
            <li> With these here, I will not be going to the barbershop every other week &amp; kicking out a lot of money to keep a clean &amp; neat shape up.</li>
            <li> but the guys out there need to know that this thing is far more practical, especially for the money, than a beard trimmer or even a much more expensive electric razor</li>
            <li> I used it maybe 2-3 times, and my old Andis, with its dull blade did a better job than this thing brand new!</li>
            <li> So far, this new clipper set is proving itself to be every bit the measure of the t-liner, and then some.</li>
            <li> This product is a huge improvement over my previous trimmer, a Conair.</li>
            <li> Most clipper sets in this price range only go down to 1/8.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep the new Andis clippers for when I want to remove hair completely or almost completely.</li>
            <li> Its a sexy black finish and very solid and sturdy in hand, and comes with extras as described.</li>
            <li> After 5 years and many razor bumps later, with the advice of my barber; I decided to upgrade my electric razor to something that will not break out my skin and this baby does the job and costs alot less.</li>
            <li> great little trimmer,cord is a little short for me.</li>
            <li> Edging is quick, sharp and done in one stroke, no matter the location.</li>
            <li> Even with the initial high functionality of the Andis, its overall performance is marred by the fact that the body of the clippers runs extremely hot after 10+ minutes of use.</li>
            <li> It is professional</li>
            <li> The old trimmer did not do this.</li>
            <li> The reasonably priced LS2 is simple to operate and does the job well.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere on the page and there is nowhere to find an E-mail or chat that I can contact directly.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> Got very noise after second use.</li>
            <li> My old hair clipper broke</li>
            <li> I also love that it comes with a super-short 1/16\\&quot; &amp; 1/8\\&quot; guards (or at least mine did).</li>
            <li> - I was looking at my reviews and saw this from almost 2 years ago (and it was probably 2 years old at the time).</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important to not have a heavy hand when lining someone&#x27;s edge up.  </li>
            <li> I pulled out my old but faltering Wahl, turned it on</li>
            <li> Kelly-K of Shiftn Steel Sport Riderz says get those professional cuts like the barber in the comfort of your home</li>
            <li> There hair cuts always look professional when I do it.</li>
            <li> I wish my old lady could shake like this...</li>
            <li> I am going to try and order the professional model and am going to return this one.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this if your looking for a complete hair cut kit.</li>
            <li> So much so, I would have to stroke the same area two or three time before I got the desired cut.</li>
            <li> Price\\&quot; near fifty dollars in years.</li>
            <li> and so far no effect has been seen</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too early to tell I guess.  </li>
            <li> I had just had a professional shave</li>
            <li> Then something else surprised me.</li>
            <li> I took my 30+ year-old American-made Wahl clippers apart and fixed them.</li>
            <li> I tried using a blade to actually shave my head even closer, and noticed it does make much of a difference because this product already gets close</li>
            <li> A bit loud and</li>
            <li> it also comes with a complete set of accessories.</li>
            <li> My barber was surprised; he could not tell that I did it myself.</li>
            <li> did not like the fact of having to buy another blade that is almost the same price of the whole trimmer</li>
            <li> I recommend it and will buy it again to replace this one when it gets old.</li>
            <li> But after 15 minutes or so the clippers completely stops working.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works just like my old pair</li>
            <li> you will of course not get as close as a razor, but you will get far closer</li>
            <li> Andis the only trimmer I have found to give a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> The in-and-out chain barbers do a terrible job, and if you want a good cut from a real barber, it&#x27;ll cost you more.</li>
            <li> but they stay cool long enough to shave my face and touch up my mustache.</li>
            <li> it wont heat up on you in the short period it requires to shave or trim, especially if you switch it off when brushing/combing hair and not cutting</li>
            <li> At first I found them getting really hot after using them for a while, but I figured out later that it was mostly due to my inexperience with these types of electric trimmers -</li>
            <li> I mean just ok.</li>
            <li> Smooth and quiet, I can trim my hair every other morning without waking my wife(truly a blessing in itself).</li>
            <li> I use them to dry shave with and they cut pretty close with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Although it comes with a variety of cheap plastic snap-on attachments to do fades, buzz-cuts, and other super-short styles, I bought these to use only as balding clippers.</li>
            <li> even with oiling it and keeping it clean the blades get really loud then don&#x27;t cut until I turn it on and off a few times.</li>
            <li> its only the first cut but its definitely as close as an electric.</li>
            <li> unless your using the shotty plastic hair guides, its a pretty rough cut near or on the face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommeded for simple all around cuts!</li>
            <li> The heat generated within the device brings the plastic housing to such a high temperature that one must hold it strategically (by the fingertips in alternating locations) in order to avoid self-inflicted burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I contacted amazon and applied for an exchange, the new trimmer came even before i sent the old one back!</li>
            <li> He has used the Andis name brand for a long time and wants nothing else.</li>
            <li> and it would still be super patchy with little clumps of hair everywhere.  </li>
            <li> , it does hum a little, even though to me its no different than the sound I hear when I am in the barber&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li> This trimmer isn&#x27;t as sharp or strong as I expected from Andis.</li>
            <li> So I trudged back to the Wal Mart and bought a new Andis clipper for appx $30.</li>
            <li> great product for hair balding and very short cutting....</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how close it actually shaved me without causing any irritation whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> product was priced higher than other like items.</li>
            <li> just like anything else, as long as you take care of this item and keep it oield and clean, it will last you a long time!!</li>
            <li> Also, surprisingly, the guards all still work and haven&#x27;t broken like some other cheaper brands I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re older than fifty, it will remind you of the old-fashioned barbers&#x27; clippers: wicked effective hair cutting that sounds like a fan jet parking on your shoulder.</li>
            <li> With that being said, this unit was clearly design to shape up trim edges and facial hair.</li>
            <li> and I cut myself if I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li> So far my 2nd one has lasted</li>
            <li> been two so far that quit around the same time</li>
            <li> They barely work.</li>
            <li> K Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> I buzz my head frequently to keep my hair short.</li>
            <li> This machine uses the same style blade that the professional t-outliners use.</li>
            <li> just bare blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These use the same blades as the professional grade t-outliners and with any blade like this you have to adjust it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen it in my life before but this trimmer is so poorly manufactured that while the motor will continue to run, the connecting rubber and plastic will no longer be able to vibrate the blade, meaning that it does not cut.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair and want to use this to keep your hair short, you are better off using a proper hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, because it&#x27;s a much close shave than the typical elctric razors by brands such as Braun and Norelic.</li>
            <li> I recommend a dry shave and while these clippers alone will get you really close they won‚Äôt be enough.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why it dies out and just doesn&#x27;t work so quickly?    </li>
            <li> Anyways, I think this is definitely a useful tool for the price, a quality product, and it beats paying the barber everytime you want to get trimmed up or shaved and it beats using wet and dirty and irritating manual razor shaving methods or ineffective electric razor methods, so it works best for me.  </li>
            <li> usually the type of hair cut i get is about a 3 with tapering the sides and back along with a clean lining.</li>
            <li> if you can call it that), when you clip your hair because it&#x27;s not a very wide clipping blade, the hair will fall of the side.</li>
            <li> It shaped the burns up very well just like any other quality shape up tool.</li>
            <li> Not a single piece of hair fell from my head.    </li>
            <li> My old ones recently died so I ordered the same set as a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a good set of close cutting clippers.</li>
            <li> With my old one I could cut mine and my three boys hair all in one sitting, but with this I have to stop half way through one head just to let it cool down.</li>
            <li> I used these clippers for about 8 months and they do not have the same sharp outlining capabilities as when i first bought them, even when properly oiled and lubricated.</li>
            <li> There is a loud buzzing noise that makes it really hard and frustrating to have a good shave.</li>
            <li> And, apparently, I either received a totally different product or something&#x27;s changed drastically since these reviews were written.    </li>
            <li> : Not good at fading between bare blade and the 1/16.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: If someone told me another trimmer did do a better job between the bare blade and 1/16 in assisting with a fade, I would return this product for the other one...</li>
            <li> cuts so close though my first one died after a few times using it</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it gets a little hot after about 15-20 minutes continuous use</li>
            <li> It obviously gets a little bit hot after using it for a while</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real sharp when it comes down to it and highly precise.</li>
            <li> I used it for dry shaving and it doesn&#x27;t cut nearly close enough.</li>
            <li> I purchased the new model which has the same blades as the old model but the housing for the clippers now has a high gloss black down the middle.</li>
            <li> Those short lengths are usually hard to find on these bargain-priced models as most only go down to 1/4\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li> so I guess I&#x27;ll be looking at other brands for a new shaving machine.</li>
            <li> These clippers were very loud and not even sharp.</li>
            <li> I like to either keep my beard tight like a 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow or a little longer and this trimmer gives me the ability to do that better than any other trimmer i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> these trimmers seem to have enough power to do a full haircut but some how managed to get bogged down by the thickness of my hair and as a result only worked for outlining, to say these can do anymore than that is a stretch.</li>
            <li> I got sick of paying expensive prices for the good quality ones with 3+ blades and replacing them all the time, not to mention they cut so close that I would bleed and get more irritated.  </li>
            <li> one has NO dumb builtin batteries to die in a few months.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was disappointed, it is very loud, wish it was adjustable</li>
            <li> but it is noticable and worse than many other trimmers/clippers I have used.</li>
            <li> I get an extremely close cut...not quite razor close, but not to far off.</li>
            <li> should they die early or any other problems arise.</li>
            <li> My only concern is how long it would last, as this clipper vibrates quite a bit</li>
            <li> I bought this as a beard trimmer and was pretty bummed to find that my beard hair was apparently thick enough to stop the motor in it&#x27;s track.</li>
            <li> After 5 years of heavy usage it has finally die but only because I performed poor maintenance on it, otherwise I&#x27;m sure she would still be trimming.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black man who gets hair bumps frequently and simply enough, I don&#x27;t get them when I use this.  </li>
            <li> Easily cleaned and because of its small size it can be stored in a drawer on a shelf out of the reach of small children.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s hoping the new clippers last at least as long as my old one . .</li>
            <li> Does the job well enough for the cost, it only brings four attachments so the hair length cutting is limited, the wide T type blade is good for trimming and around the ear but not for the mustachio mouth area, not for the professional needing to use it a long time as the motor vibrates like heck and tires the hand after just a little while.   </li>
            <li> I usually follow the whole process by going over my face and neck with Tendskin to help avoid razor bumps and then thoroughly moisturize.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna make a long story short.</li>
            <li> and they do what they are supposed to as long as they are adjusted properly.  </li>
            <li> so hopefully it will last just as long.</li>
            <li> And the power cord is a little on the short side; but that&#x27;s easily fixed with an extension cord.      </li>
            <li> It suits the purpose of purchase which is a low cost dry shaver for the beard and head.</li>
            <li> Blade came loose after a week and has never been the same after resetting.</li>
            <li> It was a hard time trying to figure out which trimmer to get since there was so much out there</li>
            <li> I always spent money on those cheap clippers you buy at your local drug store or at walmart and always was so upset with the way the left little hairs behind</li>
            <li> The hair cutting capacity was extremely good and it took very little time to master the clippers.</li>
            <li> Love for cutting my clientele hair</li>
            <li> I have owned many clippers since I started cutting my hair myself about 14 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Friends would ask me which barbar to and would be shocked after knowing I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> Not because my first one is no good anymore, but because I wanted to give this as a gift to a friend.</li>
            <li> The bag it comes with is useless and incredibly cheap.</li>
            <li> They could&#x27;ve built in a longer and more durable industrial chord, but I give it a 5th star for cutting results.</li>
            <li> Blade seems a bit crooked, but works as expected</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this only happens when it hits a rough patch of head hair, not arm hair and body hair etc.</li>
            <li> it saves you time and $ in the long run.</li>
            <li> But those concerns are minor.</li>
            <li> I found with time and experience, I didn&#x27;t have to keep running them as long to get the cuts I was after, and now there&#x27;s no issue with the blades getting hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had minimal irritation with this and minimal stubble left over (almost not enough).</li>
            <li> I should have just spent $15 extra to get the gray ones</li>
            <li> I had some of these a few years ago before I started buying the professional grade</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am white but always have had problems with ingrown hairs and could never really shave without having issues</li>
            <li> Plenty long cord.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I won&#x27;t be using it for extended periods, however, because the noise and the vibration would be very annoying for the cutter and for whomever it&#x27;s used for a full haircut.  </li>
            <li> Even with regular oiling and cleaning, the clippers break down in short order.</li>
            <li> I hope to get at least the same use from the new one.</li>
            <li> The overall life span of these clippers is relatively short, less than a year.</li>
            <li> these clippers are garbage dont even take the hair off your face not only that the clippers you get are not the same as displayed stay away from fake reviews you can tell these people fake listen to what they say it gave me the most realistic shave  </li>
            <li> The power of the motor is extremely low, or weak, and the blades became dull very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Its sharp and very quiet.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is due to the location of the switch...</li>
            <li> Not even sharp enough as a headliner.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the other reviews on this product warning about the product&#x27;s short lifespan...</li>
            <li> I use it for dry  shave.</li>
            <li> We have owned them now a few months and the blades make a weird noise when the guard is on, and I have made sure it was on correctly.</li>
            <li> Only problem with making it real close is it can be irritating on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this machine for a few weeks now, and this is only the second machine I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> I got tired of cordless shavers because they would eventually just crap out and not hold a charge, so I have decided to stick with the best.</li>
            <li> I wanted the trimmer for beard trimming as I don&#x27;t like a bare face but prefer a little stubble.  </li>
            <li> The blade starts off really sharp and with regular use should last about 2 to 2 and a half years.</li>
            <li> The previous one we had had to be charged before each use and finally wouldn&#x27;t keep a charge.  </li>
            <li> I plugged it in and half way through the haircut it simply died and never turned on again.</li>
            <li> it is only meant to be slightly loosened and then retightened.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid, well-built and feels as if it will last forever; no more batteries or dust- and hair-collecting chargers.</li>
            <li> I am a black male who get razor bumps from shaving with razors.</li>
            <li> It feels like a solid trimmer, but it just wasn&#x27;t apparently targeted at particularly thick hair.</li>
            <li> I shave my head regularly but my old clipper had broken so it had gotten to maybe a quarter inch long.  </li>
            <li> Cord a little short.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want a wet razor look</li>
            <li> I like minimal scruff.</li>
            <li> I HAD  problems with razor bumps and tried a few different products.</li>
            <li> The blades got off center and I have tried to realign them with no luck.</li>
            <li> Feels heavy and solid.</li>
            <li> but there was really not much to shave.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as i expected.</li>
            <li> Was not what i expected</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s expected when using a liner, but I just spray some coolant in order to keep it to a manageable heat.</li>
            <li> I am in the military Honor Guard, and my wife has to cut my hair 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I finally figured out the secret, especially if you have curly facial hair.</li>
            <li> , remember to never use this with a wet beard, or with water at all, and always keep the blades oiled to prolong life.</li>
            <li> The transformer gives a different voltage output which it makes this irritating loud buzzing noise.</li>
            <li> Wow, this thing cuts through my thick beard like a pro.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this one, I tried to buy a cheaper one, the Andis Easy Cut 75360, and he hated it because it was not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> it is different then the picture, it doesn&#x27;t have the lines its just a matte black with a shiny black circle toward the andis</li>
            <li> The motor is very weak;  (2) The blades became dull very quick (even after trying to adjust them); and  (3)</li>
            <li> I am caucasian and have dark straight thin (width)</li>
            <li> and it never gets old, cuts ridiculously close, so you can use it as a razor basically</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this clipper for a long time, as I wanted a way to do a little maintenance in between haircuts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with ingrown hairs and slight bump problem my entire shaving career</li>
            <li> I can not get a  sharp line or a close cut.</li>
            <li> Sharp as the day I brought it.</li>
            <li> I would say, though, that unlike the t-liner, this clipper is deceptively sharp.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as sharp as the Andis styliner T</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other clipper brands other than Andis now.    </li>
            <li> blades are SHARP and will give you the super-close cut you want.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Compared with other clippers/ trimmers, this one is quite affordable.</li>
            <li> Also, regular face shaving electric razors don&#x27;t work at all usually for me unless it&#x27;s on my moustache area, otherwise they are shotty and leave patches of hair.  </li>
            <li> You could even shave your chest and other areas with it as well if you wanted to, although I haven&#x27;tdone</li>
            <li> When I say sharp</li>
            <li> Even though this product comes with attachments for cutting different lengths of hair (as well as a fairly close shave without the attachments), they don&#x27;t work for cutting hair if you want it longer than 1/2 inch.</li>
            <li> These can almost be used to replace razors depending on how sharp you have them set .  </li>
            <li> It gets really hot and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I have fewer razor bumps than I ever had before with other trimmers.</li>
            <li> I have used 2 other trimmers from Andis</li>
            <li> never again wil i buy any other clipper..</li>
            <li> Never jams, stays sharp, and durable.</li>
            <li> If you are not useto using sharp clippers...</li>
            <li> I have tried other trimmer and electric shavers and they never fully did the job.</li>
            <li> Deceptively sharp.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close cut without the irritation that comes with other sets.</li>
            <li> After passing up this gem of a product in Wal-Mart for the past 5 years, i finally broke down and bought it after i had to replace yet another rechargeable trimmer.  </li>
            <li> only problem is that you may need to buy another blade because the one that cine with these clippers are dull.</li>
            <li> ONLY ISSUE IS THAT THIS MODEL&#x27;S BLADE IS HARD TO FIND.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product but my old t-liners are still going strong.</li>
            <li> not worth it</li>
            <li> I take that back, at least the combs work.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t cut hair well.  </li>
            <li> This product does offer a close shave, but it&#x27;s going to be a bit rough when you feel it, not smooth like a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> Works very well for cutting hair and dry shaving from my experience.</li>
            <li> The only slight complaint I have is that it overheats after about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I breaks down after 4 month.</li>
            <li> This cuts my hair to bring it down some</li>
            <li> I like the hair on my throat to be cut down to the skin</li>
            <li> It will also help cut down on Razor bumps.</li>
            <li> its also a bit sharp to the skin, it cuts!</li>
            <li> VERY SHARP AND COMES WITH CLIPPER SET....</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave, very sharp clippers.  </li>
            <li> Since i got it I shave less and has less razor bumps.</li>
            <li> The headliner is just a cheaper version of the t liner, so its still the bang for less the buck.</li>
            <li> In less than 4 months the clippers died out and refused to work.</li>
            <li> I had these trimmers less than a year before they became unusable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased this item three times, with each replacement being less reliable than the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will irritate your skin less however I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> however i have one slight grievance.</li>
            <li> less  than  15  </li>
            <li> I have been shaving for half my life</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought clippers in the past costing more and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> These by design are for the black man.</li>
            <li> I keep it cleaned and oiled, but after 6+ months it really seems to lose its sharp cutting ability.</li>
            <li> had this for a little over half a year</li>
            <li> After a few cuts the main mechanics of the clippers will start to fail, and you will have to fiddle with tightening and loosening the blade so that it will vibrate.</li>
            <li> but they cut skin tight.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a little zipper bag to keep everything neat and together.</li>
            <li> wish it cut a little closer, but it cuts close already.</li>
            <li> I had never used the little brush to help my hair grow one way to reduce ingrown hairs or bumps</li>
            <li> but I have no idea where the little buggers are.</li>
            <li> The blade is really close, for close cutting.</li>
            <li> I will update my review after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> Do not buy it, it&#x27;s cheap crap even considering the price.</li>
            <li> I had this clipper set a few years ago in college.</li>
            <li> I opened the device and cleaned all the hairs that got trapped inside.</li>
            <li> My 2nd purchase was worse.</li>
            <li> Again I opened the device and cleaned the trapped hair.</li>
            <li> But after a few shaves, the machine stopped working altogether.</li>
            <li> you would think you shaved a few hours ago.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few months.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, definitely not a cheap feeling trimmer.</li>
            <li> new.after a few usage</li>
            <li> This was a bad experience for a first time owner of a andis product and i might not buy a andis product again.</li>
            <li> From there you can usually, touch your face up with just the electric for a few days and then go in with the clippers and shaver combo once or twice a week</li>
            <li> so I use this instead to leave a very little beard</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that it vibrates a bit much, thus  4 stars, but then again I&#x27;m done after 4 minutes so its not too bad.</li>
            <li> not sure if it lists the blade sizes in the description.  </li>
            <li> Small in hand, ergonomic.</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes and only having a quarter of my head done, and that with still random hairs still sticking out everywhere I gave up.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it worked just a couple of times and the next time I was going to use it, it would not cut my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked with in the past</li>
            <li> so i usually ignored them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more scheduling trips to the barber.  </li>
            <li> The small guard is the kicker for me.  </li>
            <li> and I feel liberated no more hours waiting in a crowded barbershop.</li>
            <li> But to add to the value of it, usual accessories found in hair cutting kit, but with one extra thing.</li>
            <li> After 6 years the blades on our Andis trimmer were dull.</li>
            <li> With the t-liner, you know immediately if you&#x27;ve pressed too hard.</li>
            <li> no matter how hard I try to get the chord to its maximum length...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Note, this is meant only for ultra close cutting.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hand numb after a short time.</li>
            <li> The blade is key, and both come with a T-blade which is the sharpest cutting.  </li>
            <li> Do not let the reviews that complain over the lack of sharpness lead you not to buy these, because all those negative reviewers had to do is adjust the sharpness to their desired likeness.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this product sucks.</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer as thick (quantity) as it</li>
            <li> Im hispanic with fairly thick hair.</li>
            <li> they mean CLOSE shaving.</li>
            <li> I mean I cannot even rate this thing because it stopped working immediately.</li>
            <li> Trims CLOSE to the skin and saves a lot of time if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I mean the sharpest trimmer I ever used, and with the tips it comes to help prevent razor bumps</li>
            <li> Yes, I mean to say that the blade will stop vibrating.</li>
            <li> It still works really well, which is shocking given that I shave my head &amp; beard approximately every other week.</li>
            <li> i was just spoiled with the previous set of clippers that now all others will fail.</li>
            <li> I also sanitize it with alcohol (heard it&#x27;s not good to do that</li>
            <li> This is not a good shaver to purchase.</li>
            <li> these clipper/trimmers were of no good use to me i would have returned them</li>
            <li> Not a good buy.</li>
            <li> and you would have to keep cutting and cutting just to get every little hair left behind..</li>
            <li> The head has long eclipse screw holes that causes the blade to shift every time during cut leaving you with a bad bay.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that I did not by this kit sooner!  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend these clippers for the following reasons:  (1)</li>
            <li> The weak power of battery powered trimmers pales in comparison to an AC trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I noticed it decreased the hair bumps.</li>
            <li> It is broken now.</li>
            <li> Worse trimmer ever.</li>
            <li> piece of crap didn&#x27;t work and was sent back</li>
            <li> false ads on this item.</li>
            <li> The cord was a small price to pay for max power cutting.  </li>
            <li> It is one step below horrible at cutting with attachments and it gets very very hot after about 5-10min.</li>
            <li> So do not buy this product no more if you don&#x27;t want to get mad like me.</li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> the power switch is in a terrible position, i repeatedly would hit the switch several times by accident and there is just no good way of holding them to avoid it.</li>
            <li> I got it out of the package and started cutting and it was very dull</li>
            <li> Got one use out of it, and then the thing was useless.  </li>
            <li> guess ill continue to go to the barber...</li>
            <li> When I was looking for a trimmer to buy, I knew about the expensive &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So I was walking around Vegas with a weird looking haircut all weekend.     </li>
            <li> Also, it seemed to me that the package had been opened before, which for a personal product like this is kinda disgusting.</li>
            <li> Sorry if that&#x27;s TMI</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inconvenient to have broken clippers and wait for a solution.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after moving i lost the charger for my norelco trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> its the worst piece of hardened plastic that you could possibly use...</li>
            <li> sorry for the review....</li>

            <li> These clippers gave me the closest hair cutting experience without the ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> There was no pinching or cutting the skin.</li>
            <li> They cut close and make hair cutting faster and easier.</li>
            <li> On the box, it say is the  closest cutting blade(of course</li>
            <li> It stopped cutting after 3 months.</li>
            <li> As stated before if you are looking for Clippers these are not designed for hair cutting.</li>
            <li> The scissors didnt come with it and the bag inside was dirty, showin how used it was.</li>
            <li> so you can hold it while you are on an awkward position</li>
            <li> PRICE TRASH!!!Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> i said in the above.&lt;br /&gt;i disliked having to do all this crap just to say it was good(amazon!!)</li>
            <li> Useless!</li>
            <li> Useless!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in the quality to say the least.</li>
            <li> also the price wasnt too bad.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I received a bad set.</li>
            <li> But what&#x27;s really bad is that I can&#x27;t get a replacement.</li>
            <li> it heated so bad and get you&#x27;re scalp burn.</li>
            <li> I was so Sick of shaving.</li>

            <li> Bought it for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday, still disappointed.</li>
            <li> One thing I find annoying is the placement of the switch.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I hate shaving</li>
            <li> and I smashed this crap on my driveway.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This item was shipped on time. it exceeded my expectation. I would recommend this item to anyone. It surely is satisfying. Since i got it I shave less and has less razor bumps. It is professional indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Again!</li>
            <li> I used it for dry shaving and it doesn&#x27;t cut nearly close enough. I should have sent it back...just haven&#x27;t had the time to do it.</li>
            <li> i ordered this for my husband for fathers day. he loves it. it gives a really nice and clean cut.</li>
            <li> This trimmer isn&#x27;t as sharp or strong as I expected from Andis. I can not get a  sharp line or a close cut. The blade leaves me with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow as opposed to a bald cut. I would have returned the product it if I had not used it and got hair in the blade.</li>
            <li> Used this twice since I received it.  Works fine but he blade gets pretty warm quickly.  this comes with guard sizes, 1/16\\&quot;, 1/8, 1/4, and 3/8; not sure if it lists the blade sizes in the description.  If you are a barber, it doesn&#x27;t have a hook on the cord.  Hopefully this is the end of ingrown hair on my neck.</li>
            <li> got this as a gift for my hubby. Works great, comes in a handy carrying case with accessories for different hair styles. Great gift at a great price.</li>
            <li> these baby&#x27;s give a nice close clean shave so long as you keep them oiled and clean. Love for cutting my clientele hair</li>
            <li> This gave me one of the most easiest shaves ever. I balded my head and didnt get cut not even once. And it looks like i cut my hair with a razor. It does exactly what it describes. For the price you cant beat this one.</li>
            <li> After 6 years the blades on our Andis trimmer were dull. (go figure) We bought this one to replace it. It cuts fine but becomes hot after awhile. The old trimmer did not do this.</li>
            <li> Product came on time,works well and  met all my expectation.</li>
            <li> I received my Andis Hair Cutting Kit this morning and gave myself an overdue haircut. My efforts produced smiles and giggles from my wife and daughter, but my wife finished the job for me and everyone is pleased. I wish I had known that there are some helpful tips on haircutting at the Andis website. As has been mentioned the clipper runs hot. The cooling liquid that I ordered is being shipped from a different supplier and has not yet arrived. The reasonably priced LS2 is simple to operate and does the job well.</li>
            <li> the trimmer arrived yesterday and used it right away. when they say close shaving they mean CLOSE shaving. trims as close as a razor would. the only downside is the vibration. after about 30 seconds of use you hand will go numb and you risk messing up your shave. other than that this is an amazing trimmer for an amazing price.</li>
            <li> Blade seems a bit crooked, but works as expected</li>
            <li> Dude this Andis Trimmer came SUPER FAST like a day and a half fast! And I select standard free shipping. Its a sexy black finish and very solid and sturdy in hand, and comes with extras as described. But I&#x27;m giving the review on the shipping first which is 5 STARS, I have yet to try the trimmers yet. I will update my review after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> These clippers seem very high quality for the price. Works very well for cutting hair and dry shaving from my experience.</li>
            <li> This machine is what I have been looking for a loong time, Iwasso glad to find it and find it at a low price, but the machine works great love cutting my son and my own hair with it.</li>
            <li> Works perfect clean cuts.</li>
            <li> Cord a little short. I dropped it the first day and the 3/8 comb snaped off. I recieved another set of combs right away, no charge, from the company.  Service was great.  Seems to be working okay, strong motor, good for the price.</li>
            <li> Been using these clippers for a year to shave mustache and beard two to three times a week. I just keep them clean with clipper spray and oiled. Sharp as the day I brought it. Purchased these clippers after Andis t-outliner finally wore out after more than 8 years of use. Great clippers. [[ASIN:B0009XH6OG Andis 29775 Headliner Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> After passing up this gem of a product in Wal-Mart for the past 5 years, i finally broke down and bought it after i had to replace yet another rechargeable trimmer.  It&#x27;s safe to say I should have purchased it from the moment I saw it!  I&#x27;ve had it about 2 weeks now and have had nothing but outstanding results on my beard and neckline (I&#x27;m bald, so I use a Fusion on my head).  I no longer get irritated skin and the razor bumps on the back of my neck have all but vanished.  I was very surprised at how close it actually shaved me without causing any irritation whatsoever.  It definitely gets closer than the rechargeable trimmers that I am used to and has the power to easily work through my coarse beard hair.  My only disappointment is that I did not by this kit sooner!  I recommend this to anyone needing a good, close shave.  Use it as directed (oil, oil, oil) and you will not regret it.[[ASIN:B0009XH6OG Andis 29775 11-Piece Home Hair Cutting Kit]]</li>
            <li> Some parts looked a little cheap, but the cutter is tremendous for shaving off the fuzz on my balding husband&#x27;s head.  Works great for little detail areas, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Jesus!!! Where is Amazon support? I looked everywhere on the page and there is nowhere to find an E-mail or chat that I can contact directly. I have been a customer for a number of years. It&#x27;s been 11 months since I ordered this trimmer and only used it a couple times. The second time I used it, it fell off my table... three feet off the ground... well it never worked again. I could not believe a simple drop would make it unusable. I mean I cannot even rate this thing because it stopped working immediately. Amazon... it would be great if I can get a replacement. Perhaps I got a defective unit or something.</li>
            <li> Good quality, complete set.</li>
            <li> I breaks down after 4 month. this is my second. first one lasted for 11 month. Do not waste your money on it. not worth it</li>
            <li> I use the trimmer to shave, shape-up and/or shave my head.  It&#x27;s GREAT!  It is very comfortable - close cuts w/no nicks, cuts, or scratches. Excellent for the neck area (front&amp;back).  I use a different brand of clippers when I&#x27;m not bald but I can&#x27;t use them to shave or shape-up b/c the shave isn&#x27;t close, the blades hurt trying to get a close shave and I cut myself if I&#x27;m not careful.  My 1st set of Andis clippers broke after 5-6 yrs, but there&#x27;s no comparison - I had to go back to Andis.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah its an excelent produc, and also this people servise it was very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the machine work¬¥s very well..!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recomendate it in a 100%</li>
            <li> I purchased this clipper as a replacement to the traditional t-liner that has served me well for over fifteen years. So far, this new clipper set is proving itself to be every bit the measure of the t-liner, and then some. The included guides make trimming and shaping my \\&quot;Caesar\\&quot; and facial hair a one clipper affair. Smooth and quiet, I can trim my hair every other morning without waking my wife(truly a blessing in itself). I would say, though, that unlike the t-liner, this clipper is deceptively sharp. With the t-liner, you know immediately if you&#x27;ve pressed too hard. These, however, are so smooth, you don&#x27;t realize you&#x27;ve cut yourself until after the job is done. One thing I find annoying is the placement of the switch. You can accidently turn the clipper off in the middle of a trim or line up; not the end of the world. All in all, I find this clipper to be very satisfying.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, it had everything inside the box and all the equipment looked new. I adjusted the blade a little and the trimmers performed great. I will definately recommend this product to anyone looking a for a quality trimmer. Great price!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are great clippers.  They get you pretty close to bald, and they are inexpensive.  I shave my head once a week, and the first pair of these clippers I had lasted 4 years.  If I took care of them better I&#x27;m sure they would have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Work great. Last a good while when maintained properly.</li>
            <li> It suits the purpose of purchase which is a low cost dry shaver for the beard and head. However, if you want to use it for a shape up its not as effective. You might want to consider an Andis T-outliner for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I had a set of clippers just like these and they lasted for years.  I used them constantly for beard trimming and shaving.  They cut very close and they are very easy to use.  My old ones recently died so I ordered the same set as a replacement.  The price was very good, shipping was free and they arrived in two days.  Way to go Amazon.com.  You guys are the best!!</li>
            <li> This definitely helps speed up the trimming process.  Especially if you do any type of line-ups, its quick and precise.  One thing though, the trimmer does get warm after extended use (30mins) but nothing too serious.  Highly recommend this trimmer and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I just got these clippers in the mail today (august 13,2010) - I love them. The blade is really close, for close cutting. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Got very noise after second use.</li>
            <li> It is very good equipment</li>
            <li> Note, this is meant only for ultra close cutting.  The attachments don&#x27;t go beyond 3/8 inch length. The box makes that very clear, but I didn&#x27;t think that was very clear in the product description.</li>
            <li> It s a good product, you can get a good shave in dry, my only gripe it s the product get hot after a while, but its a good product.....</li>
            <li> i turned it on and there was nothing but noise noise noise. I dont know if it is the converter on the trimmer. I got another converter and its the same noise.</li>
            <li> This headliner cuts very well. I&#x27;ve tried outliners from Andis before and this one is very good. Still, I&#x27;d prefer an even closer cut.  I won&#x27;t say that you can use it to replace your shave, but you&#x27;ll look neat nonetheless.</li>
            <li> MYSELF:&lt;br /&gt;* I am caucasian and have dark straight thin (width) hair.&lt;br /&gt;* My hair is no longer as thick (quantity) as it was.&lt;br /&gt;* I have owned many clippers since I started cutting my hair myself about 14 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE CLIPPER:&lt;br /&gt;* I used the clipper without any guards 3 times on my hair and around 10 times on my beard before writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY EVALUATION:&lt;br /&gt;* Cuts hair extremely short. It&#x27;s been a while since I had such a nice clean short cut. In fact, I decided to use the clipper for my beard instead of shaving as it gives a nice 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;* Cuts very well.&lt;br /&gt;* No problem with overheating.&lt;br /&gt;* Small in hand, ergonomic. Feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;* I have owned more expensive clippers that did not perform as well. I am very satisfied with the product so far. Definitely recommend it. I will no longer buy hair clippers at the local store: these are more expensive and lesser quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 3 years later (aug 2014) I still use this clipper regularly. It&#x27;s as good and I&#x27;m as satisfied as the day I first used it. No cuts to my face and a fairly close shave. I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Just got this trimmer in the mail yesterday and put it right to work.  I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for close to 10 years now and this trimmer provides the tightest and fastest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Highly recommend, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a lot more power and is a much higher quality than any trimmer you could get for under $50 in a store.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  Got one use out of it, and then the thing was useless.  Awful product.  Do not buy it, it&#x27;s cheap crap even considering the price.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!! I have never owned a pair of these hair clippers, yet I have owned 100&#x27;s. These clippers gave me the closest hair cutting experience without the ingrown hairs and/or razor burn, yet shaves almost as close as a normal razor!! this product is awesome and i recommend this to anyone and everyone who needs to get a fresh fade!</li>
            <li> these clippers are garbage dont even take the hair off your face not only that the clippers you get are not the same as displayed stay away from fake reviews you can tell these people fake listen to what they say it gave me the most realistic shave  realistic? i look all over the country for these huh yeah whatever  you would think any one who cuts hair andis would take the hair off your face it doesnt the tblade will not even edge up this is good if you want short hair 1/16 1/8 1/4 3/6</li>
            <li> works perfect clean cut</li>
            <li> The trimmer works good for me.  I wanted the trimmer for beard trimming as I don&#x27;t like a bare face but prefer a little stubble.  I also have a wahl peanut which is very nice, but the advantage of this clipper is that you can adjust the blade but on the wahl peanut you cannot.  So you can adjust this one to almost a shave which you can&#x27;t do on the wahl.  Only problem with making it real close is it can be irritating on the skin. I don&#x27;t want a wet razor look so I use this instead to leave a very little beard so my face doesn&#x27;t look like a baby&#x27;s butt. Normally tho I just use the peanut unless I want a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Update 9/20/2015  Think mine is now needing a replacement, it lasted a good amount of years but even with oiling it and keeping it clean the blades get really loud then don&#x27;t cut until I turn it on and off a few times. Keep in mind this only happens when it hits a rough patch of head hair, not arm hair and body hair etc. Still great considering over 2 years of use, entire body shaves, head shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update! 5/23/2013 Still going strong by far the best shaver I have owned very fast and very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts so close though my first one died after a few times using it I still give it a 4. It&#x27;s cheap enough to buy it again the shaves are so close and fast it saves you time and $ in the long run. So far my 2nd one has lasted many shaves now great for bodybuilders or anyone who hates body hair and wants a very fast shave. I&#x27;ll keep this updated if this one dies I&#x27;ll drop it to a 3 since price to performance it&#x27;s excellent. Keep your receipt I returned mine so it cost me nothing for the replacement.</li>
            <li> These clippers/shavers work well. I use them to dry shave with and they cut pretty close with no irritation. One thing I must mention is that right out of the box, they dont cut that close. Atleast not close enough for me. They can be adjusted with a screw driver, good eyes and a steady hand! It might take you two or three times to get them just right so they dont feel like they are scratching you.</li>
            <li> My old hair clipper broke so I got this one because it was fairly cheap and had pretty good reviews.  As soon as I got it I put oil on it and started clipping.  On the very flat areas of my face it seemed to cut ok, but on any curve it did nothing.  I shave my head regularly but my old clipper had broken so it had gotten to maybe a quarter inch long.  I tried to trim it with this clipper.  I would go over the same spot over and over again and it would still be super patchy with little clumps of hair everywhere.  After 10 minutes and only having a quarter of my head done, and that with still random hairs still sticking out everywhere I gave up. I borrowed a friends shaver to finish. My old clipper could clean my whole head in 2 minutes flat and it would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is junk.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a relatively cheap hair trimmer, this is the one. I am usually very picky on these things and decided to take the chance with this. Works great. Trims CLOSE to the skin and saves a lot of time if you know what I mean. The only slight complaint I have is that it overheats after about 20 minutes. No big deal, works great!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this once and it works really well for what I bought it for (to shave my husband&#x27;s neck.)  The previous one we had had to be charged before each use and finally wouldn&#x27;t keep a charge.  This shaver eliminates that problem by having a cord and working while plugged in, no battery to worry about.</li>
            <li> I had this clipper set a few years ago in college. My clipper went out on me so I decided to purchase it again. I like it because you can cut your hair and line it up with the same clipper. It isn&#x27;t as sharp as the Andis styliner T but you can still get a fairly crisp, straight line. I also like this clipper set because it has a 1/16th guard. Most clipper sets in this price range only go down to 1/8. All in all, I like the set. Has a nice little pouch so you can carry it on the go...maybe a vacation or something.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair cutting kit for my fiance and he loves it! He has already saved 100 dollars since buying it in December because he hasn&#x27;t needed to go to the barber shop to get a hair cut. It is a very professional and durable piece of equipment! you will love owning this item! Also with the amazon prime I got the item literally 2 days before Christmas. I ordered it December 22 and got it by the 24th. Amazoon.com is very good with their delivery!</li>
            <li> I bought this to actually shave my cat with, but instead decided it would be put to better use to shave my face/cut my hair with (fancy that). Works great for these tasks!</li>
            <li> Looks solid and cut very low. Great for shaving. I have been using this device for over 2 years and still works great. My first one went out and Andis replaced it with no cost to me.</li>
            <li> so i bought this based on the reviews i saw...also the price wasnt too bad. Im hispanic with fairly thick hair. usually the type of hair cut i get is about a 3 with tapering the sides and back along with a clean lining. This cuts my hair to bring it down some but IT WONT LINE MY HAIR UP! i gues my hair is too think and wont do NOTHING TO IT! NOT EVEN A LIL BIT. unfortunetly my fiance threw away the packaging and shipping box otherwise i would of returned it. now im stuck with it...guess ill continue to go to the barber...</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005LCILF8 New Andis Company 11pc Headliner Shave Trim And Clip Kit Includes Headliner 4 Attachment Comb]]This product was priced higher than other like items. I thought it would be more reliable because it was a plug-in, rather than battery. Unfortunately, it worked just a couple of times and the next time I was going to use it, it would not cut my hair. Returned product. Going to use razor blades instead.</li>
            <li> very good product   good quality  light weight and easy to use     I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really great product I am more than satisfied by my buy it works really good, is really strong and it is small so you can take it with you and store it really easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buzzing my own hair for a dozen years or so now. I&#x27;m a white male in my early 30s with thin/ thinning hair on top. The in-and-out chain barbers do a terrible job, and if you want a good cut from a real barber, it&#x27;ll cost you more. So me, being cheap, I&#x27;ve gone through several of these cheaper clipper sets over the years - Remingtons, Wahls, Conairs, all without much success. Then I found this Andis set and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.        Well that was several years ago. I&#x27;ve been using my Andis since then without any problems. Just some clipper oil and brushing it out after each cut.     The only complaints I have are that it does get hot rather quickly, but you can buy the Cool Down spray for that (that stuff smells good; makes it smell like a real barbershop!) And the power cord is a little on the short side; but that&#x27;s easily fixed with an extension cord.      But those concerns are minor. This clipper is awesome at what it&#x27;s supposed to do - cut hair. I also love that it comes with a super-short 1/16\\&quot; &amp; 1/8\\&quot; guards (or at least mine did). Those short lengths are usually hard to find on these bargain-priced models as most only go down to 1/4\\&quot;.    Honestly I&#x27;ve REALLY got my money&#x27;s worth out of this clipper. I would absolutely buy this again. Actually I would probably spend more money and get a nicer Andis professional version, or a cordless version. Recommended - I&#x27;m an Andis man now.    --------------------------------    **Updated July 2010 - I was looking at my reviews and saw this from almost 2 years ago (and it was probably 2 years old at the time). I&#x27;m still using it today. It still works really well, which is shocking given that I shave my head &amp; beard approximately every other week. Same original blade for me; just some clipper oil before &amp; after every cut.     Also, surprisingly, the guards all still work and haven&#x27;t broken like some other cheaper brands I&#x27;ve had before. The motor on these clippers is fantastic. Easily one of the best value-purchases ever. Highly recommended. I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other clipper brands other than Andis now.    -----------------------------  ***Re-updated November 2010 - I dropped my original Andis on my tile floor from several feet, causing some damage to the original teeth/ clipper part. So I trudged back to the Wal Mart and bought a new Andis clipper for appx $30. This newer version feels ever-so-slightly cheaper in terms of materials. But I have basically the same comments as above. Heats up too quickly, short cord. But where it matters most, it still does a great job of cutting hair. For the money, these Andis clippers are one of the best things you can buy.</li>
            <li> Got the item in and I did not work. Pulled hair from the start. Attempted to lubricate and adjust to no avail.</li>
            <li> Compared to the silver Andis machine I have this is a nice substitute. Relatively much more lighter than the one I have. It still gets the job done though. The price too is great but if u want more weight and a edgier shape up go for the silver one. However be ready to pay $30 more. Overall it&#x27;s a great product for its price.</li>
            <li> its only the first cut but its definitely as close as an electric. The headliner is just a cheaper version of the t liner, so its still the bang for less the buck. it is different then the picture, it doesn&#x27;t have the lines its just a matte black with a shiny black circle toward the andis but it&#x27;s still the same hardware.</li>
            <li> The best value for the money in hair trimmers, as far as I can tell. I&#x27;ve had these for 2 years now, and they still run as good as when I first purchased them. When I was looking for a trimmer to buy, I knew about the expensive &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; T-Outliners, but I wasn&#x27;t ready to pay that much for trimmers just to do my hairline during my own haircuts. Luckily these were available, and I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are SHARP and will give you the super-close cut you want. At first I found them getting really hot after using them for a while, but I figured out later that it was mostly due to my inexperience with these types of electric trimmers - the more you keep them running, the hotter they will get. I found with time and experience, I didn&#x27;t have to keep running them as long to get the cuts I was after, and now there&#x27;s no issue with the blades getting hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a look, if you&#x27;re in the market for your first &amp;#34;line-up&amp;#34; trimmers. Haven&#x27;t found a better deal yet, and I don&#x27;t feel any need to upgrade to anything better (more expensive).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own line up for years now.  I used the Wahl clippers before I switched to Andis.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever choose another brand besides Andis.  These clippers get really close to the skin when doing a line up.  They even get close enough to cut skin so it&#x27;s important to not have a heavy hand when lining someone&#x27;s edge up.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the cord it came with.  The power cord tends to get tangles because it is a standard cord.  Most professional clippers have a rounded type cord that prevents it from getting tangled up.  Overall, great clippers!  Had them about 6 months now and still working great.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the glowing reviews. And, apparently, I either received a totally different product or something&#x27;s changed drastically since these reviews were written.    I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for almost 20 years. So I&#x27;m not a stranger to a good cut.    I put the guard I always use - 1/8\\&quot; - on the machine and tried to shave my head. Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Zip. It wouldn&#x27;t cut. Not a single piece of hair fell from my head.    I pulled out my old but faltering Wahl, turned it on and we were off to the races.     Maybe this product was defective. Or maybe it&#x27;s junk. I&#x27;m not sticking around to find out. I&#x27;m sending this back to Amazon pronto.    And if you&#x27;re in the market for a decent shaver, you might want to keep looking.</li>
            <li> Kelly-K of Shiftn Steel Sport Riderz says get those professional cuts like the barber in the comfort of your home</li>
            <li> I recanted my original post about the buzzing. The transformer gives a different voltage output which it makes this irritating loud buzzing noise. Other than that I am sure that they work great.</li>
            <li> I actually really like the way this cuts. It almost grooms your hair like a razor blade. This would be my 2nd purchase of this kit.    Concerns...  First time, the clippers died out on me mid cut, and I was in Las Vegas. Luckily, I packed my backup clippers but those do not cut nearly as short as the Andis. So I was walking around Vegas with a weird looking haircut all weekend.     I dont know what it is, the clippers just died and never worked again after that? I opened the device and cleaned all the hairs that got trapped inside. But it did not seem to fix the problem.    My 2nd purchase was worse. In less than 4 months the clippers died out and refused to work. Again I opened the device and cleaned the trapped hair. I also tried to look for any signs of damage or over heated parts. But everything looks fine.     I am not sure why it dies out and just doesn&#x27;t work so quickly?    Again I love these clippers, but for my 2nd purchase, they just don&#x27;t last long enough for me to really enjoy them.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0009XH6OG Andis 29775 Headliner Trimmer]]&lt;br /&gt;Recommended if you want to save money on going to the barber every so often.&lt;br /&gt;You can touch your hair up when necessary and do as you please.&lt;br /&gt;It works great, Andis products are well known. Very Good Buy!</li>
            <li> Great clippers for shaving your face and head. I use it to do both and I must say that these clippers are the closest clippers to a razor that I have found. It makes a great razor alternative if your skin is to sensitive for razors, which mine is. I purchased the new model which has the same blades as the old model but the housing for the clippers now has a high gloss black down the middle. Again great product. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a good set of close cutting clippers.</li>
            <li> I use this for the hair on my head and the hair on my face. Works GREAT. Professional-level quality indeed.</li>
            <li> the description said it came with a 1/2 inch adapter but it only went up to 3/8ths.  Other than that, it didn&#x27;t pull or snag my hair and was done shaving my head in 10 min.</li>
            <li> It makes my hand numb after a short time. Otherwise it works fine.  Also, it seemed to me that the package had been opened before, which for a personal product like this is kinda disgusting. I just received another product from amazon (a notebook cooler) and that one was definitely opened beforehand! What is happening with amazon? One more opened product and I am done with amazon.</li>
            <li> So I was looking for something to shave my face with. I do not razor shave because of irritation and haven&#x27;t clean shaved for a many years. I have tried many beard trimmers and usually would shave with the pop up shaver on electric shavers. I like minimal scruff. I have found so many that leave too much and I end up shaving a day or two later again. This Andis 29775 is where it is at. This will make your face look like you shaved with a razor 8 hours ago. I had minimal irritation with this and minimal stubble left over (almost not enough). I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. It shaped the burns up very well just like any other quality shape up tool. It feels like a high quality trimmer and even though many wont use this for shaving their face, I found it to be perfect for my needs. Buy this thing already!</li>
            <li> A good product to have.  Save you lots of money as you don&#x27;t need to visit the barber as often as you normally would have.  The cut is good and looks like when it&#x27;s professionally done.</li>
            <li> great little trimmer,cord is a little short for me. but a great value shipped really quick ,i would suggest to buy it</li>
            <li> These are some very good clippers. I get an extremely close cut...not quite razor close, but not to far off. I use them primarily to cut my hair (I am a 40+ yr old male), while my son uses them as trimmers to taper and edge. They are equally good in all aspects.</li>
            <li> Love it. I use it for my 2 sons hair. There hair cuts always look professional when I do it.</li>
            <li> THis is the trimmer I was looking for! has clip sizes Smaller than 1&#x27; it has 3/8, 1/8, 1/16 and one more bigger one. This is perfect for those looking to line themselves up, or looking for a shape-up in between haircuts. This is perfect for Blowouts or fades also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your like me and get haircuts and shape ups every few weeks, this is perfect for those inbetween time. Reason it doesn&#x27;t get my 5 star rating is because after a month or so it shuts off, so you need to get a screw driver and open the blades to clean the hair out of the machines. First few times it was a pain in the butt because I couldn&#x27;t find a screw driver that fit. But as far as cutting quality, it is the best!</li>
            <li> This item works really good but shaking little more and sound loud a bit but doing job and for this price it&#x27;s really  good and  not so heavy you can wear with you anywhere very comfortable.</li>
            <li> These T clippers are pretty nice.  They trim up facial hair perfectly.  They also work good for trimming up short hair.  They get close but not close as a real facial razer.  If your trimming up, or looking for a pretty short cut with out having to worry about razer burn these are the T trimmer for you!  They do shake pretty hard just fyi, its not terrible to the extent they cant be used but it is noticable and worse than many other trimmers/clippers I have used.</li>
            <li> Does the job well enough for the cost, it only brings four attachments so the hair length cutting is limited, the wide T type blade is good for trimming and around the ear but not for the mustachio mouth area, not for the professional needing to use it a long time as the motor vibrates like heck and tires the hand after just a little while.   Man I wish my old lady could shake like this... Did I tell ya that it shakes!</li>
            <li> I was so Sick of shaving. Irritation of shaving cream,dry skin, rashes. This product is a revolution you get close shaving feel without hassles. Must buy for everyone who shaves.</li>
            <li> When I first got this I would have rated it 5 stars. It gets really close, really easy to clean and was a bargain. It broke after about 6 months. It&#x27;s not the blade either, the motor seems to have lost the power to move the blade. I am going to try and order the professional model and am going to return this one.</li>
            <li> After a year for the second time mine quit working again..been two so far that quit around the same time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last 3 months and I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer. I get a very close shave, and no razor bumpors. I&#x27;m Afircan American and my beard is coarse and curly, sometimes with many razor this can lead to ingrown  hair problems. I highly recommend this, because it&#x27;s a much close shave than the typical elctric razors by brands such as Braun and Norelic. It&#x27;s very cheap and the only maintainence is clipper oil. I cam across these because the only time I would get a great shave was at the barber. When he used clippers on me I&#x27;ve never had any problems with ingrown hair, therefore I decided to own my own pair of clippers. I&#x27;m very pleased with with product and highly recommended as a very effective and affordable method for shaving and trimming.</li>
            <li> They barely work. After 5 minutes of use they started to stall and the blade stopped moving had to shake it and pat it just to get it to work properly. they don&#x27;t seem powerful enough to cut a head of hair. Have decided to stick to using them at liners instead.</li>
            <li> Compared with other clippers/ trimmers, this one is quite affordable. My only concern is how long it would last, as this clipper vibrates quite a bit</li>
            <li> Have tried a few Andis products and this by far has given me the best and closest shave utilizing hair clippers.  Great product and good buy.  Easy to clean and handles great.</li>
            <li> The first time i purchased this item it stopped working after only one use! I contacted amazon and applied for an exchange, the new trimmer came even before i sent the old one back! , the new trimmer (same model) works great! Highly recommeded for simple all around cuts!</li>
            <li> i am a baldie and i do not need a razor anymore- this trimmer is as close as i need, very close! i would definately recommend this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this machine for a few weeks now, and this is only the second machine I&#x27;ve ever bought. There is a loud buzzing noise that makes it really hard and frustrating to have a good shave. I thought this was normal considering the price of the product. But after a few shaves, the machine stopped working altogether. I guess it was defective...so I guess I&#x27;ll be looking at other brands for a new shaving machine. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the quality to say the least.</li>
            <li> I HAD  problems with razor bumps and tried a few different products. I have been using Anids now for a over a year and i can tell you my razor bump problems are history.    Like some reviewrs have posted, the unit does get a bit hot, but i prefer the unit to get hot and still deliver a great close shave, than those other products that dont get hot and have razor bumps to deal with afterward.   This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I had a stylist who did my hair cut using this machine and I liked it so much that I went and bought for my house. I use it in-between hair cuts. Its very smooth and cuts everything off on the first shot.-[[ASIN:B000143C0K Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> doesnt cut. I got it out of the package and started cutting and it was very dull it would be much wiser to save 25 more dollars and buy an updated brand</li>
            <li> These clippers are great I tried them out as soon as they arrived on my doorstep. they come with length attachments 3/8, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16. It is advertised as a trimmer and shaver (which it does a great job), but they also allow you to cut the top. They are great/made for ceasers and close cuts. They line/edge perfectly and fit great in your hand. It also comes with a little zipper bag to keep everything neat and together. It DOESN&#x27;T feel real light and cheap either. I recommend this product to anyone. I cut my hair often about once a week, I will comeback and leave a update if anything changes.</li>
            <li> I buzz my head frequently to keep my hair short. In my profession it is easier to have short hair. I&#x27;ve only used the clippers twice and they go through my hair like a hot knife in butter! I would only get these clippers if you want really short hair without having to shave! Great for sensitive areas! I would not buy this if your looking for a complete hair cut kit. The different size guards will leave your hair short- I don&#x27;t think the biggest guard is more than a #2...? VERY CLOSE CUT- all I have to say!</li>
            <li> The electric shaver seems to work fine.  However, it did have hairs stuck in it when we received it.  Could it be used or refurb.?  We will see how it works in the coming weeks</li>
            <li> This product pays for itself. I was a full not to buy a good hair cutter before. Remember to buy a good hair cutter. And it will pay for itself. I shave my beard and my head. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and bought this instead of an electric razor because I get rashes if I shave too closely. Wow, this thing cuts through my thick beard like a pro. It&#x27;s actually a pretty close shave! I like the hair on my throat to be cut down to the skin so I actually use the inexpensive Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver push-up trimmers for that. I also love that the different sized guards that come with this allow me to trim body hair, my beard, side burns...it&#x27;s awesome! Sorry if that&#x27;s TMI but the guys out there need to know that this thing is far more practical, especially for the money, than a beard trimmer or even a much more expensive electric razor if you don&#x27;t like a really close shave.</li>
            <li> these clippers are awesome.. way better than my old ones (remington).. this one is light weight, cuts close, doesn&#x27;t heat up, comes in any easy to store bag that isn&#x27;t bulky and you won&#x27;t need to keep scraping your head to catch every last strand of hair because this catches it in the first couple of runs..   only downside (if you can call it that), when you clip your hair because it&#x27;s not a very wide clipping blade, the hair will fall of the side. in my old one, the hair used to collect on top of the blade. ]</li>
            <li> This product worked well for 6you months then stopped. It worked well during its good days. The blades got off center and I have tried to realign them with no luck.</li>
            <li> ii ave been looking for a good linen-er for a while and really only got the because it was Andis but it is very good. its not the sharpest but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the quality. They seem to be for professionals. The cut is very close and smooth. There was no pinching or cutting the skin. I would classify them as trimmers and close cut clippers.</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers on 1 March 2012 for many reasons, one being the reputation that Andis has, one being my barber recommended it, and one being friends that regularly use it recommended it.  The clippers worked great everytime I used them, I kept them clean, never dropped it, treated it like a limited edition hall of fame baseball card... And here I am not even two months into it and the clippers have suddenly stopped working in the middle of trimming session. I&#x27;m hoping Andis will honor their warranty and fix/replace the clippers.  These clippers do a great job of shaping up beard, necklines, etc, everything it advertises, just wish they lasted longer than two months!  It&#x27;s inconvenient to have broken clippers and wait for a solution.</li>
            <li> The clippers get a little hot after using for a length of time, other than that , a good product!</li>
            <li> I love  this trimmer. I purchase it for the second time. I now have 2.  Its sharp and very quiet.  I use it for dry  shave. My ingrown hair are gone.</li>
            <li> I had these trimmers less than a year before they became unusable.  Prior to that they were ok, and I mean just ok. The power of the motor is extremely low, or weak, and the blades became dull very quickly.  So much so, I would have to stroke the same area two or three time before I got the desired cut. I tried adjusting the blades but that didn&#x27;t help.  I would not recommend these clippers for the following reasons:  (1) The motor is very weak;  (2) The blades became dull very quick (even after trying to adjust them); and  (3) The overall life span of these clippers is relatively short, less than a year.</li>
            <li> Works great! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great item.Fast shipping. this thing is amazing. worth every penny, would buy it again in a haertbeat</li>
            <li> This is a great set of electric clippers -- for between two and six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased this item three times, with each replacement being less reliable than the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first blush, the clippers seem too good to be true. They&#x27;re cheap (though not as cheap as they used to be) and they cut through hair like a hot knife through butter. But they are too good to be true. Many reviewers note that the clippers run hot. This is no joke. Even with the initial high functionality of the Andis, its overall performance is marred by the fact that the body of the clippers runs extremely hot after 10+ minutes of use. The heat generated within the device brings the plastic housing to such a high temperature that one must hold it strategically (by the fingertips in alternating locations) in order to avoid self-inflicted burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you manage to work around the heat issue, by either working quickly or by taking breaks to allow the machine to cool down, there is the additional issue of durability. Even with regular oiling and cleaning, the clippers break down in short order. I have not had a set last for longer than six months, the most recent one surviving only two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, with the most recent 40% increase in price (from $24 to $34), I can no longer justify this as a \\&quot;value\\&quot; purchase. Incidentally, the alleged 29% savings on this product (as of June 19, 2012) is questionable at best. This set of clippers hasn&#x27;t had a \\&quot;List Price\\&quot; near fifty dollars in years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I hate shaving and I was hoping this trimmer would give me a close enough \\&quot;shave\\&quot;, IT DOES. It gets real close and my face looks like a shave less-than-a-day-old. I don&#x27;t like the fact that it vibrates a bit much, thus  4 stars, but then again I&#x27;m done after 4 minutes so its not too bad. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> very quiet, this trimmer does exactly what you need it to do, I like to shave designs into hair, and these work fabulous , no cutting of the skin, quiet, and easily takes out that line when trying to fade. just like anything else, as long as you take care of this item and keep it oield and clean, it will last you a long time!! and this product ships faster than jimmy johns!! for sure!! thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> Bought these clippers because my husband has gone through 2 clippers in 2 years. He was interested in this brand and of course it was priced best on Amazon. Bought it 2 weeks ago and he seems extremely excited about it and is still enjoying it. I noticed it decreased the hair bumps.</li>
            <li> nice clippers and blades its all around a good quality product for the price i also like the light weight and style of the clipper.</li>
            <li> buy this because I can not spend my razor and this worked very well to keep the beauty of the face without irritation controlled</li>
            <li> What a disappointed product I have bought. I just used only four times. It is broken now. So do not buy this product no more if you don&#x27;t want to get mad like me.</li>
            <li> I got this at Wal-Mart for 30 bucks. I&#x27;ve been very happy with this clipper. I shave with it and don&#x27;t get bumps. I give myself haircuts and line myself up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it cut a little closer, but it cuts close already. For thirty bucks, this is awesome.</li>
            <li> Got this since it is a corded shaver...wanted the barbershop experience.  Has more then enough accessories and attachments. Feels heavy and solid.</li>
            <li> I use these to line up my own facial hair and they have not let me down. Keep them clean and they will keep you clean.</li>
            <li> Hubby absolutely loves this Andis! I even use it to trim my neck when I wear my short do! It has paid for itself a hundred times over! My husband now cuts his own hair, and it also has attachments for him to cut his beard and trim his mustache. It was a great investment! It also has minimized his razor bumps on his face and has eliminated them altogether from his neck! It is A GREAT Buy!</li>
            <li> The trimmers are perfect and they are great for the price. I thougt about the more expensive, but I am glad I got these first.</li>
            <li> The Andis cutting tool is the best hair liner I have ever bought. I have used other brands before, but compared to the Andis are like cheap knockoffs . Andis is the best!</li>
            <li> This product shipped fast. The Clippers do a great job. They cut close and make hair cutting faster and easier.</li>
            <li> Cheaply built and not at all sharp. Not what i expect from Andis</li>
            <li> Its a really nice trimer at Grate price.&lt;br /&gt;i use it to do line up on my self work really nice.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  After 5 years of heavy usage it has finally die but only because I performed poor maintenance on it, otherwise I&#x27;m sure she would still be trimming.  Buying my replacement as I write this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black man who gets hair bumps frequently and simply enough, I don&#x27;t get them when I use this.  That said, I really think it could get a tad closer and still be effective but believe me thats not really a complaint.</li>
            <li> i realy love the clippers they work like the gray ones that they use at the barber you will no belive how good these are and lower cost check them out youll like to thank me i wish i could tell everyone who needs edgers these are the ones and cheaper</li>
            <li> I love this clipper! It&#x27;s a clipper so its going to make noise and with any powerful clipper, it&#x27;s going to get hotter as time goes by and YOU MUST learn how to use it unless you already know. The right and left edges of the clipper work best for lining up!!! The guards are there for use but I have a separate pair of clippers that I use for  fading and such. Personally all I use them (Headliners) for is balding, beard/mustache and lining. If you are buying these or any new type of clipper for the first time, research on how to use them(youtube).</li>
            <li> I am a Stylist and I know the Andis well. Have a friend who has it and needed a product that would cut closely to finish my hairstyles off nicely. So worth the money and delivers well. only downfall&lt; like all Andis I&#x27;ve worked with in the past it gets really hot to the touch after about 5 minutes of running :/. but my cuts look perfecto.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great for those who have short hair but still care for it. Cuts sharp lines and is very easy to control. The only drawback is that it heats up very quickly, but this won&#x27;t happen if you are just tightening your hairline. Excellent value for $28, and it comes with a 5 year warranty.  I don&#x27;t think you can find such quality for the low price anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Works great. Will definitely recommend o others and will buy again if needed. I&#x27;m running out of words just buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this clipper almost 5 years now and it still cuts my hair close and makes a great trimmer. Friends would ask me which barbar to and would be shocked after knowing I cut my own hair. Every now and again I would just open it and clean it with a towel and a brush. Apply the oil ready to go. I also sanitize it with alcohol (heard it&#x27;s not good to do that but oh well hasn&#x27;t shown any problems yet).</li>
            <li> Wonderful item... greatest price.</li>
            <li> I first came across Andis products from a friend of mine who cuts my hair.And I always said I had to get a good trimmer for my beard because every of other trimmer I had either didn&#x27;t cut my hair low enough or would cause razor bumps on my face.So I decide to take a leap of faith and try this one.On the box, it say is the  closest cutting blade(of course I seen that before),but I tried, it was a amazing cut.I was surprise how clean it left my face.SO it does what it says.But to add to the value of it, usual accessories found in hair cutting kit, but with one extra thing.The trimmer comes with information how to use it in different ways and also how to stop and eliminate razor bumps.I love it and highly recommended to anyone who has a problem with razor bumps or looking for the closest cut for shaping up, shaving or styling hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an Andis T-ouliner before (the more professional and powerful barbershop type of this one) and there isn&#x27;t too much different.  The blade is key, and both come with a T-blade which is the sharpest cutting.  I&#x27;ve had trouble with ingrown hairs and slight bump problem my entire shaving career and I haven&#x27;t used a manual razor in years.  I got sick of paying expensive prices for the good quality ones with 3+ blades and replacing them all the time, not to mention they cut so close that I would bleed and get more irritated.  Also, regular face shaving electric razors don&#x27;t work at all usually for me unless it&#x27;s on my moustache area, otherwise they are shotty and leave patches of hair.  My neck is the real problem when shaving, my hairs grow every which way, ingrown hairs, some bumps.  No matter what I use to shave, my neck is most irritated and with this product it&#x27;s no different.  This product does offer a close shave, but it&#x27;s going to be a bit rough when you feel it, not smooth like a manual razor.  It will irritate your skin less however I&#x27;ve found.  The best way is to probably use the smallest size guard and trim your hair, if you don&#x27;t mind a little stuble, it will most certaintly be the best way to stop any type of bump or skin irritation problem.  I had never used the little brush to help my hair grow one way to reduce ingrown hairs or bumps but I&#x27;ve started to and so far no effect has been seen but it&#x27;s too early to tell I guess.  Anyways, I think this is definitely a useful tool for the price, a quality product, and it beats paying the barber everytime you want to get trimmed up or shaved and it beats using wet and dirty and irritating manual razor shaving methods or ineffective electric razor methods, so it works best for me.  It&#x27;s also good for trimming up your neck and around your ears and even to shave your head as well, so yeah it comes in handy.  You could even shave your chest and other areas with it as well if you wanted to, although I haven&#x27;tdone that in some time. Hope this has helped and good luck shaving!</li>
            <li> I just received the trimmers today and used them on my nephew. They are definitely better than some of the cheaper ones i have used previously. The shape ups are really nice and clean using these trimmers, they give you a very nice close cut. The reason i didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is because they heat up pretty fast, but thats because i did use them for a full hair cut basically. If you are just looking for trimmers for shape ups, beards, and tapers then these are perfect. I will definitely be buying more Andis products in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this item in January. It works nicely and gives you a nice clean line. However, it no longer works. It stopped cutting after 3 months. Perhaps I received a bad set. But what&#x27;s really bad is that I can&#x27;t get a replacement. Not good!</li>
            <li> I love this little kit. Helps me stay groomed in between hair cuts. I like the quality and all the accessories for the price. Great value. This item was shipped fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my own head once a week with a Wahl contour for 8 years. During that time I had 3 boys that I also cut their hair using the 1/8 and 1/4 attachment. The motor finally pooped out so I looked online and ended up with this Andis. I&#x27;m gonna make a long story short. this thing is great if your never gonna use an attachment and your only gonna use it for 5min. It is one step below horrible at cutting with attachments and it gets very very hot after about 5-10min. I&#x27;m talking 3rd degree burn hot. With my old one I could cut mine and my three boys hair all in one sitting, but with this I have to stop half way through one head just to let it cool down. This is junk and I would throw it if it was still in one piece, but it burnt my hand for the last time yesterday and I smashed this crap on my driveway.</li>
            <li> ***update***&lt;br /&gt;So i had given this product 5 stars 5 months ago because it works so well. However this month it just stopped functioning so im reducing my rating to 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many African american males i&#x27;m prone to razor bumps after using a razor or the electric shaves with circular blades. My only options are foil shavers and trimmers such as this. For years I used a combination of a Remington foil shaver (the one with the tipple foil) and a cheap cordless norelco trimmer. Unfortunately after moving i lost the charger for my norelco trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set about searching for a replacement specifically looking for an andis product because i have the andis promotor for hair trimming and i&#x27;ve been very please with the performanance and build quality. I was concerned about getting a corded device for shaving, but one reviewer made a point about the lack of power in cordless units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i tried this the first time, for some reason i was unimpressed. I had just had a professional shave and i was eager to try it out but there was really not much to shave. I did give it a second chance when my beard grew out. The results were amazing. Suddenly I had a barbershop quality shave! I did not even have to go over it with the foil shaver. Then something else surprised me. I tried the snap on attachments to attempt to lighten my goatee, not only was this usable, but it looked great and was quite easy to do. I;ve tried snap on attachments before and they have never quite worked right so i usually ignored them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for people who cant use a razor. It does bother me that it is not cordless, but i can live with that</li>
            <li> Gets hot after 5 mins but it lasts once u keep cleaning it</li>
            <li> The cord was a small price to pay for max power cutting.  The weak power of battery powered trimmers pales in comparison to an AC trimmer.  Lots of attachments and I can even do a quick shave with just the bare trimmer right across my face and neck.  This beats all the other cordless ones I have owned, and some were fairly nice, and the price was better than some of the cordless as well.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s great at outlining but it heats up way fast and it gets very hot</li>
            <li> These clippers are great and they come in handy when you need a quick lining. I recommended this product to anyone that love keeping their haircut. only problem is that you may need to buy another blade because the one that cine with these clippers are dull.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver. The only problem is that there is not an attachment comb that cuts the mustache shorter than the supplied combs.</li>
            <li> just used this clipper and lines up the beard just like the barber shop not as good but with practice i am sure i can get pretty close</li>
            <li> These things gave out after literally 3 uses. I plugged it in and half way through the haircut it simply died and never turned on again.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this clipper for a long time, as I wanted a way to do a little maintenance in between haircuts. The T-Blade is perfect, and at this price it&#x27;s a a great buy. It cuts very close and is great for shaping up my beard, mustache and hair line. It may be cheaper than the silver Andis T-Blade, but it does a wonderful job. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shaver works well and cuts close and is the good value that I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted clippers for those in - between haircuts. These are perfect for touch-ups. It gives a very good line-up.</li>
            <li> the item is oil picture is for whole set with attachments. The title is correct but the item in picture and description.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, cuts real close, long power cord and power source, just what I needed to make nice, clean lines.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the best trimmers on the market that&#x27;s made for the home user. I bought this exact set from Walmart about 6 years ago it finally gave out about a month ago. I believe the only reason they went out then was because I modified a replacement blade that was not made for this model. Needless to say, the experience with these clippers were great. This machine uses the same style blade that the professional t-outliners use. If you keep your blades oiled, clean and adjust them regularly they will last along time without sacrificing the quality of the cut. I cut my own hair as well as other family members and was comfortable doing an entire cutdown and line up easily. The only con to these would be how hot they get after about 20 mins. of use. With that being said, this unit was clearly design to shape up trim edges and facial hair. So in my opinion to complain about that would be knit-picking.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the cut theses trimmers get you a good close shave with no guard and cut fairly even with the guard. As stated before if you are looking for Clippers these are not designed for hair cutting.</li>
            <li> It gives you a sharp shave for a cheap price. When I say sharp I mean the sharpest trimmer I ever used, and with the tips it comes to help prevent razor bumps made me love these trimmers</li>
            <li> These clippers were very loud and not even sharp. I could deal with the noise if they actually performed which they did not. I was very disappointed in this product but my old t-liners are still going strong.</li>
            <li> Been using this thing for years and it never gets old, cuts ridiculously close, so you can use it as a razor basically</li>
            <li> Blade came loose after a week and has never been the same after resetting.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He loves it and uses it all of the time.  It cuts very well &amp; really close.  I also use it occasionally &amp; have no complaints myself.</li>
            <li> These clippers work better than advertised. I oiled them before the first use and the preciseness in the cut was just as any barber I have ever got a shape up from. I was able to correct any uneven mistakes I may have made and was able to get it so close that there was no shadow for a couple of days. The guides were very sturdy as well. Evened my whole beard with ease. The carrying case is just ok but it gets the job done. Would recommend to anyone who likes to do their own shape-ups and have different beard styles they like to try</li>
            <li> ONLY ISSUE IS THAT THIS MODEL&#x27;S BLADE IS HARD TO FIND.  I HAD TO FIND ONE LIKE IT AND MAKE IT WORK.  GO TO THE STORE AND ASK WHICH ONE IS THE MOST POPULAR AND COME BACK AND BUY THAT ONE ONLINE.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase, my first one lasted about one year. I am not a barber, I only use it on myself for beard trimming and shaping. I think it works well out of the box although I did have to adjust the blades they were noticeably not even.  I keep it cleaned and oiled, but after 6+ months it really seems to lose its sharp cutting ability. I find that it gets clogged, needs to be taken apart to be clean and oiled quite frequently.  Not a bad trimmer for the money if you don&#x27;t mind taking it apart and cleaning/maintaining it.  I find myself looking for something new after about 6 months, because a routine beard trim has turned into a 45 minute cleaning disassembling job.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this!  No more scheduling trips to the barber.  His beard always looks neat and he does a good job trimming his hair as well.  He&#x27;s had it for a year and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> this is awesome. Very good for shapeups. If you want to save money by not going to the barber shop every 3 weeks just to get the same haircut, get this. This gives you the same $15 dollar haircut quality. This is a must buy</li>
            <li> The trimmers work well and they arrived fairly quick. Better value that buying one at the stores. They get very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> Only work for two minutes and stop working forever. Product just stopped turning on. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. I might not buy a andis product again.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with trimmer, performs as described,does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li> Love it. It works like a charm.  This product is highly recommended for anybody that is interested in it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great Product. My boyfriend loves it! . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> This was a birthday present for my male companion. He has used the Andis name brand for a long time and wants nothing else. This is the perfect product and brand name for black men. It cuts close and prevents hair bumps. He is totally satisfied. The product arrived on the date promised.</li>
            <li> This is not a good shaver to purchase. It has too much complications. Because of its design you will accidental turn off it every time when in use. The head has long eclipse screw holes that causes the blade to shift every time during cut leaving you with a bad bay.</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loved this product. It was just what he wanted in a trimmer. It works great and came on time.</li>
            <li> DOES EVERYTHING I NEED IT TO DO. VERY SHARP AND COMES WITH CLIPPER SET.... CANT ASK FOR ANYTHING BETTER AND THE PRICE WAS EXECELLENT</li>
            <li> These are great and get the job done when its time to get it done! These are great for a good price too</li>
            <li> Clippers get hot  too fast and cuts off in five minutes .. But they do cut well.. I should have just spent $15 extra to get the gray ones</li>
            <li> These clippers are great however i have one slight grievance. It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as i expected. i purchased these same clippers many years ago and they cut so close you would think you shaved a few hours ago. these however leave some stubble. the blades don&#x27;t quite match up level to cut real close. i tried to align them but no dice. dont get me wrong they still do a decent job. i was just spoiled with the previous set of clippers that now all others will fail. i would still recommend this.</li>
            <li> Even though this product comes with attachments for cutting different lengths of hair (as well as a fairly close shave without the attachments), they don&#x27;t work for cutting hair if you want it longer than 1/2 inch. I took my 30+ year-old American-made Wahl clippers apart and fixed them. Now I have what I realy need. I&#x27;ll keep the new Andis clippers for when I want to remove hair completely or almost completely. That is what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> Just received the clippers,, have used them twice.. They do just what I want them to do.. Great price, Great product..Received them fast and hassle free.. THANKS</li>
            <li> great product, a groomer every real man should have in their bathroom or locker. Cuts as close as a razor but eliminating razor bumps or ingrown hair. Easily cleaned and because of its small size it can be stored in a drawer on a shelf out of the reach of small children. Another great thing about this product is that it is not as easily heated as other brands!</li>
            <li> I never use a straight razor on my face because I breakout. This is a great option to get a super close shave. It also works great to outline a beard or trim your beard,it comes with different size length guards. I love it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> These are good but I&#x27;d suggest you pay $20 dollars more for a better version. It&#x27;s a nice shave.</li>
            <li> I bought these because this is the only brand I have ever seen used by barbers over the years.  I&#x27;m using these to maintain the shape of my goatee as well as trimming sideburns and haircut hair lines between haircuts.  Doing this is allowing me to stay well groomed the entire time between haircuts.  These can almost be used to replace razors depending on how sharp you have them set .  The clippers sharpness can be adjusted by removing the two screws on the metal plate and adjusting the screw on the inside of the plate.  Do not remove the screw on inside of the plate it is only meant to be slightly loosened and then retightened.  There are videos online that show you exactly how to preform this  Do not let the reviews that complain over the lack of sharpness lead you not to buy these, because all those negative reviewers had to do is adjust the sharpness to their desired likeness.  Don&#x27;t neglect to clean and maintain these properly, there are also videos online that show you exactly how to clean it as well as what is required to  clean the clippers.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t cut so well. my older one was better</li>
            <li> these clipper/trimmers were of no good use to me i would have returned them but I have no idea where the little buggers are.</li>
            <li> broke on me toooooo fast</li>
            <li> i  love  this  trimmer  and  it  get  real  close...it  takes  me  less  than  15  min  to  have  a  bald  head  with  this  trimmer  plus  i  do  my  goatee</li>
            <li> Just received these trimmers to day &amp; used them 5 minutes after opening package. One word sums it all up...EXCELLENT!! With these here, I will not be going to the barbershop every other week &amp; kicking out a lot of money to keep a clean &amp; neat shape up. The T-Blade trimmers are just perfect from angling all the way to precision cutting. Really all it takes is one swipe &amp; you have a perfect line for your face however you choose. Feels smooth and no irritation and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! PURCHASE THIS AND YOU WILL NOT EVER SET FOOT IN A BARBERSHOP AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> Great product...I&#x27;ve had a couple different trimmers but none like this Andis one and it&#x27;s GREAT. It&#x27;s T shaped Blake makes trimming in between haircuts very easy and cuts almost bald. This is my first Andis product but definitely won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li> Nice clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because I&#x27;ve had too many rechargeable clippers in the past that eventually lose the ability to hold a charge and become garbage.&lt;br /&gt;This one has NO dumb builtin batteries to die in a few months. You just plug it in and it runs - WHAT A NOVEL CONCEPT!&lt;br /&gt;Cuts VERY well and close. I use it to touch up the edges after clipping my own hair.  Also good for trimming hair just about anywhere - the blade is pretty gentle on the skin compared to others I&#x27;ve tried, but gets the job done well.&lt;br /&gt;Oh did I mention - it comes with a FIVE YEAR WARRANTY!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again, AMAZON!</li>
            <li> Used it once...and very impressed. Very close shave, but no skin burn like I would get with a straight razor (ouch). This is the closest shave I ever got from an electric or a cordless shaver. I got tired of cordless shavers because they would eventually just crap out and not hold a charge, so I have decided to stick with the best. These days, you can always find an adaptor to plug it into a car, so why bother selling yourself short with a cordless shaver? This product is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;It is now Jan 30, 2013, and this shaver is still going strong. It gets warm and always has, but it still cuts nice and for a guy who shaves his head and face...not bad. If you don&#x60;t apply the oil to the blades every so often, it will break. Period. Great product.</li>
            <li> For facial shaving, get the headliner shave and trim model.  I had that one for 10 years and replaced it with this one.  Both this one and the shave and trim give no razor bumps but the shave and trim gave a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a week.</li>
            <li> hubby ordered these for himself and he loves the trimmers.  he says its smooth and easy to handle.  enjoying his shaving now</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers to try them out.These clippers are great for outlining and shape ups for a while. I used these clippers for about 8 months and they do not have the same sharp outlining capabilities as when i first bought them, even when properly oiled and lubricated. For the price of these edgers you are better off purchasing the (Andis T-Outliner 04710). The T-Outliners never dull and are a lot more sturdy and comfortable to hold in your hand, professional barbers use them all the time.</li>
            <li> Worse trimmer ever. This trimmer makes so much noise that you need ear plugs to get your hair trimmed. It gets really hot and uncomfortable. Stopped working after a few months. Not a good buy.</li>
            <li> Was not what i expected</li>
            <li> I have owned many types of clippers but I keep coming back to Andis because they last. I had my previous pair for about 8 years and now have purchased this item and love it. No complaints they do what they are suppose to do and last for a while. Also like them because they cut without pulling your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this item mainly as a beard trimmer and neck cleaner-upper, so it will work fine for me. It&#x27;s solid, well-built and feels as if it will last forever; no more batteries or dust- and hair-collecting chargers. I&#x27;m glad I won&#x27;t be using it for extended periods, however, because the noise and the vibration would be very annoying for the cutter and for whomever it&#x27;s used for a full haircut.  If you&#x27;re accustomed to a battery-charged trimmer, you&#x27;ll have some work to do to get accustomed to working around an electrical cord, especially with out-maneuvering the cord to position the cutter just so to get the exact results you&#x27;re wanting. The manufacturer also advises you apply machine oil to the blades before, during, and after any extended use.    So...four stars for the quality and price, three stars because of the noise and vibration. If you&#x27;re older than fifty, it will remind you of the old-fashioned barbers&#x27; clippers: wicked effective hair cutting that sounds like a fan jet parking on your shoulder.</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave, very sharp clippers.  It was a good buy, even came with a strong carrying case for travel.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but these are worth a try. They cut very close and give a powerful cut. The only downside is they get very hot after a while.</li>
            <li> Great product, allows for a crisp line up, works better than all of the other products I have used in the past. So far this machine has held up and works even better once you keep it oiled, which will bring out the products full capabilities.</li>
            <li> PROS: THIS CLIPPER CUTS VERY CLOSE AND IS ALSO VERY COMFORTABLE.      CON: THESE CLIPPERS GET VERY HOT VERY QUICKLY.    THEY ARE DECENT FOR THE PRICE.    Rom 5:6  Christ died for us at a time when we were helpless and sinful.   Rom 5:7  No one is really willing to die for an honest person, though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person.   Rom 5:8  But God showed how much he loved us by having Christ die for us, even though we were sinful.</li>
            <li> The kit did exactly as it was advertized.  I have no complaint.  The hair cutting capacity was extremely good and it took very little time to master the clippers.</li>
            <li> piece of crap didn&#x27;t work and was sent back</li>
            <li> 1. They sent me a different model then picture.  2. After second time of using it, they stopped working. Wouldnt even turn on...  3. The scissors didnt come with it and the bag inside was dirty, showin how used it was.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was disappointed, it is very loud, wish it was adjustable and it got rusty after just one use. its also a bit sharp to the skin, it cuts!</li>
            <li> Does what&#x27;s needed without any cuts, or overheating situations. Recommended purchase, very useful for the price it is listed under.</li>
            <li> They get SUPER hot fast! We have owned them now a few months and the blades make a weird noise when the guard is on, and I have made sure it was on correctly. I oil them regularly, great for lines!</li>
            <li> Great pair of clippers.  Bought these on here over a year ago...and still use them daily.  Great for trimming beard.  Keep them clean and oiled up...they will last.</li>
            <li> Brought these as a replacement for the pair I already own for years because the power cord has a worn spot on them ...wires showing after about 8+ yrs&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these for shaving&lt;br /&gt;Line ups&lt;br /&gt;Etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know where I can find a replacement cord for my older pair on amazon??</li>
            <li> Great clippers does what there suppose to and for this great price there&#x27;s no room to say no.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, definitely not a cheap feeling trimmer. Pops when you turn it on just like when your at the barber. Clean lines, makes quick work of a beard cleanup.</li>
            <li> My Dad bought this product almost 2 years ago and it has been going strong since that day. It shaves pretty clean and I love the carry bag that came with it which makes it very portable for my overseas trips which I occasionally take. Whenever my friends are coming to visit me they always make an appointment for me to taper and line them. I love this Andis headliner and for the price point I will be buying another one next week just as a backup. My only issue is that it gets a little hot after about 15-20 minutes continuous use but it&#x27;s expected when using a liner, but I just spray some coolant in order to keep it to a manageable heat. So make sure to purchase the Andis Cool Care Plus which is a coolant, disinfectant, lubricant and cleaner, and rust preventative. trust me it will come in handy.</li>
            <li> This is my second pair.  The first pair lasted about 7 years with constant use.  I recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> Very reliable! Very inexpensive! Great to have!</li>
            <li> I bought this item with the intention to use it in Jamaica, I was in Maryland when I received it. I tried it and it worked fine but when I got home and tried to use it, it was noisy and it didn&#x27;t cut well.</li>
            <li> worked great the first few times. then the blades dulled. unless your using the shotty plastic hair guides, its a pretty rough cut near or on the face.</li>
            <li> These clippers are just not that sharp, which is pretty important for \\&quot;headliner\\&quot;.  If I could combine these with the Wahl edgers I have, which are too sharp, they would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I love these, this is actually the second set I bought. Not because my first one is no good anymore, but because I wanted to give this as a gift to a friend. These headliners are quality and i only give quality gifts. The first one is still running strong since 2011.</li>
            <li> I am a black male who get razor bumps from shaving with razors. I have fewer razor bumps than I ever had before with other trimmers. I have used 2 other trimmers from Andis and I think this one is the best one yet. I purchased the trimmer and they are the best pair I have ever used. I would strongly recommended for those like me that get razor bumps. Plus the price is low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this trimmer as replacement for my Andis outlinner II that broke (think this one&#x27;s me).  It cuts as sharp as the old one but doesn&#x27;t get warm up as quick so overall it&#x27;s a great trimmer that comes with a variety of attachments combs and the best of all the bear brush that help prevent ingrown hair (dry shaving).  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is due to the location of the switch...compared to the old one (located at the top), I&#x27;ve found myself turning it off accidentally.</li>
            <li> He thanks me all the time , this was a birthday gift for him &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&amp; if hes happy . i&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> I am in the military Honor Guard, and my wife has to cut my hair 2-3 times a week. We use a combination of the Andis cutter and Wahl Clip-n-Trim to cut my hair into the perfect fade. This clipper gets very close to the skin, and does a great job considering it is not commercial, and is very cheap. I tried using a blade to actually shave my head even closer, and noticed it does make much of a difference because this product already gets close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy with it. My only wish is that it had a better attachment beyond the 1/16 to help in the fade...like a 1/32... that is the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. It makes my wifes job harder in fading my hair because it doesn&#x27;t have a good intermediary between the 1/16 and just bare blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Cheap, reliable, works very well, gets close to the skin&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not good at fading between bare blade and the 1/16.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: If someone told me another trimmer did do a better job between the bare blade and 1/16 in assisting with a fade, I would return this product for the other one...but I have yet to find it. For now I will stick with this one, as it does work very well for everything else I need.</li>
            <li> Bought this clipper for my husband, he loves it. I love the bag it came in as all pieces can stay together and be kept in order. Great product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in December, 2010. I used it maybe three times, very moderately. Mostly for sideburns, getting around the ears, that sort of thing. Nothing intense. I plugged it in and turned it on summer of 2011 (just a matter of 6-8 months later) and... nothing. It is garbage. Buy something else that will last.</li>
            <li> I always spent money on those cheap clippers you buy at your local drug store or at walmart and always was so upset with the way the left little hairs behind and you would have to keep cutting and cutting just to get every little hair left behind.. With these clippers its soooo easy to cut and it leaves a nice a smooth and even cut with one pass maybe two.. i love them.. never again wil i buy any other clipper.. Nice and sturdy and durable feeling. does not feel cheap and great price!! worth every penny and more!!!</li>
            <li> This trimmer was recommended to me by a relative and I am very happy with it.  I am also pleased with the handy storage bag for the trimmer and accessories.</li>
            <li> Great pair of clippers. Never jams, stays sharp, and durable. I love the different trimming edges as well, they have come in handy quite a few times.</li>
            <li> This trimmer met all my expectations... it&#x27;s easy to use.. powerful.. and the on/off switch is very convienient when using it.. I have a beard that I like to get creative with.. and the om/off switch makes it easy to stop and check the progress of my latest design without worrying about messing it up because of a mistake handleing the trimmer!</li>
            <li> These use the same blades as the professional grade t-outliners and with any blade like this you have to adjust it.  I had some of these a few years ago before I started buying the professional grade and they do what they are supposed to as long as they are adjusted properly.  Recently I bought another pair just for dry shaving because I remember how good they worked for me.  I even would use my originals for a crispy line.  To me these are better for shaving than the professional grey outliners.  I don&#x27;t know why but they are.  The only issue I have is the cord does go out eventually as is the case with any corded trimmer/clipper rated for home use.  That is the reason I switched to pro-grade trimmers and clippers.</li>
            <li> I use this for really basic head trimming and have no complaints. It&#x27;s easy to handle and clean, and comes with a bunch of short guides.</li>
            <li> Ive owned a Fademaster but this is also a good addition to the lineup. Only issue I have, the clippers get hot after a certain period of time.  Great overall buy</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut my face hairs as close as I like....false ads on this item. Not a close shaver as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Useless! stopped working after 2 weeks. Not even sharp enough as a headliner. You are better off with a more costly headliner.</li>
            <li> This device was my best investment</li>
            <li> I totally praise the product itself cuts exactly like it should... but the CHORD... that&#x27;s another matter...its the worst piece of hardened plastic that you could possibly use...it needed to be flexible to some degree..... no matter how hard I try to get the chord to its maximum length... to no avail the plastic is so RIGID.. not a chance....This is my third Headliner...and my last...online... the other two had chords that were very user friendly..  sorry for the review....but you asked... perhaps your new batch wont use such cheap plastic...go back to what worked...</li>
            <li> If you are not useto using sharp clippers...you better practice first. The clippers dont cut or burn they work fabulous but they cut skin tight. they are very accurate!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these . Cheap and good . Cut smooth like a razor with irritation. Cord is cheap but that&#x27;s the only problem .</li>
            <li> great product for hair balding and very short cutting.... I totally  loved it and it worth every penny you pay for it...</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.  Great for trimming my stache, nose and ears hairs.  The small guard is the kicker for me.  Clipper does heat up a little, but it cuts great.</li>
            <li> If you are buying this to get a close shave and no razor bumps then this is the one! I have tried other trimmer and electric shavers and they never fully did the job. This thing is absolutely perfect. Definitely a great buy. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my head yet but I could only imagine it to be amazing. Quick, simple, and easy.</li>
            <li> Got this 2 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it seemed to be quality, but it does not perform reliably. Has stopped working several times. And finally died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> They are great all around,im an ex barber so im intuned with line-up clippers,they are not the sharpest as you would find in a barbershop</li>
            <li> After 5 years and many razor bumps later, with the advice of my barber; I decided to upgrade my electric razor to something that will not break out my skin and this baby does the job and costs alot less.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for half my life I&#x27;m 33 and these may be one of the best liners I have ever bought u must adjust the blades to get real close I do stand by this product .....</li>
            <li> Although it comes with a variety of cheap plastic snap-on attachments to do fades, buzz-cuts, and other super-short styles, I bought these to use only as balding clippers. The blade gets super-close to the skin for just the day-old stubble look I want. The noise, while a bit loud, was not uncomfortable, and pretty much what I expected. The unit is light and ergonomic in my hand.  It comes with a convenient case perfect for travel and storage. Overall, I am very pleased with this item.y attachments. I will be returning the Wahl and getting another Andis 29775 Headliner. Here&#x27;s hoping the new clippers last at least as long as my old one . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After receiving my new Andis, I have not noticed any decrease in quality. Will update my review should they die early or any other problems arise.</li>
            <li> Great purchase for a great price.  A bit loud and the power cord is a bit short, but not anything to be counted against the product.</li>
            <li> had this for a little over half a year and then it died.  It was great while it worked but then it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on today.  I should have paid attention to the other reviews on this product warning about the product&#x27;s short lifespan...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought clippers in the past costing more and was disappointed. These clippers don&#x27;t have the high level of material quality, but for the cost they can&#x27;t be beat. They do an excellent job.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a month&#x27;s use. Like twice a week. Bought it for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday, still disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am a firefighter and my job requires that we stay clean shaven. I can not use a razor. These help me stay clean between barber visits. They do heat up after being used for a while but they stay cool long enough to shave my face and touch up my mustache. I can not comment on the attachments because I don&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> I am able to have my wife cut my hair in our home as good as when she had to take me to the barber.</li>
            <li> This product is a huge improvement over my previous trimmer, a Conair. its compact, powerful and cuts clean. it also comes with a complete set of accessories.</li>
            <li> Package arrived exactly as advertised.  Besides making a strange buzzing sound, maybe because it&#x27;s new and needs a little oil,  I am free to be my own barber.  My hair trims look great and I feel liberated no more hours waiting in a crowded barbershop. My barber was surprised; he could not tell that I did it myself.</li>
            <li> my blade just started by: off out of nowhere and it&#x27;s only been 2 days</li>
            <li> To put it simply, the only thing that works well is the power cord that lets you turn the piece of garbage on. After a few cuts the main mechanics of the clippers will start to fail, and you will have to fiddle with tightening and loosening the blade so that it will vibrate. Yes, I mean to say that the blade will stop vibrating. I&#x27;ve never seen it in my life before but this trimmer is so poorly manufactured that while the motor will continue to run, the connecting rubber and plastic will no longer be able to vibrate the blade, meaning that it does not cut. Useless! Wait I take that back, at least the combs work.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this one, I tried to buy a cheaper one, the Andis Easy Cut 75360, and he hated it because it was not sharp enough. This one is perfect, he uses it to shave his head.</li>
            <li> trimmer is an absolute piece of garbage in terms of quality, for a few dollars more you can get some thing much better. the power switch is in a terrible position, i repeatedly would hit the switch several times by accident and there is just no good way of holding them to avoid it. they get hot, really hot with continuous use of more than a few minutes. so hot in fact they will burn you even with ample amounts of oil and too much oil you&#x27;ll get hair caught in the clipper, there is no middle ground. these trimmers seem to have enough power to do a full haircut but some how managed to get bogged down by the thickness of my hair and as a result only worked for outlining, to say these can do anymore than that is a stretch. i was really easy on this clipper too and yet after only 3 months and most likely around 20 uses the thing died on me during my morning cleanup. unacceptable from Andis. worth the money? NO!!! not even close.</li>
            <li> Good Clippers.  Deceptively sharp.  They are not as good as the t edgers, and I&#x27;ve found that it takes a little longer to achieve the same result as my professional trimmers.  Overall These are a good set for home use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day and he said this is the best trimmer he has ever used and is even better than the one his barber uses! He said it gets so close that you would almost think it is a regular blade razor.</li>
            <li> I have gone through many machines of this kind, however this one is more reliable and works better, after a while the machine&#x27;s noise elevated, I oiled and still the motor is making more noise than it should. over all so far it is doing a good job.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for almost 10 years now, and no other set is more balanced. It gives a close cut without the irritation that comes with other sets. Great for lining up beards, mustaches, and anything else.</li>
            <li> These by design are for the black man. But since I suffer from similiar neck bumps &amp; the related. This turned out to be perfect. Of course it&#x27;s not as close as a razor but that&#x27;s not what I wanted it for.&lt;br /&gt;Trims well around ears &amp; back of neck with practice, &amp; a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Very powerful motor as well.</li>
            <li> good dual use trimmer</li>
            <li> One star because it only lasted 3 months before the blade got rusty,&lt;br /&gt;I did not like the fact of having to buy another blade that is almost the same price of the whole trimmer&lt;br /&gt;i would not recommend to buy this because is a waist of money,</li>
            <li> Doesnt make sharp edges like the original.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit in Oct. &#x27;13 and that coincides with the last time I visited the barbershop ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole point of buying this was to save money and maintain a good, quality, groomed look. I believe the plan has worked. It does not trim as close as the barber&#x27;s clippers, but it does well enough for me. I use it to shape up my neck line, beard and moustache as well as use it with the clipper&#x27;s guard to cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this buy and I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not 5 stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it does hum a little, even though to me its no different than the sound I hear when I am in the barber&#x27;s chair. Oh, and it does get warm after a few minutes of use, but on both the sound and heating issues, I don&#x27;t let it run continuosly. Again, I use it to keep all my facial hair and what&#x27;s left on my head, trimmed, shaped and cut, I have no problems with sound or heat.</li>
            <li> Excellent kit at a great price. Closest shave in comparison to a razor.It obviously gets a little bit hot after using it for a while but besides that you can definitely expect a lot from this product.</li>
            <li> Cuts really close. I shave with this every day or two and it keeps me free of ingrown hair. Had the cordless Andis before but the battery was unreliable. This one works great. I recommend it and will buy it again to replace this one when it gets old.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as clean and pinches my skin when I use it in my travels. This is my 4 th Andis instrument over the years so I&#x27;m not used to this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long known that if you want a really smooth shave, there isn&#x27;t just one device that will do the job. Several years ago when I was in college I finally figured out the secret, especially if you have curly facial hair. I figured out that I needed a combination, an excellent pair of clippers and then an electric shaver to do the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched back then and came to the conclusion that Andis was the best option. I‚Äôve had this particular set for two years, but I‚Äôve been using these types of clippers for about 7 years. These work great for beard trimming and getting a nice smooth shave on your face. Its also great for doing your neck area. I recommend a dry shave and while these clippers alone will get you really close they won‚Äôt be enough. To truly finish off you perfect shave, you have to pair this with a nice electric razor. It really doesn‚Äôt matter whether you go with rotary or foil, it‚Äôs really preference. For years I had a $50 Rotary Noreleco but recently I bit the bullet and bought one of the nicer Braun‚Äôs, series 5. Once you got things as smooth as you can with the clippers, bring in the electric shaver to do the clean up duty. When you follow these clippers with an electric shaver on your face and neck, there‚Äôs no beating it. It will also help cut down on Razor bumps. I usually follow the whole process by going over my face and neck with Tendskin to help avoid razor bumps and then thoroughly moisturize. From there you can usually, touch your face up with just the electric for a few days and then go in with the clippers and shaver combo once or twice a week depending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are fairly quiet and quite light. The blade starts off really sharp and with regular use should last about 2 to 2 and a half years. After that you can look for replacement blades and just swap them out but I‚Äôm usually looking for the next great pair of clippers by that point so its on you if you want to upgrade or just put in new blades.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these clippers and pretty much the entire Andis line.r /&gt;I highly recommend these clippers and pretty much the entire Andis line.</li>
            <li> These trimmers work wonders. I have had them over a year and they still are in good shape, I do have to sharpen the blade, but I knew that. I would buy again and from the same seller.</li>
            <li> This product is great I recommend to any one looking for a pair of clippers. The product has a great prive n cant go wrong with it</li>
            <li> Just stopped working in the middle of a cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaned and oiled after every use. No drops or mistreatment. Product just stopped turning on.</li>
            <li> works fantastic, just make sure u order oil and keep it oiled well, just regular maintence youll have to do. The bag it comes with is useless and incredibly cheap.</li>
            <li> Does not trim perfectly as it was described. The quality of this product sucks. I will never buy this product, again.</li>
            <li> The secret to any great haircut is a good go-to clipper for detailing. Edging is quick, sharp and done in one stroke, no matter the location. This reduces burns, scars and drawing blood from retreading on line-ups. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the cheap short power chord.  They could&#x27;ve built in a longer and more durable industrial chord, but I give it a 5th star for cutting results.</li>
            <li> This is one of the the best clippers i&#x27;ve owned to get a close shave but i do not recommend this product because a couple of months after receiving this item, the motor stopped working in the middle of my shave. In order for me to finish i had to beat on the clippers to start the motor back up just for it to stop again a minute later. But after 15 minutes or so the clippers completely stops working. Theres not a problem with the wire, the wall outlet, or the blade of the clippers i checked all of that. This was a bad experience for a first time owner of a andis product and i might not buy a andis product again.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works just like my old pair</li>
            <li> This trimmer didnt cut it, LITERALLY! I used it maybe 2-3 times, and my old Andis, with its dull blade did a better job than this thing brand new!</li>
            <li> They started out pretty good. Then it got progressively noisier the more I used it. Even with the noise, the actual quality of the cut wasn&#x27;t diminished, though. The only problems is that it does get extremely hot after a short amount of use and it actually stopped working on me after owning it for about 7 months while cutting a friend&#x27;s and my own fair every 3 weeks or so. So you can do the math on how much use you&#x27;ll get out of it. Probably will be looking for a model that&#x27;ll last longer...</li>
            <li> These clippers worked great the first time used, however they become hot very quickly and the blades seems to be cheap.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer at walmart to try out,  shaving leaves me irritated and decided to get a real trimmer to replace those bead trimmers. this thing works great for getting a close shave without any irritation or razor bumps. you will of course not get as close as a razor, but you will get far closer then those highly advertized wireless beard trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t cut hair well.  If you have thick hair and want to use this to keep your hair short, you are better off using a proper hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, remember to never use this with a wet beard, or with water at all, and always keep the blades oiled to prolong life. You should also open it up and clean out the hairs after a while, you can realign the blades by pushing them into a mirror at a 90 degree angle.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product was good and it was just what I was looking for.  I also received the product in a short period of time.  I cannot use a razor for shaving so I use clippers.  These clippers gives me a very close shave.</li>
            <li> works good. Justwhat I needed</li>
            <li> I didnt mind paying $20 for a haircut once a month, but the waiting and then the time it took for a haircut was draining me. I decided its time to save that 20 bucks andtime. I had my own set of clipperd, but needed ssomething to shape up my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Andis Headliner because its a cheaper T-liner. I used another clipper to cut my hair but it wasnt a smooth cut. So I put the 1/8 guard and went over my head. It was smooth and made my waves stand out. I then put on the 1/16 and it cut away any stray stands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to do the chin strap facial hair. It looked like I came out of the barbershop. It gave me a shave on my face the same way a razor would without irritation.  For my hairline, I used a womens white eyeliner pencil to draw it out and cut outside of the outline. My hairline and chin line were both crisp. I even lined up the back of my ears with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good for the price. It took 15 mins to do what most barbers do in an hour and I did a better job. Great for lining up your hairline/styling your beard, great for a close shave, and great for trimming down your hair on your head/beard. Only thing is that it does get hot quick, but wasnt much of a problem.</li>
            <li> Trimmer cut excellent the only problem was I had to stop twice because of the motor running too hot</li>
            <li> I bought this as a beard trimmer and was pretty bummed to find that my beard hair was apparently thick enough to stop the motor in it&#x27;s track. It feels like a solid trimmer, but it just wasn&#x27;t apparently targeted at particularly thick hair.</li>
            <li> Great very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am white but always have had problems with ingrown hairs and could never really shave without having issues but this is great and gives a really close shave without causing any irritation.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t cut myself while manscaping so im a happy camper, it has a nice shape to it so you can hold it while you are on an awkward position</li>
            <li> Hi i brought this item for my dad for Christmas and the item stopped working.</li>
            <li> This Andis 29775 Headliner Trimmer was purchased because the andis T-Outliner was out of stock...I tried this product because i wanted to shave...and i only use liners to give me a close and smooth shave....i might not purchase it again...because it didn&#x27;t stay in service for 3 months...so I purchased another Andis T-Outliner when i received an email letting me know that the Andis T-outliner was in stock..</li>
            <li> .nice and really handy work good  for now..</li>
            <li> super efficient. leaves a very fine finish too and a close skin shave. it wont heat up on you in the short period it requires to shave or trim, especially if you switch it off when brushing/combing hair and not cutting</li>
            <li> I purchased these trimmers for my fianc√© and they have been great. He used them and when he purchased a new set, he passed them on to my son.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, I use it for my beard and goatee.  Andis the only trimmer I have found to give a really close shave.  I already have another andis trimmer but I got this one because in the store it was going for $40 but I was able to pick it up on amazon for $19.  Great to have in case I need a quick replacement.  If you need a close shave and can&#x27;t use straight razors like me, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> So Like Many other Andis Products I got, I didn&#x27;t have a trimmer or Professional outliners the Barbers be using to give that fresh smooth feeling shave after a visit, so I figure why not, looks like it&#x27;s worth a shot. Once it arrived this morning I instantly broke open the box, I made sure \\&quot;Not\\&quot; to shave till it gets here, just cuz, right!, and Instantly appeared in the mirror, after some Fine detailing,minor touch ups, and good looking results I can say they are worth the buy IF you don&#x27;t won&#x27;t the Blades too sharp and still gives that smooth Barber Feel when you slap on the alcohol... And This is coming From a Brotha. No offense...</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. First trimmer I&#x27;ve had and it&#x27;s great. It was a hard time trying to figure out which trimmer to get since there was so much out there but I&#x27;m glad I chose this one as my first one and I highly recommend this trimmer and the Andis brand to anyone. I had used razors that gave me razor bumps which really made me irate but after using this, the bumps don&#x27;t show as much as they would when I used the razors. It&#x27;s real sharp when it comes down to it and highly precise. Now I&#x27;m looking real G. ;-)</li>
            <li> I like to either keep my beard tight like a 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow or a little longer and this trimmer gives me the ability to do that better than any other trimmer i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I am a barber and I use a lot of machines. I truly bought these 1 for personal care and I don&#x27;t regret. It works awesome. I bought it 2 years ago and still working great</li>
            <li> Andis has always been my go to for clippers and these did not disappoint. Keep up the great work Andis!</li>
            <li> This clipper has performed admirably for years. i am very pleased.</li>
            <li> ONLY good in the beginning/new.after a few usage, it&#x27;s a piece of CRAP.ALso it heated so bad and get you&#x27;re scalp burn.SAVE you&#x27;re money and don&#x27;t buy this PRODUCT at all, I have tried a couple more of their product and they all ended up the same, OVER PRICE TRASH!!!Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This will be my second one of these.  I love the Andis trimmers. I use these almost daily for my stomach, chest, face and head so mine get a lot of use. My first one lasted me 5 years and its actually still working fine.  The only reason I bought another one is because I threw away the clip attachments on my first one and now I need them.  As far as I can see the quality looks the same as my original one so hopefully it will last just as long. I get razor bumps if I shave my neck with a standard razor and this cuts close enough to look like a shave and does not give me the irritation that standard razors do. Oil it like once a month and your good to go.  Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> Had this product for 3+ years now and still working perfectly!</li>
            <li> This product meets all my needs for a clean shaven head. It&#x27;s light enough to hold for a reasonable amount of time and the blades give good results. It is easy and convenient for travel....good product!</li>
            <li> works great.  Plenty long cord.  Use in on my bald head hair cut.  Much better than other regular clippers that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Great!  Now my man doesn&#x27;t have to coach his barbers on how he likes his beard trimmed.  That means $$$savings!!</li>
            <li> Love It...Great Price</li>
            <li> Andis puts out a great product its on par with what my barber uses. I have had an Andis trimmer in the past, it wore out after many years of good use I hope to get at least the same use from the new one. This product comes with all the the right tools and accessories. Very smooth operation cuts a very nice line! I&#x27;m very happy with the 29775 Headliner Trimmer.</li>
            <li> Este trimer es super comodo y util, en lo que tengo comprando via web es lo mejor hasta ahora ya tengo mucho tiempo con el y no me falla.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth for shaving my face.</li>
            <li> Will buy again. It does its job</li>
            <li> just as described and in great condion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like i said in the above.&lt;br /&gt;i disliked having to do all this crap just to say it was good(amazon!!)</li>
            <li> does what i bought it for gets pretty close&lt;br /&gt;close enough to do a decent shape up&lt;br /&gt;dont use any of the guards but the brush is handy for cleaning</li>
            <li> It broke in a week !!! POS !!!!</li>
            <li> I use this to cut my son&#x27;s and husband&#x27;s hair. They like it short and this makes that a breeze. Unlike the cheaper hair trimmers, this one has a lot of power and does a great job.  You don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same area over and over, it just cuts the hair.</li>
