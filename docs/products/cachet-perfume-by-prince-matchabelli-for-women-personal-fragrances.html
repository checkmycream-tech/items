            <li>/&gt;I am so glad I found it here</li>
            <li>When I find something I really really love and go to purchase more...</li>
            <li>buy more, and wear until I die.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on it every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Nothing more sexy or arousing than standing, sitting or even passing a man and not liking how they smell.</li>
            <li>I truly love your cologne.  </li>
            <li>Still love this scent after all these years</li>
            <li>Still, I love the fragrance and am enjoying using it.</li>
            <li>Like My Mom :3</li>
            <li>This has always been her favorite cologne</li>
            <li>I can no longer find this product in my area and am glad I can still get it online.</li>
            <li>I wish they would bring it back, it is a wonderful fragrance</li>
            <li>this is one of my favorite fragrances.  </li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite and has been for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I always get many compliments on it and don&#x27;t every want to change.  </li>
            <li>Have used this for more years than I care to remember.</li>
            <li>I have had so many compliments on this fragrance from both men and women.</li>
            <li>It is not overpowering I have sensitivities to many colognes; however, this one has never been a problem for me.</li>
            <li>I love this parfum.</li>
            <li>I was so excited!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited!  </li>
            <li>since this fragrance, which is her favorite, is discontinued she does not have the ability to get ahold of it easily.  </li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re one of the lucky ones whose chemistry mixes just right with it, you will have a beautiful and unique, one-of-a-kind fragrance for yourself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no longer available in many stores...</li>
            <li>Gave it as a gift, and the new GF liked it too!</li>
            <li>Such a good price!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not obnoxiously strong</li>
            <li>I use it sparingly because it is a bit strong.</li>
            <li>Even after all these years I frequently get comments from strangers about how pleasant my perfume smells.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to make another person&#x27;s day with something so simple.  </li>
            <li>GREAT except I did not get my cash back rewards from ebates.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of good old days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a very fresh scent</li>
            <li>The original recipe may exist and may be available somewhere, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>light and clean smell</li>
            <li>Not the original anyway.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne and have worn it since it first came out.</li>
            <li>Sweet but still light and clean, not overbearing.</li>
            <li>Really appreciate being able to get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I will definately be buying more plus when someone wants to know what to give me for my birthday, mother&#x27;s day, or any ossassion I will refer them here....</li>
            <li>I could not find this locally, so I was delighted that I could replenish my Cachet cologne.</li>
            <li>Well, I love Cachet so much that I jumped at that offer from my husband</li>
            <li>When the order arrived at my house, I couldn&#x27;t resist, I had to open both bottles and test to make sure they were the real Cachet and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>I love this cologne so much and have for years and years.  </li>
            <li>People notice, but it is a mild sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>Quick.</li>
            <li>Fantastic price, fast ship, secure packing.</li>
            <li>A lovely timeless classic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far darker and more amber than the original was.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the exact item I used to buy and cannot find anywhere!  </li>
            <li>Cachet is an oldie and a goodie, a light daytime fragrance that is very wearable.  </li>
            <li>She is a more mature lady</li>
            <li>that I smell like  field of fresh flowers.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is timeless and the price is right.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even look right.</li>
            <li>Most regular priced fragrances quickly smell like sewer water on my skin  -</li>
            <li>Thanks for quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I wore this back in the early &#x27;80&#x27;s and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks very much!</li>
            <li>The order was complete and accurate.</li>
            <li>Cachet is just about the only cologne I have ever been able to wear.</li>
            <li>It is a light scent, not heavy at all, and I always get compliments on the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for several years.</li>
            <li>Mostly from male friends.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Such a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>It really is &#x27;an oldie, but a goodie!&#x27;</li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend for Christmas last year and she really enjoyed the fragrance, so I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any local stores</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I always use the opportunity of a birthday, anniversary, or holiday to make sure she has a bottle of it on the dresser next to her jewelry box.</li>
            <li>I have used this perfume for fifty years and it still smells the very best on me and has not become too expensive to wear.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks a gain!</li>
            <li>Happy to have this and have purchased it before prices got ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and prices are very reasonable.</li>
            <li>so I pretty much gave up on ever finding it again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I will still be able to wear it since it&#x27;s almost impossible to find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>This is one of my sweethearts favorite fragrances really hard to find at retail stores she loves it thank you for having it available</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I must watch closely ,I don&#x27;t put too much on</li>
            <li>Cost is too high!  </li>
            <li>Have used this perfume for many years and it is getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li>Sent via UPS, a real PLUS.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves Cachet.  </li>
            <li>again and my husband thanks you too</li>
            <li>I turned to the internet,and much to my surprise</li>
            <li>Have used this for years and was beginning to panic as I couldn&#x27;t find at the local Walgreen&#x27;s, the last place in which I&#x27;d been able to locate it.  </li>
            <li>Last year I bought this elsewhere and paid a lot more for the same product.  </li>
            <li>have been wearing this cologne since I was in high school(40 yrs.</li>
            <li>, he says it reminds him of when we were in high school</li>
            <li>It is getting harder to fine.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>and if i did find it it was to expensive, but since i found it on amazon for a great price ( i bought 2 of them)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s exactly the same as when she used to wear it.</li>
            <li>The perfume color is way to dark, Instead of a light straw color.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Cachet since it first came on the market in the 70&#x27;s, and it is the only fragrance I wear.</li>
            <li>little too strong.</li>
            <li>This is the only place I can order my perfume at a decent price!  </li>
            <li>I have used Cachet for many years and it&#x27;s getting increasingly hard to find in retail locations.  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of an old girlfriend.</li>
            <li>I have used Cachet since the early 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my 80 year old mother.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells old,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy scent, and I always receive compliments.</li>
            <li>I spent just a tad over the $25 gift limit, but it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Not easy to find all year, appears ONLY around Christmas time, so I have to get a year&#x27;s supply, but I love it.</li>
            <li>All my other perfumes are much more expensive (my favorite is Coco Chanel), but I wear this one almost every day.</li>
            <li>If this version really is reformulated , it&#x27;s enough like the one I had in my twenties to bring back fond memories.</li>
            <li>Fabulous scent, so hard to find.</li>
            <li>In General</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about the perfume other than I grew up smelling it on my mom</li>

            <li> Cachet has been a favorite cologne of mine for many years</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been completely satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> Many friends have complimented me on it and consequently I&#x27;ve recommended it to those to have asked.</li>
            <li> love it  </li>
            <li> I just love it</li>
            <li> I have shopped and shopped looking for my favorite perfume to bo</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so glad I found it here</li>
            <li> When I find something I really really love and go to purchase more...</li>
            <li> buy more, and wear until I die.  </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on it every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Nothing more sexy or arousing than standing, sitting or even passing a man and not liking how they smell.</li>
            <li> I truly love your cologne.  </li>
            <li> Still love this scent after all these years</li>
            <li> Still, I love the fragrance and am enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> Like My Mom :3</li>
            <li> This has always been her favorite cologne</li>
            <li> I can no longer find this product in my area and am glad I can still get it online.</li>
            <li> I wish they would bring it back, it is a wonderful fragrance</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite fragrances.  </li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite and has been for many years.  </li>
            <li> and I always get many compliments on it and don&#x27;t every want to change.  </li>
            <li> Have used this for more years than I care to remember.</li>
            <li> I have had so many compliments on this fragrance from both men and women.</li>
            <li> It is not overpowering I have sensitivities to many colognes; however, this one has never been a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I love this parfum.</li>
            <li> I was so excited!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited!  </li>
            <li> since this fragrance, which is her favorite, is discontinued she does not have the ability to get ahold of it easily.  </li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re one of the lucky ones whose chemistry mixes just right with it, you will have a beautiful and unique, one-of-a-kind fragrance for yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no longer available in many stores...</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift, and the new GF liked it too!</li>
            <li> Such a good price!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not obnoxiously strong</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly because it is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> Even after all these years I frequently get comments from strangers about how pleasant my perfume smells.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to make another person&#x27;s day with something so simple.  </li>
            <li> GREAT except I did not get my cash back rewards from ebates.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of good old days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a very fresh scent</li>
            <li> The original recipe may exist and may be available somewhere, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> light and clean smell</li>
            <li> Not the original anyway.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and have worn it since it first came out.</li>
            <li> Sweet but still light and clean, not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Really appreciate being able to get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I will definately be buying more plus when someone wants to know what to give me for my birthday, mother&#x27;s day, or any ossassion I will refer them here....</li>
            <li> I could not find this locally, so I was delighted that I could replenish my Cachet cologne.</li>
            <li> Well, I love Cachet so much that I jumped at that offer from my husband</li>
            <li> When the order arrived at my house, I couldn&#x27;t resist, I had to open both bottles and test to make sure they were the real Cachet and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> I love this cologne so much and have for years and years.  </li>
            <li> People notice, but it is a mild sweet scent.  </li>
            <li> Quick.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price, fast ship, secure packing.</li>
            <li> A lovely timeless classic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far darker and more amber than the original was.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the exact item I used to buy and cannot find anywhere!  </li>
            <li> Cachet is an oldie and a goodie, a light daytime fragrance that is very wearable.  </li>
            <li> She is a more mature lady</li>
            <li> that I smell like  field of fresh flowers.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is timeless and the price is right.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even look right.</li>
            <li> Most regular priced fragrances quickly smell like sewer water on my skin  -</li>
            <li> Thanks for quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I wore this back in the early &#x27;80&#x27;s and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> The order was complete and accurate.</li>
            <li> Cachet is just about the only cologne I have ever been able to wear.</li>
            <li> It is a light scent, not heavy at all, and I always get compliments on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for several years.</li>
            <li> Mostly from male friends.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Such a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li> It really is &#x27;an oldie, but a goodie!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend for Christmas last year and she really enjoyed the fragrance, so I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any local stores</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> I always use the opportunity of a birthday, anniversary, or holiday to make sure she has a bottle of it on the dresser next to her jewelry box.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for fifty years and it still smells the very best on me and has not become too expensive to wear.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks a gain!</li>
            <li> Happy to have this and have purchased it before prices got ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and prices are very reasonable.</li>
            <li> so I pretty much gave up on ever finding it again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I will still be able to wear it since it&#x27;s almost impossible to find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> This is one of my sweethearts favorite fragrances really hard to find at retail stores she loves it thank you for having it available</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I must watch closely ,I don&#x27;t put too much on</li>
            <li> Cost is too high!  </li>
            <li> Have used this perfume for many years and it is getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li> Sent via UPS, a real PLUS.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves Cachet.  </li>
            <li> again and my husband thanks you too</li>
            <li> I turned to the internet,and much to my surprise</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and was beginning to panic as I couldn&#x27;t find at the local Walgreen&#x27;s, the last place in which I&#x27;d been able to locate it.  </li>
            <li> Last year I bought this elsewhere and paid a lot more for the same product.  </li>
            <li> have been wearing this cologne since I was in high school(40 yrs.</li>
            <li> , he says it reminds him of when we were in high school</li>
            <li> It is getting harder to fine.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> and if i did find it it was to expensive, but since i found it on amazon for a great price ( i bought 2 of them)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s exactly the same as when she used to wear it.</li>
            <li> The perfume color is way to dark, Instead of a light straw color.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Cachet since it first came on the market in the 70&#x27;s, and it is the only fragrance I wear.</li>
            <li> little too strong.</li>
            <li> This is the only place I can order my perfume at a decent price!  </li>
            <li> I have used Cachet for many years and it&#x27;s getting increasingly hard to find in retail locations.  </li>
            <li> Reminds me of an old girlfriend.</li>
            <li> I have used Cachet since the early 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my 80 year old mother.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells old,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a heavy scent, and I always receive compliments.</li>
            <li> I spent just a tad over the $25 gift limit, but it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Not easy to find all year, appears ONLY around Christmas time, so I have to get a year&#x27;s supply, but I love it.</li>
            <li> All my other perfumes are much more expensive (my favorite is Coco Chanel), but I wear this one almost every day.</li>
            <li> If this version really is reformulated , it&#x27;s enough like the one I had in my twenties to bring back fond memories.</li>
            <li> Fabulous scent, so hard to find.</li>
            <li> In General</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about the perfume other than I grew up smelling it on my mom</li>
            <li> My mom loves this purfume, she has been using it since high school, it is getting harder and harder to find</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I had overheard her say that she was down to her last bit and how sad she was that she could no longer wear her favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> It smells like the cheap aftershave your creepy uncle wears.</li>
            <li> Not by a long shot.</li>
            <li> So very sorry they don&#x27;t make it any more.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to get in stores any more.  </li>
            <li> But Not Really</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I do not like any other scent of cologne for me, there is nothing out there</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine me with any other fragrance.</li>
            <li> She lives in a small rural town and cannot buy it where she lives.  </li>
            <li> How, not sure, but I do remember how it would smell completely different on each of us.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne I can ware and it has gotten very hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I am allergic to many fragrances, which give me horrible headaches.</li>
            <li> and I have been unable to locate it locally for some time now.  </li>

            <li> Used this cologne for past 45 years.  </li>

            <li> It has been hard to find in retail locations anymore</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so hard to find any place else..</li>

            <li> Have used this for years and was beginning to panic as I couldn&#x27;t find at the local Walgreen&#x27;s, the last place in which I&#x27;d been able to locate it.  And then I thought about Amazon....no problem.</li>
            <li> I used this product in the 70s.  I didn&#x27;t know it still existed.  So glad it does. It reminds me of good old days.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments wearing this Cachet, just love it.  Hard to find locally</li>
            <li> I love this cologne.  I have used it for years.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Great product and seller!!</li>
            <li> Smells as great as I remember. Thanks for quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Received as promised.  Great seller.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great transaction, Great Great product. Ya can&#x27;t find this product in stores anymore. Shipping was fast and prices are very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have used Cachet Cologne for well over 10 to 15 years, but these days it is difficult to find Cachet in a store - so I must buy it on-line.  Most regular priced fragrances quickly smell like sewer water on my skin  - but Cachet smells so great throughout the day. Even after all these years I frequently get comments from strangers about how pleasant my perfume smells. Cachet is definitely my signature scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go through about 6-3.2 oz bottles each year and I wear it every day - even while I am at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peggi McDonald  [...]</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a co worker whose name I drew in the holiday gift exchange.  She is a more mature lady and she is not computer savvy, so since this fragrance, which is her favorite, is discontinued she does not have the ability to get ahold of it easily.  I had overheard her say that she was down to her last bit and how sad she was that she could no longer wear her favorite scent.  I bought this and a tub of the dusting powder which I found on Ebay.  I spent just a tad over the $25 gift limit, but it was well worth it.  SHE SCREAMED IN DELIGHT when she opened her bag at our gift exchange.  I was so happy to make another person&#x27;s day with something so simple.  And to be honest, she always did, and does, smell very nice.  Sweet but still light and clean, not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Item was great and at a good price. Wish I could get item at a continued discount.</li>
            <li> Impossible to get in stores any more.  Bought 2 bottles and received them in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of an old girlfriend. Gave it as a gift, and the new GF liked it too! Good Times.</li>
            <li> I have used Cachet since the early 70&#x27;s.  It is my favorite perfume.  So very sorry they don&#x27;t make it any more.  Big bummer!!!!!</li>
            <li> little too strong.I must watch closely ,I don&#x27;t put too much on</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume!  I really can&#x27;t wear strong perfumes so this one is perfect.  I get lot&#x27;s of compliments when I wear it.  Sometimes I&#x27;m embarrassed to say that it is so inexpensive because many people think you have to spend a lot of money in order for it to be good.  Not so with this one.  I&#x27;m so happy that I will still be able to wear it since it&#x27;s almost impossible to find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Only place I can get this item. Thank goodness for your company as that is the only cologne o am not allergic to.</li>
            <li> Makes my wife smell good and makes her happy.  When she is happy, I am happy.  I did think it was a bit pricey compared to the last time I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Cost is too high!  Rediculous.</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s all time favorite perfume and it&#x27;s getting hard to find these days!  Of course I was able to turn to Amazon and find a seller who had it at a great price.  I don&#x27;t know much about the perfume other than I grew up smelling it on my mom and it&#x27;s not obnoxiously strong and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to many fragrances, which give me horrible headaches. Cachet is just about the only cologne I have ever been able to wear. It is a light scent, not heavy at all, and I always get compliments on the fragrance. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for several years. I am glad to still be able to get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume!</li>
            <li> Have used this fragrance off and on for years. Can&#x27;t always find it in stores so online purchase is a great way to keep up your supply.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my aunt at Christmas.  She enjoys this fragrance.  Last year I bought this elsewhere and paid a lot more for the same product.  This was an affordable purchase.  Would buy here again.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne, been looking for it here in Las Vegas.Will order again.Thank you.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Everything was great.</li>

Love it....Love it.....Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is getting very hard to find. And I am happy that I was able to find it on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;from this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Cachet for years, getting very hard to find in retail stores.I have heard many &amp;#34;You smell good&amp;#34;s!! Mostly from male friends.</li>
            <li> Have used this perfume for many years and it is getting harder to find.  Really appreciate being able to get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Quick. Sent via UPS, a real PLUS. Package for perfume is just like it was years ago. The product&#x27;s scent is identical. WOW!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  This is the only perfume I use and I have been unable to locate it locally for some time now.  Now I have a place where I can order it as needed.  THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> My mom loves this purfume, she has been using it since high school, it is getting harder and harder to find therefore I went to amazon to purchase. I will be sad for her, when we can no longer get it.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect Surprise for my Mother on Mother&#x27;s Day.  She absolutely loves Cachet.  This product is great and the surprise on her face was priceless!</li>
            <li> Cachet has been a favorite cologne of mine for many years and I&#x27;ve been completely satisfied with the product.  It has been hard to find in retail locations anymore and I plan on continuing its use.  Many friends have complimented me on it and consequently I&#x27;ve recommended it to those to have asked.</li>
            <li> love this fragrance and also gor body sray to go along with this product which was a very nice choice for my very special occasions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a perfume lover and this is my standby, inexpensive, perfume. I&#x27;ve worn it since I was in my twenties, decades ago. All my other perfumes are much more expensive (my favorite is Coco Chanel), but I wear this one almost every day.</li>
            <li> The only cologne I can use!! I can not smell it on myself and always having compliments and asking me what I am wearing!! Awesome- have used this for years!! Allergies prohibit me from using anything I can smell on myself, so this is perfect.</li>

            <li> love it  I was having hard time trying to find it  now I know where I can get it  I just love it</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cologne!</li>
            <li> I have shopped and shopped looking for my favorite perfume to bo avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I found it here and I bought two. I will definately be buying more plus when someone wants to know what to give me for my birthday, mother&#x27;s day, or any ossassion I will refer them here....pleas don&#x27;t stop offering it, that happens to me alot. When I find something I really really love and go to purchase more...they stopped selling it for one reason or another !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again and my husband thanks you too, he says it reminds him of when we were in high school and I use to wear it then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy Szeto</li>
            <li> People notice, but it is a mild sweet scent.  Always getting compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Husband likes it. If I do not have it on I feel like I am smelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more, and wear until I die.  Hope they use it on me then too.</li>
            <li> GREAT except I did not get my cash back rewards from ebates.</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for years and am disappointed they are discontinuing it! Don&#x27;t like all the designer scents</li>
            <li> I could not find this locally, so I was delighted that I could replenish my Cachet cologne.</li>
            <li> been wearing this for over 35 yrs. I get so many compliments on it every time I wear it. It is getting harder to fine. I just hope I can keep buying it. light and clean smell</li>
            <li> Happy to have this and have purchased it before prices got ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is timeless and the price is right.</li>
            <li> used it for years... I love the smell. My daughter is allergic to the smell though</li>
            <li> I have always worn cachet,when it became impossible to purchase it locally I turned to the internet,and much to my surprise I found it on amazon. This is my signature scent and I will wear nothing else.So very pleased to be able to purchase and receive it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this stuff</li>
            <li> Everything was as described, the package came as promised. Great service. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Again the answer is the same as above.  Shower or bathe is not enough. Nothing more sexy or arousing than standing, sitting or even passing a man and not liking how they smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, it smells SOOO GOOD!!! When I&#x27;m wearing the cologne people tell me how good I smell, that I smell like  field of fresh flowers. I truly love your cologne.  DON&#x27;T STOP MAKING IT.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price, fast ship, secure packing. Fabulous scent, so hard to find. I have been using Cachet since it&#x27;s debut in the 70&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Worn this fragrance for 25 years!</li>
            <li> If this version really is reformulated , it&#x27;s enough like the one I had in my twenties to bring back fond memories. Such a lovely scent.  It really is &#x27;an oldie, but a goodie!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I am not able to wear a lot of perfumes.  This is the only place I can order my perfume at a decent price!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Still love this scent after all these years</li>
            <li> Used this cologne for past 45 years.  Still getting compliments. Can&#x27;t imagine me with any other fragrance.</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly because it is a bit strong. Still, I love the fragrance and am enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and delivery.</li>
            <li> My wife wore Cachet for years. We both can pick out the scent upwind in a hurricane. She even has a jewelry box that has some cotton batting in the bottom that had Cachet spilled in it, and it still smells of Cachet to this day. Whatever the stuff is in this bottle, it&#x27;s not Cachet. Not the original anyway. Not by a long shot. It smells like the cheap aftershave your creepy uncle wears. It doesn&#x27;t even look right. It&#x27;s far darker and more amber than the original was. The original recipe may exist and may be available somewhere, but this isn&#x27;t it. This is nothing but a rip-off. (And now of course, adding insult to injury, I see in small print that this item cannot be returned.) Save your money. Unless you&#x27;ve got a creepy uncle who has a birthday coming up.</li>
            <li> A lovely timeless classic.</li>
            <li> Such a good price! My favorite perfume!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother she said it smells just as she remembers</li>
            <li> Got This For My Mom She Loves Cachet Ever Since &amp; She Also Stopped Using Victorias Secrets Crazy Huh But Not Really In General This Perfume Smellsa Super Good &amp; Like My Mom :3</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend for Christmas last year and she really enjoyed the fragrance, so I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Years ago I used Cachet all the time and loved it.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any local stores so I pretty much gave up on ever finding it again.  One day before Christmas my husband asked if I had tried to find the Cachet at Amazon.  Oh my, it&#x27;s there!  I was so excited!  He told me that if I wanted a bottle than go ahead and order one and it would be a Christmas gift.  Well, I love Cachet so much that I jumped at that offer from my husband but, instead of buying one bottle of Cachet, I purchased two.  I was so excited!  When the order arrived at my house, I couldn&#x27;t resist, I had to open both bottles and test to make sure they were the real Cachet and in good condition.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mother, who couldn&#x27;t find it anymore locally. She is allergic to several perfumes, but not this one. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my 80 year old mother. It&#x27;s a fragrance that she use to wear when she was younger and could no longer find it in any store. I was so happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! ALWAYS reliable!</li>
            <li> I am so happy Amazon had my perfume, love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother for Christmas.  She lives in a small rural town and cannot buy it where she lives.  This has always been her favorite cologne and I always send it to her when she runs out.</li>
            <li> I have used Cachet for many years and it&#x27;s getting increasingly hard to find in retail locations.  So, I was delighted to be able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected. I can no longer find this product in my area and am glad I can still get it online. The cologne came to me intact and unopened, it smells the same as it always has so I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> The order was complete and accurate. Arrived before expected.</li>
            <li> price was good, packaging was perfect, and it arrived in a timely manner...thanks!</li>
            <li> More expensive than it should be. About $5.00 over priced.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister as a gift.  She can&#x27;t find it in Canada and she reports that she loves it, it&#x27;s exactly the same as when she used to wear it.</li>
            <li> Not easy to find all year, appears ONLY around Christmas time, so I have to get a year&#x27;s supply, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Cachet is an oldie and a goodie, a light daytime fragrance that is very wearable.  I prefer Cachet Noir, though.  I wish they would bring it back, it is a wonderful fragrance and I never did understand why they discontinued it, that one I would give 5 stars....</li>
            <li> this  cologne is an oldie but goodie i have been using this cologne since i was  in my teens and now i am in my 40&#x27;s and i was upset when it became hard to find and if i did find it it was to expensive, but since i found it on amazon for a great price ( i bought 2 of them) i will be ordering it again and again .</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite fragrances.  I am very happy with this purchase. would recommend it to anyone. Thank you</li>
            <li> If you wore this back in the &#x27;70&#x27;s, you&#x27;ll remember how it works. It was made specifically to work with an individuals body chemistry. How, not sure, but I do remember how it would smell completely different on each of us. It was as made in a \\&quot;cream\\&quot; version, like a body lotion, but I&#x27;m assuming this works on the same premise. One girlfriend wore it all the time because it smelled amazing on her! I ran out to get some but found out it didn&#x27;t smell anything like what she was wearing. I was so jealous that I couldn&#x27;t get that fragrance on me. So, I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that this can truly be one of those fragrances that is definitely going to smell different on everyone. And if you&#x27;re one of the lucky ones whose chemistry mixes just right with it, you will have a beautiful and unique, one-of-a-kind fragrance for yourself.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite and has been for many years.  Glad I found it at this good price! Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> My wife has worn this since before we met 30 years ago.  Never tire of the fragrance.  I always use the opportunity of a birthday, anniversary, or holiday to make sure she has a bottle of it on the dresser next to her jewelry box.</li>
            <li> Wife has been wearing this fragrance for over 35 years...It&#x27;s no longer available in many stores...This was a great find at a fair price...&amp;#34;Happy wife, happy life.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great, Quick Service.  Have been using this product for 30 years, and was very unhappy when I could no longer purchase locally.  Amazon to the rescue!  Thank You!  Love it and you!</li>
            <li> It is my signature fragrance and I always get many compliments on it and don&#x27;t every want to change.  It&#x27;s intriguing, alluring and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for fifty years and it still smells the very best on me and has not become too expensive to wear.</li>
            <li> My very favorite scent.  Have used this for more years than I care to remember.</li>
            <li> Great product. Will order again</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t Buy...I&#x27;m Very Disappointed. I&#x27;ve been wearing Cachet for years. This stuff smells old, Like it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf for years. The perfume color is way to dark, Instead of a light straw color. Makes me wonder if its been exposed to heat. It doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the Cachet I bought at the store last week. Save your money. You Can&#x27;t Return It. Zero Stars.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne so much and have for years and years.  It&#x27;s got a very fresh scent and I get lots of compliments when I wear it.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> I wore this back in the early &#x27;80&#x27;s and loved it.  Bought a 3.2 oz bottle August 2013 for $16.86 thru Amazon and am delighted to find it is still the same wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> I have worn Cachet since the late 1970&#x27;s but have a hard time finding it.  It is great to be able to find it at an excellent price!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and have worn it since it first came out. I have had so many compliments on this fragrance from both men and women. It is not overpowering I have sensitivities to many colognes; however, this one has never been a problem for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome seller! Fast shipping! Very happy with product and highly recommend !!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it but it&#x27;s the exact item I used to buy and cannot find anywhere!  It&#x27;s the only cologne my husband can stand for me to wear.</li>
            <li> I very happy! Finally find my parfum and it&#x27;s perfect!!! Thanks very much! I love this parfum. Thanks a gain!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance at a reasonable price....always get compliments when I wear it!!!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Cachet since it first came on the market in the 70&#x27;s, and it is the only fragrance I wear. It&#x27;s not a heavy scent, and I always receive compliments.</li>
