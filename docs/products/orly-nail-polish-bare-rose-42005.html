            <li>I love Orly Nail Polish and treatments.</li>
            <li>This shade is wonderful for the French manicure or even by itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed this for years.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>However this polish would easily bubble up on the finger</li>
            <li>I use it when I just want to have a clean, healthy look on my nails without loading them with paints and</li>
            <li>Looks great by itself or french manicure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not wearing the opaque whites and pinks as you have to have the hands of  a 10 year old before it looks good.</li>
            <li>I just painted it close to the edge then applied clear coat over the top of both for a nice finish.</li>
            <li>I have used the Bare Rose color for many years but can no longer get it at Sally store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gives nails that perfect healthy pink color when you french tip them!</li>
            <li>It gives a nice glossy and professional looking finish.</li>
            <li>It does not look good over the white tips.</li>
            <li>This bare rose works great for a clean professional french manicure look as the top coat</li>
            <li>Would have liked a more pink toned polish.</li>
            <li>Worth the price. . .</li>
            <li>I love the perfect sheer pink color it leaves on my nails when I do a French Manicure.</li>
            <li>I got recommended to use this with france tips and it is so noticeable it is better to just wear part of my nail bare.</li>
            <li>Use this over the white tip polish and you will have a great looking french manicure.</li>
            <li>I really like this as a top coat for diy french manicure.</li>
            <li>I use a base coat, one coat of this Bare Rose, and a shiny top coat and my nails look great, natural but with a pretty and feminine tinge of color which goes with anything I wear.  </li>
            <li>Really too orange.  </li>
            <li>Pretty color to use if you&#x27;re treating yourself to a French Manicure but NOT long-lasting on the fingernails.</li>
            <li>was surprised that this polish was distinctly orange in color rather than the lovely pale pink  </li>
            <li>Very sheer color, close to clear nail polish with a light pink tint.</li>
            <li>think this is an old product which is no longer useable.  </li>
            <li>I like natural colors</li>
            <li>I love this.. before trying this I never liked how my french tip would look on my natural nails.</li>
            <li>This will make your nails look exactly like the fake nails in kits but only more natural looking.</li>
            <li>But it looks complete when I use it for a French Manicure.</li>
            <li>It is thick and like this unnatural pink, its bright but dark.</li>
            <li>this clear pink polish gives it a pretty pop of pink.</li>
            <li>This nail polish, however, is truly tinted, not too strong, not too thin either.</li>

            <li> I use a base coat, one coat of this Bare Rose, and a shiny top coat and my nails look great, natural but with a pretty and feminine tinge of color which goes with anything I wear.  Would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. Very sheer color, close to clear nail polish with a light pink tint. I gave it a 4 star only because I can only use it on my finger as a nail polish; it looks weird on my feet. It doesn&#x27;t have a finishing look on my feet. But it looks complete when I use it for a French Manicure.</li>
            <li> Use this over the white tip polish and you will have a great looking french manicure. This will make your nails look exactly like the fake nails in kits but only more natural looking. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love Orly Nail Polish and treatments. This bare rose works great for a clean professional french manicure look as the top coat</li>
            <li> This color is so ugly. It is thick and like this unnatural pink, its bright but dark. I do not even know how to explain. I got recommended to use this with france tips and it is so noticeable it is better to just wear part of my nail bare. It is not a deep enough color to even wear alone. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> This shade is wonderful for the French manicure or even by itself. I&#x27;ve enjoyed this for years. Others like the shade as well.</li>
            <li> Hated it - didn&#x27;t look anywhere near as pretty on as it did in the picture.  Also - it didn&#x27;t provide very good coverage.</li>

However this polish would easily bubble up on the finger nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is an old product which is no longer useable.  I regret ordering three of them.</li>
            <li> Did not like the color at all.  Really too orange.  Would have liked a more pink toned polish.</li>
            <li> Liked this colors a lot. I like natural colors and this was the perfect tint.</li>
            <li> Worth the price. . . I love the perfect sheer pink color it leaves on my nails when I do a French Manicure.</li>
            <li> I love this.. before trying this I never liked how my french tip would look on my natural nails. It was too nude and boring looking this clear pink polish gives it a pretty pop of pink. I loooooove it</li>
            <li> Gives nails that perfect healthy pink color when you french tip them! I love this polish!!</li>
            <li> I really like this polish its great for manicure &amp;&amp; makes your nails look so beautiful I recommend about 2 or 3 coats</li>
            <li> This is the topcoat for a french manicure, but I like the lighter colors being used theses days so it works. I&#x27;m not wearing the opaque whites and pinks as you have to have the hands of  a 10 year old before it looks good. This works by itself or as an overcoat on another color.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. It is really good and gives your nails a nice healthy look. Great for manicures and pedicures</li>
            <li> I saw someone giving a product review of this item on Youtube and decided to order. This nail polish is great! It runs smooth and finishes great! I use it when I just want to have a clean, healthy look on my nails without loading them with paints and embellishments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been looking for tinted nail polish for a while and purchased \\&quot;Just-Tinted\\&quot; by Revlon hoping it is what it says. Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t; after second coat, the color was as thick as a regular nail polish(and the polish didn&#x27;t glide on nails and left streaks). This nail polish, however, is truly tinted, not too strong, not too thin either. It is perfect for getting healthy look on my nails and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I really like this as a top coat for diy french manicure. It gives a nice glossy and professional looking finish. It helps when you want your diy manicures to look like you actually went to the salon. Will re-order when finished and this is going to last me a looong time. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Pretty color to use if you&#x27;re treating yourself to a French Manicure but NOT long-lasting on the fingernails.</li>
            <li> It is very subtle with one coat - like natural rosy gloss.  Two coats give a nice transparent bubblegum peachy gloss. Nice.</li>
            <li> Looks great by itself or french manicure. It does not look good over the white tips. I just painted it close to the edge then applied clear coat over the top of both for a nice finish. I have only used it once so it is still really nice and glides on easy.</li>
