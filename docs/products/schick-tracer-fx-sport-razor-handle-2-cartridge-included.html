            <li>I love this classic twin blade razor which I have been using for many years.  </li>
            <li>special,.....</li>
            <li>I really like the older razors better than the newer ones that have more blades per cartridge.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and intact.  </li>
            <li>I would have been much better off ordering new Quattro blades..</li>
            <li>Razor&#x27;s curtridge holder side-knob is very soft and easily could get break.</li>
            <li>This new one has a much better feel than the old one.</li>
            <li>Other than that great great shave.refills are to expensive.</li>
            <li>Thanks for being there because I could never find this at any store.</li>
            <li>Needed an older handle to use a large cache of blades that were on hand.  </li>
            <li>Have used for the past several years and find it comfortable and effective.  </li>
            <li>We finally thought to look on Amazon and sure enough we found it</li>
            <li>These old razor/handle combinations are very unforgiving compared to the Quattro.  </li>
            <li>So hard to find glad I could find them on amazon.</li>
            <li>He must have had the old handle for 25/30 yrs..</li>
            <li>It may not produce a closer shave than the old one, but it feels like it does.</li>
            <li>I was late to work today trying to stop by chin from bleeding, so that pretty much backs out any savings.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave, refills don&#x27;t last as long as I would like.</li>
            <li>The Schick Tracer FX was barely a step-up from the old single blade disposable razors, and I had forgotten that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a wonderful razor much easier to shave with than the ones with more blades</li>
            <li> About 3 years ago I lost my Tracer FX handle, but I still had about 30 cartridges left over. This did the trick. It will probably take me a couple of years to use all 30. Thanks for being there because I could never find this at any store. The razor works fine, nice and close never get even a nick. Recomended.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned and I don&#x27;t understand why they are not available in stores anymore.  I have two now and I hope i will continue to be able to get refills.  Schick, are you listening?</li>
            <li> Awesome product, extremely thankful I found one again. Tried lots of others, nothing comes close.</li>
            <li> this works well for all types of facial hair.  the gel strip has a soothing effect on my face.  Quality!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make me put a picture of my legs on here after I used it.  It was like a bloody massacre.</li>
            <li> Was what I was looking for, great place to shop . This writing review is what makes people come back and shop</li>
            <li> I love this razor .. have used them for years and years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for years, and I have no idea why they stopped selling it in stores. One of Schick&#x27;s dumbest idea&#x27;s ever. They disappointed a lot of customers.</li>
            <li> It was just what I need it</li>
            <li> Like others, I had unused Schick FX cartridges laying around (approx 20) and I thought I would save a few bucks by ordering a new handle and using the FX cartridges until they are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you are now used to the Schick Quattro, this logic will take you to a dark, bloody place.  These old razor/handle combinations are very unforgiving compared to the Quattro.  Almost every time I have shaved with this item I have cut myself using techniques that would not be a problem on current razors.  The Schick Tracer FX was barely a step-up from the old single blade disposable razors, and I had forgotten that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking of ordering this to save money, don&#x27;t.  I was late to work today trying to stop by chin from bleeding, so that pretty much backs out any savings.  I would have been much better off ordering new Quattro blades..</li>
            <li> I am very glad to have this Razor through the Amazon. I wonder how the Departmental stores are selling all the Cartridge but not the Razor. What a business policy? Razor&#x27;s curtridge holder side-knob is very soft and easily could get break.</li>
            <li> My husband hates change.. when he finds something he likes he sticks with it.. He must have had the old handle for 25/30 yrs.. when he finally decided he wanted another handle he went searching for another in all the drugstores and supermarkets he could find. We finally thought to look on Amazon and sure enough we found it and he is now a happy shaver..</li>
            <li> The razor is an excellent razor, I like it better than the triple blade I was using.  The freight for this item was OUTLANDISH !!!!  I would give it a 5 star for the razor but a 0 Star for the shipping costs.</li>
            <li> I change my blades  3 times a year.....never would I thought that I would find a razor to be this good,  I shave it with almost every day and yes, I have a rough beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is not any thing special,.....just plastic but the blades are unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I really like the older razors better than the newer ones that have more blades per cartridge. I bought this razor to replace one I have had for years. This new one has a much better feel than the old one. It may not produce a closer shave than the old one, but it feels like it does.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive face. Wish  Schick still made these. The 4, 5, 6 blade razors are over rated. This razor shaves close and bends to the contours of my face.</li>
            <li> So hard to find glad I could find them on amazon. The product is discontinued only wish they would bring Tracer back.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor ever. I&#x27;ve been using one like it for 20 years, it finally just wore out. So thankful that Amazon had another one just like it!</li>
            <li> Purchased because Schick discontinued this product.  Have used for the past several years and find it comfortable and effective.  Glad to be able to find one.</li>
            <li> I love this classic twin blade razor which I have been using for many years.  They don&#x27;t make razors like this anymore.  I use the razor for finishing up my morning shave or for touch ups later in the day.  The slim design lets you get to those hard to reach places.  I could find this razor only on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very close shave, refills don&#x27;t last as long as I would like. Other than that great great shave.refills are to expensive.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Price!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. Isn&#x27;t as flexible as I thought it would be. Takes a bit to get use to shaving with.</li>
            <li> Needed an older handle to use a large cache of blades that were on hand.  Arrived quickly and intact.  Great selling partner.</li>
