            <li>I suspect some reviews here may not be honest.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t an effective method for me.</li>
            <li>she tried picking my lashes to see if they weren&#x27;t the glue on kind bc</li>

            <li>I strongly believe in taking care of my eyes and reLASH has easily helped me to do that !!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month now on my eyebrows and eyelashes (just for good measure) and on one of my eyebrows and both sets of eyelashes it has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>it to have been more effective but having to keep using it</li>
            <li>It feels sooo good now to just look at myself in the mirror and see my lashes more prominent and have more volume than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>

            <li>Great product and great results in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>in comparison, this is probably the best deal I&#x27;ve found and my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>The other products worked fair at best, but then I found reLash.</li>
            <li>Great seller, arrived fast, and this doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like others I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this stuff works!!</li>
            <li>I did not expect it to work so quickly!!</li>
            <li>I am a redhead with very light lashes.  </li>
            <li>Saw results within 2 weeks and even better results within 4 weeks; much better and much more affordable than comparable prescription brand</li>
            <li>A noticed a bit more length in my lashes.</li>
            <li>I love this product for eye lashes.</li>
            <li>:) I apply every night before bed and saw results in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Maybe you need to use more than 1 tube to see any results.</li>
            <li>I have been using re-lash for over a month now and absolutely love it</li>
            <li>( now it is more fuller and thicker and a bit longer)  </li>
            <li>will buy again :)</li>
            <li>My lashes are thicker, longer, and darker ! :-)</li>
            <li>the eyes are the windows to the soul and most people take them for granted.</li>
            <li>Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>She faithfully uses it morning and evening and has enjoyed the results.  </li>
            <li>My advice to you is to use it more than once a day and may need up to 5-7 weeks to see the result.</li>
            <li>Good for the others who had success seeing</li>
            <li>they are more visible and that&#x27;s a</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this tube until it&#x27;s finished, and may find that with time the results improve even more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product around evening time for most of the month and have stunning results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order more  </li>
            <li>I need to stack up on these ReLash babies and send to my sisters and Mom also :)</li>
            <li>One thing is for sure, this product is better than all the others I tried.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to wear extensions :)</li>
            <li>Was hoping for more results...</li>
            <li>Better than any eye lash serum I&#x27;ve used.      </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I see the difference and am a satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li>My lashes look better than they ever have.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to update if my opinion changes, but I plan to keep applying this serum.  </li>
            <li>so when I saw this I was sure it would work just as well.</li>
            <li>What I know I love about this product is the service from the company.  </li>
            <li>OK, here&#x27;s the deal...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it was okay</li>
            <li>I was able to find Lilash via Overstock and this worked.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;fine too.&lt;br /&gt;They are getting fuller and thicker for sure.</li>
            <li>I have healthy lashes but was hoping they would grow longer which they have not.</li>
            <li>I love mascara, but have found that I do lose some eyelashes.</li>
            <li>In fact it was her favorite gift of the day.  </li>
            <li>Okay I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully every night as the direction states.</li>
            <li>I will give it more time to see if my eyelashes will grow.</li>
            <li>I waited till I had used the product for a couple weeks to make sure it was working.</li>
            <li>and so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m suspicious of many reviews, but want to say up front that I&#x27;m not paid to review products.</li>
            <li>Great product with fast results</li>
            <li>It takes more to apply to my eyebrows but it still does its job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely try it out :) I&#x27;ll order more soon using my coupon too :D</li>
            <li>I love the results from this serum.</li>
            <li>I also want to point out that many of the glowing five-star reviews appear suspicious.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I believe it is going to work better than most.</li>
            <li>I bought another tube to give it more time.</li>
            <li>BUT I WILL KEEP ON USING YOUR PRODUCT, HOPING IT WILL IMPROVE MUCH MORE.  </li>
            <li>it more time..</li>
            <li>it grows more and more..</li>
            <li>growth, so please try to put A LOT on the top of your eyelash for a month then</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>top photo is from 1/29/15...</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love the result!&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Love the product but can&#x27;t tell if it is working yet.</li>
            <li>This stuff truly works i had ripped many eyelashes out from lash extensions</li>
            <li>5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li>I have seen more results with City Lash.</li>
            <li>and my eyes have gotten better.</li>
            <li>results were ok.  </li>
            <li>Love this eyelash enhancer.</li>
            <li>so I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to make it 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>5 stars from me :-)</li>
            <li>:) I use this for my lashes since I use extensions too</li>
            <li>I did go through and look at the ingredients list of many others - Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17</li>
            <li>She totally love this product and I would recommend all the ladies out there to try.</li>
            <li>Careprost is much better alternative.</li>
            <li>Ok can I just say I wish I knew about this product a year ago.</li>
            <li>Most saw results after about 4 weeks of  use.</li>
            <li>I have tried soooo many eyelash growth products, but this one seems to do the trick.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t tell if it worked on my top lashes.  </li>
            <li>I experienced NO irritation, stinging, or eye watering issues, which is just unusual for me with these kinds of products.</li>
            <li>AGAIN, I was incredibly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>In terms of growth it seems to be ok</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product for a couple of gifts because I am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>and I have been using it for 6 weeks or more now.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product!!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not to sure about my brows.</li>
            <li>Much better smell than products like this</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better for SOME people.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will take some time to see results</li>
            <li>I love this product, I use it over and over....</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many eyelash regrowth products over the years that I have lost count.</li>
            <li>My mascara seems to make them fall out more than I would like.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use this :-)</li>
            <li>After 3 months of use, I LOVE my fuller and longer lashes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look drastic in the photo, but you do notice fullness and additional length from the before (on top) and after (on the bottom).</li>
            <li>This product was okay</li>
            <li>I have seen improvement, for sure.  </li>
            <li>OK, no joke.  </li>
            <li>and I bought her this to try and her results were much better with Relash.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for results but after many weeks, I don&#x27;t see any difference in my lash length.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for better results.</li>
            <li>I had some shorter lashes that now look to be evening out, which is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I am excited to see the results after more time goes by!</li>
            <li>I will continue the recommended 8 weeks and hopefully see better results.</li>
            <li>As the weeks went by, I noticed that they were also getting thicker and more luscious.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>but this product works for me and  is  more affordable,  has healthy ingredients</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I got much better results from Rapid Lash</li>
            <li>I am glad I did</li>
            <li>and I am one satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying this again for sure</li>
            <li>my brows and lashes will be longer and fuller :)</li>
            <li>but you have to make sure you do it all the time.</li>
            <li>I love this product because you have to just apply it once</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t leave home without this product that is for sure.</li>
            <li>The serum has a nice texture and is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>The spot on my eyebrow where it was pierced many years ago has always been thinner than the rest of my brows</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more concerned about my eyebrows rather than my lashes, but I&#x27;m using it on both anyway.</li>
            <li>It was okay, but not as promised</li>
            <li>I need more time to test it out</li>
            <li>you wear contacts, make sure to remove them.</li>
            <li>I feel safe using this product.  </li>
            <li>After using reLASH for  two weeks both my lashes and brows have noticeably more volume.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>This product exceeded my expectations so much, and I am honestly so happy with it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is wash your face and remove your makeup ( be sure to remove your contacts).</li>
            <li>Make sure you remove your contact lenses and make up before applying.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try it and after 3 days of using it</li>
            <li>so i am very familiar with results....</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>This buyer loved his item very much and wanted more but at the time it was out of stock.</li>
            <li>Nice design and has an applicator tip that is like the tip of a fine paintbrush and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The tube and applicator is very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that I do see some new growth, and I expect more to gradually appear as I continue to use this product in the months ahead.</li>
            <li>The serum has a very light texture and was easy to work with as well.  </li>
            <li>I believe that good things come to those who wait ;-)</li>
            <li>she said she never knew i had lashes that long lol!</li>
            <li>After using it for one month my lashes grew fuller and longer and my eyes look even pretty good without using mascara.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled with the smooth transaction and how quickly this product arrived!  </li>
            <li>Okay, this is just too cool!</li>
            <li>Thank you reLASH for putting a smile on my grandmas face!!</li>
            <li>Excited to see some results!</li>
            <li>My lashes look darker and more full!  </li>
            <li>and I am excited to find it!</li>
            <li>So excited about this product!</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to apply.  </li>
            <li>i love the easy application...almost like putting on liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to do this quick video recommending this amazing product.</li>
            <li>Amazing how quickly I saw results (3 wks) Will always have in my makeup bag.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results so far and plan to keep on using it.</li>
            <li>Overall I like this product and since I am already seeing results I am glad I caught this at a great price and am able to share my opinion of it.</li>
            <li>I have been using Latisse for years, since I was able to acquire it cheap.  </li>
            <li>This one is good because it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes if you use too much.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping for something good.</li>
            <li>and I was super excited to be able to get a sample of this product and share my experience with the product with you!  </li>
            <li>With reLASH, you will get a SAFE serum that works, awesome customer service, and an affordable price that won&#x27;t double after the first time you buy it...</li>
            <li>Its all true!</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m super excited!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a huge difference but every bit helps.</li>
            <li>and it is a huge pain.</li>
            <li>We both see a huge difference in our brows and lashes.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference in my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I will admit I was a huge skeptic.</li>
            <li>i see a huge difference .</li>
            <li>but overall shes just extremely happy as that was one thing</li>
            <li>So I ordered another to see fit</li>
            <li>The growth we saw was just amazing and fast.</li>
            <li>Relash is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for about a week and do not expect to see a great change yet.  </li>
            <li>Have always had light, sparse eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled about the results, and would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>This product is just fabulous and it does NOT irritate my eyes like rapid lash</li>
            <li>However, the customer service is fantastic and with any product results may vary.</li>
            <li>Also, my lashes went back to the way they were before I used Lilash which worked great for me.  </li>
            <li>so I thought I would give this product a try since it had such great reviews.  </li>
            <li>This is a great serum that is starting to improve the length and density of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>These have been great for the short time being used, but</li>
            <li>My lashes look fantastic.</li>
            <li>Thanks again for this amazing serum</li>
            <li>Its a great product with a money back guarantee</li>
            <li>The applicator is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I also applied to sparse areas of my eyebrows, and they have filled in as well.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m happy with the upper lashes.  </li>
            <li>It works very well, does not irritate, and is effective.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a great amount of growth in the short time I have been using this.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>so far growth is happening works good if used correctly</li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>SO far So good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, finding the eLASH Growth Serum was a very exciting</li>
            <li>I am super pleased with how quickly I&#x27;ve seen results with reLash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use, and though it does have directions to keep away from eyes because it may irritate them, I never had that problem</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used rapid lash previous to using this product; the reviews weren&#x27;t as great, but I feel as though that worked better for me....</li>
            <li>First I noticed that my lashes are looking healthy and shiny, then I saw they truly look longer.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Now I have to worry about my eyelashes touching my glasses ( for the first time in my life)</li>
            <li>I decided to try reLASH and have been very pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product consistently every night and most days.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>Excited to see how things progress.</li>
            <li>However, about the time I got excited about seeing results, my eyelids started swelling and became itchy.</li>
            <li>I have to alter my original review of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Latisse in the past with awesome results.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I wonder if it&#x27;s worth all the effort!  </li>
            <li>I have used in the past- very impressive!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this as a promotion.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>Boys rarely notice anything!  </li>
            <li>am very pleased with my results this far.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to obtain this product and to give my opinion on it.</li>
            <li>It comes with a very narrow brush that is the perfect size for application</li>
            <li>I was trying to find an alternative that was more natural and more affordable.</li>
            <li>So far I love the results, my lashes are longer, seem fuller and darker!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use right before I go to bed</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and fits right into my bedtime routine.  </li>
            <li>but I felt like there was nothing else I could do just to get that special lash look.</li>
            <li>and I was super excited to start using it immediately...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to have found a product that works and is so easy to use / thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>I love this stuff; it really does work.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something that was more reasonable</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say about it is that it did not irritate my eyes as some reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li>At the end of two months I saw the full results, longer fuller stronger lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a tried and true product for me for years.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works yet, as it says it may take 8 weeks for me to see the full effect.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s dissatisfied with their eyelashes and wants more luscious lashes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been using more than a couple of days, can&#x27;t say much about it yet.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff really works</li>
            <li>I ordered the product because I have always loved big eyelashes.</li>
            <li>( I do these also with relash)....and full and thicker......</li>
            <li>I could not give the product a 5 star because while I have noticed improvement in my brows, I am not noticing much difference in my hopelessly sparse eyelashes where I need it most.</li>
            <li>I have full lashes</li>
            <li>So with this serum it helps provide full lashes.</li>
            <li>And again I have my full lashes as I was born with it.</li>
            <li>Seeing eye lashes grow after month of every day use, can&#x27;t wait for full results.</li>
            <li>My lashes are thinning and I needed something to make them full again.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and I&#x27;m glad about that</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 star review was bc of the length of time it took to see results (which was a good 3 months)</li>
            <li>There is no smell and no bad side effects of this product.</li>
            <li>Also my eyelashes look very healthy, they were feeling kind of dry and brittle before but this has made them feel and look much healthier.</li>
            <li>I have been using it consistently for the past 5 weeks and my lashes are now longer, stronger and more beautiful than when I started.</li>
            <li>For the first 2 weeks, it was fine</li>
            <li>After using this product for about six weeks, I am happy to report all of my lashes have grown back and all of my lashes are much longer.  </li>
            <li>The difference has been tremendous.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>My lashes have grown quickly and it looks a bit thicker than it once was.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly with no flaking.</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with the service and the product.</li>
            <li>Given as a gift several times and every recipient has been very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>The packaging was very high quality, prefect sized brush and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love my new look, my eyes look wider brighter.</li>
            <li>Previously had used rapid lash with great results  </li>
            <li>Most people with high reviews have it right</li>
            <li>If you know anyone who wants longer lashes tell them to use this!!</li>
            <li>Works very well!!  </li>
            <li>This serum really works!!</li>
            <li>It took a couple of weeks to see results, but I was consistent!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for almost 3 months and it really works!!</li>
            <li>this stuff definitely made my lashes longer, even more than Latisse did!</li>
            <li>Ok so I usually do not write reviews for products I buy from Amazon..</li>
            <li>But I really do recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>he didn&#x27;t believe me it was my real lashes!!</li>
            <li>I will come back in a couple weeks to share more about my experience with reLash!</li>
            <li>when my first tube runs out!</li>
            <li>It thus far has been very comfortable to wear and has not irritated my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have used many eyelash serums in the past, and by far, this is the absolute best!  </li>
            <li>I have been using Grande lash MD for 3 plus months, thought I would try ReLash because of all the positive reviews, and their money back guarantee, but my lashes are noticibly thinner in the last 10 days of use and I do not want to lose all the progress I had (very happy before with the results</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super excited about using reLash to help regain what was once one of my most complimented facial features - My Lashes!</li>
            <li>Amazing results after only a couple days!!!</li>
            <li>AMAZING RESULTS IN only 4 weeks!</li>
            <li>In addition to this, I would remove my make up with coconut oil because it really gets off the makeup and also conditions your lashes (AND ITS CHEAP).  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Most of the eyelash serums burn if they get near my eyes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Iam very happy that it delivered a day before I expected however I have been using this product for only one week and have not seen any change.</li>
            <li>I then tried Idol Lash, twice, without much success then moved on to Rapid Lash (purchased twice).  </li>
            <li>My lashes have grown AND become thicker - looking much more natural than with Latisse.  </li>
            <li>better results so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exciting.</li>
            <li>Worth the $.</li>
            <li>Considering I am 60 yrs old, and have hypothyroidism, I wasn&#x27;t sure of the type of result I would get.</li>
            <li>I love Relash so far.</li>
            <li>so I tried using some fresh brushes.  </li>
            <li>Just started but so far I am pleased</li>
            <li>You should get it, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My lashes not only are longer but more importantly (to me) are thicker.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>and it was definitely worth the price listed.</li>
            <li>I have access to paying wholesale for some of the top lash serums on the marker and this by far exceeds any of their results.....</li>
            <li>Instructions were clear, leaving me feeling confident about application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is so much better so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting compliments and even accusations of false lashes now (which is awesome)</li>
            <li>; no issues I use it on the top and bottom lashes; I can see a diff in the lower lashes; due to extentions on the top lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li>Then after using consistently for 2 more weeks, I was like wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen tremendous &amp; consistent growth.</li>
            <li>So anyway, I started using reLash 1 week ago and was invited to go to my newly pregnant daughter&#x27;s first ultrasound today.  </li>
            <li>The right lashes are somewhat thicker.</li>
            <li>I could feel effect almost right away.</li>
            <li>with the right mascara they look like falsies.</li>
            <li>I also have irritation in my right eye, although I put it on with one eye at a time with it close.</li>
            <li>You can also put this on your brows to lengthen them or make your brows thicker (which is &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; right now).  </li>
            <li>Your lashes appear to grow right before your eyes.</li>
            <li>Then by the thrid week my right eye I notice some of my eye lashes are falling out.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li>and of course she jumped right in with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it a week, but I notice it is a much higher quality than the kind I used to purchase in stores, and</li>
            <li>They do honor their money back guarantee, and I am pleased that I got a full refund.</li>
            <li>You will have long beautiful lashes in a month or so, but make sure you start using it less once you almost reach the length you wanted.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast (2 days) and after just a week I started to notice my eyelashes not only becoming longer and darker but also fuller with more volume which was really what I wanted!</li>
            <li>But definitely worth the price &amp; MUCH cheaper than lash extensions!</li>
            <li>I think I had more lashes before I tried this, having been using it for 6 weeks and can barely see my lashes even with mascara.</li>
            <li>I have nice long eyelashes up to my eyebrows</li>
            <li>Did not expect to see any difference the first week because the description on Amazon says that it takes 4-6 weeks, so I was surprised when my lashes started becoming stiffer and thicker right away.</li>
            <li>so it keeps my lashes nice and long!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not just the results but the price, and in how large of a tube!</li>
            <li>My eyebrows were thinning in certain spot and this helped thicken them up!</li>
            <li>She always talks about how a lot of guys are lucky by having longer eyelashes when we don&#x27;t really need them.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how easy it is to apply.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have found this gem of a product as such an economical price.</li>
            <li>just make sure the area is clean and dry.</li>
            <li>and I am noticing a slight change in my lashes which is good.</li>
            <li>She said she tried a few different brands and this is the best eyelash growth serum she&#x27;s used</li>
            <li>Make sure your face is fully clean and dry when applying the serum.</li>
            <li>I had used a previous eyelash serum and loved it, and they stopped making it.  </li>
            <li>The serum itself is clear and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are growing back beautifully and are so healthy and thick.</li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews and trying it for herself, she’s very confident that she’ll get the results she’s hoping for.  </li>
            <li>says:&amp;#34;It beats buying so many different brands of mascara trying to find the right one, then having to apply and remove it every day.</li>
            <li>I am a blonde and my eyebrows and lashes are very light and sparse.  </li>
            <li>She is not a high maintenance gal, but she does like to have nice looking lashes.  </li>
            <li>Very fast service.</li>
            <li>Still working but little bit good than before I think I need times</li>
            <li>After using reLASH for only 5 days I already see a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard about these products and that they really work and can be used for the brows too!  </li>
            <li>The ingredient list has a bunch of natural ingredients which is important to me as well.  </li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to apply the serum and have used it consistently for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>She said she could tell in the first 4 weeks that her lashes were getting fuller.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to my friends!!</li>
            <li>Not only can I see a difference, my husband and many of my close friends can as well.</li>
            <li>When this first purchase runs out, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more reLASH.  </li>
            <li>well i am not so consistent at that</li>
            <li>I have used it consistently for over 2 months and have had zero results.</li>
            <li>There was an issue with my first order</li>
            <li>First, let me tell you that I was a Latisse user for awhile.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the best thing about this product was the customer service.</li>
            <li>and I so appreciate that so much!  </li>
            <li>you are only supposed to apply it to the top lid lashes.  </li>
            <li>Been using this consistently as instructed for 1.5 months.</li>
            <li>ReLASH doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and contains more product for the money compared to RapidLash and Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>I put this serum on at night for a week or so and now my lashes are back and healthy as ever.</li>
            <li>You need to be consistent in applying it every day, I saw results within a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in my eyelash thickness and length - nothing over the top but enough that I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian, and I think for the most part, we are not known for our luscious eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I purchase this lash growth liquid first time 6/11/15 now reviwing this item</li>
            <li>You apply this before going to bed on top of the eyelid above the lash line.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>After 6 weeks of consistent use, I am not seeing any results.</li>
            <li>Anyway when this product first arrived I gave it the sniff test.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product if you want more volume and length in your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>This product is pretty inexpensive compared to a lot she has tried.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased I bought it a second time.</li>
            <li>I have my sexy glam look back</li>
            <li>Then I noticed many of my lashes are longer and they have definitely thickened up.</li>
            <li>As I said in my first review, the Lilash had stopped working as well so either it&#x27;s the combination of these two products that is working</li>
            <li>Either way, my lashes are much better now and certainly a big improvement from what my lashes were like before I had started using these types of products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how much more they grow in the next 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>I think the results are more pronounced, and I only apply it at night.</li>
            <li>and it really does work!</li>
            <li>Once its on you really can&#x27;t tell that you even put it on!</li>
            <li>NO fake lashes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll most likely buy it again</li>
            <li>I have bought many different brands including ones from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>So very grateful!</li>
            <li>it really works!</li>
            <li>They definitely look thicker and more contoured.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>my lashes and grow more because I was getting eyelash extensions and was told having more/stronger lashes would make the extensions look fuller and last longer.</li>
            <li>Thanks RELASH!</li>
            <li>Much better than the similar prescription product.</li>
            <li>From experience I expect that to l see more lash length in the next couple of week.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This works and after the first week my lashes were longer.</li>
            <li>I was worried that this would be super oily or irritating, but it worked great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just super excited to share my story and hope anyone who had the same issue as mine will try it and see the results for themselves.</li>
            <li>The product was was just OK, but the seller was terrific, very helpful.</li>
            <li>Still waiting for positive results.</li>
            <li>They even offer an Amazon gift card if you post pictures of positive results.</li>
            <li>My lashes are positively longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that these positive changes continue.  </li>
            <li>I love relash serum, I was getting eye lash extensions for a year and they damaged my eyelashes, so I stopped and when they all fell off I would use mascara and realized my lashes weren&#x27;t as long anymore</li>
            <li>I so wanted to love this product after having been a long time Latisse user, which produced lashes that were truly plush.  </li>
            <li>I had been using Rapidlash, which at first worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Quite honestly, after at least 3 weeks of using the product I have not seen any significant difference.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I use Younique&#x27;s 3 d fiber lash mascara and love it just wanted a little extra help with fuller lashes</li>
            <li>I used it almost every night for the last 6 weeks and they&#x27;ve steadily grown and become thicker, more voluminous.</li>
            <li>The price is right and the quantity is more than you receive on the other brands.  </li>
            <li>I am just starting to use the product, which had strong positive reviews, so my expectations are very high.  </li>
            <li>I have used most of my first order and will buy again when the tube is empty.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes look thick, long and beautiful!!  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers mentioned, the tube and applicator are super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Will update in a few more weeks, but at this point reLASH seems like a winner!</li>
            <li>I recommend this mascara to anyone looking for bold, dramatic, sexy eyes with no clumps and easy take</li>
            <li>It is probably a very good product that I just happen to be allergic to, I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
            <li>I havent noticed much difference other than my brows and lashes seem super soft, but Im sure in time</li>
            <li>My lashes are really showing a huge improvement after only using for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is soooo much cheaper, and within the 6 days of using this, I have noticed my eyelashes are much thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>I did not have much hope in seeing my eyelashes growth, but it did growth after 6 weeks of using this serum.</li>
            <li>So if it seems as though the product is no longer working, it&#x27;s really that the follicles are taking a break.</li>
            <li>really like using a eyelash enhancer,  and will probably stick with this brand.</li>
            <li>Used for 2 months, didn&#x27;t see much change.</li>
            <li>Well, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Some have grown a bit straight, squiggly/spidey looking</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>, brows grew longer not so much thicker</li>
            <li>Really does work , my eyebrows are filling in.</li>
            <li>I like this product it really works</li>
            <li>It really works for me.</li>
            <li>My eyes really pop when I apply my mascara</li>
            <li>I even had before pictures ready for a before and after review</li>
            <li>DIDNT see much growth</li>
            <li>Absolutely did nothing</li>
            <li>I understand that it takes 4-6 weeks to really see results.  </li>
            <li>Sadly don&#x27;t really notice a thing.</li>
            <li>product really does thicken and extend lashes like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this morning and night and really wanted it to work</li>
            <li>I did not think it would work that fast.</li>
            <li>and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum</li>
            <li>I have a supplier who gives me a huge discount, so it&#x27;s not much of a difference especially since Latisse works so much better, and is clinically proven.</li>
            <li>and I used it for two months straight.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much, I would recommend.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for the month to see how much fuller and longer they will get.</li>
            <li>But with this product my eyes always felt normal and my lashes got much longer and thicker!</li>
            <li>I didn’t smell anything that would make me question the product too much.</li>
            <li>The growth I have noticed isn&#x27;t really substantial.</li>
            <li>really works</li>
            <li>Although I do see a difference in the thickness of my lashes,  my eyes are very irritated when I use the product.</li>
            <li>Grow so fast I have to get eyebrows waxed</li>
            <li>Very encouraged.</li>
            <li>They also say they have twice as much in their applicator bottle.</li>
            <li>My lashes are not any thicker, but the areas where my lashes were falling out has filled back in.</li>
            <li>So I have some gabs of no hair which really scares me.</li>
            <li>Has really made a difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Fast forward 3 weeks</li>
            <li>Never thought it could make this much of a difference</li>
            <li>This is not just another “hope it works” product… it’s the real stuff</li>
            <li>It is gentle, and I believe I see hair growth in the brows, the lashes seem to be longer.</li>
            <li>This product really thickened both my lashes and my brows.</li>
            <li>It took just about two weeks to really start to see the difference, so I would recommend getting it and putting in the time.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really tell if I like it or not.</li>
            <li>so why not get the results at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>The one star is because the product really didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: If you are unsure about this product, absolutely do get it.</li>
            <li>Today my lashes are much fuller.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look so much healthier.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, my lashes have definitely thinned and I needed something fast and easy...</li>
            <li>Since using the reLash, the difference in thickness and length is now very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I used it very faithfully.</li>
            <li>The downside is that I didn&#x27;t really know when to stop using this product because when my lashes started to grow longer, it eventually started falling off</li>
            <li>I really did like this growth serum.</li>
            <li>because I really wanted to try this out.  </li>
            <li>This item works very well and it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes when applied.</li>
            <li>really like it.</li>
            <li>but nothing really helpedâ€</li>
            <li>when I used mascara my lashes still appeared very shortâ€</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t really see any difference, but have noticed that my lashes are not falling out as much</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten a few nice compliments.</li>
            <li>Conditioning my lashes with natural vitamin E oil for the last year and this worked better for me than anything else I tried.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome and I will recommend it to any women have short and thin</li>
            <li>Just started using it but excited to see how the growth works, I was doing fake lashes and extensions but hope this is a good alternTive</li>
            <li>Most women love long eyelashes but some of us has to have a little help.</li>
            <li>A couple of months ago, I lost a significant number of eye lashes that left areas on my lashes with no lashes at all.  </li>
            <li>My other favorite thing about it is that I didn&#x27;t feel it at night OR in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I actually get excited to put makeup on in the morning</li>
            <li>Just this morning I looked in the mirror as I applied my mascara - and noticed a significant difference in last fullness and length.  </li>
            <li>My skin gotten better, but my eyebrows and eyelashes started falling out due to</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ve always had descent eyelashes, so I honestly didn&#x27;t think this would do anything at all, but since I stopped wearing makeup, I wanted my eyelashes to look long and thick without mascara, so I figured, why not?  </li>
            <li>I would recommend reLASH to anyone who wants to have their natural lashes grow in fuller or stimulate areas where lashes seem a bit sparse if willing to diligently follow the directions for a clean face, especially around the eyes, for a period of time.</li>
            <li>The active ingredient in most of these eyelash growth serums is Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17.</li>
            <li>My glasses were slightly in my way as I applied the reLASH Serum, but I was able to apply without to much fuss.</li>
            <li>My eyes tend to water if someone sneezes within a ten foot radius (meaning, my eyes water really easily) and using almost any product near my eyes is a no go.</li>
            <li>My blue eyes are very sensitive and reLash goes on smooth, stays all night with no creeping and my eyes look refreshed in the morning with thicker and longer lashes.  </li>
            <li>I finally have a full brow; never have in my life.  </li>
            <li>- found this product used daily and my lashes have now grown and full...</li>
            <li>No skin problems with this, and I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t sting my eyes or irritate them at all, and my eyes are pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have never had such full lashes.</li>
            <li>Thus far, no ill effects.</li>
            <li>With clean eyelashes free of make up, and contacts removed, apply a small line of the serum and call it a night.</li>
            <li>Relash works better than any other lash product!</li>
            <li>After only two weeks of use, my aestiocian was noticing significant growth, and new lash growth</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s kind of hard to absolutely verify.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to eyelash extensions that are super expensive!</li>
            <li>Rapid Lash was okay, my lashes did grow and slightly thicken</li>
            <li>2 Months of steady use and no results.  </li>
            <li>I have found now that as I am getting older that my lashes are not how they used to be.</li>
            <li>i have paid over $50 for &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; eyelashes that are glued on to my own, and that was a complete waste.</li>
            <li>The size is larger at 7.4 ml than most similar products.</li>
            <li>You simply apply it from the inner top corner along the lash line to the outer corner.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older my lashes have thinned out.</li>
            <li>My upper lashes are getting a little more full, and lower lashes ...</li>
            <li>bought it as Reviews are quite nice, but not satisfied as much as they marked until now.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I high recommend buying this product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly commend this.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I immediately went on amazon to find a growth serum and saw that this was highly rated.</li>
            <li>If you need immediate growth then I  highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I totally highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;Dana</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have high hopes and will probably return it.</li>
            <li>received this, along with other similar serums,  at a discount price so that I could test them and provide an honest evaluation.</li>
            <li>Ive tried many eyelash serum and this one didnt seem to help my eyelashes maybe a little on eyebrows</li>
            <li>reLASH is super easy to apply, and nothing negative to report in regards to itching or burning which is a relief.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend to anyone that has lost eyelash length due to age, menopause, etc.</li>
            <li>I think the positive reviews are because the sellers constantly email you after purchasing and prompt you to write a positive review.</li>
            <li>I regrew some eyebrow and they generally had a better appearance --even getting growth where empty patches had been --  and my eyelashes got quite a bit longer.  </li>
            <li>The eyebrows regrew but are not thick.  </li>
            <li>Really does work...so surprised.</li>
            <li>but I am sure will be a bit difference after few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had long full eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I was recently in the dentist chair having my teeth cleaned and both the hygienist and dentist commented on how long and lovely my eyelashes were.  </li>
            <li>I had no negative effects, but for the price and underwhelming results, i&#x27;ll stick to a cheaper product.</li>
            <li>This may not work for everyone because everyone is different but it&#x27;s worth the try.</li>
            <li>I just ran out and will be ordering more as my brows are still not completely grown in enough as I would like.</li>
            <li>I normally apply after I wash my face</li>
            <li>I missed a few days and feel more motivated now to use it twice a day and see what happens.</li>
            <li>The Wife loves this product normally things like this</li>
            <li>The product is definitely worth trying and they send you a coupon for 10% off your next purchase.</li>
            <li>I plan to keep using it to keep my eyelashes looking full and long.</li>
            <li>but they are stronger and slightly longer and not to mention happy without the harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>I have to say that I did not have a reaction which is a big thing right there.</li>
            <li>My eyebrow hair is not coming out as well on the left side as it is on the right.</li>
            <li>I have short, stubby lashes and have been waiting around for just the right product to come out</li>
            <li>Unlike any other growth serum available</li>
            <li>, I have tons of new hair</li>
            <li>I thought I was supposed to use it at night for the purpose of new lash growth and thicker lashes.  </li>
            <li>I am seeing new growth where there were no lashes before.</li>
            <li>I used Latisse while living in California, and thought I might try something new after moving to the east coast.</li>
            <li>so I try new ones every six months or so.</li>
            <li>and I lost all my new lashes that I gain with Latisse.</li>
            <li>Of course in the morning I checked for new growth and saw nothing.</li>
            <li>This is her new go to product.</li>
            <li>My girl said that she needed a new eyelash from the store, i said hold on, I got something coming.</li>
            <li>Well, as one grows older (I&#x27;m now in my early 70s)</li>
            <li>Considering natural aging, and the tendency for thyroid problems to exaggerate hair loss in lash and brow, I may have had decent results....</li>
            <li>so far they stay long and full.  </li>
            <li>My left lashes are very much thicker.</li>
            <li>and so my eyes are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>so far i see no results at all!</li>
            <li>My first eye lash serum ever used was &amp;#34;rapid lash&amp;#34; it worked well but decided to try a different brand..</li>
            <li>like the other lash friendly additional ingredients in reLash - keratin, silk, corn soy and wheat protein.</li>
            <li>Apparently it has worked really well for others</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Wow it HAS made a difference!  </li>
            <li>Last night was my 39th night to use re-lash and unfortunately  no results yet.  </li>
            <li>I have applied my first coat tonight, and will be back in a week or two to post results.</li>
            <li>There are other products out there that do the same thing for a lot more money</li>
            <li>I have noticed a considerable amount of growth in my eyelashes in a matter or a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed improvement but not drastic enough to rated any higher.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Have to use rest of product to see how far I can go!</li>
            <li>They started growing after a couple of weeks - just a little bit, nothing major, but it gave me hope for even better results at the end of the treatment.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend reLASH to anybody interested in getting, longer, stronger lashes</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend the eyelash growth serum as part of a stellar beauty regime.  </li>
            <li>Other lash serums I&#x27;ve used have worked wonders and I was excited to try this one.</li>
            <li>really nice and much more affordable than that other expensive brand that Ms Shields promotes.  </li>
            <li>well, I barely had any before; now I have a normal looking lash line (even tho don&#x27;t apply to lower lashes, I think the solution migrates onto them when I close my eyes)!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any improvement and quickly returned to buying the more expensive Latisse.</li>
            <li>Putting on mascara is now fun because I love to see how thick my lashes will look!!</li>
            <li>They pretty much all have that as a basis, then the other ingredients vary.</li>
            <li>A little thicker (good) and a little longer (maybe not so good).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I recently (accidentally) cut a large chunk out of my eyelash trying to trim my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>heard from many people that their eye lash growth serum bruns a little bit and their lash line were often red after they applied it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>If your are transitioning from eyelash extensions to your natural lashes then give reLASH a try.</li>
            <li>Still too early to see it work</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it, but I would also say keep your expectations reasonable.</li>
            <li>I am so surprised at this product...  </li>
            <li>My lashes are much fuller and are starting to grow longer.</li>
            <li>I am always on the hunt for products for my 75 year old grandma.</li>
            <li>Has not done any thing so far</li>
            <li>I was in a complete panic, I could not even curl my lashes and use mascara be</li>
            <li>The company offers a money-back guarantee.</li>
            <li>Wow - 6 things that I like about this product.  </li>
            <li>will grown longer than my natural lash length.</li>
            <li>I have noticed after using relash over the last 3 to 4 weeks that my lashes are really improving.</li>
            <li>So far I have seen no improvement</li>
            <li>so far.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and can&#x27;t use those lash extender mascaras.  </li>
            <li>With age and the changes that come with it, my lashes were darn near disappearing.  </li>
            <li>Although I have not really noticed more hairs growing after several weeks of use, each hair gets definitely longer.</li>
            <li>but I seem to have headaches if I use it too frequently...</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to learn that they&#x27;re purchased reviews.</li>
            <li>I can see my eyebrows growing back in where I had thinned them too much at one time.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised - def some reviews that do not seem legit here</li>
            <li>and this morning I was pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li>It simply doesn&#x27;t work, I used LiLash and that really made a difference.</li>
            <li>Now I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>but over time my eyes have gotten so sensitive I have had to even give up on liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I had been getting eyelash extensions for almost a year, but the cost of keeping them up, only to have them fall out in a week was just too much.</li>
            <li>I have seen a very noticeable difference, especially when I wear mascara.</li>
            <li>Within 2 months my lashes are nearly back to pre-chemo length and much fuller than before.</li>
            <li>I have been applying at bedtime and frequently in the morning also.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m surprised at how well it works for me.</li>
            <li>I am a 68 year old woman and was saddened by the natural thinning of my lashes and brows.  </li>
            <li>and it took her a couple weeks to see the results, but she was surprised at how noticeable the difference was.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants that longer lash look.  </li>
            <li>It seems  to be working- haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know for sure on long term.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how much they change in the next month!</li>
            <li>In fact I use it about 4 times a week because with a busy family I just forget.</li>
            <li>But perhaps because of age factor, the brow growth has no color (but at least there is more to tint)</li>
            <li>I applied mascara today for the first time since I started reusing it, and I thought one of my lashes was falling out because it was so long.</li>
            <li>I think one really needs to use the drug bimatroprost because simple conditioners etc aren&#x27;t going to make (one&#x27;s)</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my sensitive eyes at all.</li>
            <li>So much so that I just ordered my second bottle.  </li>
            <li>So I surprised her with this</li>
            <li>, she says it really makes her eyebrows look bigger.</li>
            <li>Since mascara could not cover up the bald spots and my lashes were not growing in fast enough.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Surprised her with it</li>
            <li>Going for the natural route now.</li>
            <li>no eyelashes from wearing individuals eyelashes that pulled out my natural eyelashes.</li>
            <li>And I hav sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>My lashes were already longish from the Latisse use, but so far I have not seen any diminishing lashes.  </li>
            <li>used this product for a month on my brows and lashes, and wow did it do wonders.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>I already have pretty long lashes</li>
            <li>Instructions on back are very clear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to tell the biggest difference, but then again it has only been a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Definitely I will buy few more tubes.</li>
            <li>My lashes are long and full like they used to be when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>After losing most my real lashes from fake ones, it took about 3 weeks to really see the growth.</li>
            <li>True, I&#x27;m 50, lost a lot of lash length after chemo (which also spurred menopause), and I have thyroid problems; even with all that, though, I still can get a pretty good look with mascara; my lashes used to be extravagantly long, so now they&#x27;re just average, though thin individually.</li>
            <li>I dye my lashes black and do no have to wear mascara on a daily basis because the lashes are nice and long now.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a little over a week and see a significant difference in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>reLASH is easy to apply and does not leave your eyes feeling sticky like some I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it four stars is because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised that it didn&#x27;t work for me since many people love it...very disappointed.</li>
            <li>I have had success with other products but not with Relash.  </li>
            <li>nothing, zipo, zilch not a single new lash or longer</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m right in the middle of happy and disappointed.  </li>
            <li>the key is to be consistent in using it daily, and apply it correctly.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed that most the bad reviews are from people who have used a more expensive product (latisse/lilash) before and know what kind of results to expect.</li>
            <li>but what I noticed was that my eyelashes became almost freakishly long but never became much thicker.  </li>
            <li>When I took them all out, my natural lashes were damaged beyond belief, short, split and missing in huge chunks.</li>
            <li>I purchased because I saw a 4.9/5 review, apparently there was quite a bit bias in the early reviewers.</li>
            <li>As much as I loved how long and thick my lashes got (so long they touches my eyeglasses)</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t watered down like many other products, so it won&#x27;t get in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am excited because my lashes got slightly longer and thicker within a short period.</li>
            <li>Well this newly expectant Grammy decided to get all duded up for the big event!  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply, did not cause irritation, or have any negative effects.</li>
            <li>After 9 weeks, I did not see any difference at all in the thickness or length of my lashes (there is still more serum left, I&#x27;d say it lasts at least 3 months).</li>
            <li>I just started using the product for a few days and already seeing mild results.  </li>
            <li>I am not a negative person and usually find something good in everything, but after waiting and waiting to see positive results, I am sad to admit that this product had none.</li>
            <li>Rapid Lash and Urban Decay products seem better in terms of cultivating multiple full lashes over time, but those products have a different feel, with Rapid Lash being slightly irritating if it&#x27;s left on for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>I am a middle aged man who was born with better than average lashes for a man.</li>
            <li>This product claims to have a higher concentration of Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 as other eyelash growth brands.</li>
            <li>I started noticing a difference but nothing major.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted longer lashes, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the hefty price of some of the other serums on the market - nor did I want to buy something that would sting my eyes upon application.</li>
            <li>However, the brush is small enough so you can easily get the serum where it&#x27;s supposed to go, and it never strayed from where I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had naturally long lashes, but as an older gal (61) I&#x27;ve realized they could use some &amp;#34;support&amp;#34;,  so</li>
            <li>I see a MAJOR difference because I had no eyebrows from waxing (which I have stopped) &amp; just in general (runs in my family) and</li>
            <li>Having worked in a lab before, I did a little research...and the non disclosure of actual drug like ingredients worries me... and is likely why their product is no longer available in Tennessee and California.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend of mine who constantly complain how I have longer natural lashes than her.</li>
            <li>Only used it once so far.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve actually seen growth of my lashes.</li>
            <li>(only used once so far).</li>
            <li>There is a reason Latisse costs twice as much and is harder to come by-</li>
            <li>It has been a rather short time, however, so time will tell; but, so far I am liking the product.</li>
            <li>And apparently, I still haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I did extensive googling on the ingredients before using this, and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a problem with thin lashes, but did want some more length to eliminate the need for mascara all the time.  </li>
            <li>I used to have lovely lashes but after years of false eye lashes</li>
            <li>Having some trouble returning it since the company wants it in NEW condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had very sparse lashes and have used other products to help lengthen them.</li>
            <li>I can really see a difference in my lashes as do other people.</li>
            <li>Much easier to apply than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>I originally have long and thick lashes and usually my hair and lashes grow pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I have used few brands before and none of them I felt really worked, I can say this one is a winner so far.    </li>
            <li>The patch in my eyebrow is filled in, and my eyelashes that I lost are slowly coming back in as well</li>
            <li>At first it was a little bit irritable close to my eye, but then I got used to it.</li>
            <li>She began to see growth in just four weeks to lashes that have grown out long thick and full!</li>
            <li>She has complained that her eyelashes have started to thin out (as well as her hair) as she ages, and she is definitely not a false eyelashes kind of person.</li>
            <li>so I was hoping this would be a great alternative. :(</li>
            <li>Apparently my lashes are different on each side.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Latisse in the past and had success with it.  </li>
            <li>As a 56 year old women suffering from thin eyelashes, using this product is much more economical than going to get false eyelashes placed.</li>
            <li>I felt that my eyelashes were actually worse after that treatment because having a foreign product attached to my own eyes only made me want to pull them out or play with them all the time causing them to fall.</li>
            <li>They are very long and lush.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ve been using reLash for a month and a half and my lashes are now much longer, thicker, and fuller.</li>
            <li>But so far I&#x27;m not sure that it really works.</li>
            <li>my lashes are growing back and I&#x27;ve noticed a definite change in the length and fullness of my lashes in general.</li>
            <li>Only Latisse gives you the results of long lush lashes.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this nor be fooled by prompted positive reviews.</li>
            <li>My lashes are already a little longer and fuller, and they&#x27;re much softer to the touch.</li>
            <li>They only gave a little over a month to return the product when most eyelash serums take at least 2-3 months before you start to see results.  </li>
            <li>The reLASH serum works slowly and steadily to create NEW lash AND brow growth, filling in, lengthening and darkening the hairs.</li>

            <li> Used as directed it worked good.</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse and wanted to try this since the reviews were so good.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff here.</li>
            <li> I heard really good things about this reLASH from my friends - keep in mind</li>
            <li> so I guess ths is as good as it gets for me.  </li>
            <li> it works so good</li>
            <li> When I was offered this reLASH Eyelash Growth Serum to try  for a great deal and share my honest opinion about it, of course I ordered immediately.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as good as Latisse, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved this</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> I bought reLASH because I was intrigued by the good reviews it had, and because the company promises to refund your money if the serum doesn&#x27;t do anything for you - no questions asked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and it did what it says it would.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 weeks now seems will doing good job with lashs</li>
            <li> The good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes when putting it on.</li>
            <li> This may not be as good as the reviews say.</li>
            <li> After using this products I am now excited to apply mascara as they are fuller than ever &amp; look incredible!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment, Excellent Product, Great Customer Service A</li>
            <li> Best thing is I don’t have to hear her complaining about short lashes anymore :D</li>

            <li> I suspect some reviews here may not be honest.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t an effective method for me.</li>
            <li> she tried picking my lashes to see if they weren&#x27;t the glue on kind bc</li>

            <li> I strongly believe in taking care of my eyes and reLASH has easily helped me to do that !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month now on my eyebrows and eyelashes (just for good measure) and on one of my eyebrows and both sets of eyelashes it has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> it to have been more effective but having to keep using it</li>
            <li> It feels sooo good now to just look at myself in the mirror and see my lashes more prominent and have more volume than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>

            <li> Great product and great results in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> in comparison, this is probably the best deal I&#x27;ve found and my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> The other products worked fair at best, but then I found reLash.</li>
            <li> Great seller, arrived fast, and this doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like others I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this stuff works!!</li>
            <li> I did not expect it to work so quickly!!</li>
            <li> I am a redhead with very light lashes.  </li>
            <li> Saw results within 2 weeks and even better results within 4 weeks; much better and much more affordable than comparable prescription brand</li>
            <li> A noticed a bit more length in my lashes.</li>
            <li> I love this product for eye lashes.</li>
            <li> :) I apply every night before bed and saw results in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Maybe you need to use more than 1 tube to see any results.</li>
            <li> I have been using re-lash for over a month now and absolutely love it</li>
            <li> ( now it is more fuller and thicker and a bit longer)  </li>
            <li> will buy again :)</li>
            <li> My lashes are thicker, longer, and darker ! :-)</li>
            <li> the eyes are the windows to the soul and most people take them for granted.</li>
            <li> Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> She faithfully uses it morning and evening and has enjoyed the results.  </li>
            <li> My advice to you is to use it more than once a day and may need up to 5-7 weeks to see the result.</li>
            <li> Good for the others who had success seeing</li>
            <li> they are more visible and that&#x27;s a</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this tube until it&#x27;s finished, and may find that with time the results improve even more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product around evening time for most of the month and have stunning results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order more  </li>
            <li> I need to stack up on these ReLash babies and send to my sisters and Mom also :)</li>
            <li> One thing is for sure, this product is better than all the others I tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to wear extensions :)</li>
            <li> Was hoping for more results...</li>
            <li> Better than any eye lash serum I&#x27;ve used.      </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I see the difference and am a satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li> My lashes look better than they ever have.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sure to update if my opinion changes, but I plan to keep applying this serum.  </li>
            <li> so when I saw this I was sure it would work just as well.</li>
            <li> What I know I love about this product is the service from the company.  </li>
            <li> OK, here&#x27;s the deal...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it was okay</li>
            <li> I was able to find Lilash via Overstock and this worked.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;fine too.&lt;br /&gt;They are getting fuller and thicker for sure.</li>
            <li> I have healthy lashes but was hoping they would grow longer which they have not.</li>
            <li> I love mascara, but have found that I do lose some eyelashes.</li>
            <li> In fact it was her favorite gift of the day.  </li>
            <li> Okay I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully every night as the direction states.</li>
            <li> I will give it more time to see if my eyelashes will grow.</li>
            <li> I waited till I had used the product for a couple weeks to make sure it was working.</li>
            <li> and so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m suspicious of many reviews, but want to say up front that I&#x27;m not paid to review products.</li>
            <li> Great product with fast results</li>
            <li> It takes more to apply to my eyebrows but it still does its job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely try it out :) I&#x27;ll order more soon using my coupon too :D</li>
            <li> I love the results from this serum.</li>
            <li> I also want to point out that many of the glowing five-star reviews appear suspicious.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I believe it is going to work better than most.</li>
            <li> I bought another tube to give it more time.</li>
            <li> BUT I WILL KEEP ON USING YOUR PRODUCT, HOPING IT WILL IMPROVE MUCH MORE.  </li>
            <li> it more time..</li>
            <li> it grows more and more..</li>
            <li> growth, so please try to put A LOT on the top of your eyelash for a month then</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> top photo is from 1/29/15...</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love the result!&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Love the product but can&#x27;t tell if it is working yet.</li>
            <li> This stuff truly works i had ripped many eyelashes out from lash extensions</li>
            <li> 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> I have seen more results with City Lash.</li>
            <li> and my eyes have gotten better.</li>
            <li> results were ok.  </li>
            <li> Love this eyelash enhancer.</li>
            <li> so I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to make it 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> 5 stars from me :-)</li>
            <li> :) I use this for my lashes since I use extensions too</li>
            <li> I did go through and look at the ingredients list of many others - Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17</li>
            <li> She totally love this product and I would recommend all the ladies out there to try.</li>
            <li> Careprost is much better alternative.</li>
            <li> Ok can I just say I wish I knew about this product a year ago.</li>
            <li> Most saw results after about 4 weeks of  use.</li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many eyelash growth products, but this one seems to do the trick.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t tell if it worked on my top lashes.  </li>
            <li> I experienced NO irritation, stinging, or eye watering issues, which is just unusual for me with these kinds of products.</li>
            <li> AGAIN, I was incredibly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> In terms of growth it seems to be ok</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for a couple of gifts because I am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for 6 weeks or more now.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product!!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not to sure about my brows.</li>
            <li> Much better smell than products like this</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better for SOME people.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will take some time to see results</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it over and over....</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many eyelash regrowth products over the years that I have lost count.</li>
            <li> My mascara seems to make them fall out more than I would like.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this :-)</li>
            <li> After 3 months of use, I LOVE my fuller and longer lashes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look drastic in the photo, but you do notice fullness and additional length from the before (on top) and after (on the bottom).</li>
            <li> This product was okay</li>
            <li> I have seen improvement, for sure.  </li>
            <li> OK, no joke.  </li>
            <li> and I bought her this to try and her results were much better with Relash.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for results but after many weeks, I don&#x27;t see any difference in my lash length.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for better results.</li>
            <li> I had some shorter lashes that now look to be evening out, which is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I am excited to see the results after more time goes by!</li>
            <li> I will continue the recommended 8 weeks and hopefully see better results.</li>
            <li> As the weeks went by, I noticed that they were also getting thicker and more luscious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> but this product works for me and  is  more affordable,  has healthy ingredients</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I got much better results from Rapid Lash</li>
            <li> I am glad I did</li>
            <li> and I am one satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying this again for sure</li>
            <li> my brows and lashes will be longer and fuller :)</li>
            <li> but you have to make sure you do it all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this product because you have to just apply it once</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t leave home without this product that is for sure.</li>
            <li> The serum has a nice texture and is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> The spot on my eyebrow where it was pierced many years ago has always been thinner than the rest of my brows</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more concerned about my eyebrows rather than my lashes, but I&#x27;m using it on both anyway.</li>
            <li> It was okay, but not as promised</li>
            <li> I need more time to test it out</li>
            <li> you wear contacts, make sure to remove them.</li>
            <li> I feel safe using this product.  </li>
            <li> After using reLASH for  two weeks both my lashes and brows have noticeably more volume.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations so much, and I am honestly so happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is wash your face and remove your makeup ( be sure to remove your contacts).</li>
            <li> Make sure you remove your contact lenses and make up before applying.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to try it and after 3 days of using it</li>
            <li> so i am very familiar with results....</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> This buyer loved his item very much and wanted more but at the time it was out of stock.</li>
            <li> Nice design and has an applicator tip that is like the tip of a fine paintbrush and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The tube and applicator is very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that I do see some new growth, and I expect more to gradually appear as I continue to use this product in the months ahead.</li>
            <li> The serum has a very light texture and was easy to work with as well.  </li>
            <li> I believe that good things come to those who wait ;-)</li>
            <li> she said she never knew i had lashes that long lol!</li>
            <li> After using it for one month my lashes grew fuller and longer and my eyes look even pretty good without using mascara.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled with the smooth transaction and how quickly this product arrived!  </li>
            <li> Okay, this is just too cool!</li>
            <li> Thank you reLASH for putting a smile on my grandmas face!!</li>
            <li> Excited to see some results!</li>
            <li> My lashes look darker and more full!  </li>
            <li> and I am excited to find it!</li>
            <li> So excited about this product!</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to apply.  </li>
            <li> i love the easy application...almost like putting on liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to do this quick video recommending this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Amazing how quickly I saw results (3 wks) Will always have in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Her first comments was there were no bad side effects whatsoever when she put it on, which made her happy.  </li>

            <li> Overall I like this product and since I am already seeing results I am glad I caught this at a great price and am able to share my opinion of it.</li>

            <li> I was really hoping for something good.</li>
            <li> and I was super excited to be able to get a sample of this product and share my experience with the product with you!  </li>

            <li> Because of the personal care that has been provided, I am very confident in giving reLASH 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I see many more eyelashes, especially at the corner; they look so healthy!</li>
            <li> She was super excited that she is able to use something like this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super excited!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a huge difference but every bit helps.</li>
            <li> and it is a huge pain.</li>
            <li> We both see a huge difference in our brows and lashes.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference in my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I will admit I was a huge skeptic.</li>
            <li> i see a huge difference .</li>
            <li> but overall shes just extremely happy as that was one thing</li>
            <li> So I ordered another to see fit</li>
            <li> The growth we saw was just amazing and fast.</li>
            <li> Relash is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about a week and do not expect to see a great change yet.  </li>
            <li> Have always had light, sparse eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled about the results, and would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This product is just fabulous and it does NOT irritate my eyes like rapid lash</li>
            <li> However, the customer service is fantastic and with any product results may vary.</li>
            <li> Also, my lashes went back to the way they were before I used Lilash which worked great for me.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I would give this product a try since it had such great reviews.  </li>
            <li> This is a great serum that is starting to improve the length and density of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> These have been great for the short time being used, but</li>
            <li> My lashes look fantastic.</li>
            <li> Thanks again for this amazing serum</li>
            <li> Its a great product with a money back guarantee</li>
            <li> The applicator is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I also applied to sparse areas of my eyebrows, and they have filled in as well.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m happy with the upper lashes.  </li>
            <li> It works very well, does not irritate, and is effective.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a great amount of growth in the short time I have been using this.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> so far growth is happening works good if used correctly</li>
            <li> so far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> SO far So good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, finding the eLASH Growth Serum was a very exciting</li>
            <li> I am super pleased with how quickly I&#x27;ve seen results with reLash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use, and though it does have directions to keep away from eyes because it may irritate them, I never had that problem</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used rapid lash previous to using this product; the reviews weren&#x27;t as great, but I feel as though that worked better for me....</li>
            <li> First I noticed that my lashes are looking healthy and shiny, then I saw they truly look longer.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Now I have to worry about my eyelashes touching my glasses ( for the first time in my life)</li>
            <li> I decided to try reLASH and have been very pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product consistently every night and most days.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Excited to see how things progress.</li>
            <li> However, about the time I got excited about seeing results, my eyelids started swelling and became itchy.</li>
            <li> I have to alter my original review of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Latisse in the past with awesome results.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I wonder if it&#x27;s worth all the effort!  </li>
            <li> I have used in the past- very impressive!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this as a promotion.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> Boys rarely notice anything!  </li>
            <li> am very pleased with my results this far.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to obtain this product and to give my opinion on it.</li>
            <li> It comes with a very narrow brush that is the perfect size for application</li>
            <li> I was trying to find an alternative that was more natural and more affordable.</li>
            <li> So far I love the results, my lashes are longer, seem fuller and darker!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use right before I go to bed</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and fits right into my bedtime routine.  </li>
            <li> but I felt like there was nothing else I could do just to get that special lash look.</li>
            <li> and I was super excited to start using it immediately...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to have found a product that works and is so easy to use / thanks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> I love this stuff; it really does work.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something that was more reasonable</li>
            <li> The only good thing I can say about it is that it did not irritate my eyes as some reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li> At the end of two months I saw the full results, longer fuller stronger lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a tried and true product for me for years.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works yet, as it says it may take 8 weeks for me to see the full effect.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s dissatisfied with their eyelashes and wants more luscious lashes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using more than a couple of days, can&#x27;t say much about it yet.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff really works</li>
            <li> I ordered the product because I have always loved big eyelashes.</li>
            <li> ( I do these also with relash)....and full and thicker......</li>
            <li> I could not give the product a 5 star because while I have noticed improvement in my brows, I am not noticing much difference in my hopelessly sparse eyelashes where I need it most.</li>
            <li> I have full lashes</li>
            <li> So with this serum it helps provide full lashes.</li>
            <li> And again I have my full lashes as I was born with it.</li>
            <li> Seeing eye lashes grow after month of every day use, can&#x27;t wait for full results.</li>
            <li> My lashes are thinning and I needed something to make them full again.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and I&#x27;m glad about that</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 star review was bc of the length of time it took to see results (which was a good 3 months)</li>
            <li> There is no smell and no bad side effects of this product.</li>
            <li> Also my eyelashes look very healthy, they were feeling kind of dry and brittle before but this has made them feel and look much healthier.</li>
            <li> I have been using it consistently for the past 5 weeks and my lashes are now longer, stronger and more beautiful than when I started.</li>
            <li> For the first 2 weeks, it was fine</li>
            <li> After using this product for about six weeks, I am happy to report all of my lashes have grown back and all of my lashes are much longer.  </li>
            <li> The difference has been tremendous.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> My lashes have grown quickly and it looks a bit thicker than it once was.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly with no flaking.</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased with the service and the product.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift several times and every recipient has been very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> The packaging was very high quality, prefect sized brush and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love my new look, my eyes look wider brighter.</li>
            <li> Previously had used rapid lash with great results  </li>
            <li> Most people with high reviews have it right</li>
            <li> If you know anyone who wants longer lashes tell them to use this!!</li>
            <li> Works very well!!  </li>
            <li> This serum really works!!</li>
            <li> It took a couple of weeks to see results, but I was consistent!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 3 months and it really works!!</li>
            <li> this stuff definitely made my lashes longer, even more than Latisse did!</li>
            <li> Ok so I usually do not write reviews for products I buy from Amazon..</li>
            <li> But I really do recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> he didn&#x27;t believe me it was my real lashes!!</li>
            <li> I will come back in a couple weeks to share more about my experience with reLash!</li>
            <li> when my first tube runs out!</li>
            <li> It thus far has been very comfortable to wear and has not irritated my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have used many eyelash serums in the past, and by far, this is the absolute best!  </li>
            <li> I have been using Grande lash MD for 3 plus months, thought I would try ReLash because of all the positive reviews, and their money back guarantee, but my lashes are noticibly thinner in the last 10 days of use and I do not want to lose all the progress I had (very happy before with the results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super excited about using reLash to help regain what was once one of my most complimented facial features - My Lashes!</li>
            <li> Amazing results after only a couple days!!!</li>
            <li> AMAZING RESULTS IN only 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> In addition to this, I would remove my make up with coconut oil because it really gets off the makeup and also conditions your lashes (AND ITS CHEAP).  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Most of the eyelash serums burn if they get near my eyes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Iam very happy that it delivered a day before I expected however I have been using this product for only one week and have not seen any change.</li>
            <li> I then tried Idol Lash, twice, without much success then moved on to Rapid Lash (purchased twice).  </li>
            <li> My lashes have grown AND become thicker - looking much more natural than with Latisse.  </li>
            <li> better results so far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exciting.</li>
            <li> Worth the $.</li>
            <li> Considering I am 60 yrs old, and have hypothyroidism, I wasn&#x27;t sure of the type of result I would get.</li>
            <li> I love Relash so far.</li>
            <li> so I tried using some fresh brushes.  </li>
            <li> Just started but so far I am pleased</li>
            <li> You should get it, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My lashes not only are longer but more importantly (to me) are thicker.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> and it was definitely worth the price listed.</li>
            <li> I have access to paying wholesale for some of the top lash serums on the marker and this by far exceeds any of their results.....</li>
            <li> Instructions were clear, leaving me feeling confident about application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is so much better so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting compliments and even accusations of false lashes now (which is awesome)</li>
            <li> ; no issues I use it on the top and bottom lashes; I can see a diff in the lower lashes; due to extentions on the top lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Then after using consistently for 2 more weeks, I was like wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen tremendous &amp; consistent growth.</li>
            <li> So anyway, I started using reLash 1 week ago and was invited to go to my newly pregnant daughter&#x27;s first ultrasound today.  </li>
            <li> The right lashes are somewhat thicker.</li>
            <li> I could feel effect almost right away.</li>
            <li> with the right mascara they look like falsies.</li>
            <li> I also have irritation in my right eye, although I put it on with one eye at a time with it close.</li>
            <li> You can also put this on your brows to lengthen them or make your brows thicker (which is &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; right now).  </li>
            <li> Your lashes appear to grow right before your eyes.</li>
            <li> Then by the thrid week my right eye I notice some of my eye lashes are falling out.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li> and of course she jumped right in with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a week, but I notice it is a much higher quality than the kind I used to purchase in stores, and</li>
            <li> They do honor their money back guarantee, and I am pleased that I got a full refund.</li>
            <li> You will have long beautiful lashes in a month or so, but make sure you start using it less once you almost reach the length you wanted.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast (2 days) and after just a week I started to notice my eyelashes not only becoming longer and darker but also fuller with more volume which was really what I wanted!</li>
            <li> But definitely worth the price &amp; MUCH cheaper than lash extensions!</li>
            <li> I think I had more lashes before I tried this, having been using it for 6 weeks and can barely see my lashes even with mascara.</li>
            <li> I have nice long eyelashes up to my eyebrows</li>
            <li> Did not expect to see any difference the first week because the description on Amazon says that it takes 4-6 weeks, so I was surprised when my lashes started becoming stiffer and thicker right away.</li>
            <li> so it keeps my lashes nice and long!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not just the results but the price, and in how large of a tube!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows were thinning in certain spot and this helped thicken them up!</li>
            <li> She always talks about how a lot of guys are lucky by having longer eyelashes when we don&#x27;t really need them.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how easy it is to apply.  </li>
            <li> Glad to have found this gem of a product as such an economical price.</li>
            <li> just make sure the area is clean and dry.</li>
            <li> and I am noticing a slight change in my lashes which is good.</li>
            <li> She said she tried a few different brands and this is the best eyelash growth serum she&#x27;s used</li>
            <li> Make sure your face is fully clean and dry when applying the serum.</li>
            <li> I had used a previous eyelash serum and loved it, and they stopped making it.  </li>
            <li> The serum itself is clear and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are growing back beautifully and are so healthy and thick.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews and trying it for herself, she’s very confident that she’ll get the results she’s hoping for.  </li>
            <li> says:&amp;#34;It beats buying so many different brands of mascara trying to find the right one, then having to apply and remove it every day.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde and my eyebrows and lashes are very light and sparse.  </li>
            <li> She is not a high maintenance gal, but she does like to have nice looking lashes.  </li>
            <li> Very fast service.</li>
            <li> Still working but little bit good than before I think I need times</li>
            <li> After using reLASH for only 5 days I already see a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about these products and that they really work and can be used for the brows too!  </li>
            <li> The ingredient list has a bunch of natural ingredients which is important to me as well.  </li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to apply the serum and have used it consistently for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> She said she could tell in the first 4 weeks that her lashes were getting fuller.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to my friends!!</li>
            <li> Not only can I see a difference, my husband and many of my close friends can as well.</li>
            <li> When this first purchase runs out, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more reLASH.  </li>
            <li> well i am not so consistent at that</li>
            <li> I have used it consistently for over 2 months and have had zero results.</li>
            <li> There was an issue with my first order</li>
            <li> First, let me tell you that I was a Latisse user for awhile.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the best thing about this product was the customer service.</li>
            <li> and I so appreciate that so much!  </li>
            <li> you are only supposed to apply it to the top lid lashes.  </li>
            <li> Been using this consistently as instructed for 1.5 months.</li>
            <li> ReLASH doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and contains more product for the money compared to RapidLash and Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> I put this serum on at night for a week or so and now my lashes are back and healthy as ever.</li>
            <li> You need to be consistent in applying it every day, I saw results within a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in my eyelash thickness and length - nothing over the top but enough that I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian, and I think for the most part, we are not known for our luscious eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this lash growth liquid first time 6/11/15 now reviwing this item</li>
            <li> You apply this before going to bed on top of the eyelid above the lash line.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> After 6 weeks of consistent use, I am not seeing any results.</li>
            <li> Anyway when this product first arrived I gave it the sniff test.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product if you want more volume and length in your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> This product is pretty inexpensive compared to a lot she has tried.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased I bought it a second time.</li>
            <li> I have my sexy glam look back</li>
            <li> Then I noticed many of my lashes are longer and they have definitely thickened up.</li>
            <li> As I said in my first review, the Lilash had stopped working as well so either it&#x27;s the combination of these two products that is working</li>
            <li> Either way, my lashes are much better now and certainly a big improvement from what my lashes were like before I had started using these types of products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how much more they grow in the next 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I think the results are more pronounced, and I only apply it at night.</li>
            <li> and it really does work!</li>
            <li> Once its on you really can&#x27;t tell that you even put it on!</li>
            <li> NO fake lashes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll most likely buy it again</li>
            <li> I have bought many different brands including ones from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> So very grateful!</li>
            <li> it really works!</li>
            <li> They definitely look thicker and more contoured.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> my lashes and grow more because I was getting eyelash extensions and was told having more/stronger lashes would make the extensions look fuller and last longer.</li>
            <li> Thanks RELASH!</li>
            <li> Much better than the similar prescription product.</li>
            <li> From experience I expect that to l see more lash length in the next couple of week.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This works and after the first week my lashes were longer.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this would be super oily or irritating, but it worked great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just super excited to share my story and hope anyone who had the same issue as mine will try it and see the results for themselves.</li>
            <li> The product was was just OK, but the seller was terrific, very helpful.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for positive results.</li>
            <li> They even offer an Amazon gift card if you post pictures of positive results.</li>
            <li> My lashes are positively longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that these positive changes continue.  </li>
            <li> I love relash serum, I was getting eye lash extensions for a year and they damaged my eyelashes, so I stopped and when they all fell off I would use mascara and realized my lashes weren&#x27;t as long anymore</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love this product after having been a long time Latisse user, which produced lashes that were truly plush.  </li>
            <li> I had been using Rapidlash, which at first worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Quite honestly, after at least 3 weeks of using the product I have not seen any significant difference.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I use Younique&#x27;s 3 d fiber lash mascara and love it just wanted a little extra help with fuller lashes</li>
            <li> I used it almost every night for the last 6 weeks and they&#x27;ve steadily grown and become thicker, more voluminous.</li>
            <li> The price is right and the quantity is more than you receive on the other brands.  </li>
            <li> I am just starting to use the product, which had strong positive reviews, so my expectations are very high.  </li>
            <li> I have used most of my first order and will buy again when the tube is empty.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes look thick, long and beautiful!!  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned, the tube and applicator are super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Will update in a few more weeks, but at this point reLASH seems like a winner!</li>
            <li> I recommend this mascara to anyone looking for bold, dramatic, sexy eyes with no clumps and easy take</li>
            <li> It is probably a very good product that I just happen to be allergic to, I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
            <li> I havent noticed much difference other than my brows and lashes seem super soft, but Im sure in time</li>
            <li> My lashes are really showing a huge improvement after only using for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It is soooo much cheaper, and within the 6 days of using this, I have noticed my eyelashes are much thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> I did not have much hope in seeing my eyelashes growth, but it did growth after 6 weeks of using this serum.</li>
            <li> So if it seems as though the product is no longer working, it&#x27;s really that the follicles are taking a break.</li>
            <li> really like using a eyelash enhancer,  and will probably stick with this brand.</li>
            <li> Used for 2 months, didn&#x27;t see much change.</li>
            <li> Well, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Some have grown a bit straight, squiggly/spidey looking</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> , brows grew longer not so much thicker</li>
            <li> Really does work , my eyebrows are filling in.</li>
            <li> I like this product it really works</li>
            <li> It really works for me.</li>
            <li> My eyes really pop when I apply my mascara</li>
            <li> I even had before pictures ready for a before and after review</li>
            <li> DIDNT see much growth</li>
            <li> Absolutely did nothing</li>
            <li> I understand that it takes 4-6 weeks to really see results.  </li>
            <li> Sadly don&#x27;t really notice a thing.</li>
            <li> product really does thicken and extend lashes like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this morning and night and really wanted it to work</li>
            <li> I did not think it would work that fast.</li>
            <li> and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum</li>
            <li> I have a supplier who gives me a huge discount, so it&#x27;s not much of a difference especially since Latisse works so much better, and is clinically proven.</li>
            <li> and I used it for two months straight.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for the month to see how much fuller and longer they will get.</li>
            <li> But with this product my eyes always felt normal and my lashes got much longer and thicker!</li>
            <li> I didn’t smell anything that would make me question the product too much.</li>
            <li> The growth I have noticed isn&#x27;t really substantial.</li>
            <li> really works</li>
            <li> Although I do see a difference in the thickness of my lashes,  my eyes are very irritated when I use the product.</li>
            <li> Grow so fast I have to get eyebrows waxed</li>
            <li> Very encouraged.</li>
            <li> They also say they have twice as much in their applicator bottle.</li>
            <li> My lashes are not any thicker, but the areas where my lashes were falling out has filled back in.</li>
            <li> So I have some gabs of no hair which really scares me.</li>
            <li> Has really made a difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast forward 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Never thought it could make this much of a difference</li>
            <li> This is not just another “hope it works” product… it’s the real stuff</li>
            <li> It is gentle, and I believe I see hair growth in the brows, the lashes seem to be longer.</li>
            <li> This product really thickened both my lashes and my brows.</li>
            <li> It took just about two weeks to really start to see the difference, so I would recommend getting it and putting in the time.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really tell if I like it or not.</li>
            <li> so why not get the results at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> This works really well</li>
            <li> The one star is because the product really didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: If you are unsure about this product, absolutely do get it.</li>
            <li> Today my lashes are much fuller.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look so much healthier.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, my lashes have definitely thinned and I needed something fast and easy...</li>
            <li> Since using the reLash, the difference in thickness and length is now very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I used it very faithfully.</li>
            <li> The downside is that I didn&#x27;t really know when to stop using this product because when my lashes started to grow longer, it eventually started falling off</li>
            <li> I really did like this growth serum.</li>
            <li> because I really wanted to try this out.  </li>
            <li> This item works very well and it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes when applied.</li>
            <li> really like it.</li>
            <li> but nothing really helpedâ€</li>
            <li> when I used mascara my lashes still appeared very shortâ€</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t really see any difference, but have noticed that my lashes are not falling out as much</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten a few nice compliments.</li>
            <li> Conditioning my lashes with natural vitamin E oil for the last year and this worked better for me than anything else I tried.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and I will recommend it to any women have short and thin</li>
            <li> Just started using it but excited to see how the growth works, I was doing fake lashes and extensions but hope this is a good alternTive</li>
            <li> Most women love long eyelashes but some of us has to have a little help.</li>
            <li> A couple of months ago, I lost a significant number of eye lashes that left areas on my lashes with no lashes at all.  </li>
            <li> My other favorite thing about it is that I didn&#x27;t feel it at night OR in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I actually get excited to put makeup on in the morning</li>
            <li> Just this morning I looked in the mirror as I applied my mascara - and noticed a significant difference in last fullness and length.  </li>
            <li> My skin gotten better, but my eyebrows and eyelashes started falling out due to</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve always had descent eyelashes, so I honestly didn&#x27;t think this would do anything at all, but since I stopped wearing makeup, I wanted my eyelashes to look long and thick without mascara, so I figured, why not?  </li>
            <li> I would recommend reLASH to anyone who wants to have their natural lashes grow in fuller or stimulate areas where lashes seem a bit sparse if willing to diligently follow the directions for a clean face, especially around the eyes, for a period of time.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in most of these eyelash growth serums is Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17.</li>
            <li> My glasses were slightly in my way as I applied the reLASH Serum, but I was able to apply without to much fuss.</li>
            <li> My eyes tend to water if someone sneezes within a ten foot radius (meaning, my eyes water really easily) and using almost any product near my eyes is a no go.</li>
            <li> My blue eyes are very sensitive and reLash goes on smooth, stays all night with no creeping and my eyes look refreshed in the morning with thicker and longer lashes.  </li>
            <li> I finally have a full brow; never have in my life.  </li>
            <li> - found this product used daily and my lashes have now grown and full...</li>
            <li> No skin problems with this, and I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t sting my eyes or irritate them at all, and my eyes are pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have never had such full lashes.</li>
            <li> Thus far, no ill effects.</li>
            <li> With clean eyelashes free of make up, and contacts removed, apply a small line of the serum and call it a night.</li>
            <li> Relash works better than any other lash product!</li>
            <li> After only two weeks of use, my aestiocian was noticing significant growth, and new lash growth</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s kind of hard to absolutely verify.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to eyelash extensions that are super expensive!</li>
            <li> Rapid Lash was okay, my lashes did grow and slightly thicken</li>
            <li> 2 Months of steady use and no results.  </li>
            <li> I have found now that as I am getting older that my lashes are not how they used to be.</li>
            <li> i have paid over $50 for &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; eyelashes that are glued on to my own, and that was a complete waste.</li>
            <li> The size is larger at 7.4 ml than most similar products.</li>
            <li> You simply apply it from the inner top corner along the lash line to the outer corner.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older my lashes have thinned out.</li>
            <li> My upper lashes are getting a little more full, and lower lashes ...</li>
            <li> bought it as Reviews are quite nice, but not satisfied as much as they marked until now.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I high recommend buying this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly commend this.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I immediately went on amazon to find a growth serum and saw that this was highly rated.</li>
            <li> If you need immediate growth then I  highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I totally highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;Dana</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have high hopes and will probably return it.</li>
            <li> received this, along with other similar serums,  at a discount price so that I could test them and provide an honest evaluation.</li>
            <li> Ive tried many eyelash serum and this one didnt seem to help my eyelashes maybe a little on eyebrows</li>
            <li> reLASH is super easy to apply, and nothing negative to report in regards to itching or burning which is a relief.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend to anyone that has lost eyelash length due to age, menopause, etc.</li>
            <li> I think the positive reviews are because the sellers constantly email you after purchasing and prompt you to write a positive review.</li>
            <li> I regrew some eyebrow and they generally had a better appearance --even getting growth where empty patches had been --  and my eyelashes got quite a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> The eyebrows regrew but are not thick.  </li>
            <li> Really does work...so surprised.</li>
            <li> but I am sure will be a bit difference after few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had long full eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I was recently in the dentist chair having my teeth cleaned and both the hygienist and dentist commented on how long and lovely my eyelashes were.  </li>
            <li> I had no negative effects, but for the price and underwhelming results, i&#x27;ll stick to a cheaper product.</li>
            <li> This may not work for everyone because everyone is different but it&#x27;s worth the try.</li>
            <li> I just ran out and will be ordering more as my brows are still not completely grown in enough as I would like.</li>
            <li> I normally apply after I wash my face</li>
            <li> I missed a few days and feel more motivated now to use it twice a day and see what happens.</li>
            <li> The Wife loves this product normally things like this</li>
            <li> The product is definitely worth trying and they send you a coupon for 10% off your next purchase.</li>
            <li> I plan to keep using it to keep my eyelashes looking full and long.</li>
            <li> but they are stronger and slightly longer and not to mention happy without the harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> I have to say that I did not have a reaction which is a big thing right there.</li>
            <li> My eyebrow hair is not coming out as well on the left side as it is on the right.</li>
            <li> I have short, stubby lashes and have been waiting around for just the right product to come out</li>
            <li> Unlike any other growth serum available</li>
            <li> , I have tons of new hair</li>
            <li> I thought I was supposed to use it at night for the purpose of new lash growth and thicker lashes.  </li>
            <li> I am seeing new growth where there were no lashes before.</li>
            <li> I used Latisse while living in California, and thought I might try something new after moving to the east coast.</li>
            <li> so I try new ones every six months or so.</li>
            <li> and I lost all my new lashes that I gain with Latisse.</li>
            <li> Of course in the morning I checked for new growth and saw nothing.</li>
            <li> This is her new go to product.</li>
            <li> My girl said that she needed a new eyelash from the store, i said hold on, I got something coming.</li>
            <li> Well, as one grows older (I&#x27;m now in my early 70s)</li>
            <li> Considering natural aging, and the tendency for thyroid problems to exaggerate hair loss in lash and brow, I may have had decent results....</li>
            <li> so far they stay long and full.  </li>
            <li> My left lashes are very much thicker.</li>
            <li> and so my eyes are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> so far i see no results at all!</li>
            <li> My first eye lash serum ever used was &amp;#34;rapid lash&amp;#34; it worked well but decided to try a different brand..</li>
            <li> like the other lash friendly additional ingredients in reLash - keratin, silk, corn soy and wheat protein.</li>
            <li> Apparently it has worked really well for others</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Wow it HAS made a difference!  </li>
            <li> Last night was my 39th night to use re-lash and unfortunately  no results yet.  </li>
            <li> I have applied my first coat tonight, and will be back in a week or two to post results.</li>
            <li> There are other products out there that do the same thing for a lot more money</li>
            <li> I have noticed a considerable amount of growth in my eyelashes in a matter or a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed improvement but not drastic enough to rated any higher.</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Have to use rest of product to see how far I can go!</li>
            <li> They started growing after a couple of weeks - just a little bit, nothing major, but it gave me hope for even better results at the end of the treatment.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend reLASH to anybody interested in getting, longer, stronger lashes</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend the eyelash growth serum as part of a stellar beauty regime.  </li>
            <li> Other lash serums I&#x27;ve used have worked wonders and I was excited to try this one.</li>
            <li> really nice and much more affordable than that other expensive brand that Ms Shields promotes.  </li>
            <li> well, I barely had any before; now I have a normal looking lash line (even tho don&#x27;t apply to lower lashes, I think the solution migrates onto them when I close my eyes)!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement and quickly returned to buying the more expensive Latisse.</li>
            <li> Putting on mascara is now fun because I love to see how thick my lashes will look!!</li>
            <li> They pretty much all have that as a basis, then the other ingredients vary.</li>
            <li> A little thicker (good) and a little longer (maybe not so good).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I recently (accidentally) cut a large chunk out of my eyelash trying to trim my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> heard from many people that their eye lash growth serum bruns a little bit and their lash line were often red after they applied it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> If your are transitioning from eyelash extensions to your natural lashes then give reLASH a try.</li>
            <li> Still too early to see it work</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it, but I would also say keep your expectations reasonable.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised at this product...  </li>
            <li> My lashes are much fuller and are starting to grow longer.</li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for products for my 75 year old grandma.</li>
            <li> Has not done any thing so far</li>
            <li> I was in a complete panic, I could not even curl my lashes and use mascara be</li>
            <li> The company offers a money-back guarantee.</li>
            <li> Wow - 6 things that I like about this product.  </li>
            <li> will grown longer than my natural lash length.</li>
            <li> I have noticed after using relash over the last 3 to 4 weeks that my lashes are really improving.</li>
            <li> So far I have seen no improvement</li>
            <li> so far.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and can&#x27;t use those lash extender mascaras.  </li>
            <li> With age and the changes that come with it, my lashes were darn near disappearing.  </li>
            <li> Although I have not really noticed more hairs growing after several weeks of use, each hair gets definitely longer.</li>
            <li> but I seem to have headaches if I use it too frequently...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to learn that they&#x27;re purchased reviews.</li>
            <li> I can see my eyebrows growing back in where I had thinned them too much at one time.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised - def some reviews that do not seem legit here</li>
            <li> and this morning I was pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t work, I used LiLash and that really made a difference.</li>
            <li> Now I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> but over time my eyes have gotten so sensitive I have had to even give up on liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I had been getting eyelash extensions for almost a year, but the cost of keeping them up, only to have them fall out in a week was just too much.</li>
            <li> I have seen a very noticeable difference, especially when I wear mascara.</li>
            <li> Within 2 months my lashes are nearly back to pre-chemo length and much fuller than before.</li>
            <li> I have been applying at bedtime and frequently in the morning also.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m surprised at how well it works for me.</li>
            <li> I am a 68 year old woman and was saddened by the natural thinning of my lashes and brows.  </li>
            <li> and it took her a couple weeks to see the results, but she was surprised at how noticeable the difference was.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants that longer lash look.  </li>
            <li> It seems  to be working- haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know for sure on long term.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how much they change in the next month!</li>
            <li> In fact I use it about 4 times a week because with a busy family I just forget.</li>
            <li> But perhaps because of age factor, the brow growth has no color (but at least there is more to tint)</li>
            <li> I applied mascara today for the first time since I started reusing it, and I thought one of my lashes was falling out because it was so long.</li>
            <li> I think one really needs to use the drug bimatroprost because simple conditioners etc aren&#x27;t going to make (one&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my sensitive eyes at all.</li>
            <li> So much so that I just ordered my second bottle.  </li>
            <li> So I surprised her with this</li>
            <li> , she says it really makes her eyebrows look bigger.</li>
            <li> Since mascara could not cover up the bald spots and my lashes were not growing in fast enough.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Surprised her with it</li>
            <li> Going for the natural route now.</li>
            <li> no eyelashes from wearing individuals eyelashes that pulled out my natural eyelashes.</li>
            <li> And I hav sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> My lashes were already longish from the Latisse use, but so far I have not seen any diminishing lashes.  </li>
            <li> used this product for a month on my brows and lashes, and wow did it do wonders.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> I already have pretty long lashes</li>
            <li> Instructions on back are very clear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to tell the biggest difference, but then again it has only been a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Definitely I will buy few more tubes.</li>
            <li> My lashes are long and full like they used to be when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> After losing most my real lashes from fake ones, it took about 3 weeks to really see the growth.</li>
            <li> True, I&#x27;m 50, lost a lot of lash length after chemo (which also spurred menopause), and I have thyroid problems; even with all that, though, I still can get a pretty good look with mascara; my lashes used to be extravagantly long, so now they&#x27;re just average, though thin individually.</li>
            <li> I dye my lashes black and do no have to wear mascara on a daily basis because the lashes are nice and long now.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little over a week and see a significant difference in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> reLASH is easy to apply and does not leave your eyes feeling sticky like some I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars is because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised that it didn&#x27;t work for me since many people love it...very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have had success with other products but not with Relash.  </li>
            <li> nothing, zipo, zilch not a single new lash or longer</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m right in the middle of happy and disappointed.  </li>
            <li> the key is to be consistent in using it daily, and apply it correctly.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed that most the bad reviews are from people who have used a more expensive product (latisse/lilash) before and know what kind of results to expect.</li>
            <li> but what I noticed was that my eyelashes became almost freakishly long but never became much thicker.  </li>
            <li> When I took them all out, my natural lashes were damaged beyond belief, short, split and missing in huge chunks.</li>
            <li> I purchased because I saw a 4.9/5 review, apparently there was quite a bit bias in the early reviewers.</li>
            <li> As much as I loved how long and thick my lashes got (so long they touches my eyeglasses)</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t watered down like many other products, so it won&#x27;t get in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am excited because my lashes got slightly longer and thicker within a short period.</li>
            <li> Well this newly expectant Grammy decided to get all duded up for the big event!  </li>
            <li> It was easy to apply, did not cause irritation, or have any negative effects.</li>
            <li> After 9 weeks, I did not see any difference at all in the thickness or length of my lashes (there is still more serum left, I&#x27;d say it lasts at least 3 months).</li>
            <li> I just started using the product for a few days and already seeing mild results.  </li>
            <li> I am not a negative person and usually find something good in everything, but after waiting and waiting to see positive results, I am sad to admit that this product had none.</li>
            <li> Rapid Lash and Urban Decay products seem better in terms of cultivating multiple full lashes over time, but those products have a different feel, with Rapid Lash being slightly irritating if it&#x27;s left on for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged man who was born with better than average lashes for a man.</li>
            <li> This product claims to have a higher concentration of Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 as other eyelash growth brands.</li>
            <li> I started noticing a difference but nothing major.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted longer lashes, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the hefty price of some of the other serums on the market - nor did I want to buy something that would sting my eyes upon application.</li>
            <li> However, the brush is small enough so you can easily get the serum where it&#x27;s supposed to go, and it never strayed from where I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had naturally long lashes, but as an older gal (61) I&#x27;ve realized they could use some &amp;#34;support&amp;#34;,  so</li>
            <li> I see a MAJOR difference because I had no eyebrows from waxing (which I have stopped) &amp; just in general (runs in my family) and</li>
            <li> Having worked in a lab before, I did a little research...and the non disclosure of actual drug like ingredients worries me... and is likely why their product is no longer available in Tennessee and California.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend of mine who constantly complain how I have longer natural lashes than her.</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve actually seen growth of my lashes.</li>
            <li> (only used once so far).</li>
            <li> There is a reason Latisse costs twice as much and is harder to come by-</li>
            <li> It has been a rather short time, however, so time will tell; but, so far I am liking the product.</li>
            <li> And apparently, I still haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I did extensive googling on the ingredients before using this, and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with thin lashes, but did want some more length to eliminate the need for mascara all the time.  </li>
            <li> I used to have lovely lashes but after years of false eye lashes</li>
            <li> Having some trouble returning it since the company wants it in NEW condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very sparse lashes and have used other products to help lengthen them.</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in my lashes as do other people.</li>
            <li> Much easier to apply than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I originally have long and thick lashes and usually my hair and lashes grow pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I have used few brands before and none of them I felt really worked, I can say this one is a winner so far.    </li>
            <li> The patch in my eyebrow is filled in, and my eyelashes that I lost are slowly coming back in as well</li>
            <li> At first it was a little bit irritable close to my eye, but then I got used to it.</li>
            <li> She began to see growth in just four weeks to lashes that have grown out long thick and full!</li>
            <li> She has complained that her eyelashes have started to thin out (as well as her hair) as she ages, and she is definitely not a false eyelashes kind of person.</li>
            <li> so I was hoping this would be a great alternative. :(</li>
            <li> Apparently my lashes are different on each side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Latisse in the past and had success with it.  </li>
            <li> As a 56 year old women suffering from thin eyelashes, using this product is much more economical than going to get false eyelashes placed.</li>
            <li> I felt that my eyelashes were actually worse after that treatment because having a foreign product attached to my own eyes only made me want to pull them out or play with them all the time causing them to fall.</li>
            <li> They are very long and lush.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve been using reLash for a month and a half and my lashes are now much longer, thicker, and fuller.</li>
            <li> But so far I&#x27;m not sure that it really works.</li>
            <li> my lashes are growing back and I&#x27;ve noticed a definite change in the length and fullness of my lashes in general.</li>
            <li> Only Latisse gives you the results of long lush lashes.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this nor be fooled by prompted positive reviews.</li>
            <li> My lashes are already a little longer and fuller, and they&#x27;re much softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> They only gave a little over a month to return the product when most eyelash serums take at least 2-3 months before you start to see results.  </li>
            <li> The reLASH serum works slowly and steadily to create NEW lash AND brow growth, filling in, lengthening and darkening the hairs.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I saw this product because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just clever marketing or if lashes could actually grow faster with the help of a serum.</li>
            <li> I am 79 years old and wonder if I am past the point of getting any new growth.  </li>
            <li> Also, from a person who has absolutely NO beauty regimen, this is very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel weird on your eye.  </li>
            <li> , only mistake I made was I put it on one eye and not the other to see how well it worked, now I have one eye with way thicker increased lashes, and ever so much longer, and the other eye is sitting there like helloooo me to please.</li>
            <li> my eyelash has definitely grew little longer and I had new eyelashes coming out in the inner corner of my eyes that I have lost some of them before.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend to anyone who needs a little boost.</li>
            <li> So I can say that after not using it for several months, and having the resulting thinning lashes that naturally come with aging, that my lasheshave thickened up and gotten longer in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working not sure really.</li>
            <li> They have grown so long that they rise above my droopy eyelid skin now!  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product long enough it  to see results I need to</li>
            <li> But if I use it regularly, it will make my lashes grow long until it falls again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause any type of stinging and the gel is pretty thick</li>
            <li> so I am always a little gun shy when it comes to putting any kind of serum etc there.</li>
            <li> Well that&#x27;s my little secret :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would work but a few weeks of diligent application, I began to see new hair growth in my lashes.</li>
            <li> I apply it at night after I&#x27;ve washed my face and it only takes seconds to apply and a couple of minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work because my lashes are so thin, but after a few weeks,...</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have grown in fuller than ever in my life because they have always been thin and my eyelashes are full and long.</li>
            <li> but I am starting to notice a difference in the thickness of the lashes, particularly at the base where I most wanted the change.</li>
            <li> No new growth, not even a tiny bit thicker..</li>
            <li> Before I purchased reLASH, I considered the reviews, both positive and negative; but in the end I made the decision to purchase reLASH.</li>
            <li> My eyes are very sensitive, and in the past, similar products have either stung or caused my eyes to water and be irritated for hours after use.</li>
            <li> It is a little early to tell</li>
            <li> I get comments all the time about how long my lashes are, even from strangers.</li>
            <li> Hopefully someday in the not too distant future I won&#x27;t even have to use brow liner!</li>
            <li> However for long term results I cannot recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> My friends all have long lashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 60 and used to have long lashes.  </li>
            <li> Not as long as I&#x27;d like,</li>
            <li> no for long term use.</li>
            <li> People always compliment me on how long my lashes look with mascara on</li>
            <li> I have long lashes but they needed a bit of thickening.</li>
            <li> I kept waiting for long or even semi long lashes and it just didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has been a long time.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money</li>
            <li> My lashes aren&#x27;t as long as falsies</li>
            <li> (my lashes are blonde &amp; were once not very full/long)</li>
            <li> I have not been using it too long...</li>
            <li> so I would have a good base to adhere to.  </li>
            <li> faster).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually applied twice a day for the first two weeks, then tapered down to once at night.</li>
            <li> reLash is less expensive and is really better for me.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this for less than a week and have incorporated it into my daily routine of applying it in the morning before my makeup and in the evening after I remove all makeup.</li>
            <li> considering how bad my lashes and brows were its still worth it!!!  </li>
            <li> It seemed like it took a little longer to start working,  but that&#x27;s no big deal, because none of these products work instantly.&lt;br /&gt;Remember it&#x27;s only stimulating the eyelash follicles you already have, and those follicles will need a rest.  </li>
            <li> So far maybe a little bit of difference, but not much.  </li>
            <li> This helped but not enough for me to warrant a other purchase.</li>
            <li> For me I have always been obsessed with my eye lashes and having long thick amazing lashes.</li>
            <li> For the last 3 weeks I have used Latisse on one eye and relash on the other.  </li>
            <li> makes me eyelashes SO LONG!</li>
            <li> But, with some of the reviews I&#x27;d read, including one from an older woman with thyroid problems (or at least, that was what was stated), that I&#x27;d see some benefit from this product, even though I&#x27;ve never heard of anything other than Latisse that actually worked on eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are noticeably longer and I haven&#x27;t been using the product for very long.</li>
            <li> my sister is going to buy her a bottle of it too; she can see a difference in her brows already and has not been using it very long.</li>
            <li> I have been using religiously for over a month now and have seen very minimal results.</li>
            <li> but it worked just as well as other more expensive products and brought back some brow hair i had been missing for years.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take very long before visible results started to show.</li>
            <li> It did however leave my eyes feeling dry and changed my eye color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this eyelash serum for a few days, so obviously I haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic difference in the length or fullness of my lashes....</li>
            <li> I also took hair, skin &amp; nail vitamins &amp; an extra 5000 Mcg dose of Biotin everyday the last month which I think also helped boost my results!</li>
            <li> So I starting using Relash a few weeks ago and my lashes are not only noticeably longer but thicker as well.  </li>
            <li> I only applied it to the area missing lashes because I did not want to risk having my lashes at different lengths.</li>
            <li> From the googling that I did, it seems that the active ingredient in this is the same as that in growth serums in the price range of $200!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and so far it hasn&#x27;t been irritating me.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product to help you regrow, thicken, and enhance your lashes on a permanent basis without irritation or the expense of having false ones applied and constantly maintained, I highly recommend reLash!</li>
            <li> After 5 weeks I can detect no new growth whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worked on my eyelashes as well, but I&#x27;m going to wait a few weeks until I make that major judgment.</li>
            <li> it works better than the expensive brands I have tried and in half the time!  </li>
            <li> she&#x27;s gives me a all these hugs every single time she see me</li>
            <li> Used per directions every single morning and evening for over 90 days.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this product nightly for over 2 months, without a single day off.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend because she is constantly spending money on fake eyelashes then has nothing but problems with the ones she buys, shes is absolutely blown away by this product, not only</li>
            <li> after 7 weeks so not sure if it&#x27;s just time and natural growing cycle is what&#x27;s doing it.</li>
            <li> Although I have dark lashes, they are very short, stubby.</li>
            <li> After running out they slowly returned to normal and I wanted to find a replaced.</li>
            <li> so you have nothing to loose.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to apply to the base of my lashes with short strokes.</li>
            <li> Even very long!</li>
            <li> The 1st picture was taken the day I started, the 2nd is about 3 and a half weeks in to the process.</li>
            <li> It has madey lashes thick and long and lush.</li>
            <li> I used another much more expensive product in the past, and got faster results, but GUESS WHAT?</li>
            <li> my lashes were only slightly fuller after 6 weeks of continuous nightly use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for less then a couple weeks and already see growth on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Even using it less than recommended it has made a BIG difference!  </li>
            <li> Totally comparable to prescription products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, but at a third of the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after pulling out half of my lashes on my left eye by accident with an eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> have only been using about  a week and a half</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks since I started using this, but I think it has lengthened my lashes a little bit.</li>
            <li> I used other lash products partially in the past, and fellt that this item is far better...cost, and performance.</li>
            <li> I can actually see little lashes growing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little over a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only seen a little difference</li>
            <li> As it was, I had a little space between a few eyelashes, (probably only noticeable by me), but I wanted to see if I noticed any growth in that tiny area before commenting.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to hear about this product because it&#x27;s so much less expensive than Latisse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much less expensive product too, than Lilash which is another reason I was so excited.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint which isn&#x27;t about the product is my eye brows are so blonde</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for at least a month every night and so far see absolutely no result.</li>
            <li> more so I can basically start over after a horrible waxing experience haha :</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> put some on my eyebrows that are receding at the center end,  and they are responding.</li>
            <li> A few days later, you will not believe what happened!!</li>
            <li> Have followed instructions but absolutely no growth.</li>
            <li> Has not really helped my lashes grow longer.</li>
            <li> No real noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no noted changes in eye lash length.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only had it/used for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I tried apply liquid on all over the upper eyelash which means almost covered and heavy pn</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks I noticed missing lashes were growing back in.</li>
            <li> Well I have had this for roughly 10 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll come back in a few weeks and let you know how well the product is working for me.</li>
            <li> I used it for 21/2 months and there was absolutely no difference whatsoever in my eyelash length.</li>
            <li> and while I think the lashes may be longer, they are not much fuller and once again, no change in color.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well without irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> I got this order of reLASH Eyelash Serum for my wife and it only arrived a few days ago and she has only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> A total waste.</li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable but would of been worth it , if it worked, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> expected, it took about 4-5 weeks for me to start noticing a difference</li>
            <li> and I expect my lashes to grow even longer in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using reLASH for a few weeks - putting it on my upper lid lash line before going to sleep.  </li>
            <li> so I expected two.</li>
            <li> need this as hair is harder to grow as we age.</li>
            <li> I have never really used anything like this before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months and there are absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> Not a huge difference, but enough for me to tell.</li>
            <li> but I continued on using it nevertheless, simply bc I was SICK of the hassle of paying to get my lashes done all  the time &amp; was desperate for my own natural ones back!</li>
            <li> I apply the serum along the base of my upper lashes after washing my makeup off at night - the little brush applicator makes it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Certainly no adverse effects.</li>
            <li> Certainly do not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a mascara product that a few of my friends sell that is supposed to make your lashes fuller immediately, but I&#x27;ve been leery to try it due to the concern that the fibers would get into my eyes and cause that hours of irritation, plus I simply don&#x27;t have the time to apply 3 coats of that product to create temporary results.</li>
            <li> They eyelashes grew long, but not full.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use my eyelash curler anymore because my lashes are long and thick enough now.</li>
            <li> Being an Asian girl, long thick eyelashes are just not part of the deal.  </li>
            <li> Definitely buying again..makes them long and thick.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older my eyelashes have started to thin out.</li>
            <li> I started noticing thicker eyelashes after only a few uses!</li>
            <li> this is way cheaper and safer than other other products that irritated my eyes.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve bought things like these online that ended up being knockoffs and not working.</li>
            <li> so I was pretty skeptical about this one but wanted to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> So, since I still have the other lash growth serum...</li>
            <li> I wait until ReLASH dries and then apply the other to my lower lash line.  </li>
            <li> My sister and I purchased two of the leading products to see there results side by side of each other.</li>
            <li> She began use of reLash, I used the other brand.</li>
            <li> So, drop off on your other brands, this is the one.</li>
            <li> I have used other growth serums before and never had a problem.</li>
            <li> like the OTHER guy&#x27;s product</li>
            <li> Smelled nothing like the other things that I have tried that just literally brought tears to my eyes.</li>
            <li> but it also worked continuously with the use the of the other product.</li>
            <li> but that could be due to the biotin I&#x27;m taking.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wonder if other reviews are paid for or what?  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only had it a few months!  </li>
            <li> I also have a couple little tiny patches in my eyebrows where the little hairs had stopped growing in</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on how this works in comparison to other products</li>
            <li> Even if I didn&#x27;t, this is cheaper than any other product like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other eyelash serums for regrowth, but this does seem to help my lashes grow faster, and longer.</li>
            <li> I am trying to now play catch up to get the other eye with this one.</li>
            <li> does not appear to work as well as other brands.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other lash lengthening serums, but this product seems to give faster results and my eyelashes are darker, which I like.  </li>
            <li> I was wary at first since I wear contact lenses</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first and did a lot of research and decided to go with ReLash.</li>
            <li> and my dermatologist prescribe me accutane and some other tropical cream that helped me with my acne.</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse in the past and frankly, that is the ONLY product that has worked.</li>
            <li> This was my first shot at an eyelash serum, and I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I do not exaggerate when I say that my lashes have doubled in quantity, but be aware that my lashes were very thin to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I bought it after reading the reviews here and even though I was skeptical about positive reports after two weeks</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t really made any difference on my other eyebrow, but I&#x27;m going to assume that&#x27;s my issue since it has been working so well otherwise.</li>
            <li> It is a little harder to apply than I had thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the only thing that changed was I gained red, raw, bases of lashes/eyelids that actually scabbed!</li>
            <li> I used to have a bare patch in my left eyebrow that made it difficult to get my eyebrows to look symmetrical.</li>
            <li> My dark youthful lashes were disappearing until I used this product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a success story</li>
            <li> This product definitely works, at least for me it does.  </li>
            <li> Always complained about her short lashes compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> Putting on mascara is never fun for me.</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; thing about it was at least it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> After reading some horror stories about women who used different products on their hair to aid with growth, I was a bit concerned, but laboratory testing on the ingredients in this didn&#x27;t turn up anything negative.</li>
            <li> It looks like the base of my lashes became thicker, so they spread out a bit and popped up making them look better already.</li>
            <li> Wearing false lashes from the salons pulled out my natural lashes.</li>
            <li> I have been spending much more on Latisse and their annoying brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this product.</li>
            <li> and they have to be trimmed down with scissors.</li>
            <li> I have tried other growth type products will little change</li>
            <li> I started applying my reLASH product last night and am anxiously awaiting my reLASH results!  </li>
            <li> I just thought I&#x27;d try a serum that was less expensive and bought because of the high ratings from other users.  </li>
            <li> I have not been using this product long enough to see dramatic results, but I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> After using this for several months, this makes a few lashes very long but thin.</li>
            <li> I feel slight change</li>
            <li> It worked but it was twice the price and less amount in the container.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first as I was not sure how my skin would react</li>
            <li> About 2 and a half weeks ago, my lancome eyelash curler cut a chunk of my eyelashes off.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Eyelash Growth Serum for a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product did not work for me at all despite using it religiously, twice daily in the morning and evening, as directed.</li>
            <li> I am not allergic to anything but this slightly burned me.  </li>
            <li> I think there might be a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and half now.</li>
            <li> I previously used an eyebrow pencil to fill in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My lashes also were falling out less, which I noticed.</li>
            <li> and I have way less breakage.  </li>
            <li> In less than a month I noticed my brows seemed to be getting thicker.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about a week and a half and can feel my lashes thickening.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even made a comment and asked if I was wearing fake lashes when I curled and did my normal make up routine.</li>
            <li> Why put the 180 day return policy when it is not true?  </li>
            <li> I was devastated and desperate for a fast fix!</li>
            <li> my eyelashes were were lusciously long and divinely thick...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week</li>
            <li> but i had for a little over a month and barly seeing any diff</li>
            <li> little thickness in lashes</li>
            <li> but I do notice that my lashes are a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely leery to buy this product because my past experience has been that miracle products like this never work the way they claim.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was a little cheaper but</li>
            <li> My lashes seem a little longer.</li>
            <li> I could also see my eyelashes looking a little longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> And they grew a little longer, I&#x27;m still using it</li>
            <li> No side effects, except for a little discoloration along the lash line.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s little irritate my eye so apply not close to eyes</li>
            <li> well I have done a little damage.</li>
            <li> yes I saw the little heart beating.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been using it a little over a week.)</li>
            <li> I have used other brands in the past</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks I already saw a little bit of a difference.</li>
            <li> I had never tried an Eyelash growth serum or anything before this product, and I was a little worried like &amp;#34;man</li>
            <li> so I think it might have been a little dried up when I got it.  </li>
            <li> After just a few days it looks like my eyelashes may be getting a little longer.</li>
            <li> I have horrible light, short eyelashes</li>
            <li> Purchased this a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thin short lashes.</li>
            <li> I started using the reLash a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I could see results after just a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Have been using for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product to regrow my eyebrows after a bout of dermatitis made them rather thin.  </li>
            <li> Lilash worked for me, but it is not available in the US because it has the ingredients of Latisse.  </li>
            <li> I have really thin, short lashes.</li>
            <li> I can see some added thickness and length to my eyelashes and some hairs growing on the sparse end of my eyebrows that has trouble growing.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and also apply it to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and it came within a few days.</li>
            <li> started using it about 3 weeks ago when i got it for her bday and asking me everyday if I saw any changes.  </li>
            <li> and my lashes are back to thin and stubby.</li>
            <li> My lashes are thin and short.</li>
            <li> I plan on updating my review in a few weeks to share my ongoing results, too.  </li>
            <li> I had used reLASH for a while and misplaced my tube.</li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase it because it was either this or fake lashes, and if this worked, I would far prefer it over gluing lashes on all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> If you have short or thin eyelashes, I recommend giving this brand a try.</li>
            <li> but as I used make up everyday, I&#x27;m losing my lashes because of the amount of mascara I use.</li>
            <li> In the few weeks I have been using it,</li>
            <li> After 5 weeks I have gained a few millimeters in length</li>
            <li> However, my source dried up, so I deiced to give ReLash a try.  </li>
            <li> So, when I stop using it, a few of my lashes that are longer in length will fall which made me use it again</li>
            <li> I have been using reLASH on one side for a few nights</li>
            <li> After trying on my lash line for a few days, I decided to put some on my eyebrow.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> a few of them have now with this product.  </li>
            <li> I saw eyebrow growth within a few days.  </li>
            <li> I thought she was wearing false lashes or had gotten individual lashes put on.  </li>
            <li> After a month and a half of using this product, I am  noticing that I&#x27;m losing lashes versus gaining longer lashes!</li>
            <li> I stopped using it about three weeks ago, due to the negative results of the item.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes grew so long and thick!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for a section of my eyebrows I was trying to regrow, just a few very faint shorter hairs emerged but did not fill in the area.</li>
            <li> It took my small lashes and grew them to make them a little longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, Latisse (VERY expensive) works fast</li>
            <li> I know it usually takes a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Rapid lash made my lashes very long but still thin..</li>
            <li> , I did not find a link on the order to contact the seller, who say contact us through Amazon prior to a bad review, so feel disillusioned with the money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> It was a wrong decision because not only did it not work, it stings and I simply wasted time/effort applying this.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have also been using it on my brows and they look a little thicker too!  </li>
            <li> little baby lashes!</li>
            <li> not only is she now saving money by not buying fake eyelashes all the time</li>
            <li> unfortunately I know this from personal experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure why this seems to work so well for some people</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working yet.</li>
            <li> Not sure if there&#x27;s a link</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse in the past and it worked for both.</li>
            <li> and I lazily stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad/old tubes or</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works</li>
            <li> Will update before and afters in a few weeks!  </li>
            <li> I used Rimmel&#x27;s Lash Accelerator Serum in the past, with some results.</li>
            <li> but when I tried it said that I was not able to return it.</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse in the past, and it caused me to have hyper-pigmentation on my lids.</li>
            <li> I like the applicator as well - the small brush makes it easier to apply without getting it all over yourself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a long time I have used eye lash extensions for which for all your girls out there that have them know, they are extremely expensive and you spend over $100 every few weeks to fill them.</li>
            <li> Still faint, but still a big improvement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> The serum is applied with a small skinny brush type applicator.</li>
            <li> the last go around was uncomfortable...</li>
            <li> I have notice that my lashes have become longer and thicker in the past weeks.</li>
            <li> didn’t want to start using false eyelashes because it is not really needed yet</li>
            <li> I will continue to use religiously and would highly recommend this product to others who have weak, brittle lashes!!!!</li>
            <li> The only thing is my bottom lashes are still very thin.</li>
            <li> and fullerâ€¦my eyelashes were very thin and short</li>
            <li> I am also recommending to a friend who has thin eyebrows due to thyroid issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I paid so much and got no results.</li>
            <li> I am SO disappointed, absolutely NOTHING changed in the appearance of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> This serum did help a little - I can at least SEE them (without mascara) now!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that one of the favorites tricks of some of these serum purveyors is that there&#x27;s hardly anything in the tube.</li>
            <li> I could hardly tell if I had lashes as they were so sparse.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way to me, filed a complaint with amazon but seller refunded...</li>
            <li> I buy eyelash growth serum, and I know - they have at least twice, in some cases, three times</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this for me as a gift because I&#x27;ve complained about my thinning lashes.</li>
            <li> The product instructions state that it needs to be applied for at least 8 weeks before you see results.</li>
            <li> Try it for a week or two at least and see if you notice healthier and fuller brows.</li>
            <li> I can see lashes have grown really slowly</li>
            <li> NOT AS THICK AS I WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE.  </li>
            <li> my process is just slow.</li>
            <li> They are extremely thick and didn&#x27;t look like this before.</li>
            <li> I have seen a slow improvement.  </li>
            <li> suggestion is that if you decide to use it, take it slow.</li>
            <li> Noticed that lashes are getting thick.</li>
            <li> I was told I was past the date they allow returns!  </li>
            <li> I was never good at applying fake eyelashes, and getting them professionally done it so expensive.</li>
            <li> The other issue with that is that people start growing random hair where the serum touches.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately,  I don&#x27;t see any of the results that the other reviews led me to believe.</li>
            <li> but seriously it works this way!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It is WAY less expensive, and made here in L.A.</li>
            <li> A little expensive</li>
            <li> What a major disappointment!</li>
            <li> They (in a lot of cases) build with fiber glass type substances and I ended up with a really bad infection that had to be medically treated.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my eyelashes are just not good.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed in my &amp;#34;results.&amp;#34; I followed the directions but failed to see much change in my lashes at all.</li>
            <li> ; :-(&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this status is only temporary and they do restock this serum so I can purchase it again !!</li>
            <li> It made my eyes blood shot red and blurred my vision :(&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> Improved with a thick look but not length!</li>
            <li> It is very hard to get any of the liquid onto the brush</li>
            <li> I know seems silly since I have used false eyelashes etc in the past</li>
            <li> I have using this product approximately one week and my girls already say they can see thicker, longer lashes.</li>
            <li> Her lashes have become thin and frail, and mascara does not stick to them.</li>
            <li> I see the areas where there were thin spots are filling</li>
            <li> My eye brows were patchy and thin, so I started using this after reading the reviews, I did get results, hair immediately started growing in.</li>
            <li> and so my lashes are thin and</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the secret to never needing flaws eyelash again!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I just using like &amp;#34;write thin line &amp;#34; on the edge of the eyelash.</li>
            <li> After using this product for approximately 2 months</li>
            <li> It was non irritating and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have always had thin lashes.</li>
            <li> If you have thin lashes this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> but alas I did not.</li>
            <li> My stressful job causes me to tug on my poor eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes are thin and this serum makes my mascara go on smoother</li>
            <li> but they always look so thin.  </li>
            <li> years ago when attempting to wear false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will no longer wear false lashes.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m going to have to go with false lashes.</li>
            <li> But there is no way I want to put on false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like anything close to my eyes (all you contact wearers out there know what I mean!), and when I saw the directions said to brush the serum at the base of your eyelashes, I got a little nervous.</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen dramatic results, it does seem to be helping to lengthen my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> No more fake eyelashes !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old and my lashes were thinning out terribly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to mess with FAKE LASHES!!  </li>
            <li> and I think I got a fake tube from Sephora in NYC</li>
            <li> Amazon unfortunately doesn&#x27;t sell lilash (and it&#x27;s expensive)</li>
            <li> but sadly there is nothing to show.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get this for forever just never wanted to get it because every time I found it&#x27; it was soo expensive.</li>
            <li> I lost some lashes because I had eye surgery a couple of years ago, the bald spot really troubled me.  </li>
            <li> was wrong (too shy or stingy..?)</li>
            <li> I may have had unrealistic expectations for this product.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was quite skeptical as to whether this would work</li>
            <li> Sorry to tell you.</li>
            <li> Sorry reLASH</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after 2 weeks of use I saw no results.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not meet my expectations as I have not seen any changes in my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Worst case scenario, you get your money back.</li>
            <li> I looked like a weird lizard.</li>
            <li> I had them dyed and they were still so faint</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say I would like a refund.</li>
            <li> Due to horrible allergies as a teenager, my eyebrows became very thin and sparse.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product when I ordered it, but desperate for anything to work.</li>
            <li> As we get &amp;#34;old-er&amp;#34;, eyelashes and brows can get thin... VERY thin! :(  </li>
            <li> So disappointing.  </li>
            <li> #unhappy #don&#x27;twasteyour$$</li>
            <li> I worked in a cosmetic surgeon&#x27;s office and I had patient&#x27;s come in with some crazy looking lashes.</li>
            <li> I was so sad :(.  </li>
            <li> i hope it doesnt blind me&amp;#34; and no worries there at all!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I ordered it, but couldn&#x27;t be any happier.</li>
            <li> you should rally start with the bad reviews when looking into purchasing a product.</li>
            <li> I bought this after badly damaging my lashes from those extension.</li>
            <li> or I got a bad product.</li>
            <li> Made my eyes inch badly.</li>
            <li> However, I started breaking out really bad</li>
            <li> I tried this with disastrous results.</li>

            <li> 4-6 weeks now  :(</li>

            <li> Even my kids thought I was wearing fake lashes after I applied mascara!!</li>
            <li> It also clumped at the base of the extensions, so</li>
            <li> I hate to say this</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using daily since receiving and cannot see any difference in growth.</li>
            <li> Saw results within 2 weeks and even better results within 4 weeks; much better and much more affordable than comparable prescription brand</li>
            <li> A noticed a bit more length in my lashes. I know it worked because when I stopped my lashes went back to being shorter. It wasn&#x27;t a huge difference but every bit helps.</li>
            <li> So far I love the results, my lashes are longer, seem fuller and darker! It&#x27;s easy to use right before I go to bed I just brush it along my lash line, awesome product!</li>
            <li> I love this product for eye lashes. I have use the Eyelash Growth Serum for 2 weeks and my lashed have started to grow plus they look fuller. I will differently be using for my lashed to grow. Love my new look, my eyes look wider brighter.</li>
            <li> As we get &amp;#34;old-er&amp;#34;, eyelashes and brows can get thin... VERY thin! :(  I&#x27;ve heard about these products and that they really work and can be used for the brows too!  Looking forward to receiving mine and will get back with a review after I use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend of mine who constantly complain how I have longer natural lashes than her. She always talks about how a lot of guys are lucky by having longer eyelashes when we don&#x27;t really need them. Anyways, she was extremely happy &amp; surprised when she saw this product... and she is very happy with the results. She can see her eyelashes get longer. Now I have another problem, I can&#x27;t keep her off me... she&#x27;s gives me a all these hugs every single time she see me now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad that this product worked for her! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend because she is constantly spending money on fake eyelashes then has nothing but problems with the ones she buys, shes is absolutely blown away by this product, not only did she realize a difference in her eye lashes but her sister and mom noticed it too.  I high recommend buying this product not only is she now saving money by not buying fake eyelashes all the time but overall shes just extremely happy as that was one thing she didnt like about herself was her eyelashes but not she does!!!!</li>
            <li> reLASH is super easy to apply, and nothing negative to report in regards to itching or burning which is a relief. The ingredient list has a bunch of natural ingredients which is important to me as well.  Did not expect to see any difference the first week because the description on Amazon says that it takes 4-6 weeks, so I was surprised when my lashes started becoming stiffer and thicker right away. It looks like the base of my lashes became thicker, so they spread out a bit and popped up making them look better already. Will update in a few more weeks, but at this point reLASH seems like a winner!</li>
            <li> This really works! I started noticing thicker eyelashes after only a few uses! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I had been using Latisse and really liked it, BUT after receiving  reLASH and giving it a try, I plan to continue with this product.  It is soooo much cheaper, and within the 6 days of using this, I have noticed my eyelashes are much thicker and longer. I&#x27;m sold on this brand!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this about two months ago. I apply it at night once a day. so far i see no results at all! you should rally start with the bad reviews when looking into purchasing a product.</li>
            <li> Used religiously for 3 months. Did not see a bit of difference.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love reLash!!  My blue eyes are very sensitive and reLash goes on smooth, stays all night with no creeping and my eyes look refreshed in the morning with thicker and longer lashes.  It is the perfect compliment to my beauty line-up and so, so easy to use! I would whole heartedly recommend it to everyone - a perfect gift item!!!  reLash, I will be back!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money. I noticed a difference within one week.</li>
            <li> Not only did reLASH make my eyelashes longer but also thicker. If your are transitioning from eyelash extensions to your natural lashes then give reLASH a try. They don&#x27;t look like I have extensions but they are way longer and thicker then they use to be. :) I apply every night before bed and saw results in about 3 weeks. Best serum iv tried.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using this because it was making my eyelashes fall out, it had to\he opposite effect of what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> I used it every night and there was no change. Maybe you need to use more than 1 tube to see any results.</li>
            <li> I used to have a bare patch in my left eyebrow that made it difficult to get my eyebrows to look symmetrical. I also had lost some eyelashes (which didn&#x27;t grow back) years ago when attempting to wear false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried eyelash serums before, but they have never worked. This stuff actually works for me! The patch in my eyebrow is filled in, and my eyelashes that I lost are slowly coming back in as well (the eyebrow hair definitely came back faster).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually applied twice a day for the first two weeks, then tapered down to once at night.</li>
            <li> Awful. Did not work for me. I used it faithfully and ended up back to latisse. Having some trouble returning it since the company wants it in NEW condition.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to apply the serum and have used it consistently for 6 weeks. I have seen zero change in length or thickness. This was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any color, but the product works great!</li>
            <li> Package is perfect. Still too early to see it work but like the idea and my daughter is hoping to see it grow her eyebrow where it has lost hair. Great idea and excited to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought it a week ago and been using it since. I feel slight change but I am sure will be a bit difference after few weeks of use. no irritation to the eye. easy to apply. I think this product does work.    I have used few brands before and none of them I felt really worked, I can say this one is a winner so far.    update: Jan 8 2015    I have been using re-lash for over a month now and absolutely love it and it does work. my eyelash has definitely grew little longer and I had new eyelashes coming out in the inner corner of my eyes that I have lost some of them before.  when you apply mascara you can definitely see the change dramatically ( now it is more fuller and thicker and a bit longer)  will buy again :)</li>
            <li> Great stuff !!! I highly recommend it. I started seeing results in just a couple of weeks ! My lashes are thicker, longer, and darker ! :-) I am a middle aged man who was born with better than average lashes for a man. I always believed in capitalising on your strengths in life and so I consider my lashes one of my strengths and I&#x27;m glad there is a great serum like reLASH to help me keep them looking great !! Easy to apply and no eye irritation experienced.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking forward to buying another tube when mine runs out so I could maintain my great looking lashes, but as of this review the amazon page states.. &amp;#34;Currently unavailable.&lt;br /&gt;We don&#x27;t know when or if this item will be back in stock.&amp;#34; :-(&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this status is only temporary and they do restock this serum so I can purchase it again !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true the eyes are the windows to the soul and most people take them for granted. It doesn&#x27;t matter if your a man or a woman. If you take care of your eyes, they will take care of you. I have been a successful businessman  for decades and my eyes have always helped me succeed in my day to day interactions with people. I strongly believe in taking care of my eyes and reLASH has easily helped me to do that !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks since I started using this, but I think it has lengthened my lashes a little bit. I hope that they will become a bit thicker, too, but only time will tell. I would recommend this product, if for nothing else then the lengthening aspect. It doesn&#x27;t cause any type of stinging and the gel is pretty thick (so it doesn&#x27;t drip). I will try to remember to come back in a couple of months to post an update.</li>
            <li> Purchased this a few weeks ago. Haven&#x27;t been able to tell the biggest difference, but then again it has only been a few weeks. Will continue to use daily.</li>
            <li> Most people with high reviews have it right so I won&#x27;t go into details. Amazing product and it works!!!! Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Arrived on time. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week and I think I am noticing thicker lashes. I like how easy it goes on and absorbs good too.</li>
            <li> Okay, this is just too cool! I never thought in a million years you could grow your lashes! Both me and my gf have short lashes and after 3 weeks of seeing her use it, I &amp;#34;permanently borrowed&amp;#34; it from her. If you know anyone who wants longer lashes tell them to use this!! Love it</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing the results on my friend.  She has been using it  and her lashes are amazing.  They are very long and lush.  I thought she was wearing false lashes or had gotten individual lashes put on.  Nope, it turns out she has been using reLASH for 3 months.  She faithfully uses it morning and evening and has enjoyed the results.  She has made me a believer!  She said she could tell in the first 4 weeks that her lashes were getting fuller.  I can&#x27;t wait and will update in a month my expierence with it.</li>
            <li> Great Product with Great Results! Easy to use and apply.  I have been using Relash for about 2 weeks and am already seeing great results.  I would highly recommend this to my friends!! This will definitely become a permanent staple in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I did not have much hope in seeing my eyelashes growth, but it did growth after 6 weeks of using this serum. My advice to you is to use it more than once a day and may need up to 5-7 weeks to see the result. Great customer service also.</li>
            <li> Best Eyelash Growth Serum I ever bought. I was very excited to try it and after 3 days of using it I start seeing results. First I noticed that my lashes are looking healthy and shiny, then I saw they truly look longer. I can not wait to see how my lashes will look in one month. Definitely I will buy few more tubes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of eyelash enhancer,  and they all work.  This one is good because it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes if you use too much.  You only need a tiny amount. It seemed like it took a little longer to start working,  but that&#x27;s no big deal, because none of these products work instantly.&lt;br /&gt;Remember it&#x27;s only stimulating the eyelash follicles you already have, and those follicles will need a rest.  So if it seems as though the product is no longer working, it&#x27;s really that the follicles are taking a break. Just go with it.&lt;br /&gt;I put some on my eyebrows that are receding at the center end,  and they are responding. A little thicker (good) and a little longer (maybe not so good).&lt;br /&gt;I really like using a eyelash enhancer,  and will probably stick with this brand.</li>
            <li> Works well and is cheaper than Latisse AND DOES NOT STING MY EYES! Most of the eyelash serums burn if they get near my eyes</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product!</li>
            <li> 2 Months of steady use and no results.  I have had success with other products but not with Relash.  Good for the others who had success seeing this is way cheaper and safer than other other products that irritated my eyes.  Back to the more expensive eyelash growth products.</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen dramatic results, it does seem to be helping to lengthen my lashes.  They&#x27;re also a bit darker, so even without any mascara they are more visible and that&#x27;s a plus I wasn&#x27;t counting on.  I will continue to use this tube until it&#x27;s finished, and may find that with time the results improve even more.  I would definitely recommend it, but I would also say keep your expectations reasonable.</li>
            <li> Seemed to take forever, but after using for about a week my wife confirms after about one week of using it, she could see fuller longer lashes! Great product. I highly commend this.</li>
            <li> I have using this product approximately one week and my girls already say they can see thicker, longer lashes.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised at this product...  I recently (accidentally) cut a large chunk out of my eyelash trying to trim my eyebrows.  I thought it would never grow back!  After about 8 days of using this product my lashes are all the same length again!  I can&#x27;t wait to see the next level!  Soooo glad I got this product!!</li>
            <li> Due to horrible allergies as a teenager, my eyebrows became very thin and sparse.  I&#x27;ve always had to use makeup to fill them in and it is a huge pain. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month now on my eyebrows and eyelashes (just for good measure) and on one of my eyebrows and both sets of eyelashes it has made a huge difference.  Unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t really made any difference on my other eyebrow, but I&#x27;m going to assume that&#x27;s my issue since it has been working so well otherwise.</li>
            <li> Used for 2 months, didn&#x27;t see much change. The company is very nice and will take care of you if it doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s worth a try. Maybe my eyelashes are just not good.</li>
            <li> Great Product for hair growth.  My wife has been using it for sometime and has seen some good results with thicker and more lush lashes and brows.  Nice sized container and well packaged.  Very good deal!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product around evening time for most of the month and have stunning results. My lashes are longer, as well as thicker and darker as well! I used other lash products partially in the past, and fellt that this item is far better...cost, and performance. Don&#x27;t expect changes to happen overnight. It took around 4 weeks for me to see a difference and now it is remarkable! I get comments all the time about how long my lashes are, even from strangers. I hope Amazon will always carry this product, go get yours ladies!</li>
            <li> Ive tried many eyelash serum and this one didnt seem to help my eyelashes maybe a little on eyebrows but i had for a little over a month and barly seeing any diff</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff I&#x27;m going to order more  already seen a big difference in just two weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using ReLash for about 3 weeks now. I bought it from Amazon wickedgadgets retailer. At first I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve bought things like these online that ended up being knockoffs and not working. Well, this is the real deal. I&#x27;ve always had thin short lashes. My lashes are now longer and fuller. Some have grown a bit straight, squiggly/spidey looking but I don&#x27;t care because I can fix them with mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Before ReLash I used GrandeLash MD that I bought from my hair salon. It worked but it was twice the price and less amount in the container. ReLash doesn&#x27;t make my eyes burn like GLMD does either. I had also tried Talica Lipocils years ago but the second time around it didn&#x27;t work and I think I got a fake tube from Sephora in NYC, so I didn&#x27;t take another chance. Plus I like that ReLash is made in USA. I need to stack up on these ReLash babies and send to my sisters and Mom also :)</li>
            <li> Apparently my lashes are different on each side. My left lashes are very much thicker. The right lashes are somewhat thicker. One thing is for sure, this product is better than all the others I tried. I will order again.</li>
            <li> does not work. Period. I hope I can still get a refund.</li>
            <li> This works!  My lashes are longer and thicker in just three weeks use!  I don&#x27;t need to wear extensions :)</li>
            <li> A superior beauty product!</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent pricing. Compares to a popular brand.</li>
            <li> Works very well!!  And no burning on your eyes!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and worked like a charm. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I used to have Evolash for the eyelashes growth. I could feel effect almost right away. This one doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> bought it as Reviews are quite nice, but not satisfied as much as they marked until now.</li>
            <li> After a month there is no difference at all in my lashes</li>
            <li> Iam very happy that it delivered a day before I expected however I have been using this product for only one week and have not seen any change. My eyelashes were ripped out from my eyelash curler and I hope it eventually works. Have not seen any results yet I will post if changes.</li>
            <li> I was anticipating some kind of improvement in my eyelashes but have seen so change or growth aftr 4-6 weeks now  :(</li>
            <li> Was hoping for more results...little thickness in lashes, brows grew longer not so much thicker</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment, Excellent Product, Great Customer Service A +++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using once a day now for about a month. My lashes are much fuller and are starting to grow longer. I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I have used  products like reLash before with no results so I was pretty skeptical about this one but wanted to give it a try.  One might ask why I&#x27;m using eyelash growth serum anyway given I&#x27;ve always had long full eyelashes.  Well, as one grows older (I&#x27;m now in my early 70s), things change.  One change that had been occurring for me was that my eyelashes were falling out and breaking off, and my eyelids were noticeable droopy.  I started using reLash six weeks ago religiously every night.  I even took a close up photo of my eyes so I could compare before and after.  Well, I haven&#x27;t taken an after photo yet because I have no need to...  I can actually see the difference in my eyelashes - they are fuller, longer and thicker!  They have grown so long that they rise above my droopy eyelid skin now!  Not only can I see a difference, my husband and many of my close friends can as well. I was recently in the dentist chair having my teeth cleaned and both the hygienist and dentist commented on how long and lovely my eyelashes were.  My hairdresser commented.  Strangers in the grocery store line comment.  Would I recommend reLash?  Definitely!</li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for products for my 75 year old grandma. Her lashes have become thin and frail, and mascara does not stick to them. While on the hunt I came across reLASH at an amazing price and just had to let my grandma try it. She was so excited!! Upon opening the tube, I was worried that it may be runny, but it was a perfect consistency. The application process is so simple that my grandma could even do it herself. A few days later, you will not believe what happened!! I had to share this all with you because this product is beyond amazing!! Within 3 days of my grandma using the product her eyelashes were not only thickening but she can now wear mascara!! Something she has not done in years!!! Thank you reLASH for putting a smile on my grandmas face!!</li>
            <li> After using this product for just a couple of weeks, I can already see a big difference in my lashes.  When this first purchase runs out, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more reLASH.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I would have like it to have been more effective but having to keep using it well i am not so consistent at that and I think you have to use it for a extended length of time to get results</li>
            <li> Has not done any thing so far</li>
            <li> Better than any eye lash serum I&#x27;ve used.      My eye lashes look longer and healthier than they have in years</li>
            <li> Really does work , my eyebrows are filling in.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I use Younique&#x27;s 3 d fiber lash mascara and love it just wanted a little extra help with fuller lashes</li>
            <li> I like this product it really works</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It really works for me. Now I have to worry about my eyelashes touching my glasses ( for the first time in my life)</li>
            <li> It works great!My lashes look like they did in my 20&#x27;s! Yea! I love it when a product does what it says it&#x27;s going to do! Thank you Relash!</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product. A couple of months ago, I lost a significant number of eye lashes that left areas on my lashes with no lashes at all.  I was in a complete panic, I could not even curl my lashes and use mascara be cause it only drew attention to the bald spots.  After using this product for about six weeks, I am happy to report all of my lashes have grown back and all of my lashes are much longer.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> 0 stars-- did not work at all. Have followed instructions but absolutely no growth.</li>
            <li> I started using the reLash a few weeks ago.  I have seen a difference in the condition of my lashes.  It seems to me that my lashes are fuller.  I can actually see little lashes growing. I would totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  I could see results after just a few days of using it. I was surprised at how easy it is to apply.  It isn&#x27;t watered down like many other products, so it won&#x27;t get in your eyes.  My other favorite thing about it is that I didn&#x27;t feel it at night OR in the morning.  There is NO sticky or clumpy residue left over.  Great product!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are noticeably longer and I haven&#x27;t been using the product for very long. I&#x27;m hoping it will also make my lashes thicker with continued use. I hope so since I bought two tubes.</li>
            <li> This serum really works!! I purposely waited 8 weeks to post a review so I could give an honest opinion on my satisfaction with this product. Before using this product, my lashes were skimpy, short and some areas of my lashes were gone.  After 8 weeks of using this product, the &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; area of my lashes started growing hair and my lashes longer than they&#x27;ve ever been. I see the difference and am a satisfied customer.  If your thinking about getting this product, give it a try. They have a 180 money back guarantee so you have nothing to loose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very sparse lashes and have used other products to help lengthen them. The other products worked fair at best, but then I found reLash. Have been using it every night for 2 weeks now and the results are incredible! I don&#x27;t need to use my eyelash curler anymore because my lashes are long and thick enough now. My eyes really pop when I apply my mascara and I&#x27;ve gotten a few nice compliments. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this product and will continue buying it, plus recommending it to my friends and family! reLASH will do wonders for your lashes ladies and gents!</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES it!! She has already seen some improvement in just a couple of weeks, and she&#x27;s well on her way to having fuller, thicker eyelashes than she&#x27;s ever had before. reLASH ROCKS!!</li>
            <li> My lashes are getting thicker. I was skeptical at first as I was not sure how my skin would react but I am happy to say no issues. Excellent Product. Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> Used it for a few weeks and did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!  It took a couple of weeks to see results, but I was consistent!  My lashes look better than they ever have.  I love how easy it is to apply.  I actually get excited to put makeup on in the morning because I know how great my lashes are going to look!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this eyelash serum for a few days, so obviously I haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic difference in the length or fullness of my lashes....yet. I believe that good things come to those who wait ;-) Here are the things that I DO like about this product: (1) It&#x27;s not tested on animals. (2) It&#x27;s easy to apply. (3) It does not burn if you get it in your eye...unfortunately I know this from personal experience. (4) The company offers a money-back guarantee. (5) There is no chemical smell like you might expect. (6) I don&#x27;t have to mess with FAKE LASHES!!  Wow - 6 things that I like about this product.  There are ZERO things I dislike about this product!! I&#x27;ll be sure to update if my opinion changes, but I plan to keep applying this serum.  I&#x27;d recommend it to others for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I saw the great reviews. Last summer I used lilash that my mom gave me and was amazed by the results. My eyelashes grew so long and thick! After running out they slowly returned to normal and I wanted to find a replaced. Amazon unfortunately doesn&#x27;t sell lilash (and it&#x27;s expensive) so when I saw this I was sure it would work just as well. I have used it consistently for over 2 months and have had zero results. I even had before pictures ready for a before and after review but sadly there is nothing to show. I&#x27;m really not sure why this seems to work so well for some people but I have noticed that most the bad reviews are from people who have used a more expensive product (latisse/lilash) before and know what kind of results to expect. I will be switching back to one of those products.</li>
            <li> I have found now that as I am getting older that my lashes are not how they used to be. I guess that is one of those things that happen with age.&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t want to start using false eyelashes because it is not really needed yet but I did want to see if there was something that I could do about my thinning lashes.&lt;br /&gt;When I was afforded the chance to try this reLash growth serum at a promotional discount, I just had to try it. I have been using this product for a while now and I will say that I am seeing good results and it doesn’t bother my eyes at all. I have noticed that my lashes look fuller and thicker and I am so happy to see that it is working. If you find that you have thinning lashes this is something that I suggest.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff; it really does work.  I am a blonde and my eyebrows and lashes are very light and sparse.  I used one bottle and could tell a difference so I bought another bottle.  My sister has been using my bottle too.  We both see a huge difference in our brows and lashes.  I finally have a full brow; never have in my life.  My lashes are long and full like they used to be when I was younger.  I am very happy with this; it really works.  my sister is going to buy her a bottle of it too; she can see a difference in her brows already and has not been using it very long. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember to use it every night but I do notice that my lashes are a little thicker.  Maybe I am just hallucinating or maybe it did what it said it would.  You are the only one who can judge this.  Also, from a person who has absolutely NO beauty regimen, this is very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel weird on your eye.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Definitely noticed an improvement after about 3 weeks.  Will purchase again instead of Latisse.</li>
            <li> What I know I love about this product is the service from the company.  There was an issue with my first order and I was contacted and sent another order immediately. I am just starting to use the product, which had strong positive reviews, so my expectations are very high.  Because of the personal care that has been provided, I am very confident in giving reLASH 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I tried this with disastrous results. Lashes started shrinking away. I went back to rapid lash. Hope they come back. I was so sad :(.  Previously had used rapid lash with great results  don&#x27;t know why I switched. Go RAPID LASH!!!!!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working not sure really. I bought this after badly damaging my lashes from those extension. I can see lashes have grown really slowly but it still has bald spot and after 7 weeks so not sure if it&#x27;s just time and natural growing cycle is what&#x27;s doing it. So I ordered another to see fit will grown longer than my natural lash length. Will keep this updated.</li>
            <li> OK, here&#x27;s the deal...I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using ReLash in my upper and lower eyelids as well as my eyebrows for about a month or so, and I definitely am seeing longer fuller eyelashes...with the right mascara they look like falsies. 😃&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows do appear to be filling in a bit...I see the areas where there were thin spots are filling in.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this product again...and again and again!</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far. Will rate again after I see results.</li>
            <li> This Purchase I made over a month ago has been a real pleasant surprise.  I have been noticing my  lashes getting thinner as I age. So, I wanted to give this a try.  I have noticed after using relash over the last 3 to 4 weeks that my lashes are really improving. There is a noticable increase in thickness and growth.  So, I am very happy that I am now getting the results I had hoped for and more!</li>
            <li> so far growth is happening works good if used correctly</li>
            <li> So far I have seen no improvement and I have been using it faithfully.  It is very hard to get any of the liquid onto the brush so I think it might have been a little dried up when I got it.  I just keep moving it around inside the tube and eventually there will be some liquid on the brush.  I apply it every morning and night.</li>
            <li> it was okay DIDNT see much growth</li>
            <li> This did not work for me. I was able to find Lilash via Overstock and this worked. I wanted to find something cheaper and tried this product. All the lashes I had grown with the Lilash fell out while using this product. I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> My eye brows were patchy and thin, so I started using this after reading the reviews, I did get results, hair immediately started growing in. My only complaint which isn&#x27;t about the product is my eye brows are so blonde, I have tons of new hair but u cant see it unless your close up or I use eye brow pencil to darken. I&#x27;m considering getting them dyed so you can actually see my eye brows now that there fuller</li>
            <li> I received the item very quickly.  I&#x27;ve been using the serum for a number of weeks now and I&#x27;m impressed.  First, let me tell you that I was a Latisse user for awhile.  Without a doubt, Latisse (VERY expensive) works fast but what I noticed was that my eyelashes became almost freakishly long but never became much thicker.  I felt like I had spider legs for eyelashes.  My eyelids also became discolored and puffy in time.  I then tried Idol Lash, twice, without much success then moved on to Rapid Lash (purchased twice).  Rapid Lash was okay, my lashes did grow and slightly thicken but I kept looking around.  I decided to try reLASH and have been very pleased with the results so far.  My lashes have grown AND become thicker - looking much more natural than with Latisse.  There is no discoloration or puffiness of my eyelids...so far.  It did take a couple weeks to start seeing results but that&#x27;s okay.  The price is right and the quantity is more than you receive on the other brands.  I&#x27;m very happy with this serum and plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month and I don&#x27;t see a big change ..... I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the best thing about this product was the customer service. I have been using religiously for over a month now and have seen very minimal results. I had no negative effects, but for the price and underwhelming results, i&#x27;ll stick to a cheaper product.</li>
            <li> Not noticing an improvement in eyelashes. Kind of on the fence with this one. I know it usually takes a few weeks. But with Latisse I did notice an improvement within a month.</li>
            <li> I purposely waited almost 4 weeks before giving my feedback on this product because I wanted to see what results, if any, would appear after using it for a period of time. As it was, I had a little space between a few eyelashes, (probably only noticeable by me), but I wanted to see if I noticed any growth in that tiny area before commenting. I&#x27;m happy to say that I do see some new growth, and I expect more to gradually appear as I continue to use this product in the months ahead. I would recommend reLASH to anyone who wants to have their natural lashes grow in fuller or stimulate areas where lashes seem a bit sparse if willing to diligently follow the directions for a clean face, especially around the eyes, for a period of time.</li>
            <li> I was extremely leery to buy this product because my past experience has been that miracle products like this never work the way they claim.  I used an eyelash curler and before I realized it my eye lashes  on both eyes were cut and I literally had no lashes.  I was desparate so I purchased this product.  Well, 3 weeks later and my eye lashes are the longest they have eve been in my life.  They are beautiful and I am getting compliments!  WOW amazing product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely did nothing and I did use the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably the biggest skeptic on planet earth &amp; l cant begin to express upon just HOW impressed I am with my results!? The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 star review was bc of the length of time it took to see results (which was a good 3 months) but I continued on using it nevertheless, simply bc I was SICK of the hassle of paying to get my lashes done all  the time &amp; was desperate for my own natural ones back! I also took hair, skin &amp; nail vitamins &amp; an extra 5000 Mcg dose of Biotin everyday the last month which I think also helped boost my results! But definitely worth the price &amp; MUCH cheaper than lash extensions! So Don&#x27;t hesitate, it definitely works, but just be patient!</li>
            <li> I have used a similar product under another name. It is only to be used at night after face is washed thoroughly. Noticed the results after one week. Works.</li>
            <li> I have been appling the reLash 2 times a day as directed it&#x60;s diffinatly working. I&#x60;m happy and would recommend it. Thank-you</li>
            <li> I have a problem with thinning lashes. I began using ReLash because I wanted thicker, fuller and stronger lashes. I have been using this product for 2 weeks.  I understand that it takes 4-6 weeks to really see results.  This product is easy to use and fits right into my bedtime routine.  I have already noticed just in two weeks time that my lashes are stronger and seem a bit thicker.  I can&#x27;t wait for the end result.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered reLASH around the middle of January.&lt;br /&gt;Love the look and feel of the product and it certainly&lt;br /&gt;speaks quality.&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 weeks I have seen a difference in the texture&lt;br /&gt;of my lashes. I am fair haired and so my lashes are thin and&lt;br /&gt;fine too.&lt;br /&gt;They are getting fuller and thicker for sure. If they do no more&lt;br /&gt;than now I am still very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Love ReLash! My eyelashes are growing back beautifully and are so healthy and thick. Everyone needs to try this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this now for about three weeks.  My lashes are thicker and I am hoping for longer lashes with continued use.. Update - It has been about two months now and I can tell my lashes are longer.  I like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of these serums.. This one did not do anything to my lashes.. Rapid lash made my lashes very long but still thin.. this one nothing.. still looking for that miracle one</li>
            <li> Great product and great results in a short period of time. Unlike any other growth serum available and it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes! Great value ! Just make sure all makeup is off before application!!</li>
            <li> Has not really helped my lashes grow longer. I have healthy lashes but was hoping they would grow longer which they have not.</li>
            <li> Have been using reLash every night for 4-6 weeks so haven&#x27;t noticed any growth or change in lashes yet.  I am 79 years old and wonder if I am past the point of getting any new growth.  Now been using relash for 3 months with no change.  Wondering why some people have great results and others do not.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks now, and have not noticed any change in my lashes.</li>
            <li> My eyes had a horrible reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Grande lash MD for 3 plus months, thought I would try ReLash because of all the positive reviews, and their money back guarantee, but my lashes are noticibly thinner in the last 10 days of use and I do not want to lose all the progress I had (very happy before with the results and I guess I should not have changed brands) made before and use the product for 180 days! I have no idea how to contact the seller, I did not find a link on the order to contact the seller, who say contact us through Amazon prior to a bad review, so feel disillusioned with the money back guarantee. I KNOW how to apply and had great results before using ReLash.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows were thinning out, so I needed something to help make them fuller again.  This worked great for me!  It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> This product feels great. It feels like putting cucumbers on your eyelids. My wife, her mother, and I are going to use this until the bottle runs out and see if it works. If it does, I will add another star.</li>
            <li> I wear contact lenses so I would just recommend that you dont wear your lenses when applying this product as I had kinda like a foggy type look whenever i tried wearing my contacts with this. When I wore my glasses i experienced no problems. I wear acuve oasis hydroclear lenses just in case anyone needed to know.</li>
            <li> Fast Service and great product!</li>
            <li> Been using nightly for about 2 weeks and no difference yet. Will update after a month</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, I love this product! I love mascara, but have found that I do lose some eyelashes. I was worried that this would be super oily or irritating, but it worked great. Very excited to see my super great lashes soon</li>
            <li> I have been using reliance for about 1 month and have not seen any results. Yes anyone else seeing something that I have not please respond and let me know if possibly I&#x27;m not getting it enough time or what I should expect.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and can&#x27;t use those lash extender mascaras.  They (in a lot of cases) build with fiber glass type substances and I ended up with a really bad infection that had to be medically treated.  With age and the changes that come with it, my lashes were darn near disappearing.  Lashes are necessary for eye health and I just had to find some way to replace them. This appears to be helping and I so appreciate that so much!  Has greatly reduced the amount of irritants that make it to my eyes via nature (dust, wind, etc.) because my lashes are returning.  There is absolutely NO chemical smell, either, which was an unexpected blessing, too.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as a stocking stuffer at Christmas... and she loves it.  In fact it was her favorite gift of the day.  I wish I would have known how happy this would make her.. I would have saved hundreds of dollars in gifts and just got her two of these!</li>
            <li> Okay I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully every night as the direction states. But I have not seen any growth with my eyelashes. I also have irritation in my right eye, although I put it on with one eye at a time with it close. I will give it more time to see if my eyelashes will grow. But so far I&#x27;m not sure that it really works.</li>
            <li> Darker and longer lashes only after a month.</li>
            <li> It definitely works I get lots of compliments on my eyelashes</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I used to use Prevage (actually, I still have some left).  I wanted something that was more reasonable (price-wise)...but, had the same results.  This is like 1/2 the price of Prevage...and you start seeing results in 2 weeks.  With this one...you are only supposed to apply it to the top lid lashes.  So, since I still have the other lash growth serum...I wait until ReLASH dries and then apply the other to my lower lash line.  You can also put this on your brows to lengthen them or make your brows thicker (which is &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; right now).  I love this stuff!  My friend, who is an aesthetician, noticed a difference in my lashes and brows - woo hoo!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. Would like to return it. They give 6 months to do it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.  IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few weeks. Not sure if it&#x27;s working yet.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product to regrow my eyebrows after a bout of dermatitis made them rather thin.  But I used it on my eyelashes as well just to see what would happen.  After 7 weeks of treating my eyebrows and eyelashes once every evening I definitely saw results.  I regrew some eyebrow and they generally had a better appearance --even getting growth where empty patches had been --  and my eyelashes got quite a bit longer.  However, neither eyebrows or eyelashes got fuller.  The eyebrows regrew but are not thick.  They eyelashes grew long, but not full.  I&#x27;m still happy I&#x27;ve had some results and will continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me at all.  I have been using it for about 6 weeks with no results except itching in the inner corner of both lids.  Lilash worked for me, but it is not available in the US because it has the ingredients of Latisse.  FDA says it can&#x27;t come in.  Now I am back to square one.</li>
            <li> I waited till I had used the product for a couple weeks to make sure it was working. Guess what it is totally working. The difference is amazing. Wish it was a little cheaper but considering how bad my lashes and brows were its still worth it!!!  Hopefully someday in the not too distant future I won&#x27;t even have to use brow liner!</li>
            <li> Still waiting for positive results.</li>
            <li> Been using this consistently as instructed for 1.5 months. Sadly don&#x27;t really notice a thing.</li>
            <li> No real noticeable difference.  My lashes seem a little longer.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the secret to never needing flaws eyelash again!&lt;br /&gt;This product really does thicken and extend lashes like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. Your lashes appear to grow right before your eyes. It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful. I recommend this mascara to anyone looking for bold, dramatic, sexy eyes with no clumps and easy take-off.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a 5 star for me.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I have really thin, short lashes. Seeing improvement already!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this morning and night and really wanted it to work but I didn&#x27;t see any changes. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have been wanting to get this for forever just never wanted to get it because every time I found it&#x27; it was soo expensive. When I was able to get this item at an exceptional price I just had to and so glad I did. I have tried it on my eyelashes and also on my eyebrows. I could see the eyebrow hairs growing. I did not think it would work that fast. I could also see my eyelashes looking a little longer and fuller. Thumbs up. Recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m suspicious of many reviews, but want to say up front that I&#x27;m not paid to review products. Over the years, I&#x27;ve used several different lash enhancers. After using this for several months, this makes a few lashes very long but thin. It&#x27;s a nice effect but it seems not all lashes benefit.  Rapid Lash and Urban Decay products seem better in terms of cultivating multiple full lashes over time, but those products have a different feel, with Rapid Lash being slightly irritating if it&#x27;s left on for an extended period of time. ReLASH doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and contains more product for the money compared to RapidLash and Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> Great product with fast results</li>
            <li> This is a great lash enhancer and it&#x27;s working for me. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all and it&#x27;s very easy to apply to the base of my lashes with short strokes. It takes more to apply to my eyebrows but it still does its job. I can see some added thickness and length to my eyelashes and some hairs growing on the sparse end of my eyebrows that has trouble growing. This may not work for everyone because everyone is different but it&#x27;s worth the try. This is a quality enhancer.</li>
            <li> I like reLash but I saw reviews for another product that is very similar called Royal Lashes ... I don&#x27;t know which one I should get. My friend told me she&#x27;s tried both and she loves RL.</li>
            <li> I love relash serum, I was getting eye lash extensions for a year and they damaged my eyelashes, so I stopped and when they all fell off I would use mascara and realized my lashes weren&#x27;t as long anymore and the mascara would clump faster than before extensions. I&#x27;d say with lash serum in ONE month I noticed my eyelashes got their fullness back! And they grew a little longer, I&#x27;m still using it so I&#x27;m hoping they will continue to grow! I&#x27;d definitely try it out :) I&#x27;ll order more soon using my coupon too :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three different lash growth products over the last three years and know now that I&#x27;m &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; with reLash. My sister and I purchased two of the leading products to see there results side by side of each other. She began use of reLash, I used the other brand. The growth we saw was just amazing and fast. She began to see growth in just four weeks to lashes that have grown out long thick and full! I am now using reLash and am thrilled too. And it&#x27;s not just the results but the price, and in how large of a tube! I&#x27;ve found that one of the favorites tricks of some of these serum purveyors is that there&#x27;s hardly anything in the tube. Not reLash! It&#x27;s the largest bottle of any competitor AND at the lowest price + great performance. So, drop off on your other brands, this is the one.</li>
            <li> I love the results from this serum. Wearing false lashes from the salons pulled out my natural lashes. I put this serum on at night for a week or so and now my lashes are back and healthy as ever. I will no longer wear false lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little over a week and I swear I&#x27;m already seeing results! I&#x27;m definitely going to keep up with it.</li>
            <li> This will work. Although I have not really noticed more hairs growing after several weeks of use, each hair gets definitely longer. Even very long! Not sure if there&#x27;s a link but I seem to have headaches if I use it too frequently...</li>
            <li> I have been using it faithfully and have not noticed a change in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes are growing longer and thicker!! I&#x27;ve applied diligently for the last 3weeks every night as instructed and now I can&#x27;t believe the difference in the length and thickness of my lashes. Even my kids thought I was wearing fake lashes after I applied mascara!! I love this product and will continue to use!!</li>
            <li> I used this product on my lashes and eyebrows twice day for 8 weeks and it did absolutely nothing. The only good thing I can say about it is that it did not irritate my eyes as some reviews have mentioned. I am sending it back for a refund. I also want to point out that many of the glowing five-star reviews appear suspicious. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to learn that they&#x27;re purchased reviews.</li>
            <li> I love reLASH! I can see my eyebrows growing back in where I had thinned them too much at one time. So happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had great eyelashes. After using reLASH for only 5 days I already see a huge difference! My lashes are thicker and longer then ever before!  This is one product I will never be without!!</li>
            <li> Wow. I just received this in the mail today and I&#x27;m super excited! I can&#x27;t wait to use it and watch my lashes grow!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with the smooth transaction and how quickly this product arrived!  I&#x27;ve only been using it a week, but I notice it is a much higher quality than the kind I used to purchase in stores, and better results so far.  Glad to have found this gem of a product as such an economical price.</li>
            <li> The only issue about this item is that it did not do what was stated at the time that it was purchased.  I stopped using it about three weeks ago, due to the negative results of the item.  There was no improvement at all with this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all - I tried another product that did so I was surprised - def some reviews that do not seem legit here or I got a bad product.</li>
            <li> The product was was just OK, but the seller was terrific, very helpful.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve used this product. I tried another product and came back to this one because it works! You need to be consistent in applying it every day, I saw results within a couple weeks. I now apply it to my eyebrows and have notice growth from my thinning brows. I have recommended this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have gotten longer but not thicker as yet.  I&#x27;ve used the product consistently every night and most days. So I&#x27;m right in the middle of happy and disappointed.  I&#x27;ll keep up the program and let you know when I finish the tube.  Undecided if I&#x27;ll order another one yet.</li>
            <li> Makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only seen a little difference</li>
            <li> I really like this serum and my eyelashes have gotten longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> Got an opened product that spilled on it&#x27;s way to me, filed a complaint with amazon but seller refunded...it stings and doesn&#x27;t work! I&#x27;ve used Revitalash and Latisse before I tried to save money and use this instead. It was a wrong decision because not only did it not work, it stings and I simply wasted time/effort applying this. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement and quickly returned to buying the more expensive Latisse. I have a supplier who gives me a huge discount, so it&#x27;s not much of a difference especially since Latisse works so much better, and is clinically proven.</li>
            <li> did not work at all on me after a month. would like a refund.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love this product after having been a long time Latisse user, which produced lashes that were truly plush.  However, it was cost prohibitive.  Next alternative was this product.  This did not appear to thicken or grow my lashes after diligent applications, as instructed at 6 week mark and then on and off for almost 3 months.  Unfortunately, the only thing that changed was I gained red, raw, bases of lashes/eyelids that actually scabbed! Not good!</li>
            <li> Great product, can tell it is helping already, looking forward to luscious lashes</li>
            <li> I lost some lashes because I had eye surgery a couple of years ago, the bald spot really troubled me.  I started using this product about three weeks ago and this morning I was pleasantly surprised... I have tiny lashes on my bald spot and some longer ones at the outer corner of both eyes.  I am applying the product twice a day, morning and night.  IT WORKS!  It&#x27;s exciting.</li>
            <li> Used as directed it worked good. A little expensive</li>
            <li> I received this around April 1st so it&#x27;s been about 8 weeks. I apply it 6/7 nights a week. I have noticed a difference in my eyelash thickness and length - nothing over the top but enough that I will continue to use this. I would never try Latisse which could change your eye color...I prefer to keep my blue eyes! It&#x27;s a great product - The owners of this company are very attentive and want you to be happy...I&#x27;m Happy and will buy again.</li>
            <li> It does not appear to have any color.  I did not expect it to.  I want it to help regrow lashes and brows.  I do not know if it does this.  I will edit when I have used it longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian, and I think for the most part, we are not known for our luscious eyelashes.  This serum did help a little - I can at least SEE them (without mascara) now!  Not as amazing a transformation as I hoped, but it&#x27;s something.</li>
            <li> I got &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; results.  Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
            <li> To see results you must apply once daily every day.  I did in the beginning and began to see results and then slacked off.  I have since resumed and am now applying twice a day every day and I am seeing great results.  This product does as advertised and I will be reordering soon.</li>
            <li> it does help to extend lashes.</li>
            <li> Sucked! Didn&#x27;t do a thing and I used it for two months straight. I guess I&#x27;m going to have to go with false lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Latisse in the past and had success with it.  But for some reason, Latisse just stopped working for me.  So I starting using Relash a few weeks ago and my lashes are not only noticeably longer but thicker as well.  Being an Asian girl, long thick eyelashes are just not part of the deal.  But with Relash, I actually have lashes now and LOTS of them!</li>
            <li> Love it.  My lashes have grown and my eyebrows are getting thicker.  Very happy with it.  I dye my lashes black and do no have to wear mascara on a daily basis because the lashes are nice and long now.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no noted changes in eye lash length. Have been using for over 4 weeks</li>
            <li> No change that I can see yet... I&#x27;ll keep using till its gone and hope for something to improve.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks I definitely noticed a difference. I used it for my eyelashes and brows. I just ran out and will be ordering more as my brows are still not completely grown in enough as I would like. Thanks so much, I would recommend. The 1st picture was taken the day I started, the 2nd is about 3 and a half weeks in to the process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for at least a month every night and so far see absolutely no result. I will keep persisting for another month in hope. I wish I had gotten Latisse or lash envy instead....</li>
            <li> I got this for my eyebrows. I use it everyday and also apply it to my eyelashes. My eyelashes appear to be longer, however the reason I got it was to grow my eyebrows .Does Not Work!!  My eyebrows haven&#x27;t grown one hair!! I have used Latisse in the past and it worked for both. Very disappointed and will not be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> I believe it is going to work better than most. I bought another tube to give it more time.</li>
            <li> Made my eyes inch badly. I have used other growth serums before and never had a problem.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, but the company&#x27;s customer service was great!</li>
            <li> so far so good.  i&#x27;ve only had it/used for a few weeks but i can see the results.  i love the easy application...almost like putting on liquid eyeliner.  really nice and much more affordable than that other expensive brand that Ms Shields promotes.  Thank you reLash for coming up with a product that is effective and affordable!</li>
            <li> YES, I HAVE SEEN RESULTS IN THE THICKNESS OF MY EYELASHES, THOUGH NOT AS THICK AS I WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE.  BUT I WILL KEEP ON USING YOUR PRODUCT, HOPING IT WILL IMPROVE MUCH MORE.  THANK YOU!!!  GRACIELA</li>
            <li> It is a colorless serum. I&#x27;ve had it a week and my lashes have grown. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> Relash is a fabulous product. It has madey lashes thick and long and lush. No side effects, except for a little discoloration along the lash line. Well worth it! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product long enough it  to see results I need to&lt;br /&gt;give it more time..</li>
            <li> I used another much more expensive product in the past, and got faster results, but GUESS WHAT? THAT product is no longer able to be shipped to my state! So what in the heck was I putting on my eyes??? The reLASH serum works slowly and steadily to create NEW lash AND brow growth, filling in, lengthening and darkening the hairs. I don&#x27;t worry about undisclosed ingredients harming me, as they pride themselves on being SAFE! NutraLuxe cannot say that. Having worked in a lab before, I did a little research...and the non disclosure of actual drug like ingredients worries me... and is likely why their product is no longer available in Tennessee and California. With reLASH, you will get a SAFE serum that works, awesome customer service, and an affordable price that won&#x27;t double after the first time you buy it...like the OTHER guy&#x27;s product did!&lt;br /&gt;The serum isn&#x27;t runny, isn&#x27;t too thick...very easy to apply...just make sure the area is clean and dry. Then...get ready for AWESOME LASHES AND BROWS!</li>
            <li> Relash did not worked for me. I brought it 6 months ago and I do not notice a difference. I&#x27;m disappointed that I paid so much and got no results.</li>
            <li> I purchase this lash growth liquid first time 6/11/15 now reviwing this item 8/26/15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first I just using like &amp;#34;write thin line &amp;#34; on the edge of the eyelash. 1 month later it&#x27;s growinglittle but not critically. I thought it just what is.&lt;br /&gt;But I tried apply liquid on all over the upper eyelash which means almost covered and heavy pn my lash.&lt;br /&gt;Then it grows more and more.. Now I know how to do it!!&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong (too shy or stingy..?) just put on a LOT before go to sleep after your removed make up.&lt;br /&gt;Next day, you look like you were cryingwith white line on the corner of your eyes but it&#x27;s OK!..LOL but seriously it works this way!&lt;br /&gt;It growth, so please try to put A LOT on the top of your eyelash for a month then review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only things bothering me after quite growing, it&#x27;s little irritate my eye so apply not close to eyes</li>
            <li> About 2 and a half weeks ago, my lancome eyelash curler cut a chunk of my eyelashes off. I was devastated. I immediately went on amazon to find a growth serum and saw that this was highly rated. I ordered it and it came within a few days. You apply this before going to bed on top of the eyelid above the lash line. I only applied it to the area missing lashes because I did not want to risk having my lashes at different lengths. Now my lashes are back! :)  Great product!&lt;br /&gt;The top photo is from 1/29/15... I recieved the serum on 1/30/15 and the bottom photo is from today 2/17/15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!!  :)</li>
            <li> Really does work...so surprised. Definitely buying again..makes them long and thick. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> So happy that I do not have to get a prescription for this. I have used this for about two weeks (sometimes I just forget to put it on) and I can already see a difference. Can&#x27;t wait for the month to see how much fuller and longer they will get.</li>
            <li> I had a great experience with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I heard from many people that their eye lash growth serum bruns a little bit and their lash line were often red after they applied it. But with this product my eyes always felt normal and my lashes got much longer and thicker! I love the result!&lt;br /&gt;All in all 5-star experience!&lt;br /&gt;As you can see on this pictures it works awesome!</li>
            <li> After just one week of using reLash I noticed a difference in the length of my eye lashes. I found this easy to apply with no irritation.</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t work, I used LiLash and that really made a difference. Going to find another product, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I thought I was supposed to use it at night for the purpose of new lash growth and thicker lashes.  I have only been using it for about a week and do not expect to see a great change yet.  So far maybe a little bit of difference, but not much.  This is too soon to see a big change.</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks I noticed missing lashes were growing back in. At the end of two months I saw the full results, longer fuller stronger lashes. They look great with or without mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for couple of weeks now, and I can tell a difference. At first it was a little bit irritable close to my eye, but then I got used to it. I&#x27;m happy with the results so far and plan to keep on using it.</li>
            <li> So far so good; no issues I use it on the top and bottom lashes; I can see a diff in the lower lashes; due to extentions on the top lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again. I try and put it on before bed, haven&#x27;t had irritation.</li>
            <li> Love the product but can&#x27;t tell if it is working yet.</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for over a month and I can honestly say my lashes did grow ...   I had to cut them way back because they were growing in a downward direction  - found this product used daily and my lashes have now grown and full... Great product.</li>
            <li> No improvement at all. I used this product religiously for over a month and have seen no changes in my eyelashes. It might as well have been snake oil. I am not a negative person and usually find something good in everything, but after waiting and waiting to see positive results, I am sad to admit that this product had none.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything to my eyelashes. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff truly works i had ripped many eyelashes out from lash extensions and it made them grow back quicker and longer within 2 weeks! 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> After 6 weeks of consistent use, I am not seeing any results. I have seen more results with City Lash. They do honor their money back guarantee, and I am pleased that I got a full refund.</li>
            <li> I apply it 2x daily. Morning and night. Have always had light, sparse eyelashes. Have only been using this for a couple weeks. Already see improvement. Length (visible after I put on mascara.). Excited to see how things progress.</li>
            <li> Well I have had this for roughly 10 days. I used to have lovely lashes but after years of false eye lashes well I have done a little damage. Now I have sensitive eyes so I am always a little gun shy when it comes to putting any kind of serum etc there. Yeah I know seems silly since I have used false eyelashes etc in the past but over time my eyes have gotten so sensitive I have had to even give up on liquid eyeliner. Anyway when this product first arrived I gave it the sniff test. I didn’t smell anything that would make me question the product too much. Smelled nothing like the other things that I have tried that just literally brought tears to my eyes. So I decided to dive in and see how it would work out. I have to say that I did not have a reaction which is a big thing right there. It has been about 10 days and I am noticing a slight change in my lashes which is good. I am only using at once at night like suggested and the results are noticeable to me. Overall I like this product and since I am already seeing results I am glad I caught this at a great price and am able to share my opinion of it. I know as with anything else that once you stop using it there is a chance that the results will be reversed but I am going to see how that works out. If I find that my lashes start to take a dive I will say that I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I had been getting eyelash extensions for almost a year, but the cost of keeping them up, only to have them fall out in a week was just too much. When I took them all out, my natural lashes were damaged beyond belief, short, split and missing in huge chunks. I was skeptical about this product when I ordered it, but desperate for anything to work. This product is amazing!!!! I have used it for just over a month, and my lashes have all grown back, stronger &amp; fuller than they were before I started extensions. I am so thrilled about the results, and would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the great reviews. I think the positive reviews are because the sellers constantly email you after purchasing and prompt you to write a positive review. They even offer an Amazon gift card if you post pictures of positive results. I had used RapidLash before and switched to this product just to try it. Almost immediately, I started losing all the extra length I had gotten with RapidLash. I continued using ReLash and decided to stop after 2 months since I saw a decrease in my lash length.  I went back to RapidLash and poof, my lashes started to grow again. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this nor be fooled by prompted positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 3 months and it really works!! I&#x27;m super happy with the results, and have noticed growth, both in length and in strength/thickness, of my lashes. I normally apply after I wash my face and before I go to bed. When I feel like it, I&#x27;ve applied it in the morning underneath my mascara without any issues. I haven&#x27;t felt any irritation. I would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Have used several brands of this product, but none have made my lashes thicker.  This product does, so I am very happy!!!</li>
            <li> Does not perform miracles on overplucked brows but it worked just as well as other more expensive products and brought back some brow hair i had been missing for years.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Am seeing some growth in my eyelashes and my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I used it for about 3 weeks. For the first 2 weeks, it was fine and I was beginning to see results. However, about the time I got excited about seeing results, my eyelids started swelling and became itchy. Soon after, my eyebrows did as well, where I had been using the serum. I stopped using reLash and my eyes have gotten better. It is probably a very good product that I just happen to be allergic to, I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
            <li> I have to alter my original review of 5 stars.  it is has been several months now and my lashes are now starting to break off as before use and I am no longer experiencing growth. If you need immediate growth then I  highly recommend this product.  it works better than the expensive brands I have tried and in half the time!  However for long term results I cannot recommend this product.  I have used more expensive products that took 1 month to see growth but it also worked continuously with the use the of the other product.</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse and wanted to try this since the reviews were so good. Its all true! this stuff definitely made my lashes longer, even more than Latisse did! It is WAY less expensive, and made here in L.A. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After about a month of use, I can totally see the differences in my eyelashes and my eyebrows. My eyebrows were thinning in certain spot and this helped thicken them up! Also my eyelashes look very healthy, they were feeling kind of dry and brittle before but this has made them feel and look much healthier. Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> results were ok.  my lashes were only slightly fuller after 6 weeks of continuous nightly use.</li>
            <li> I may have had unrealistic expectations for this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 1-2 months and have noticed some growth but that could be due to the biotin I&#x27;m taking. The growth I have noticed isn&#x27;t really substantial. I&#x27;ve used Latisse in the past with awesome results. So, I will be going back to Latisse.</li>
            <li> Only Latisse gives you the results of long lush lashes. This helped but not enough for me to warrant a other purchase.</li>
            <li> Awful.  Used as directed did nothing for my eyelashes. They said they would stand by a refund and they never did. Disappointed</li>
            <li> After 6 weeks of use, I&#x27;m leaving another review. I&#x27;ve seen tremendous &amp; consistent growth. I have no idea how any of these reviews state that the product doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s been an undeniable change for me. I&#x27;m getting compliments and even accusations of false lashes now (which is awesome) I used it almost every night for the last 6 weeks and they&#x27;ve steadily grown and become thicker, more voluminous. I&#x27;m so excited to have found a product that works and is so easy to use / thanks!</li>
            <li> Relash works better than any other lash product! I have submitted pictures taken 7 weeks apart without makeup. The third picture is taken at present day with mascara. Beautiful! I have seen a very noticeable difference, especially when I wear mascara. As a 56 year old women suffering from thin eyelashes, using this product is much more economical than going to get false eyelashes placed. I definitely plan to continue using this product!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Great Product, came in a timely fashion, easy to apply, and was able to see results within two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now, and have already seen progress with my lashes.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with thin lashes, but did want some more length to eliminate the need for mascara all the time.  Now, when I remove my mascara at night, it feels as though I still have some on because my lashes look longer than they did when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product if you want more volume and length in your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash enhancer. really works I saw results with longer and thicker eyelashes  in 2 weeks! will definitely repurchase. every mascara I wear makes my eyelashes look like I&#x27;m wearing falsies. i suggest trying the miss manga rock loreal mascara.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was quite skeptical as to whether this would work but I actually can see longer and thicker lashes with the naked eye.  While I never had short lashes, they actually appear to have grown so I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Although I do see a difference in the thickness of my lashes,  my eyes are very irritated when I use the product.</li>
            <li> Worth the $. Post chemo I had about 4 lashes on each eye.  Within 2 months my lashes are nearly back to pre-chemo length and much fuller than before. Also used on my eyebrows. Great results. Grow so fast I have to get eyebrows waxed ~ every 10-14 days and they have to be trimmed down with scissors. I used to be able to make it 3 weeks. This is an effective product.</li>
            <li> I am seeing new growth where there were no lashes before. Very encouraged. I have been applying at bedtime and frequently in the morning also.</li>
            <li> Ok so I usually do not write reviews for products I buy from Amazon.. But this serum is absolutely amazing! My first eye lash serum ever used was &amp;#34;rapid lash&amp;#34; it worked well but decided to try a different brand.. So I gave this brand a try.. If I&#x27;m not mistaken when I bought this product (approx 2-3 weeks ago) there was a sale going on and I purchased it for about ~$35.. Which is around the same price as rapid lash. It arrived fast (2 days) and after just a week I started to notice my eyelashes not only becoming longer and darker but also fuller with more volume which was really what I wanted! This product is just fabulous and it does NOT irritate my eyes like rapid lash did.. The bottle is also really big so it&#x27;ll definately last a while. But I really do recommend this product!! Thank you reLash, I can&#x27;t wait to see how great my lashes will look in a few more weeks!! 5 stars from me :-)</li>
            <li> re-ordering! :) I use this for my lashes since I use extensions too so it keeps my lashes nice and long!</li>
            <li> Started using this about five weeks ago and I have to admit, I&#x27;m surprised at how well it works for me. My upper lashes are getting a little more full, and lower lashes ...well, I barely had any before; now I have a normal looking lash line (even tho don&#x27;t apply to lower lashes, I think the solution migrates onto them when I close my eyes)! No skin problems with this, and I have pretty sensitive skin. Will continue to use this stuff forever, or until I have a reason not to.</li>
            <li> It did not work. Sorry to tell you. It was the product with the best reviews but I applied the entire container and my eye lashes are the same length as before applying the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had naturally long lashes, but as an older gal (61) I&#x27;ve realized they could use some &amp;#34;support&amp;#34;,  so I thought I&#x27;d try &amp;#34;reLASH&amp;#34;.  I was sadly disappointed!  After using this product for approximately 2 months my lashes are the shortest they&#x27;ve ever been!  I&#x27;ve discontinued using this product and will return to using &amp;#34;Mavala Double-Lash&amp;#34;!  It&#x27;s been a tried and true product for me for years.  I only thought I&#x27;d give reLASH a try because the reviews I read were so &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;.  I learned, when you find a great product.....stay with it!</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 mo. Not one bit of change. So disappointing.  I will try something else.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! My dark youthful lashes were disappearing until I used this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well. I didn&#x27;t think to take a before picture but wish I did!</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in most of these eyelash growth serums is Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17. They pretty much all have that as a basis, then the other ingredients vary. I know it does work as I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile. So the question in my review is how reLash stacks up to the competition...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the other lash friendly additional ingredients in reLash - keratin, silk, corn soy and wheat protein. This product claims to have a higher concentration of Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 as other eyelash growth brands. I think they do but it&#x27;s kind of hard to absolutely verify. I did go through and look at the ingredients list of many others - Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 is listed as the third ingredient in reLash. The others I looked at, it was 4th or 5th. They also say they have twice as much in their applicator bottle. That&#x27;s absolutely true! I buy eyelash growth serum, and I know - they have at least twice, in some cases, three times more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in comparison, this is probably the best deal I&#x27;ve found and my favorite so far. It comes in a mascara type silver tube, slightly larger. Nice design and has an applicator tip that is like the tip of a fine paintbrush and is easy to apply. I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity or allergic reaction to this product. I received this product to try at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review. All opinions expressed are truly my own. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Great to grow longer lashes. My lashes are not any thicker, but the areas where my lashes were falling out has filled back in. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The first week I was noticing a small growth. Then by the thrid week my right eye I notice some of my eye lashes are falling out. So I have some gabs of no hair which really scares me. So I stopped using the product because I&#x27;m scared to lose my eye lashes. I&#x27;m going to try another product. Sorry reLASH I was really hoping for something good. I just can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> Good product. Didn&#x27;t take very long before visible results started to show. Hopefully with continued use the eyelashes will continue to grow beautifully.</li>
            <li> I have been using nightly for about 3 weeks now. I haven&#x27;t seen results to be honest. However, the customer service is fantastic and with any product results may vary. What seems to be great for some may not for others. I am going to continue to use in case my process is just slow. I will update as I see progress.</li>
            <li> I used Latisse while living in California, and thought I might try something new after moving to the east coast. After 5 weeks I can detect no new growth whatsoever. Time to find a Latisse vendor!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any change</li>
            <li> Was so excited to hear about this product because it&#x27;s so much less expensive than Latisse. Unfortunately, after 2 weeks of use I saw no results. Apparently it has worked really well for others but I&#x27;m not a success story</li>
            <li> I like it at the beginning, but I try something alse</li>
            <li> Has really made a difference. My lashes are definitely longer!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works yet, as it says it may take 8 weeks for me to see the full effect.  I have only used it 4 days.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a couple weeks but it appears to be helping.  It is easy to apply and I have had no irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month and I see no growth, but some eye irritation.</li>
            <li> I bought the ReLash for my wife and her friends. After 3 weeks of using this product you can see the result. At first,&lt;br /&gt;You will not see the result but with this product you have to give it time. My wife experience is 3 week. You can see it yourself. She totally love this product and I would recommend all the ladies out there to try. Thanks</li>
            <li> I see a difference in a month of use. My lashes are a bit longer and thicker. I missed a few days and feel more motivated now to use it twice a day and see what happens. I will definitely reorder. This product seems to actually work. Yay.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money! Did nothing at all. Used per directions every single morning and evening for over 90 days. No new growth, not even a tiny bit thicker..&lt;br /&gt;Nada, nothing, zipo, zilch not a single new lash or longer lashes.&lt;br /&gt;WASTE of money and time!&lt;br /&gt;Wonder if other reviews are paid for or what?  This does not work. Go to Dr and get the prescription stuff.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. I used up all of the product and still not see improvement.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars is because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see a huge difference.  I have noticed that on one eye, the lashes seem to be a bit longer.  So far so good.  I&#x27;ll come back in a few weeks and let you know how well the product is working for me.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works, at least for me it does.  I am a 68 year old woman and was saddened by the natural thinning of my lashes and brows.  I gave this product a try after reading the reviews but saw no improvement until about six weeks.  I began to see growth in length and thickness.  I do not exaggerate when I say that my lashes have doubled in quantity, but be aware that my lashes were very thin to begin with.  I have used most of my first order and will buy again when the tube is empty.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. I used it for 21/2 months and there was absolutely no difference whatsoever in my eyelash length. I&#x27;m dissapointed especially because when I left customer feedback and said I wasn&#x27;t getting results (a month ago) someone from the company called me to tell me to &amp;#34;keep using it&amp;#34; ... Probably just so I couldn&#x27;t return it within the returns period. #unhappy #don&#x27;twasteyour$$</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for less then a couple weeks and already see growth on my lashes.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff here. My wife loves this stuff.  Says it gives her longer and stronger lashes.  She is not a high maintenance gal, but she does like to have nice looking lashes.  Thats about her only makeup thing.  This product is pretty inexpensive compared to a lot she has tried. And it works! I recommend this for your woman.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this.  Always complained about her short lashes compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;She started using it about 3 weeks ago when i got it for her bday and asking me everyday if I saw any changes.  Fast forward 3 weeks, I’m impressed!  Never thought it could make this much of a difference but it did.  Best thing is I don’t have to hear her complaining about short lashes anymore :D</li>
            <li> Careprost is much better alternative. The results are undeniable. Your friends will notice the increase in length in just 3 weeks after use. I bought mine on maximumlashes.com. Try it out..its amazing</li>
            <li> I give this one star because it simply did not work.  And it is already drying up and I&#x27;ve only had it a few months!  And when I tried to see if I could return I was told I was past the date they allow returns!  They only gave a little over a month to return the product when most eyelash serums take at least 2-3 months before you start to see results.  Also, my lashes went back to the way they were before I used Lilash which worked great for me.  I just thought I&#x27;d try a serum that was less expensive and bought because of the high ratings from other users.  Would not buy again because it didn&#x27;t work and because of the return policy.  I am out $40 and my lashes are back to thin and stubby.</li>
            <li> This stuff did work! I had pulled out some lashes on accident and decided to try this to see if it would speed the re-growth. It definitely made my lashes longer and seemed to speed the regrowth. It also helped my eyebrows fill in a bit. I was so pleased I bought it a second time.</li>
            <li> This stuff DOES work.  I definitely noticed a difference. I would recommend</li>
            <li> Wow! There is power packed inside this eyelash serum. Although I have dark lashes, they are very short, stubby. I&#x27;m looking forward to the results I get using this reLash Eyelash Serum.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and it took her a couple weeks to see the results, but she was surprised at how noticeable the difference was. She said she tried a few different brands and this is the best eyelash growth serum she&#x27;s used so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says:&amp;#34;It beats buying so many different brands of mascara trying to find the right one, then having to apply and remove it every day. I recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s dissatisfied with their eyelashes and wants more luscious lashes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I feel like I finally have control over how my lashes look.  This is not just another “hope it works” product… it’s the real stuff and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants that longer lash look.  It’s the best natural way to get the lashes you want, and feel good about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake eyelashes were such a constant headache to apply but I felt like there was nothing else I could do just to get that special lash look. My friends all have long lashes but I just didn&#x27;t and it really frustrated me. It feels sooo good now to just look at myself in the mirror and see my lashes more prominent and have more volume than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just after 2 weeks of using reLASH I started noticing a difference but nothing major. Then after using consistently for 2 more weeks, I was like wow! I&#x27;m just super excited to share my story and hope anyone who had the same issue as mine will try it and see the results for themselves. Love it!</li>
            <li> Ok can I just say I wish I knew about this product a year ago. I was paying 200$ a bottle that I got from my doctor at my skincare clinic. I went away for awhile and didn&#x27;t bring it with me and I lazily stopped using it. I tried reLASH (I loved the price point) after I was envious of all of my friends having eyelash extensions which is another hell story for me will never repeat!! I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this stuff works!! My friends thought I got eyelash extensions! I also have a couple little tiny patches in my eyebrows where the little hairs had stopped growing in so I just penciled them in. I use reLASH on those patches too and my hairs there are freakin growing back too!! My boyfriend came back from a trip and said to me &amp;#34; Oh you got extensions again hey?&amp;#34; (He loves that look) he didn&#x27;t believe me it was my real lashes!! I have my sexy glam look back and I never need to go broke again for it!!!</li>
            <li> It seems  to be working- haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know for sure on long term.</li>
            <li> I just love this product!!!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, and I do see my lashes getting thicker, and they do seem to be getting longer. I can&#x27;t wait to see how much they change in the next month! Take pictures! You&#x27;ll see for yourself!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this!!! Amazing results after only a couple days!!!</li>
            <li> Just started using it but excited to see how the growth works, I was doing fake lashes and extensions but hope this is a good alternTive</li>
            <li> I heard really good things about this reLASH from my friends - keep in mind the key is to be consistent in using it daily, and apply it correctly. Most saw results after about 4 weeks of  use. I look forward to seeing the same results myself? Nice packaging too!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Wow!  I have never used a product like reLash before (frankly I didn&#x27;t even know they existed) so I can&#x27;t comment on how this works in comparison to other products but I can relate my own findings.  When I saw this product I decided I would give it a try because I have very fine brittle eyelashes.  I work from home so I don&#x27;t often wear make-up and when I do, I would never wear mascara because my eyelashes tend to break and are so short you can&#x27;t see them anyway.  So anyway, I started using reLash 1 week ago and was invited to go to my newly pregnant daughter&#x27;s first ultrasound today.  Well this newly expectant Grammy decided to get all duded up for the big event!  I put on mascara and could not believe my eyes!  I had eyelashes that the curler worked on!  Wow it HAS made a difference!  I cried at the ultrasound, yes I saw the little heart beating.  My eyelashes knocked against my glasses (A sensation I have not known for years) and then came home and washed off the mascara and low and behold my eyelashes are still there!  I am so happy with these 1 week results...I will continue to use religiously and would highly recommend this product to others who have weak, brittle lashes!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week, but already my lashes appear thicker. Easy to use and does not irritate by eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using reLash for a week now.  So far I am impressed that it does not irritate my eyes at all.  Love the applicator brush and especially love the price!  I have been spending much more on Latisse and their annoying brushes.  If this product works for me, I will be a loyal customer for life and... will tell all of my friends!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product. Putting on mascara is never fun for me. My lashes are thin and short. Sometimes I wonder if it&#x27;s worth all the effort!  I have been using reLASH, but not daily as instructed. In fact I use it about 4 times a week because with a busy family I just forget. Even using it less than recommended it has made a BIG difference!  Now my lashes seem fuller and longer. Putting on mascara is now fun because I love to see how thick my lashes will look!! I have also been using it on my brows and they look a little thicker too!  Great product and I would highly recommend to anyone who needs a little boost.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve actually seen growth of my lashes. Not as fast as I&#x27;d like, but I &#x27;m an impatient person. Still waiting to see if I notice change in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Considering I am 60 yrs old, and have hypothyroidism, I wasn&#x27;t sure of the type of result I would get. It is gentle, and I believe I see hair growth in the brows, the lashes seem to be longer. But perhaps because of age factor, the brow growth has no color (but at least there is more to tint) and while I think the lashes may be longer, they are not much fuller and once again, no change in color.  Considering natural aging, and the tendency for thyroid problems to exaggerate hair loss in lash and brow, I may have had decent results.... would love input on this, Have ordered again, just as happy with product. 11/07/15</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using more than a couple of days, can&#x27;t say much about it yet.</li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many eyelash growth products, but this one seems to do the trick.  I&#x27;m over 60 and used to have long lashes.  My lashes are so think it looks like I&#x27;m wearing eye liner.  Not as long as I&#x27;d like, but I have mascara for that</li>
            <li> I used ReLash while wearing lash extensions...my bottom lashes definitely grew in the 6 weeks but I can&#x27;t tell if it worked on my top lashes.  It also clumped at the base of the extensions, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend its use with them.  Now that the extensions have been removed I am continuing use of ReLash because it worked so well on the lower lashes.</li>
            <li> SO far So good.  Easy to Use and can see some results already!</li>
            <li> I love Relash so far. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve started using it, and I&#x27;ve seen the difference -especially around my eyebrows. I think it&#x27;s worked on my eyelashes as well, but I&#x27;m going to wait a few weeks until I make that major judgment.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this for me as a gift because I&#x27;ve complained about my thinning lashes. I am super pleased with how quickly I&#x27;ve seen results with reLash. (I&#x27;ve been using it a little over a week.) It&#x27;s so easy to use! I apply it at night after I&#x27;ve washed my face and it only takes seconds to apply and a couple of minutes to dry. My lashes are already a little longer and fuller, and they&#x27;re much softer to the touch. Someone even complimented them yesterday. My eyes are very sensitive, and in the past, similar products have either stung or caused my eyes to water and be irritated for hours after use. NEITHER were the case with this. I experienced NO irritation, stinging, or eye watering issues, which is just unusual for me with these kinds of products. YAY!! I&#x27;ve seen a mascara product that a few of my friends sell that is supposed to make your lashes fuller immediately, but I&#x27;ve been leery to try it due to the concern that the fibers would get into my eyes and cause that hours of irritation, plus I simply don&#x27;t have the time to apply 3 coats of that product to create temporary results. This was the perfect alternative! If you&#x27;re looking for a product to help you regrow, thicken, and enhance your lashes on a permanent basis without irritation or the expense of having false ones applied and constantly maintained, I highly recommend reLash! I plan on updating my review in a few weeks to share my ongoing results, too.  UPDATE: I had used reLASH for a while and misplaced my tube. I started using it again a couple of weeks ago, after having come across it. AGAIN, I was incredibly pleased with the results. I applied mascara today for the first time since I started reusing it, and I thought one of my lashes was falling out because it was so long. Then I noticed many of my lashes are longer and they have definitely thickened up. So I can say that after not using it for several months, and having the resulting thinning lashes that naturally come with aging, that my lasheshave thickened up and gotten longer in less than 2 weeks. I&#x27;m impressed with how quickly the results have shown and also impressed that my tube is just over a year old and still as effective as when I first received it.</li>
            <li> It is a little early to tell but I think it is alright. Certainly no adverse effects.</li>
            <li> I started using this about a week ago. I put on mascara today and I can see the results already. I totally highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;Dana S Corcione</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product &amp; thought I&#x27;d try it. I didn&#x27;t think it would work but a few weeks of diligent application, I began to see new hair growth in my lashes. I even applied it on my eyebrows &amp; this thing thickened my brows too. AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Had great hopes, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my lashes.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes.  Nor did it make my eyelashes grow.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a bit over a month and have seen no change.</li>
            <li> I used Latisse for 2 years and switched t reLash.  In terms of growth it seems to be ok but I noticed an irritation and reddening around lash area I never got with Latisse.  I thought maybe it was bacteria from reusing same brush so I tried using some fresh brushes.  I stopped the product after I woke up with swollen puffy eyelids.  I will go back to Latisse.  You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! My lashes are longer and thicker already &amp; look like they are getting darker!!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!!! I am so happy with the results.  My lashes are really showing a huge improvement after only using for 2 weeks.  I have purchased this product for a couple of gifts because I am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This product really thickened both my lashes and my brows. It was non irritating and I will continue to use it. Good product, great value.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff really works</li>
            <li> I am SO disappointed, absolutely NOTHING changed in the appearance of my lashes.  This is even more surprising given all of it&#x27;s excellent reviews.  I think one really needs to use the drug bimatroprost because simple conditioners etc aren&#x27;t going to make (one&#x27;s) my lashes grow.  I am going to try to get my $$ back.  Waste of time.</li>
            <li> I was using Lilash for several years and suddenly it didn&#x27;t seem to be working anymore.  Not sure if I got a bad/old tubes or what so I thought I would give this product a try since it had such great reviews.  I don&#x27;t like to give 1 star reviews, BUT this soooo didn&#x27;t do anything for me and I have been using it for 6 weeks or more now.  I was expecting to get the long/thick lashes that I use to get when I was using Lilash, but am so disappointed.  It&#x27;s a much less expensive product too, than Lilash which is another reason I was so excited.  You get what you pay for, right? 6-5-15  I have continued to use this product (all tubes) even though I didn&#x27;t feel it was working.  Paid for it, may as well keep using it (although the company did offer me a refund)  However, I started using this WITH the Lilash product I had been using before and it seems that my lashes have responded.  Now, I have no way of knowing if combining the products has done the trick, but I will continue this process for now.  I have upgraded from a one-star to a three-star because I believe it may be working now even though it wasn&#x27;t when I was applying this product only.  As I said in my first review, the Lilash had stopped working as well so either it&#x27;s the combination of these two products that is working OR I am having a growth period in my eyelashes.  Either way, my lashes are much better now and certainly a big improvement from what my lashes were like before I had started using these types of products.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Eyelash Growth Serum for a week and a half.  I am a redhead with very light lashes.  I do believe this is working!  I also wear glasses and I actually think my lashes are about to touch the the lens&#x27; of my glasses!!  Thank you for such a great product!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I saw this product because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just clever marketing or if lashes could actually grow faster with the help of a serum. I decided to purchase it because it was either this or fake lashes, and if this worked, I would far prefer it over gluing lashes on all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was surprisingly easy to apply. I usually don&#x27;t like anything close to my eyes (all you contact wearers out there know what I mean!), and when I saw the directions said to brush the serum at the base of your eyelashes, I got a little nervous. However, the brush is small enough so you can easily get the serum where it&#x27;s supposed to go, and it never strayed from where I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using reLASH every night for 2 weeks and am VERY happy to report...my lashes have grown! It took just about two weeks to really start to see the difference, so I would recommend getting it and putting in the time. I can&#x27;t wait to see how much more they grow in the next 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> This is a great serum that is starting to improve the length and density of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  My lashes are definitely growing  but I&#x27;m not to sure about my brows. Hopefully my brows will kick in soon. I&#x27;m  planning on using this product from now on!</li>
            <li> Just started but so far I am pleased</li>
            <li> This did NOTHING for my lashes. I had EXCELLENT results from GrandeLASH MD Eyelash Enhancer, and hoped this would work just as well. Now I&#x27;ve lost all the growth I&#x27;d gained from the GrandeLASH and am back to stubby lashes. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I see many more eyelashes, especially at the corner; they look so healthy!</li>
            <li> Really liked this product! The packaging was very high quality, prefect sized brush and easy to use. Much better smell than products like this I have used in the past- very impressive! It didn&#x27;t sting my eyes or irritate them at all, and my eyes are pretty sensitive. Have been using it about a week and my eyelashes look fullers and healthier. I can&#x27;t wait to use it more and get even greater results!</li>
            <li> I have been using reLash Eyelash Growth Serum for about a week and 2 days now. The difference has been tremendous. I ordered the product because I have always loved big eyelashes. I have tried everything out there. I i have paid over $50 for &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; eyelashes that are glued on to my own, and that was a complete waste. I felt that my eyelashes were actually worse after that treatment because having a foreign product attached to my own eyes only made me want to pull them out or play with them all the time causing them to fall. I have also tried over the counter mascaras that supposedly have serum in them to help the growth, and also have used fiber mascaras. These have been great for the short time being used, but no for long term use. This product is very easy to use, which is one of the reasons I decided to try it. It&#x27;s routine for us women to shower and/or wash our face before bed, applying whatever moisturizer on to our faces, and brushing our teeth. The use of this product fits perfectly into our routines. With clean eyelashes free of make up, and contacts removed, apply a small line of the serum and call it a night. It&#x27;s super easy to use, and though it does have directions to keep away from eyes because it may irritate them, I never had that problem, I recommend this product to everyone! I have bought 3 of these for my mom, my sister in law and my best friend. Makes for a great christmas gift!</li>
            <li> This buyer loved his item very much and wanted more but at the time it was out of stock.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for a section of my eyebrows I was trying to regrow, just a few very faint shorter hairs emerged but did not fill in the area. I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now, so I guess ths is as good as it gets for me.  I won&#x27;t repurchase. Maybe it works better for SOME people.  I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> not seen any difference since using every day</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not meet my expectations as I have not seen any changes in my lashes.  Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do a thing.  have been using for 7 weeks and don&#x27;t notice a thing at all.  Would not buy again.  waste of money</li>
            <li> Great product. I received today. it comes in a container similar to mascara. when applied it did not cause irritation and was easy to apply. I&#x27;m sure it will take some time to see results (only used once so far). I will update the review.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe it actually worked! People always compliment me on how long my lashes look with mascara on</li>
            <li> My lashes are thicker &amp; longer!  Love re-lash!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it over and over....it works so good I have nice long eyelashes up to my eyebrows ( I do these also with relash)....and full and thicker......Sometimes I miss a day here and there...no problem so far they stay long and full.  Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> Last night was my 39th night to use re-lash and unfortunately  no results yet.  :(  I&#x27;ll  keep using  it til it&#x27;s  gone.  I&#x27;m  still hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Dee Dee Daley</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference I took pictures before and after I know everyone is different but nothing for me</li>
            <li> I have tried so many eyelash regrowth products over the years that I have lost count. They all seem to lose their effectiveness on me after a while so I try new ones every six months or so. I have been using this one for about two months now. It does not cause irritation, redness or itching and is easy to apply. It is a once per day application product and I apply it at night before bed after washing off the day. I could not give the product a 5 star because while I have noticed improvement in my brows, I am not noticing much difference in my hopelessly sparse eyelashes where I need it most.</li>
            <li> Love this product! After losing most my real lashes from fake ones, it took about 3 weeks to really see the growth. They look amazing again. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second night using it so I can&#x27;t really tell if I like it or not. I was excited to try this as a promotion. Even if I didn&#x27;t, this is cheaper than any other product like it. Application is simple. It gives directions. Not sure if it works but I can update in a couple weeks with results.</li>
            <li> I stop using my Latisse tretmente to use the reLash Serum and I lost all my new lashes that I gain with Latisse.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this product long enough to see dramatic results, but I can see a difference. reLASH is easy to apply and does not leave your eyes feeling sticky like some I have tried in the past. I have only been using this for less than a week and have incorporated it into my daily routine of applying it in the morning before my makeup and in the evening after I remove all makeup. My eyelashes are generally light and thin so I always wear mascara. After just a few days it looks like my eyelashes may be getting a little longer. I&#x27;m happy to have purchased this during a special promotion and wanted to give my honest opinion on it. I will continue to use it and will try to update at a later time. If you have short or thin eyelashes, I recommend giving this brand a try.</li>
            <li> Unlike Grande Lash, I don&#x27;t experience the burning sensation that worried me when applying Grande Lash.  reLash is less expensive and is really better for me.  I think the results are more pronounced, and I only apply it at night.</li>
            <li> Great product. My lashes look fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product to help boost my lashes, so when I was offered a reviewers opportunity for this re-Lash product I was so excited to try it out. The item arrived on the estimated delivery date and was well packaged. The directions are very simple, just apply one coat before bed and that&#x27;s it! I have applied my first coat tonight, and will be back in a week or two to post results. The product went on very easily and did not smear or drip. It comes with a very narrow brush that is the perfect size for application and it didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my sensitive eyes at all. Excited to see some results!</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I want longer lashes. My mascara seems to make them fall out more than I would like. When I was offered this reLASH Eyelash Growth Serum to try  for a great deal and share my honest opinion about it, of course I ordered immediately.  It arrived and I read the directions which states to use at night after you take your contacts out. The evening came and I removed my contacts, my only issue is that I literally cannot see anything without my contacts. My glasses were slightly in my way as I applied the reLASH Serum, but I was able to apply without to much fuss. Of course in the morning I checked for new growth and saw nothing. Well I continued using the serum every night for the next week and then I saw something...little baby lashes! And according to my sunglasses, my lashes are longer! Need longer lashes, try this reLASH Eyelash Growth Serum before you put extensions.</li>
            <li> Saw results immediately.  Lashes appear darker and thicker. The size is larger at 7.4 ml than most similar products.</li>
            <li> This works wonders to help thicken and lengthen my lashes. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expexted</li>
            <li> This is a great lash growth serum for just about anyone and works quickly.</li>
            <li> I hate to say this but this product is A JOKE. It does not work. I have seen no difference what so ever in my lashes. Actually they are thinner than before I started using this product!</li>
            <li> I have always had thin lashes. When I had the opportunity to try this for a promotional price in exchage for an honest opinion and review I thought what the heck. I am really glad I did. I have never had such full lashes. I have to apply once a day but that isok. I am retouching makeup anyway so you might as touch this up too. There is no irritation or anything. It is easy to apply. If you have thin lashes this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Luv this serum. I have full lashes but as I used make up everyday, I&#x27;m losing my lashes because of the amount of mascara I use. So with this serum it helps provide full lashes. And again I have my full lashes as I was born with it. The shipping was quick. And the product itself is awesome. Apply it before you go to sleep that&#x27;s what I do. Make sure your face is fully clean and dry when applying the serum. You should get it, it is worth it. Thanks again for this amazing serum</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in my lashes as do other people. It&#x27;s a great product. There are other products out there that do the same thing for a lot more money so why not get the results at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> I have horrible light, short eyelashes and I was super excited to be able to get a sample of this product and share my experience with the product with you!  This product is really easy to use. You simply apply it from the inner top corner along the lash line to the outer corner. It goes on smooth and easy. There is no smell and no bad side effects of this product. I have been using this product for 4 weeks and it really does work! My lashes look darker and more full!  Once its on you really can&#x27;t tell that you even put it on! This is a great alternative to eyelash extensions that are super expensive! Its a great product with a money back guarantee so you have nothing to worry about!</li>
            <li> Definitely can tell a difference. Thicker and longer. Only have been using 2 weeks. No side effects.</li>
            <li> This is truly a great product! I was very skeptical when I ordered it, but couldn&#x27;t be any happier. I apply before bed. In the few weeks I have been using it, my eyelashes look they did when I was much younger. I would strongly recommend to anyone that has lost eyelash length due to age, menopause, etc. It is well worth the money. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! My lashes not only are longer but more importantly (to me) are thicker. I&#x27;ll continue to use this :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other eyelash serums for regrowth, but this does seem to help my lashes grow faster, and longer. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> It worked for me. Applying it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> reLash is a great product.  Not to mention the turnaround time.  I received my reLash within a week.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work because my lashes are so thin, but after a few weeks,...I noticed a huge difference in my lashes.  Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I heard about this reLASH eye serum from a friend and how you can get drastic results in about 6 weeks. I just started using the product for a few days and already seeing mild results.  Will update before and afters in a few weeks!  [UPDATE] After 3 months of use, I LOVE my fuller and longer lashes. My boyfriend even made a comment and asked if I was wearing fake lashes when I curled and did my normal make up routine. The best compliment ever. Boys rarely notice anything!  WIN! lol  [photo] It doesn&#x27;t look drastic in the photo, but you do notice fullness and additional length from the before (on top) and after (on the bottom).</li>
            <li> This works really well, only mistake I made was I put it on one eye and not the other to see how well it worked, now I have one eye with way thicker increased lashes, and ever so much longer, and the other eye is sitting there like helloooo me to please. I am trying to now play catch up to get the other eye with this one.</li>
            <li> reLash growth serum has worked great.  No irritation and my lashes are longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product did not work for me at all despite using it religiously, twice daily in the morning and evening, as directed. After 9 weeks, I did not see any difference at all in the thickness or length of my lashes (there is still more serum left, I&#x27;d say it lasts at least 3 months). I used Rimmel&#x27;s Lash Accelerator Serum in the past, with some results. The one star is because the product really didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to do. It was easy to apply, did not cause irritation, or have any negative effects. It simply didn&#x27;t do anything at all. HOWEVER, the customer service is outstanding and my experience with the seller has been nothing but pleasant. They checked in with me after 8 weeks and issued me a refund immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you are unsure about this product, absolutely do get it. Be patient. Worst case scenario, you get your money back.</li>
            <li> This product was okay but I did not see any results out of it the way I did with Latisse product.  I also saw that it has a 180 day refund policy but when I tried it said that I was not able to return it. Why put the 180 day return policy when it is not true?  Thank you, IleneGonzales, Elko, NV  89801</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of lash products. This product works very well without irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  I&#x27;ve tried several lash growth serums and this one actually works!  I started to see results after just one week&#x27;s of use.  Love the product!</li>
            <li> I have seen improvement, for sure.  Looking forward to the results of longer use.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a considerable amount of growth in my eyelashes in a matter or a couple of weeks! Worth the price. A must if you have a history of eyelash extensions!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using reLash for a week.  I am noticing my lashes starting to look longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> Great packaging looks top notch and feels top notch</li>
            <li> Disappointed!! I think I had more lashes before I tried this, having been using it for 6 weeks and can barely see my lashes even with mascara.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 2 weeks and it seems to bulk up my lashes. I have long lashes but they needed a bit of thickening. This product is the bomb!</li>
            <li> OK, no joke.  I used Latisse for 1.5 years and it gave me great results.  But then I stopped (the prescription ran out and I never made it to the doctor to get it updated).  One day doing research online I came across reLash.  I bought it after reading the reviews here and even though I was skeptical about positive reports after two weeks, I figured eventually my lashes would grow.  It has been just over two weeks and it&#x27;s like I am wearing mascara all the time.  Amazing results.  So much so that I just ordered my second bottle.  Woot!</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed in my &amp;#34;results.&amp;#34; I followed the directions but failed to see much change in my lashes at all.</li>
            <li> My wife was using LiLash and I bought her this to try and her results were much better with Relash. This is her new go to product.</li>
            <li> does not appear to work as well as other brands.  will switch back to grandlashMD</li>
            <li> I got this order of reLASH Eyelash Serum for my wife and it only arrived a few days ago and she has only used it a few times. She has complained that her eyelashes have started to thin out (as well as her hair) as she ages, and she is definitely not a false eyelashes kind of person. So I surprised her with this and of course she jumped right in with it. Her first comments was there were no bad side effects whatsoever when she put it on, which made her happy.  After reading the other reviews and trying it for herself, she’s very confident that she’ll get the results she’s hoping for.  Overall, very pleased with the service and the product.</li>
            <li> My eyebrow hair is not coming out as well on the left side as it is on the right.</li>
            <li> This works well. I have been applying it twice a day and definitely see a difference in the length and thickness of my lashes. I have used Latisse in the past, and it caused me to have hyper-pigmentation on my lids. I looked like a weird lizard. This product has not caused any pigmentation or irritation after 8 weeks of use. It&#x27;s almost as good as Latisse, in my opinion. The applicator is fantastic. Will definitely get another bottle.</li>
            <li> Saw a difference in my lashes in just 2 weeks! After just two weeks I noticed the length in my lashes were longer. Now I&#x27;ve been using reLash for a month and a half and my lashes are now much longer, thicker, and fuller. I can tell such a difference and I&#x27;m SO happy with the results! Will be buying again!!!!</li>
            <li> When I was younger my eyelashes were were lusciously long and divinely thick... I&#x27;m super excited about using reLash to help regain what was once one of my most complimented facial features - My Lashes! I&#x27;ve read a lot of great reviews from people who have used the product, so I have no doubt the it will work for me as well! I like the fact that it is &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34; as well.</li>
            <li> There is a reason Latisse costs twice as much and is harder to come by-it works~this product, however, does not!</li>
            <li> I have just started using my reLash for about 4 days now.  It thus far has been very comfortable to wear and has not irritated my eyes.  I will come back in a couple weeks to share more about my experience with reLash!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work AT ALL!!!!!! I have used other brands in the past so i am very familiar with results.... I kept waiting for long or even semi long lashes and it just didn&#x27;t happen. Would NEVER use this again. A total waste.</li>
            <li> This product is working great. My lashes are growing darker and fuller and very quick, so everybody can notice the difference. I used to put another product before but it made my eyes redish and unconfortable sometimes. Nothing of these happens with this one. Really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I like that it does not irritate my eyes. I will buy this again for sure!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for results but after many weeks, I don&#x27;t see any difference in my lash length.</li>
            <li> I just got my order of reLASH- eyelash serum. As I have gotten older my eyelashes have started to thin out. But there is no way I want to put on false eyelashes. I used this with no side effects. As I have gotten older my lashes have thinned out. I am excited because my lashes got slightly longer and thicker within a short period. Great value for the price!!!! I&#x27;m planning on giving some as gifts to my family members...</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, noticeably longer lashes and brows in about a week!</li>
            <li> The Wife loves this product normally things like this cause her eyelashes to fall out. This product did not have that effect. She was super excited that she is able to use something like this. It&#x27;s has been a long time. Now we can get her a product she can finally use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> One month later with no difference</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any result after 2 months of use, caused my eyes to water and itch...eventually had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the product.  I saw results in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Great! Also I would like to add that the customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed improvement but not drastic enough to rated any higher.</li>
            <li> It has only been a couple of weeks but I am starting to notice a difference in the thickness of the lashes, particularly at the base where I most wanted the change. If this continues, I&#x27;ll have some real noticeable change, but even as it is now, I&#x27;m impressed. The product is definitely worth trying and they send you a coupon for 10% off your next purchase. Not a bad deal!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference at all.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved this I bought it as a gift for her birthday, she says it really makes her eyebrows look bigger.</li>
            <li> I am not allergic to anything but this slightly burned me.  It was uncomfortable but would of been worth it , if it worked, but it didn&#x27;t.  A complete waste of money</li>
            <li> Seeing eye lashes grow after month of every day use, can&#x27;t wait for full results. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old and my lashes were thinning out terribly. I could hardly tell if I had lashes as they were so sparse. Today it is a MUCH different story.  I have been using this product for over four weeks. Applying it once every night. I didn&#x27;t experience any adverse effects thankfully. Today my lashes are much fuller. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I wish I had taken before and after photos to show you but alas I did not. Thank you for such a fantastic product. I have been pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> No noticeable change in lashes</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have tried other lash lengthening serums, but this product seems to give faster results and my eyelashes are darker, which I like.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> My stressful job causes me to tug on my poor eyelashes. Since mascara could not cover up the bald spots and my lashes were not growing in fast enough. I decided to try this item and have been using it for over a month now. My lashes have grown quickly and it looks a bit thicker than it once was. After applying mascara, I&#x27;ve been asked if I&#x27;m wearing falsies. I would purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using reLASH for 8 weeks now and I love the results! Totally comparable to prescription products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, but at a third of the price.&lt;br /&gt;As expected, it took about 4-5 weeks for me to start noticing a difference but at this point I&#x27;m amazed at the improvement in length and fullness! As other reviewers mentioned, the tube and applicator are super easy to use. Easy to throw in a purse or makeup bag for overnight trips. I like the applicator as well - the small brush makes it easier to apply without getting it all over yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up from me! Will get it again.</li>
            <li> No change at all.  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> Noticing a bit of difference in length but not in thickness. I&#x27;ve been using as directed for over a month. I was hoping for better results.</li>
            <li> Great product! I saw noticeable growth on my lashes within a week of using it. I plan to keep using it to keep my eyelashes looking full and long.</li>
            <li> Wow.  Awesome product.  My eyelashes look so much healthier.</li>
            <li> I am totally disappointed! After a month and a half of using this product, I am  noticing that I&#x27;m losing lashes versus gaining longer lashes! I would never use this product again!! Beware!!</li>
            <li> Good seller, quick results!!!:-)</li>
            <li> This was a great product . After two weeks of use you can already see the serum making a difference in my eye lashes. I was wary at first since I wear contact lenses and so my eyes are very sensitive. But there were no side effects and it was definitely worth the price listed. I would be back again...Thank you again for a great product</li>
            <li> My girl said that she needed a new eyelash from the store, i said hold on, I got something coming. Surprised her with it and she loves it and asked me where I got it. Well that&#x27;s my little secret :)</li>
            <li> LOVE...LOVE this product!!!  I will admit I was a huge skeptic. I have tried other growth type products will little change and there were so any steps to follow.  As I have gotten older, my lashes have definitely thinned and I needed something fast and easy...NO fake lashes.  Since using the reLash, the difference in thickness and length is now very noticeable.  I have had no irritation at all and will continue to use reLash!!! If you are over 50...BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> Been using this every night for a couple of weeks now. I think there might be a slight improvement. When I put mascara on my eyelashes look longer. Is it the serum or mascara or both?</li>
            <li> I wanted to do this quick video recommending this amazing product. For me I have always been obsessed with my eye lashes and having long thick amazing lashes. For a long time I have used eye lash extensions for which for all your girls out there that have them know, they are extremely expensive and you spend over $100 every few weeks to fill them. I was trying to find an alternative that was more natural and more affordable. I came across this product, ReLash. After about 3 weeks I already saw a little bit of a difference. My eye lashes were looking longer and thicker. I have been using it for about a month and half now. It has been like night and day! My eye lashes look thick, long and beautiful!!  It&#x27;s like a transformation! I get compliments all the time on my eye lashes now, people asking me what I use and what my trick is. They are extremely thick and didn&#x27;t look like this before. So I&#x27;m just saying if you like having amazing lashes, I would recommend this product to anyone, for all you girls who have eye lash extensions it&#x27;s a very affordable way to still have amazing lashes!!!Best product ever!!</li>
            <li> I used this product and liked it very much. My lashes were longer an fuller. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the great lash serum!  Great seller, arrived fast, and this doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like others I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> After I week of use my lashes &amp; brows look thicker.  Have to use rest of product to see how far I can go!</li>
            <li> Excellent price and very accurately described, Happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product! My lashes are thin and this serum makes my mascara go on smoother and my lashes look thicker. I had some shorter lashes that now look to be evening out, which is fantastic! I will be recommending this to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have access to paying wholesale for some of the top lash serums on the marker and this by far exceeds any of their results.....&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many.&lt;br /&gt;This can use on your brows also!! I highly recommend this product!! It is perfect just in time for the holidays and a perfect stocking stuffer!! This gets an A+ in my book!!</li>
            <li> This product is great. I have been using it for a little over a week and see a significant difference in my eyelashes. I had no idea that this was possible when it came to your eyelashes. I have heard of people getting fake lashes and of different mascaras, but this is truly the way to go if you are looking to get more luscious looking eyelashes. I am excited to see the results after more time goes by!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all these great reviews. This didn&#x27;t work for me. It made my eyes blood shot red and blurred my vision :(&lt;br /&gt;Been Going for the natural route now. Conditioning my lashes with natural vitamin E oil for the last year and this worked better for me than anything else I tried. My lashes aren&#x27;t as long as falsies but they are stronger and slightly longer and not to mention happy without the harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> Good but I needed something stronger so I decided to try Royal Lashes. It&#x27;s given me longer lashes in just 2 weeks! I got mine from RoyalCosmetics.net</li>
            <li> I have seen NO CHANGE with is product ! 😔</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed a hue difference yet. I will continue the recommended 8 weeks and hopefully see better results.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this was a total waste of money. I applied it twice a day as instructed for over three weeks and it didn&#x27;t make the slightest bit of difference to my eyelashes. The product instructions state that it needs to be applied for at least 8 weeks before you see results. And I say that&#x27;s bogus. After three weeks, you should see some difference. The only &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; thing about it was at least it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I&#x27;ll have to try something else. What a major disappointment! Certainly do not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> absolutetly nothing happened to me! :( Even I had lost lashes...</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy application!</li>
            <li> I bought reLASH because I was intrigued by the good reviews it had, and because the company promises to refund your money if the serum doesn&#x27;t do anything for you - no questions asked. I&#x27;ve always wanted longer lashes, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the hefty price of some of the other serums on the market - nor did I want to buy something that would sting my eyes upon application. Well, reLASH was the answer! I have been using it consistently for the past 5 weeks and my lashes are now longer, stronger and more beautiful than when I started. I apply the serum along the base of my upper lashes after washing my makeup off at night - the little brush applicator makes it very easy to apply. I haven&#x27;t had any side effects from using this product and I started noticing results almost immediately. After just a couple of uses, my lashes looked healthier. As the weeks went by, I noticed that they were also getting thicker and more luscious. They started growing after a couple of weeks - just a little bit, nothing major, but it gave me hope for even better results at the end of the treatment. After 5 weeks I have gained a few millimeters in length and I expect my lashes to grow even longer in the next few weeks. I would definitely recommend reLASH to anybody interested in getting, longer, stronger lashes and I&#x27;ll most likely buy it again when my first tube runs out!</li>
            <li> I used Latisse for a couple of years and noticed a big difference after just 3 or so weeks.  I have been using this product for a month and there has been no difference at all.  I will continue to use it for a bit longer -- maybe it will just take longer on me?  I can&#x27;t afford Latisse anymore so I was hoping this would be a great alternative. :(</li>
            <li> Amazing how quickly I saw results (3 wks) Will always have in my makeup bag. Arrived quickly. Item as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now, and have noticed my lashes are fuller and longer.  I also applied to sparse areas of my eyebrows, and they have filled in as well.  Thank you for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for 3 weeks and have seen no results as of yet. I will keep using it until i run out and update my comments. Will keep you all posted.</li>
            <li> This seem to be working. I only used it for about 10 days and I can see a diffrents already.</li>
            <li> My lashes are positively longer.  I am hoping if I continue to use it they will also thicken.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder when I finish what I have4.</li>
            <li> I have yet to see the changes. It&#x27;s been close to a month of using and I didn&#x27;t see any changes to my eyelash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using reLASH for a few weeks - putting it on my upper lid lash line before going to sleep.  Just this morning I looked in the mirror as I applied my mascara - and noticed a significant difference in last fullness and length.  This product lives up to it&#x27;s claims, and I will suggest it to my friends.  I am a fan, and will repurchase it when the time comes!  Run out and buy it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Some re growth of lashes. But, I can&#x27;t say it is the greatest I have used.</li>
            <li> I have been using Latisse and decided to try your product.  For the last 3 weeks I have used Latisse on one eye and relash on the other.  Well the relash eye is now looking better than the Latisse eye!  I know everyone has a different body chemistry but this product works for me and  is  more affordable,  has healthy ingredients and I am excited to find it!</li>
            <li> So I ordered the ReLash and received it on 1/24/15. I see a MAJOR difference because I had no eyebrows from waxing (which I have stopped) &amp; just in general (runs in my family) and no eyelashes from wearing individuals eyelashes that pulled out my natural eyelashes. My eyebrows have grown in fuller than ever in my life because they have always been thin and my eyelashes are full and long. I use it morning and night. I will be ordering more. I was skeptical at first and did a lot of research and decided to go with ReLash. I&#x27;m a customer for life, very satisfied with the product and glad I went with this brand. My husband even noticed and saw a difference. No more fake eyelashes ! Woohoo!</li>
            <li> I have bought many different brands including ones from a dermatologist. The is AWESOME!  I actually noticed a difference within one week!  I did not expect it to work so quickly!! There was one spot on my left lid where the lashes were sparse and now that spot has grown in!  My lashes look thicker also. The only thing is my bottom lashes are still very thin. But I&#x27;m happy with the upper lashes.  And I hav sensitive eyes and it does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had been using Rapidlash, which at first worked very well.  then it seemed to stop working, and I tried this serum.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything for my lashes.  no extra length or thickness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed improvement in my lashes in a week&#x27;s time. Makes my mascara application an easy task now. Great product!</li>
            <li> I had used a previous eyelash serum and loved it, and they stopped making it.  For a year I have been searching for a replacement, I can officially say I found it!!! It works very well, does not irritate, and is effective.  So very grateful!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after pulling out half of my lashes on my left eye by accident with an eyelash curler. I was devastated and desperate for a fast fix! After using this product for four weeks my lashes are growing back and I&#x27;ve noticed a definite change in the length and fullness of my lashes in general.</li>
            <li> I have been using Latisse for years, since I was able to acquire it cheap.  However, my source dried up, so I deiced to give ReLash a try.  My lashes were already longish from the Latisse use, but so far I have not seen any diminishing lashes.  It has been a rather short time, however, so time will tell; but, so far I am liking the product.</li>
            <li> Great product....it really works!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are almost nonexistent.  I had them dyed and they were still so faint I was told I did not have to pay.  Since using this product I see definite&lt;br /&gt;progress.  I have eyebrows!  Still faint, but still a big improvement.  It&#x27;s been 6 weeks and will continue using night and day.</li>
            <li> I am a recovering chemo patient and wanted to try anything to get my eyelashes back....they are growing nicely and I am thrilled...still need to see a thicker lash but it has only been two weeks</li>
            <li> I have seen a slow improvement.  I got much better results from Rapid Lash and it&#x27;s cheaper!</li>
            <li> I suspect some reviews here may not be honest. This did nothing for me. Not. One. Thing. I used it very faithfully. True, I&#x27;m 50, lost a lot of lash length after chemo (which also spurred menopause), and I have thyroid problems; even with all that, though, I still can get a pretty good look with mascara; my lashes used to be extravagantly long, so now they&#x27;re just average, though thin individually. But, with some of the reviews I&#x27;d read, including one from an older woman with thyroid problems (or at least, that was what was stated), that I&#x27;d see some benefit from this product, even though I&#x27;ve never heard of anything other than Latisse that actually worked on eyelashes. And apparently, I still haven&#x27;t. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this product. I originally have long and thick lashes and usually my hair and lashes grow pretty fast. However, I started breaking out really bad and my dermatologist prescribe me accutane and some other tropical cream that helped me with my acne. My skin gotten better, but my eyebrows and eyelashes started falling out due to the medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for a month on my brows and lashes, and wow did it do wonders. I wish I could use it all over my head so my hair could grow thicker and faster as well. The downside is that I didn&#x27;t really know when to stop using this product because when my lashes started to grow longer, it eventually started falling off I&#x27;m not sure why. I&#x27;d have lashes falling when I wash my face in the morning and I don&#x27;t use soap, I only use water and facial sponge and avoid the eyes area. So, when I stop using it, a few of my lashes that are longer in length will fall which made me use it again so it grows back. But if I use it regularly, it will make my lashes grow long until it falls again. Currently I use it 3 to 4 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion is that if you decide to use it, take it slow. It&#x27;s a good product and it did what it says it would. You will have long beautiful lashes in a month or so, but make sure you start using it less once you almost reach the length you wanted.</li>
            <li> There are so many eye/hair products out there, but I didn&#x27;t know a product like this existed! I have plucked my eyebrows for years, to the point where some of my eyebrow hair didn&#x27;t grow back. Now that thicker and fuller eyebrows are the trend, I wanted to find a way to get this look.  I previously used an eyebrow pencil to fill in my eyebrows. This wasn&#x27;t an effective method for me. My eyebrows looked unnatural and I had smudges on my face from the eyebrow liner. I was never good at applying fake eyelashes, and getting them professionally done it so expensive. Nonetheless, finding the eLASH Growth Serum was a very exciting alternative!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle looks like a mascara tube. The serum is applied with a small skinny brush type applicator. The serum itself is clear and is easy to apply. It dries quickly with no flaking. I did not experience any irritation with this product whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with my results this far. My eyebrows look amazing! They definitely look thicker and more contoured. My eyelashes are thicker as well. I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Works great, seeing results after a week of use</li>
            <li> I have used many eyelash serums in the past, and by far, this is the absolute best!  Before I purchased reLASH, I considered the reviews, both positive and negative; but in the end I made the decision to purchase reLASH. I am glad I did and I am one satisfied customer.  I actually noticed increased lash growth in about 3 weeks.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> no change in lash length. Would not purchase again. Does not even begin to compare to Latisse.</li>
            <li> WOW! That&#x27;s sums it up! AMAZING RESULTS IN only 4 weeks! I also applied it to my eyebrows!! Crazy results ! I will be buying this again for sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month with zero results. I have used Latisse in the past and frankly, that is the ONLY product that has worked. So why did I try ReLash? As much as I loved how long and thick my lashes got (so long they touches my eyeglasses) the last go around was uncomfortable...eyes itching, redness around the eyes and expense. The only upside of Relash is here has been no side effects....but also no results. I&#x27;ll give it another month but I don&#x27;t have high hopes and will probably return it.</li>
            <li> I had never tried an Eyelash growth serum or anything before this product, and I was a little worried like &amp;#34;man i hope it doesnt blind me&amp;#34; and no worries there at all! It doesnt burn or cause any discomfort for me,. I also use this on my brows trying to get them to grow in more so I can basically start over after a horrible waxing experience haha :)&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using about  a week and a half I havent noticed much difference other than my brows and lashes seem super soft, but Im sure in time my brows and lashes will be longer and fuller :)&lt;br /&gt;I use this twice a day once in the morning and once at night</li>
            <li> Excellent product! After using this products I am now excited to apply mascara as they are fuller than ever &amp; look incredible! (my lashes are blonde &amp; were once not very full/long) my mom sees me quiet often &amp; she noticed them obviously bc she tried picking my lashes to see if they weren&#x27;t the glue on kind bc she said she never knew i had lashes that long lol! The packing, instructions, customer service &amp; satisfaction promise were all superb &amp; I&#x27;m very happy with the results of this &amp; more confident too!</li>
            <li> Made my lashes grow more full and darker. Now i have eyelashes. Wow</li>
            <li> I returned it...allergic reaction :(</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a way to make my eyelashes to look fuller. I tried the eyelash curler. It worked for awhile but you have to make sure you do it all the time. I love this product because you have to just apply it once and it lasts all day. Its color is perfect and its very easy to apply. Even for the beginners with makeup can apply it very easily. I won&#x27;t leave home without this product that is for sure. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It very quickly lengthened my lashes, so it works. It did however leave my eyes feeling dry and changed my eye color. I have always had blue/green eyes. In only two weeks they have started to turn brown. Even since I stopped they are getting darker and darker brown.</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, after at least 3 weeks of using the product I have not seen any significant difference. Of course, I cannot let something like this rule my life and the directions tend to make you do so. According to the instructions you should apply on the CLEANSED area twice a day. Well, that&#x27;s not a problem at night but in the morning I have to apply regular makeup therefore my eyes require some color. So, if that is what is keeping me from seeing the results others are seeing then perhaps the product just isn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been applying it to the underbrow area and again there has been no substantial difference.</li>
            <li> I believe my lashes have gotten a bit longer. No change in color - still very fair.</li>
            <li> I honestly havn&#x27;t seen a difference so I don&#x27;t want to rate it until the end of the 8 weeks to see if there is a change.</li>
            <li> I have notice that my lashes have become longer and thicker in the past weeks. I am very happy with the results, and would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I wear eyelash extensions.  Eyelash growth serum was recommended to me to strengthen my eyelashes so I would have a good base to adhere to.  This was my first shot at an eyelash serum, and I was skeptical.  I have been using reLASH on one side for a few nights and I can already start to see some changes. I&#x27;m hoping that these positive changes continue.  The serum has a nice texture and is fragrance free.  Instructions were clear, leaving me feeling confident about application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this, along with other similar serums,  at a discount price so that I could test them and provide an honest evaluation. After trying on my lash line for a few days, I decided to put some on my eyebrow.  The spot on my eyebrow where it was pierced many years ago has always been thinner than the rest of my brows so I&#x27;m attempting to grow that part back.  I am also recommending to a friend who has thin eyebrows due to thyroid issues.</li>
            <li> I really did like this growth serum. It took my small lashes and grew them to make them a little longer and fuller. The serum has a very light texture and was easy to work with as well.  (I received this product at a discounted rate to leave an honest review).</li>
            <li> I will update when I have more results, but thus far, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product. I&#x27;m more concerned about my eyebrows rather than my lashes, but I&#x27;m using it on both anyway. I did extensive googling on the ingredients before using this, and I was pleasantly surprised. After reading some horror stories about women who used different products on their hair to aid with growth, I was a bit concerned, but laboratory testing on the ingredients in this didn&#x27;t turn up anything negative. From the googling that I did, it seems that the active ingredient in this is the same as that in growth serums in the price range of $200! I was impressed, so I tried it. Thus far, no ill effects. My eyes tend to water if someone sneezes within a ten foot radius (meaning, my eyes water really easily) and using almost any product near my eyes is a no go. But, I bravely applied this along my eyelashes and brows as directed, and it doesn&#x27;t run, it dries quickly, and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes tear up! I&#x27;m very excited to see results, and will post pictures soon! *I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working - am using it on my eyelashes and they seem to be growing!</li>
            <li> PROS: It works. Lots of friends and family noticed the difference in two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: NOT PERMANENT</li>
            <li> Haven t used it yet but  ad was misleading it read for lashes and brows so I expected two.</li>
            <li> Zero results. Waste of money</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! makes me eyelashes SO LONG!</li>
            <li> It was okay, but not as promised</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 weeks now seems will doing good job with lashs</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to help&lt;br /&gt;Strengthen my lashes and grow more because I was getting eyelash extensions and was told having more/stronger lashes would make the extensions look fuller and last longer. After only two weeks of use, my aestiocian was noticing significant growth, and new lash growth</li>
            <li> This not working for me. :-(</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. I just simply put it on after I washed my face before bed. In addition to this, I would remove my make up with coconut oil because it really gets off the makeup and also conditions your lashes (AND ITS CHEAP).  I already have pretty long lashes but I could see a difference in about a month with this product. My lashes also were falling out less, which I noticed.</li>
            <li> I think it is working.  I have missed a day or two on occasion.  Lashes do seem longer and fuller than before.  I have used Latisse and see about the same with your product.</li>
            <li> Very fast service. I am seeing great results for time that I have been using this product, around 3 weeks.  I have sensitive eyes and so far it hasn&#x27;t been irritating me.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift several times and every recipient has been very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a very nice improvement in the length and thickness of my eyelashes. I will continue to use and order this product. Also impressed with the excellent customer sevice.</li>
            <li> Still have not noted a difference yet.</li>
            <li> I need more time to test it out so I will come back once I see the results after several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;If you wear contacts, make sure to remove them. Nice packaging!! Instructions on back are very clear.&lt;br /&gt;I def. need this as hair is harder to grow as we age.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It does not irritate my eyes like others I&#x27;ve tried, and with regular use I have noticed a difference in my lashes.  Also, I tried using it to help fill in my brows where I had overplucked, so the hairs weren&#x27;t growing back in anymore, and a few of them have now with this product.  Yay!  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product! Thank you</li>
            <li> Received my reLASH product superfast!  I started applying my reLASH product last night and am anxiously awaiting my reLASH results!  Stay tuned in and I will post my reLASH results soon!</li>
            <li> So excited about this product! I just got it and was very impressed that it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes when I applied it. I know it&#x27;s not to go in the eyes but when you are placing product on your lashes some is bound to seep in. I used Latisse for a while and the brushes were horrible! It was inevitable to get the serum all over the lid with those. The other issue with that is that people start growing random hair where the serum touches. I worked in a cosmetic surgeon&#x27;s office and I had patient&#x27;s come in with some crazy looking lashes. I blame this on the brush. This product is so much better so far. I will be using it nightly and will return with a results review in 5 or 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> This was just the thing I was looking for. My lashes are thinning and I needed something to make them full again. The good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes when putting it on.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Just loving this!  The shipping was fast and I&#x27;m glad about that because I really wanted to try this out.  I have short, stubby lashes and have been waiting around for just the right product to come out and this is it!  The application is simple to use and not gummy or tacky. I like the 100% money back guarantee.  I feel safe using this product.  I&#x27;m seeing improvements already.</li>
            <li> This item works very well and it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes when applied. I did notice that my lashes were longer.</li>
            <li> Was impressed by size and quantity. Very easy to apply, with the brush... Much easier to apply than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> Great gift for my wife .we really like it.</li>
            <li> Improved with a thick look but not length!</li>
            <li> I really love this product!  I have not been using it too long...but I am already seeing some results!  I would definitely recommend the eyelash growth serum as part of a stellar beauty regime.  Thanks RELASH!</li>
            <li> After reading all of the excellent reviews about reLASH, I was very optimistic about this product. I received the product in a timely manner and I was super excited to start using it immediately... Unfortunately,  I don&#x27;t see any of the results that the other reviews led me to believe. I saw no growth, change in thickness, or resiliency of my eye lashes or brows.  In fact It appears that I&#x27;m losing lashes instead of growing them... I&#x27;ve used rapid lash previous to using this product; the reviews weren&#x27;t as great, but I feel as though that worked better for me.... I&#x27;m quite disappointed.....Been using reLASH for about a month &amp; nothing......</li>
            <li> Works great it does what it says.</li>
            <li> The product arrived within a couple of days of ordering. The tube and applicator is very easy and comfortable to use. Much better than the similar prescription product. After using reLASH for  two weeks both my lashes and brows have noticeably more volume.  From experience I expect that to l see more lash length in the next couple of week.  Very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I am Amazed how well this product works !! I never thought these worked but after trying it for a couple of weeks i see a huge difference . LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does not sting my eyes.  Would recommend this brand.  Noticed that lashes are getting thick.</li>
            <li> I have been using over 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any changed of my eye lash. I am surprised that it didn&#x27;t work for me since many people love it...very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using reLash-eyelash growth serum for a while now and I definitely see my lashes grow longer and fullerâ€¦my eyelashes were very thin and short and I tried several products but nothing really helpedâ€¦when I used mascara my lashes still appeared very shortâ€¦finally one of my friends recommended me reLash-eyelash growth serumâ€¦I didnâ€™t think that would work but she told me just keep using it and it works!  After using it for one month my lashes grew fuller and longer and my eyes look even pretty good without using mascara.  This product is awesome and I will recommend it to any women have short and thin eyelashesâ€¦just keep using it and you will see the lashes grow longer and fuller! It works!ïŠ</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve always had descent eyelashes, so I honestly didn&#x27;t think this would do anything at all, but since I stopped wearing makeup, I wanted my eyelashes to look long and thick without mascara, so I figured, why not?  This product exceeded my expectations so much, and I am honestly so happy with it. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now, but I started seeing results after about 2 weeks.  I could not be happier with this product and I will continue buying this.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again.  My lashes were breaking and stopped growing on the inside corners of my eyes and this stuff seems to have kickstarted  the growth and I have way less breakage.  I  apply it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this product nightly for over 2 months, without a single day off. However, I did not notice any difference to my lash length and thickness. I purchased because I saw a 4.9/5 review, apparently there was quite a bit bias in the early reviewers. I have got to do some fairness to future buyers. This may not be as good as the reviews say.</li>
            <li> Still working but little bit good than before I think I need times</li>
            <li> I am using relash for my eyebrows. Every evening after I washed my face I would apply relash. The brush is very fine so I wondered how well the liquid would go on to my brows. In less than a month I noticed my brows seemed to be getting thicker. Not a huge difference, but enough for me to tell. I think it&#x27;s working so I just purchased another tube and may try on my lashes too. Will update comments and rating if needed after I use the second tube and don&#x27;t continue to see a difference. (Side note, I&#x27;ve been using product on my brows once a day for over a month and I haven&#x27;t run out yet.)</li>
            <li> This product was a lot easier to apply than I anticipated. This is great to strengthen your eyelashes and promote growth.Most women love long eyelashes but some of us has to have a little help. Well ladies here is your help. I was so excited to obtain this product and to give my opinion on it. I have never really used anything like this before so I was skeptical.I am so glad that I did.All you have to do is wash your face and remove your makeup ( be sure to remove your contacts). and then apply with the brush that came with it.You will want to do this every night until you feel you have achieved what you were wanting from your eyelashes.Try it for a week or two at least and see if you notice healthier and fuller brows. I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is so-so don&#x27;t really see any difference, but have noticed that my lashes are not falling out as much</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised.  I saw eyebrow growth within a few days.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months and there are absolutely no results. I took a photo of my lashes before I stated and a month after no results. Took a photo a month after still no results. Overrated and overpriced. Save your money.</li>
            <li> This eyelash serum has been great for me!  I always want my eyelashes to seem plumper but they always look so thin.  I have noticed a great amount of growth in the short time I have been using this.  It is very easy to apply.  Make sure you remove your contact lenses and make up before applying.  I am so glad that I was given the opportunity to review this product and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about a week and a half and can feel my lashes thickening. The length is coming in as well, hopefully by prom time my lashes are extravagantly longer! By the looks of it they will be! Way more than what I expect!</li>
            <li> This works and after the first week my lashes were longer. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as others I have used</li>
            <li> It is a little harder to apply than I had thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. I&#x27;ve applied it as directed and nothing has happened. Other lash serums I&#x27;ve used have worked wonders and I was excited to try this one. I am sorry to say I would like a refund. It did nothing. :(((</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice any difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 1.5 months now.  I used it on both my eye lashes and eyebrows.  Since application on both areas, I have noticed my eye lashes have increased in length and perhaps in thickness.  My eyebrows have not changed their scantiness, but I will continue to use the product.  I feel that the progress noted in the eyelash length will also enhance the eyebrows. Time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;Connie</li>
