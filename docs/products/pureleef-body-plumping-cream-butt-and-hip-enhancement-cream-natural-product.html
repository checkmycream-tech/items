            <li>/&gt;Update: Found a deal on some good programs here -  www.buttgoals.com - if anybody is interested.  </li>
            <li>It starts to feel good for the first hour or so</li>
            <li>I dislike the mint sensation when you first put it on, but it does smell good.</li>
            <li>you can see how I&#x27;ve filled out the shorts :)</li>
            <li>I will be ordering another jar as I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love the fact that it&#x27;s a hormonal free product.</li>
            <li>Also the price is right for this jar size!!</li>
            <li>I definitely need another jar &amp; i will be happy to get two more based on my progress</li>
            <li>The odor is kinda strong</li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;m loving mine!</li>
            <li>and i see a huge difference</li>
            <li>You are genetically predisposed to where you carry the most of your bodyfat &amp; where it will be the first to go.</li>
            <li>Seen a change right away !</li>
            <li>Love this stuff just purchased ready to see the results</li>
            <li>Many people that know me very well have noticed before I had a chance to mention it.</li>
            <li>If anyone is wanting a more natural approach to enhancing your assets this is the way to go &amp; if anyone has any questions, doubts, or concerns email me at allenjada306@gmail.com!</li>
            <li>Tried this product and felt a sensation right away.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, 5 stars.</li>
            <li>First time trying this product</li>
            <li>I am still on my first jar &amp; today is June 19.</li>
            <li>, I know I really like the product!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day consistently in the beginning.</li>
            <li>evening you have to be consistent.</li>
            <li>So make sure you spread the cream over your entire thigh area is this is your target concern area!</li>
            <li>I am a curvy lady and every time I focus on working out, the first thing to go is my butt.</li>
            <li>First of all I have not nor do I know anyone who has purchased this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently twice a day along</li>
            <li>my next order I&#x27;m going to focus more on my hips...</li>
            <li>Many women complain about &amp;#34;losing their butt&amp;#34; when starting out a new workout plan.</li>
            <li>I wish they had a money back guarantee but its fine.</li>
            <li>and I can now see a slight indention in my thigh where my upper thigh is getting more plump than the lower thigh where I did not rub the cream!!</li>
            <li>Like it really worked fast for me</li>
            <li>I dont really think Butt cream work for veryskinny people, its not a miracle cream</li>
            <li>it really lives up to its expectations.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Your glutes are a muscle work the muscle and learn how to scuplt your body with exercerise for real results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m real and will give yall an update in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I kind of wasted but lesson learned.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong minty smell and tingled a little when I put it on.</li>
            <li>My first bottle has lasted me since about mid april.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: Whenever I worked out intensely, my butt would be the first to go.</li>
            <li>So if you have a butt and want to enhance it, I highly recommend pureleef.</li>
            <li>i never even beleived that a cream would make ur butt bigger, just wanted to give it a try, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Am gonna keep using this and buy more to see if am gonna add few inches</li>
            <li>No negative side effects and it has now been 2 months.</li>
            <li>picture on the left is 4.13.15 and 5.1.15 on the right .</li>
            <li>So as I researched products, as I am not a fan of surgery, I ran across this new one and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>Had it almost a month really haven&#x27;t seen any major difference</li>
            <li>The first month I used the cream in conjunction with squats the second month</li>
            <li>Not only have I noticed plumping in my butt, I have also notice my stretch marks fading you must be consistent.</li>
            <li>If you are consistent initially and wein off to once a day with moderate exercise, you (and others haha)</li>
            <li>my butt is plumper &amp; my hips have actually filled in a little.</li>
            <li>I have used 1 jar so far.</li>
            <li>and I became very plump back there</li>
            <li>Paired with squats about 3 times a week (nothing major) and still results!</li>
            <li>Put it on tonight, used like a quarter size and can feel a icy hot sensation.  </li>
            <li>Been using this since the 19th of May and no results yet so can&#x27;t really give a bad or good review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s made my bottom a little more jiggly, but didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; like advertised or I just haven&#x27;t used it long enough for it to plump.</li>
            <li>You would think since its seemed to have launched in early 2015, there&#x27;d be a few TRUTHFUL, HELPFUL reviews, but there aren&#x27;t &amp; I won&#x27;t buy until I see a few</li>
            <li>This is simply because you are not eating enough calories &amp; doing too much cardio, not enough weight training.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks i saw a dramatic difference&lt;br /&gt;it plumped up my butt giving it a better shape and my bony hips are no longer bony ^-^</li>

            <li> This is simply because you are not eating enough calories &amp; doing too much cardio, not enough weight training.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks i saw a dramatic difference&lt;br /&gt;it plumped up my butt giving it a better shape and my bony hips are no longer bony ^-^</li>
            <li> but I mainly got this for my hips because I have narrow indented hips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second jar, believe me I was super skeptical about this</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a single helpful testimonial about this product since I&#x27;ve researched it.</li>
            <li> Just used for first time last night and woke up with these weird purple bumps all over my butt.</li>
            <li> Tried it, saw minimal results, but that could all just be mental.</li>
            <li> It takes a few months before u see results but it worked and has made my butt and hips slightly bigger, smoother.</li>
            <li> a round plump shape takes a while to finally work</li>
            <li> and I must admit it has done what I expected it to do; maintain my butt.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen what I expected so $50.00</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical of the cream.</li>
            <li> I asked how the cr√®me knows it&#x27;s being applied to your butt because some questions were asked if this product can be used on other body parts, in which the answer was &amp;#34;No.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I mean, how silly does this sound?</li>
            <li> i have some fat down dat hips.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not cool</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to use it a little bit longer and  see results.</li>
            <li> My only negative is that it took 4 months to work but at least it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> This gimmicky stuff just doesn&#x27;t fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had this cream for a few weeks now,  </li>
            <li> but I used everyday twice a day</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I exercised at least 4 times a week between May 11 &amp; June 6.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that any company would target vulnerable women who are unsatisfied with their body.</li>
            <li> too bad is not permanent.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t continue to use :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Horrible product, wouldn&#x27;t recommand it!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Tried it, saw minimal results, but that could all just be mental. IF you actually want to plump your booty up a bit, I recommend finding a program that works for you and STICKING TO IT.  This gimmicky stuff just doesn&#x27;t fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Found a deal on some good programs here -  www.buttgoals.com - if anybody is interested.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical of the cream. It has a very strong minty smell and tingled a little when I put it on. I used it about 2-3 times a day depending on how many showers I took. I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s made my bottom a little more jiggly, but didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; like advertised or I just haven&#x27;t used it long enough for it to plump. However, I did not work out at all to see if it actually worked. I&#x27;m debating on ordering another jar</li>
            <li> First time trying this product and I loved my results!! Also the price is right for this jar size!!</li>
            <li> I just posted this because I didn&#x27;t think it was fair to give 1star and your review says you didn&#x27;t purchase it!!! That&#x27;s not cool</li>
            <li> Hello, I have been using Pureleef since April 16, 2015. I apply the cream twice a day religiously lol! I did not exercise between April 16 &amp; May 11. I exercised at least 4 times a week between May 11 &amp; June 6. I am still on my first jar &amp; today is June 19. I definitely need another jar &amp; i will be happy to get two more based on my progress, I know I really like the product! I think my results are realistic, I also think the product works best with exercise! I wish this company the best!</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks i saw a dramatic difference&lt;br /&gt;it plumped up my butt giving it a better shape and my bony hips are no longer bony ^-^</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a single helpful testimonial about this product since I&#x27;ve researched it. Not here. Not Instagram. Not the official website, Google or even YouTube. You would think since its seemed to have launched in early 2015, there&#x27;d be a few TRUTHFUL, HELPFUL reviews, but there aren&#x27;t &amp; I won&#x27;t buy until I see a few - **ALSO** it&#x27;s reported you won&#x27;t see any results until about 2 months (2 jars) - all you April buyers - BE PATIENT - THEN review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.  I thought it would work but I saw no results. I wish they had a money back guarantee but its fine. I&#x27;m taking a loss on money.</li>
            <li> I love this! just a couple weeks and already noticing a difference :) can&#x27;t wait to order again. picture on the left is 4.13.15 and 5.1.15 on the right . you can see how I&#x27;ve filled out the shorts :) gonna start pairing with squats and see what happens!</li>
            <li> This works for me. Am curvy but i want more inches. Am 28 waist and 40 hips. Been using this for a month now and not even twice a day cus i forget sometimes and now am 41 hips. Like it really worked fast for me cus i have some fat down dat hips. I dont really think Butt cream work for veryskinny people, its not a miracle cream i never even beleived that a cream would make ur butt bigger, just wanted to give it a try, well worth the money. Am gonna keep using this and buy more to see if am gonna add few inches more.well stuff like this doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but m happy it worked for me yay</li>
            <li> I will be ordering another jar as I am happy with the results so far. One jar lasted almost two months for me. The first month I used the cream in conjunction with squats the second month I did not do any squats. I like the smell of the product and the tingling sensation lol. I&#x27;ll also be trying the breast cream. I figured why not, the butt and hip cream works matters well...</li>
            <li> PureLeef body plumping cream is working wonders on my butt and my hips. In fact I had no hips to begin with. I work out daily (squats) so that&#x27;s just a plus!!! I&#x27;m very happy with the results I am getting &amp; I love the fact that it&#x27;s a hormonal free product. I recommend this product to anyone wishing to enhance their buttocks &amp; hips.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product well over a month and I don&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. I will continue to purchase it. It takes a few months before u see results but it worked and has made my butt and hips slightly bigger, smoother. I do not even work out, I&#x27;m sure if I did the results would be greater. Overall I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff just purchased ready to see the results</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as most would be but if your dedicated to this cream, you will see results and so far I&#x27;m loving mine! I noticed results after 1 month of using twice as day as directed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks now and I am definitely seeing results.. I use it morning and before bed along with squatting and leg weight training. Not only have I noticed plumping in my butt, I have also notice my stretch marks fading you must be consistent. It smells like bengay but it&#x27;s tolerable.</li>
            <li> Just used for first time last night and woke up with these weird purple bumps all over my butt. Guess I&#x27;m allergic or is that suppose to happen? It&#x27;s not itchy.  Won&#x27;t continue to use :(</li>
            <li> Good product!  I have had this cream for a few weeks now,  the thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting is that my butt looks smoother.  My butt looks rounder at the bottom however I will update again once I am done with my jar</li>
            <li> it worked for me..I love it..also add squats</li>
            <li> I definitely saw an improvement. I have used 1 jar so far. I used it twice a day consistently in the beginning. I kind of slacked off towards the end so my jar lasted about 2 months. I am ordering my next jar and this time I will pair using this with workouts. Update after jar #2 coming soon.</li>
            <li> This works wonders i&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and i see a huge difference like i see my hips getting wider. can&#x27;t wait to use it a little bit longer and  see results.</li>
            <li> Tried this product and felt a sensation right away. My husband asked me if I was wearing a butt pad. I will keep using.</li>
            <li> Noticing a good change!</li>
            <li> Been using this since the 19th of May and no results yet so can&#x27;t really give a bad or good review. It says you&#x27;ll see results within 2 months so I&#x27;ll keep you guys posted.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for almost 3 weeks now and my results are amazing. I apply cream twice a day morning and evening you have to be consistent.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all! None of my questions were answered! Horrible product, wouldn&#x27;t recommand it!</li>
            <li> I must say it has been working for me..I will be ordering more for sure!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this in May! I have seen results. I rubbed this cream on my butt, hips and thigh area and I can now see a slight indention in my thigh where my upper thigh is getting more plump than the lower thigh where I did not rub the cream!! So make sure you spread the cream over your entire thigh area is this is your target concern area! Will be ordering another jar asap!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works!! If you are consistent initially and wein off to once a day with moderate exercise, you (and others haha) see/feel (smooth/softness) results! Will be buying my second bottle soon ! My first bottle has lasted me since about mid april.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: Whenever I worked out intensely, my butt would be the first to go. So I&#x27;m glad I can keep my shape now.</li>
            <li> Love ..love..love this product it really lives up to its expectations. I am  on my third jar. And loving it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. You definitely have to keep using it to see results but I used everyday twice a day and I became very plump back there lol</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any change and I am almost finish with my jar.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome gave my butt a round plump shape takes a while to finally work but I love it üòç</li>
            <li> It was ok... too bad is not permanent. .. you definitely see a difference  when you work out... do squads and lounges</li>
            <li> Had it almost a month really haven&#x27;t seen any major difference</li>
            <li> Seriously? This is a scam. Nothing that you rub on your skin will awaken fat cells. It&#x27;s not how anatomy works. Ladies be okay with your tits and if you must have a booty then go work for it. Rubbing a cream on your butt isn&#x27;t going to create fat cells out of no where. Your glutes are a muscle work the muscle and learn how to scuplt your body with exercerise for real results.</li>
            <li> Works prefect! Seen a change right away !</li>
            <li> My cream just arrived today ! Very fast shipping, 5 stars. Put it on tonight, used like a quarter size and can feel a icy hot sensation.  I&#x27;m real and will give yall an update in 2 weeks. I will post pics as well. I bought this because I seen it on IG and draya was promoting it...lol...my IG welcome2nikkisworld ....Stay tuned......</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any results yet, but it&#x27;s only been 1 month....</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a couple of weeks and I must admit it has done what I expected it to do; maintain my butt. I am a curvy lady and every time I focus on working out, the first thing to go is my butt. So as I researched products, as I am not a fan of surgery, I ran across this new one and decided to try it out. IT WORKS! Now as I work out, I apply the cream nightly before bed. My own preference. So if you have a butt and want to enhance it, I highly recommend pureleef. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a butt but I mainly got this for my hips because I have narrow indented hips. &amp; this cream is amazing. I&#x27;m on my second jar, believe me I was super skeptical about this &amp; I didn&#x27;t see too many good reviews &amp; wasn&#x27;t sure if the good ones I did see were real people, but I took a leap &amp; I ordered &amp; my butt is plumper &amp; my hips have actually filled in a little. I also work out which made the results even better. I love this cream I will continue to order until I hit the maximum results. If anyone is wanting a more natural approach to enhancing your assets this is the way to go &amp; if anyone has any questions, doubts, or concerns email me at allenjada306@gmail.com! Pureleef is awesome!!</li>
            <li> Heard about this from a friend so I tried it. Not only did I want to have a bigger butt but I wanted my hips to spread as well.  It&#x27;s working in both areas.  My only negative is that it took 4 months to work but at least it&#x27;s working so I&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS STUFF!! If your worried about trying it... Try it! I swear in 3 weeks I&#x27;ve already noticed a plumper booty. Paired with squats about 3 times a week (nothing major) and still results!</li>
            <li> First of all I have not nor do I know anyone who has purchased this product.  Second I have posted questions which have been deleted so I figured I would comment and see if my comment gets deleted.  I asked how the cr√®me knows it&#x27;s being applied to your butt because some questions were asked if this product can be used on other body parts, in which the answer was &amp;#34;No.&amp;#34;  So how does the cr√®me know it&#x27;s being placed on the butt and only works on the butt?  I know there is a cr√®me for the breasts which I assume only works on the breasts.  Again, how does the cr√®me know where it is being applied?  Logic would say if the cr√®me makes your butt fatter and breasts fatter by stimulating fat cells, then the cr√®me would in fact stimulate fat cells no matter where it is applied.  I bet if they advertised their cr√®me makes men&#x27;s specific body parts bigger they would increase sales 10 fold!  It&#x27;s your money, spend it how you want to, but you may want to stop and smell the roses every once in a while....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff now for about 2 1/2 weeks and I&#x27;m seeing a difference in my butt &amp; my hips are spreading. I&#x27;ve been using it consistently twice a day along w/squats. It works!</li>
            <li> Works Well! Reordering again my booty is plumping &amp; rounding‚úîÔ∏èüëè</li>
            <li> It starts to feel good for the first hour or so but I haven&#x27;t seen what I expected so $50.00 I kind of wasted but lesson learned. I love you Draya but it wasn&#x27;t what it was cracked up to be.</li>
            <li> I love this product...it worked wonders on my butt..my next order I&#x27;m going to focus more on my hips...I wish I took a b4 &amp; after photo..but I see and feel the results. Just know it works,can&#x27;t wait for my second order which will be in a couple of days...</li>
            <li> It actually works. I have noticed results in about 3 weeks. No negative side effects and it has now been 2 months. Many people that know me very well have noticed before I had a chance to mention it. I have not done squats and I model swimwear. I dislike the mint sensation when you first put it on, but it does smell good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that any company would target vulnerable women who are unsatisfied with their body. An &amp;#34;ingredient&amp;#34; that you rub onto your skin will NOT &amp;#34;awaken&amp;#34; fat cells. I mean, how silly does this sound? Fat cells don&#x27;t sleep. You either have body fat, or you don&#x27;t. You are genetically predisposed to where you carry the most of your bodyfat &amp; where it will be the first to go. Many women complain about &amp;#34;losing their butt&amp;#34; when starting out a new workout plan. This is simply because you are not eating enough calories &amp; doing too much cardio, not enough weight training. Shame on this company.</li>
            <li> I bought the product and have been using it for three weeks. I&#x27;ve used it as directed as well as, have been in the gym doing leg/butt exercises. After 3 weeks, there haven&#x27;t been any results. My skin tingles at the area of application but there isn&#x27;t any plumping as stated. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Starting seeing a difference after only 2 1/2 weeks</li>
            <li> Great product.  My girl has seem results in a matter of weeks and she loves it. The odor is kinda strong</li>
