            <li> I love this product and would remedy it</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the thermoslim.&lt;br /&gt;I think by itself it will take longer for results. But when i started working out, eating right, and using this 2x a day with the thermoslim; the product does smooth out skin and reduce cellulite.</li>
            <li> So far I have been using this treatment for about a month now.  The smell is pleasant.  The menthol tingling feelings make it feel like it&#x27;s doing something.  I have yet to see drastic results but only time will tell as I continue to finish off the tube.  I use it in conjunction with a cellulite roller.</li>
            <li> I love it!! The shipping was fast. And the smell of this product is nice, and it works great on me. Cannot wait to wear my swimming suit this next summer!</li>
