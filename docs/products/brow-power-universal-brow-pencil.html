            <li>This pencil does the trick and more!  </li>
            <li>I love the brush at the end for blending and perfecting the look!</li>
            <li>The first one I bought was perfect, a 5 star product.  </li>
            <li>Try it - I think you will love it!</li>
            <li>This is my first brow pencil and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>When you first start using it, you just have to work with it and learn what works best for you.</li>
            <li>It can be wiped off rather easily and it would be great if the point was refillable.</li>
            <li>I thought I might need to practice to get nice looking brows, but the first time I used this, I was impressed; no practice needed.</li>
            <li>I learned that certain hair colors look best with my complexion and no longer experiment.</li>
            <li>This brow pencil is amazing.</li>
            <li>What an amazing eyebrow pencil could not do without it.  </li>
            <li>This pencil is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used everything from pencils to powders to get my brows to show up and look nice, but nothing ever worked as well as this pencil.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best brow pencil ever</li>
            <li>WHEN THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS I SEARCHED AND TRIED AND FOUND NOTHING I LIKED</li>
            <li>I got a deluxe sample size of this from my Ipsy bag a couple months ago</li>
            <li>Clinique has a nice color too, but it doesn&#x27;t have the brush and it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as this.  </li>
            <li>It also works perfectly for my sister&#x27;s much lighter eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the Brow Power Brow Pencil.</li>
            <li>this is great product and I am so glad I am able to replace the sample one I had.</li>
            <li>Will never use another kind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many good ones from Tart, Billion Doller Brow, and Anastasia Dip Brow Pomade.</li>
            <li>The pencil went on darker than I thought, which I liked.</li>
            <li>I love love love this pencil!!</li>
            <li>I love love love this brow pencil!!</li>
            <li>Very natural- looking and perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li>I never colored my brows before using this, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but a very easy to use brow color.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use and how it perfectly matched my brow color.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect to make natural looking Eybrows.</li>
            <li>I love this handy pencil.</li>
            <li>I COMPLETELY agree with all of the wonderful reviews about how well this product works.  </li>
            <li>Best brush and color by far</li>
            <li>The price was right this time and the pencil works great.</li>
            <li>If you liked the original you will not want tbis!</li>
            <li>I got this eyebrow pencil free as a part of the :\Look Good, Feel Better program for women with cancer.</li>
            <li>Great product matches my brows exactly.</li>
            <li>The pencil is very, very light</li>
            <li>have tatooed eyebrows, so have a great shape to begin with, but am 70 and getting a load of grey hairs, this pencil is great.  </li>
            <li>Love this pencil.</li>
            <li>Love that this pencil works for just about everyone.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this eyebrow pencil, I wont use anything else.</li>
            <li>It does cost more for one than I used to pay for two, but it works, so I will pay the price.</li>
            <li>Most of them got the job done but none of them every matched the color of my brows well.</li>
            <li>$22 is a bit much but totally worth it to me because it matches perfectly!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT,</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now an &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34; in my eyes! :)</li>
            <li>Most eyebrows just wiped off or sweated off my face.</li>
            <li>have bought this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>it is my favorite eyebrow product.  </li>
            <li>I have used many brow powders and they work</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I hope they never stop making this brow pencil because I have finally found the perfect solution to my sparse brows.</li>
            <li>and so I bought one for $18 on eBay 2 weeks after using the sample size because I just fell in LOVE.</li>
            <li>but I mostly just fill and shape the outer halves of my brows.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the product, no irritation, washes off w/o problem.</li>
            <li>I cannot say how much I love this pencil.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, but from Ulta, so I could try it on before buying, I love this pencil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this is definitely the best one.  </li>
            <li>This pencil is the opposite, it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li>Using like strokes give you a lighter effect &amp; surprise the more you apply, the darker it&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li>I have been through many brown pencils for my medium brown eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Many of the eyebrow pencils I have used have had hints of red in them, but this brow pencil is the perfect brown.</li>
            <li>This eyebrow pencil is okay but has a tendency to be smudgy as the day wears on.</li>
            <li>This has happened with more than one of the pencils I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product and fell in love.</li>
            <li>love it :)</li>
            <li>Love this item.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this brow pencil.</li>
            <li>However this pencil is so much better than the Anastasia product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>was quite satisfied with my brows after just using the Brow Power pencil.</li>
            <li>However, incorporating the Brow Power pencil into my regular routine (brow wax, pencil, brow powder, spoolie brush) gave me the best brows ever.</li>
            <li>My brows have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>I know that is a lot for an eyebrow pencil, but it seems like it could hold a lot more.  </li>
            <li>It is just OK, i thought it would glide on better.</li>
            <li>and why so many love it.</li>
            <li>I am sure the one thing to do is avoid turning the pencil until there is a need to...</li>
            <li>My favorite...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try more Of It Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Love this pencil.</li>
            <li>but I keep coming back for the perfectly neutral color.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, and nothing compares or is better.</li>
            <li>I received this and ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>, I just wanted a more defined look.</li>
            <li>The best of these is the Dip Brow, but even that took too long to apply and wasn&#x27;t as waterproof as I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>Loved the first one and had to get another one.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be a great way to make my eyebrows look more natural</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyebrow pen, it goes on easily and the color can be manipulated through application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply, does not look cakey, blends beautifully, looks natural and is the PERFECT shade (no red undertones whatsoever).  </li>
            <li>Excellent product--no regrets.</li>
            <li>works wonders on brows of all colors fills in exrends looks natural great product</li>
            <li>Practice makes perfect and I wasn&#x27;t sure about this pen based on reviews stating it was too dark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had full eyebrows for many years and have tried many products.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR GOOD COLOR (TAUPE) AND REAL EASE AND ACCURACY OF USE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve practically tried everything out there and this brow pencil has certainly given me the best results by far.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Just be careful with that and enjoy having perfect eyebrows!</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and stays put.</li>
            <li>This pencil is an easy way to fill in sparse brows.  </li>
            <li>You can easily adjust the shade by the amount that you apply so</li>
            <li>Yet it&#x27;s easy to wash off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The color is fine, but we could have gotten one cheaper that works just as well.</li>
            <li>I love this because it makes it a bit easier to make quick brow strokes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my wonderful little helper</li>
            <li>Fill in your brows, then flip the pencil around and use the brush end to polish and smooth them.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t on me when I got out in the light.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it define my brows and give them great shape--I am seeing them growing in.  </li>
            <li>I use a few brush strokes of stronger color to enhance the shaping and get wonderful compliments on my eyes--more so than ever!  </li>
            <li>its amazing even just the slightest coloring makes your whole face enhanced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another tip i found out is that this works great to enhance any facial beauty marks you may have.</li>
            <li>The universal color is great.  </li>
            <li>Brows look fabulous.</li>
            <li>So, a light touch is truly light...feather touch.</li>
            <li>This pencil is fantastic for &amp;#34;drawing&amp;#34; towards your nose and extending outward.  </li>
            <li>It is still a touch darker for me than I would like, no matter how light I apply</li>
            <li>I lightly use the spooly brush again to soften the color and blend it into my brows.  </li>
            <li>I have sparse and light eyebrows</li>
            <li>I cannot go anywhere without filling them in, so its safe to say that ive gone through my fair share of different brow pencils and powders.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li>- I changed my mind about the original 5 star review.  </li>
            <li>No more looking for the perfect brow pencil/powder for me!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The shade partially adjusts to every hair color and gives a beautiful, natural-looking brow.</li>
            <li>I love the spooly brush on the end, and I first use that before application of the pencil.  </li>
            <li>Use a lighter hand for a more natural brow or use more pressure if you want a darker brow.</li>
            <li>It stays on for a good long time and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>All of the powders I have are dark even if they say for blondes but this really blends perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The color is great and can be applied darker if you press harder.  </li>
            <li>IT IS EVERY BIG AS GOOD</li>
            <li>it really makes me look better.</li>
            <li>The Brow Power closely matches my hair color that is a cool brown.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the only thing I spend a lot of money on because it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li>I just learned that QVC sells this as a trio (so you get 3 brow pencils and full size) every April and August for $42</li>
            <li>Although the product is good and does blend well, there isn&#x27;t enough of it, for the price that is paid.</li>
            <li>Looked good, but the mechanism in the pencil broke &amp; there is still a lot of the lead left that I cannot use.  </li>
            <li>A full brow-lift instruction diagram is included with each pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural looking, easy to apply and makes my brows look better than they have in years.</li>
            <li>It lasts forever, is a color that is never fake looking, and is easy to use...</li>
            <li>Great value, lasts all day, and is very easy to adjust the color to your liking just by applying with less or more pressure which leaves less or more product on your brows.  </li>
            <li>Since then, I have tried other products and have not been happy.</li>
            <li>That said, I also change my hair color with the seasons (more strawberry blonde in summer, more auburn in the winter)</li>
            <li>This is quick and lasts.</li>
            <li>The seller&#x27;s performance was great--received quickly.</li>
            <li>I carry it in my purse all the time for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and natural looking.</li>
            <li>I can apply it as light or dark as I want and the brush really helps blend it well so that my brows appear more &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  Since I&#x27;m in my 60s now, my brows are VERY light and sparse, so this fills in well without looking like they were drawn in with a crayon, like so many others do.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I liked was they showed you how to draw the brow (looks very natural)</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my It Cosmetics Brow Power Universal Eyebrow Pencil.  </li>
            <li>I have light eyebrows and this works pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>However, I also use this pencil on its own and my eyebrows look better than they ever have using any other product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product and can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li>I shop for cool browns without the warm, red tones.</li>
            <li>The second purchase, a \\&quot;Sorme True Taupe\\&quot; brow pencil is definitely a warm reddish brown, non-waterproof pencil.  </li>
            <li>Love this .looks very natural.</li>
            <li>my husband who does not even understand if i am wearing lipstick or not, never fails to see the difference whenever i apply this !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a brunette, but my blonde friends love it, too!</li>
            <li>The first one lasted almost a year!</li>
            <li>It works perfectly, lasts all day and since you&#x27;re only using it once a day, the pencil itself lasts a VERY long time.  </li>
            <li>I dont twist the pencil up too much as im worried it might snap, I also make quick and light strokes as to not snap the pencil as well.</li>
            <li>It has such great control and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>The spoolie seems really durable &amp; doesn&#x27;t bend or feel cheap like some.</li>
            <li>Use the brush before and after you pencil; this makes it look even more natural.  </li>
            <li>brow routine consists of coloring in my brows with this pencil then using Benefit Gimme Brow (linked below) in medium brown to brush my eyebrows up and make my eyebrows look even more natural.</li>
            <li>I think people who use this type of product are looking for something with a more natural look.</li>
            <li>The most natural looking eyebrow pencil I have.</li>
            <li>Most eyebrow pencil does not draw natural.  </li>
            <li>In all honesty I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>When I saw how this worked, I thought I could make my brows look more natural.  </li>
            <li>The Color is just right.</li>
            <li>My brows look natural and expressive-- all day long</li>
            <li>Love this product, it works very well and looks natural.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a eyebrow pencil that is easy to use and looks natural.</li>
            <li>It also starts out light and gets darker the more you put on or the harder you swipe.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent brow pencil but very hard to find!</li>
            <li>In the heat it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long, but still by far the best thing I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>however, I&#x27;m gray to very light blonde</li>
            <li>Some over-tweezing has grown back and what hasn&#x27;t gets remedied:)</li>
            <li>and then I was amazed at how the pencil matches the color of your brow exactly.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time using a brow pencil.</li>
            <li>formula keeps my unruly brows in shape all day &amp; I haven&#x27;t noticed any smudging, even during this hot summer.</li>
            <li>However, I bought two more and the pencil immediately fell out of both pencils the second I opened the box.  </li>
            <li>Needed to fill in brows and tried many different types of products.</li>
            <li>The first time it happened, I considered it an accident.  </li>
            <li>I love how universal the shade is</li>
            <li>This did not work the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>As a finishing touch, I  lightly brush through brows with the spooly brush for a natural, polished look.</li>
            <li>Purchased this first time from a shopping network.</li>
            <li>Whether my hair is highlighted blonde or is its natural, light brown, this remains my favorite brow filler of all time.</li>
            <li>ok, but you can do the same thing with any brow pencil and a lash brush</li>
            <li>This one kept on most of the day and the color is much more natural than some of the other browns I tried.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair - and it matches perfectly without being really dark.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much that when my brows grew back in, I came back to pay for another one.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine the first time but the second time I could not get the liner to come out</li>
            <li>The taupe color easily matches several shades depending on how the user applies​.</li>
            <li>Goes on so easy and is simple to layer for a darker color.  </li>
            <li>And it really does last and doesn&#x27;t come off easily.</li>
            <li>So, that leaves me in the same tough spot with the rest of you who find yourself researching on the best product to frame your faces with.  </li>
            <li>I had many other brow pencil simiilar to this, but this the first time it happend to me considering the pencil is pretty new.</li>
            <li>Having the brush on the end is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>AS MUCH.  </li>
            <li>If I had paid for it myself, I might not like it as much.  </li>
            <li>I have very sparse eyebrows</li>
            <li>idk maybe they really draw on their brows</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for anyone considering getting their eyebrows tattooed!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>But it really is how you apply it.</li>
            <li>Now I am naturally gray, but choose to be medium golden brown.</li>
            <li>I have really messed up brows.</li>
            <li>I do not wear much make up, but I use this every day.</li>
            <li>The stick is thicker than regular brow pencils and applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>This brow pencil really works.  </li>
            <li>This product really does what is promised.</li>
            <li>It goes on well, stays on and looks like real eye brows.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Smudging the pencil lines with the brush is so real looking</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>my mom is a redhead and complete different hair and skintone than me and her eyebrows are almost nonexistent as most redheads have blondish brows and lashes.</li>
            <li>After a few seconds, the waxy consistency of the pencil seems to \\&quot;set,\\&quot; providing a way to keep my brows looking neat and tidy.  </li>
            <li>Love how easy this is to use, how it blends with my natural color, and how long lasting it is.  </li>
            <li>But I do like that the pencil does give you a more subtle fill-in, and from using this product, I&#x27;ve realized how important it is to fill in your brows -</li>
            <li>my brows look pretty and natural, even in sunlight!</li>
            <li>Another issue, which I don&#x27;t know if it is due to the product itself or an allergy from using it, but as I&#x27;m putting it on it pulls out my eyebrows; to elaborate, as I stroke color onto my brow</li>
            <li>Pencil goes on dark unless you apply VERY lightly...</li>
            <li>i used before and it is the only thing that looks natural for me and is easy to use</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly &amp; when brushed looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use Sorme which is half the price and a better product.</li>
            <li>It has a slight ash tone to it, which is something I appreciate because how many browns are there out there that go reddish!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two main issues.</li>
            <li>The pencil i received is very waxy and a few precious eyebrow hairs have even been pulled out as I am applying it.</li>
            <li>Because it really looks very natural and matches any color.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this pencil to anyone, particularly those who have a difficulty time in finding a natural-looking color match.</li>
            <li>I have been using brow power for at least a year and love it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i make the ends come out a little farther where they are supposed to and fill them in just a bit more</li>
            <li>I really like this brow pencil because you can make it as light or as dark as you want.</li>
            <li>Press lightly for lighter brows, harder for darker ones.  </li>
            <li>it has a color to it that really does shade in completely natural.</li>
            <li>This IT cosmetics pencil draw natural in shape and color and it lasts for a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant as I  thought it abit pricey, but find the universal pencil is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>A little pricy but worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>The Brow Power pencil is great!&lt;br /&gt;It further darkened my dark brows very easily.</li>
            <li>The crayon is wide, waxy and is Nothing like original product.  </li>
            <li>AM A NEW CUSTOMER FOR THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>- I did that once with a brand new one and never found it.  </li>
            <li>What a disappointment to find the perfect brow pencil, and it either breaks (or just slips out of the swivel container since it doesn&#x27;t seem to actually be attached in any way to hold the product in place).  </li>
            <li>When this happened I lost a good portion of the brow pencil since it broke off, plus it made a mess to put the larger pieces of the brow pencil back in the dispenser.</li>
            <li>The color is very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve tried them all and more) hands down!!  </li>
            <li>It works on my dark brows with a heavier hand, as well as my daughter&#x27;s light brows with a lighter one.  </li>
            <li>This is almost the exact same pencil as the Models Prefer.  </li>
            <li>I found this at Ulta first and bought one in Amazon for back up.</li>
            <li>so natural !</li>
            <li>I like that since some pencils can be way too dark even with a light hand.  </li>
            <li>Stays on all day and looks natural!</li>
            <li>You can make the color as dark or as light as you want.</li>
            <li>I then lightly fill in my brows with short strokes, following the direction of natural hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I can go as light or dark as I want with my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>You must apply with light strokes for a natural looking brow and I like the brush which is on the other end of the pencil to finish.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that, even though it&#x27;s not cheap, one pencil does last several months.  </li>
            <li>The brow pencil fell after the first use, I was able to put it back in without breaking it and it did twist up and down, but then fell out again upon the second use.  </li>
            <li>and I was just unlucky this time--or whether to give up on the product since it&#x27;s a lot of trouble to return products (even as easy as Amazon makes it for us).  </li>
            <li>so I cleansed by brows with a mild astringent and tried again and carefully drew my line by tilting the pen at a 90 degree angle.</li>
            <li>brows are not bad by themselves or should i say were since this lady messed them all up...but that extra touch even makes a big difference.</li>
            <li>You have to learn to use a light hand or you will have very dark eyebrows</li>
            <li>I am a Blonde, so I go gently with the coloring and like the natural results.</li>
            <li>Color also blends in with my natural brows.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking before; thinking the color looked natural.  </li>
            <li>Looks completely natural.[[ASIN:B003VPTA2U</li>
            <li>Nothing works to make your filled-in eyebrows look as natural as this pencil.  </li>
            <li>Adds natural looking hair where yours might not exist.  </li>
            <li>When I was young</li>
            <li>The caps don&#x27;t fit snuggly and constantly fall off; second, the actual brow stick when the cap came off</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to like this product after initially seeing it on QVC</li>
            <li>The brush actually removes to much of the product.</li>
            <li>and it just looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I ordered another one before my old one was used up -</li>
            <li>Looks natural, stays on, doesn&#x27;t smudge, etc.  </li>
            <li>Although it is a stick, it looks like a powder on--thus the natural thing it has going</li>
            <li>Not harsh.</li>
            <li>The spooly end brush gives a natural, polished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But then again, I don&#x27;t think that can be helped since my face develops natural oils through out the day and</li>
            <li>I struggled and struggled with eyebrow pencils over the years, trying to find a color that did not look absurd on my fair, freckled face.  </li>
            <li>The oval-shaped tip is perfect for both thin and thick brows.</li>
            <li>Fell out right away never really got to try it</li>
            <li>This brow pencil was reccommended to me by a friend and when i sadly shelled out $22 for it, i was pretty pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Broke after first use, also I think it&#x27;s old, because it&#x27;s much harder, than the one I purchased in a store.</li>
            <li>This is my only high end makeup product...</li>
            <li>Yeah - it&#x27;s cool that the color matches pretty much every hair color depending on how thick you apply it, but  other than that</li>
            <li>If you have super blonde brows or black brows, this MAY not work for you as it may be too light for black brows and too dark for super blonde brows.</li>
            <li>(I was able to slip it back inside, but I make sure all the product is twisted down before I apply the cap now).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all and either within a few hours or by the end of the day it was always obvious that I had filled them in.</li>
            <li>The pencil I was using before made my brows look okay as long as I was in the house, but when I went outside and looked at my eyebrows in the sun they always looked a little orangey</li>
            <li>This looks very natural and I look years younger.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and really looks natural.</li>
            <li>This pencil is super thin which allows me to gradually fill in with wispy strokes exactly where I need it.</li>
            <li>So I was looking for a similar product that performed like the old Models Prefer version.  </li>
            <li>I have overplucked brows and blonde hair and this blends naturally.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about the &#x27;universal&#x27; color, but I have to say it absolutely works for a brunette with fair skin and black brows.</li>
            <li>Not only are they super light in contrast to my dark hair, but thin and patchy especially after pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>Depending on how dark you want your brows depends on how much you want to press and build the color up.</li>
            <li>In general, we apply the same pressure to our eyes as we do to the skin on the rest of our face.</li>
            <li>I barely have any eyebrows and this helps immensely!!</li>
            <li>and this seems to keep it looking soft until long after I&#x27;ve made it home from work.</li>
            <li>I use it as a light base to shape/apply growth ingredients, then my favorite brown pencil last...</li>
            <li>I was able to retrieve it and put it back in the barrel, but i am not happy that it came apart, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I received this in a gift package, and was astounded at how much it was an improvement over my previous eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it everyday, so it certainly was not over-used.  </li>
            <li>I do like this eyebrow pencil, but I think it&#x27;s a little pricy for how much product it holds.  </li>
            <li>If your eyebrows have gone missing, this pencil will certainly help get them back.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I thought I might need to practice to get nice looking brows, but the first time I used this, I was impressed; no practice needed.</li>
            <li> I learned that certain hair colors look best with my complexion and no longer experiment.</li>
            <li> This brow pencil is amazing.</li>
            <li> What an amazing eyebrow pencil could not do without it.  </li>
            <li> This pencil is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything from pencils to powders to get my brows to show up and look nice, but nothing ever worked as well as this pencil.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best brow pencil ever</li>
            <li> WHEN THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS I SEARCHED AND TRIED AND FOUND NOTHING I LIKED</li>
            <li> I got a deluxe sample size of this from my Ipsy bag a couple months ago</li>
            <li> Clinique has a nice color too, but it doesn&#x27;t have the brush and it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as this.  </li>
            <li> It also works perfectly for my sister&#x27;s much lighter eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the Brow Power Brow Pencil.</li>
            <li> this is great product and I am so glad I am able to replace the sample one I had.</li>
            <li> Will never use another kind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many good ones from Tart, Billion Doller Brow, and Anastasia Dip Brow Pomade.</li>
            <li> The pencil went on darker than I thought, which I liked.</li>
            <li> I love love love this pencil!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this brow pencil!!</li>
            <li> Very natural- looking and perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> I never colored my brows before using this, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but a very easy to use brow color.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use and how it perfectly matched my brow color.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect to make natural looking Eybrows.</li>
            <li> I love this handy pencil.</li>
            <li> I COMPLETELY agree with all of the wonderful reviews about how well this product works.  </li>
            <li> Best brush and color by far</li>
            <li> The price was right this time and the pencil works great.</li>
            <li> If you liked the original you will not want tbis!</li>
            <li> I got this eyebrow pencil free as a part of the :\Look Good, Feel Better program for women with cancer.</li>
            <li> Great product matches my brows exactly.</li>
            <li> The pencil is very, very light</li>
            <li> have tatooed eyebrows, so have a great shape to begin with, but am 70 and getting a load of grey hairs, this pencil is great.  </li>
            <li> Love this pencil.</li>
            <li> Love that this pencil works for just about everyone.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyebrow pencil, I wont use anything else.</li>
            <li> It does cost more for one than I used to pay for two, but it works, so I will pay the price.</li>
            <li> Most of them got the job done but none of them every matched the color of my brows well.</li>
            <li> $22 is a bit much but totally worth it to me because it matches perfectly!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT,</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now an &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34; in my eyes! :)</li>
            <li> Most eyebrows just wiped off or sweated off my face.</li>
            <li> have bought this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> it is my favorite eyebrow product.  </li>
            <li> I have used many brow powders and they work</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I hope they never stop making this brow pencil because I have finally found the perfect solution to my sparse brows.</li>
            <li> and so I bought one for $18 on eBay 2 weeks after using the sample size because I just fell in LOVE.</li>
            <li> but I mostly just fill and shape the outer halves of my brows.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the product, no irritation, washes off w/o problem.</li>
            <li> I cannot say how much I love this pencil.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, but from Ulta, so I could try it on before buying, I love this pencil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this is definitely the best one.  </li>
            <li> This pencil is the opposite, it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li> Using like strokes give you a lighter effect &amp; surprise the more you apply, the darker it&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li> I have been through many brown pencils for my medium brown eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Many of the eyebrow pencils I have used have had hints of red in them, but this brow pencil is the perfect brown.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil is okay but has a tendency to be smudgy as the day wears on.</li>
            <li> This has happened with more than one of the pencils I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product and fell in love.</li>
            <li> love it :)</li>
            <li> Love this item.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this brow pencil.</li>
            <li> However this pencil is so much better than the Anastasia product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> was quite satisfied with my brows after just using the Brow Power pencil.</li>
            <li> However, incorporating the Brow Power pencil into my regular routine (brow wax, pencil, brow powder, spoolie brush) gave me the best brows ever.</li>
            <li> My brows have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li> I know that is a lot for an eyebrow pencil, but it seems like it could hold a lot more.  </li>
            <li> It is just OK, i thought it would glide on better.</li>
            <li> and why so many love it.</li>
            <li> I am sure the one thing to do is avoid turning the pencil until there is a need to...</li>
            <li> My favorite...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try more Of It Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Love this pencil.</li>
            <li> but I keep coming back for the perfectly neutral color.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, and nothing compares or is better.</li>
            <li> I received this and ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> , I just wanted a more defined look.</li>
            <li> The best of these is the Dip Brow, but even that took too long to apply and wasn&#x27;t as waterproof as I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li> Loved the first one and had to get another one.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be a great way to make my eyebrows look more natural</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyebrow pen, it goes on easily and the color can be manipulated through application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to apply, does not look cakey, blends beautifully, looks natural and is the PERFECT shade (no red undertones whatsoever).  </li>
            <li> Excellent product--no regrets.</li>
            <li> works wonders on brows of all colors fills in exrends looks natural great product</li>
            <li> Practice makes perfect and I wasn&#x27;t sure about this pen based on reviews stating it was too dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had full eyebrows for many years and have tried many products.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR GOOD COLOR (TAUPE) AND REAL EASE AND ACCURACY OF USE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve practically tried everything out there and this brow pencil has certainly given me the best results by far.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with that and enjoy having perfect eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and stays put.</li>
            <li> This pencil is an easy way to fill in sparse brows.  </li>
            <li> You can easily adjust the shade by the amount that you apply so</li>
            <li> Yet it&#x27;s easy to wash off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The color is fine, but we could have gotten one cheaper that works just as well.</li>
            <li> I love this because it makes it a bit easier to make quick brow strokes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my wonderful little helper</li>
            <li> Fill in your brows, then flip the pencil around and use the brush end to polish and smooth them.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t on me when I got out in the light.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it define my brows and give them great shape--I am seeing them growing in.  </li>
            <li> I use a few brush strokes of stronger color to enhance the shaping and get wonderful compliments on my eyes--more so than ever!  </li>
            <li> its amazing even just the slightest coloring makes your whole face enhanced.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another tip i found out is that this works great to enhance any facial beauty marks you may have.</li>
            <li> The universal color is great.  </li>
            <li> Brows look fabulous.</li>
            <li> So, a light touch is truly light...feather touch.</li>
            <li> This pencil is fantastic for &amp;#34;drawing&amp;#34; towards your nose and extending outward.  </li>
            <li> It is still a touch darker for me than I would like, no matter how light I apply</li>
            <li> I lightly use the spooly brush again to soften the color and blend it into my brows.  </li>
            <li> I have sparse and light eyebrows</li>
            <li> I cannot go anywhere without filling them in, so its safe to say that ive gone through my fair share of different brow pencils and powders.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li> - I changed my mind about the original 5 star review.  </li>
            <li> No more looking for the perfect brow pencil/powder for me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The shade partially adjusts to every hair color and gives a beautiful, natural-looking brow.</li>
            <li> I love the spooly brush on the end, and I first use that before application of the pencil.  </li>
            <li> Use a lighter hand for a more natural brow or use more pressure if you want a darker brow.</li>
            <li> It stays on for a good long time and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> All of the powders I have are dark even if they say for blondes but this really blends perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The color is great and can be applied darker if you press harder.  </li>
            <li> IT IS EVERY BIG AS GOOD</li>
            <li> it really makes me look better.</li>
            <li> The Brow Power closely matches my hair color that is a cool brown.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only thing I spend a lot of money on because it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li> I just learned that QVC sells this as a trio (so you get 3 brow pencils and full size) every April and August for $42</li>
            <li> Although the product is good and does blend well, there isn&#x27;t enough of it, for the price that is paid.</li>
            <li> Looked good, but the mechanism in the pencil broke &amp; there is still a lot of the lead left that I cannot use.  </li>
            <li> A full brow-lift instruction diagram is included with each pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural looking, easy to apply and makes my brows look better than they have in years.</li>
            <li> It lasts forever, is a color that is never fake looking, and is easy to use...</li>
            <li> Great value, lasts all day, and is very easy to adjust the color to your liking just by applying with less or more pressure which leaves less or more product on your brows.  </li>
            <li> Since then, I have tried other products and have not been happy.</li>
            <li> That said, I also change my hair color with the seasons (more strawberry blonde in summer, more auburn in the winter)</li>
            <li> This is quick and lasts.</li>
            <li> The seller&#x27;s performance was great--received quickly.</li>
            <li> I carry it in my purse all the time for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I can apply it as light or dark as I want and the brush really helps blend it well so that my brows appear more &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  Since I&#x27;m in my 60s now, my brows are VERY light and sparse, so this fills in well without looking like they were drawn in with a crayon, like so many others do.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I liked was they showed you how to draw the brow (looks very natural)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my It Cosmetics Brow Power Universal Eyebrow Pencil.  </li>
            <li> I have light eyebrows and this works pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> However, I also use this pencil on its own and my eyebrows look better than they ever have using any other product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product and can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li> I shop for cool browns without the warm, red tones.</li>
            <li> The second purchase, a \\&quot;Sorme True Taupe\\&quot; brow pencil is definitely a warm reddish brown, non-waterproof pencil.  </li>
            <li> Love this .looks very natural.</li>
            <li> my husband who does not even understand if i am wearing lipstick or not, never fails to see the difference whenever i apply this !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a brunette, but my blonde friends love it, too!</li>
            <li> The first one lasted almost a year!</li>
            <li> It works perfectly, lasts all day and since you&#x27;re only using it once a day, the pencil itself lasts a VERY long time.  </li>
            <li> I dont twist the pencil up too much as im worried it might snap, I also make quick and light strokes as to not snap the pencil as well.</li>
            <li> It has such great control and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> The spoolie seems really durable &amp; doesn&#x27;t bend or feel cheap like some.</li>
            <li> Use the brush before and after you pencil; this makes it look even more natural.  </li>
            <li> brow routine consists of coloring in my brows with this pencil then using Benefit Gimme Brow (linked below) in medium brown to brush my eyebrows up and make my eyebrows look even more natural.</li>
            <li> I think people who use this type of product are looking for something with a more natural look.</li>
            <li> The most natural looking eyebrow pencil I have.</li>
            <li> Most eyebrow pencil does not draw natural.  </li>
            <li> In all honesty I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> When I saw how this worked, I thought I could make my brows look more natural.  </li>
            <li> The Color is just right.</li>
            <li> My brows look natural and expressive-- all day long</li>
            <li> Love this product, it works very well and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a eyebrow pencil that is easy to use and looks natural.</li>
            <li> It also starts out light and gets darker the more you put on or the harder you swipe.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brow pencil but very hard to find!</li>
            <li> In the heat it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long, but still by far the best thing I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> however, I&#x27;m gray to very light blonde</li>
            <li> Some over-tweezing has grown back and what hasn&#x27;t gets remedied:)</li>
            <li> and then I was amazed at how the pencil matches the color of your brow exactly.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time using a brow pencil.</li>
            <li> formula keeps my unruly brows in shape all day &amp; I haven&#x27;t noticed any smudging, even during this hot summer.</li>
            <li> However, I bought two more and the pencil immediately fell out of both pencils the second I opened the box.  </li>
            <li> Needed to fill in brows and tried many different types of products.</li>
            <li> The first time it happened, I considered it an accident.  </li>
            <li> I love how universal the shade is</li>
            <li> This did not work the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> As a finishing touch, I  lightly brush through brows with the spooly brush for a natural, polished look.</li>
            <li> Purchased this first time from a shopping network.</li>
            <li> Whether my hair is highlighted blonde or is its natural, light brown, this remains my favorite brow filler of all time.</li>
            <li> ok, but you can do the same thing with any brow pencil and a lash brush</li>
            <li> This one kept on most of the day and the color is much more natural than some of the other browns I tried.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair - and it matches perfectly without being really dark.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much that when my brows grew back in, I came back to pay for another one.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine the first time but the second time I could not get the liner to come out</li>
            <li> The taupe color easily matches several shades depending on how the user applies​.</li>
            <li> Goes on so easy and is simple to layer for a darker color.  </li>
            <li> And it really does last and doesn&#x27;t come off easily.</li>
            <li> So, that leaves me in the same tough spot with the rest of you who find yourself researching on the best product to frame your faces with.  </li>
            <li> I had many other brow pencil simiilar to this, but this the first time it happend to me considering the pencil is pretty new.</li>
            <li> Having the brush on the end is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> AS MUCH.  </li>
            <li> If I had paid for it myself, I might not like it as much.  </li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyebrows</li>
            <li> idk maybe they really draw on their brows</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for anyone considering getting their eyebrows tattooed!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> But it really is how you apply it.</li>
            <li> Now I am naturally gray, but choose to be medium golden brown.</li>
            <li> I have really messed up brows.</li>
            <li> I do not wear much make up, but I use this every day.</li>
            <li> The stick is thicker than regular brow pencils and applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> This brow pencil really works.  </li>
            <li> This product really does what is promised.</li>
            <li> It goes on well, stays on and looks like real eye brows.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> Smudging the pencil lines with the brush is so real looking</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> my mom is a redhead and complete different hair and skintone than me and her eyebrows are almost nonexistent as most redheads have blondish brows and lashes.</li>
            <li> After a few seconds, the waxy consistency of the pencil seems to \\&quot;set,\\&quot; providing a way to keep my brows looking neat and tidy.  </li>
            <li> Love how easy this is to use, how it blends with my natural color, and how long lasting it is.  </li>
            <li> But I do like that the pencil does give you a more subtle fill-in, and from using this product, I&#x27;ve realized how important it is to fill in your brows -</li>
            <li> my brows look pretty and natural, even in sunlight!</li>
            <li> Another issue, which I don&#x27;t know if it is due to the product itself or an allergy from using it, but as I&#x27;m putting it on it pulls out my eyebrows; to elaborate, as I stroke color onto my brow</li>
            <li> Pencil goes on dark unless you apply VERY lightly...</li>
            <li> i used before and it is the only thing that looks natural for me and is easy to use</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly &amp; when brushed looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use Sorme which is half the price and a better product.</li>
            <li> It has a slight ash tone to it, which is something I appreciate because how many browns are there out there that go reddish!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two main issues.</li>
            <li> The pencil i received is very waxy and a few precious eyebrow hairs have even been pulled out as I am applying it.</li>
            <li> Because it really looks very natural and matches any color.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this pencil to anyone, particularly those who have a difficulty time in finding a natural-looking color match.</li>
            <li> I have been using brow power for at least a year and love it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i make the ends come out a little farther where they are supposed to and fill them in just a bit more</li>
            <li> I really like this brow pencil because you can make it as light or as dark as you want.</li>
            <li> Press lightly for lighter brows, harder for darker ones.  </li>
            <li> it has a color to it that really does shade in completely natural.</li>
            <li> This IT cosmetics pencil draw natural in shape and color and it lasts for a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant as I  thought it abit pricey, but find the universal pencil is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> A little pricy but worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> The Brow Power pencil is great!&lt;br /&gt;It further darkened my dark brows very easily.</li>
            <li> The crayon is wide, waxy and is Nothing like original product.  </li>
            <li> AM A NEW CUSTOMER FOR THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> - I did that once with a brand new one and never found it.  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment to find the perfect brow pencil, and it either breaks (or just slips out of the swivel container since it doesn&#x27;t seem to actually be attached in any way to hold the product in place).  </li>
            <li> When this happened I lost a good portion of the brow pencil since it broke off, plus it made a mess to put the larger pieces of the brow pencil back in the dispenser.</li>
            <li> The color is very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve tried them all and more) hands down!!  </li>
            <li> It works on my dark brows with a heavier hand, as well as my daughter&#x27;s light brows with a lighter one.  </li>
            <li> This is almost the exact same pencil as the Models Prefer.  </li>
            <li> I found this at Ulta first and bought one in Amazon for back up.</li>
            <li> so natural !</li>
            <li> I like that since some pencils can be way too dark even with a light hand.  </li>
            <li> Stays on all day and looks natural!</li>
            <li> You can make the color as dark or as light as you want.</li>
            <li> I then lightly fill in my brows with short strokes, following the direction of natural hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I can go as light or dark as I want with my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> You must apply with light strokes for a natural looking brow and I like the brush which is on the other end of the pencil to finish.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that, even though it&#x27;s not cheap, one pencil does last several months.  </li>
            <li> The brow pencil fell after the first use, I was able to put it back in without breaking it and it did twist up and down, but then fell out again upon the second use.  </li>
            <li> and I was just unlucky this time--or whether to give up on the product since it&#x27;s a lot of trouble to return products (even as easy as Amazon makes it for us).  </li>
            <li> so I cleansed by brows with a mild astringent and tried again and carefully drew my line by tilting the pen at a 90 degree angle.</li>
            <li> brows are not bad by themselves or should i say were since this lady messed them all up...but that extra touch even makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> You have to learn to use a light hand or you will have very dark eyebrows</li>
            <li> I am a Blonde, so I go gently with the coloring and like the natural results.</li>
            <li> Color also blends in with my natural brows.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking before; thinking the color looked natural.  </li>
            <li> Looks completely natural.[[ASIN:B003VPTA2U</li>
            <li> Nothing works to make your filled-in eyebrows look as natural as this pencil.  </li>
            <li> Adds natural looking hair where yours might not exist.  </li>
            <li> When I was young</li>
            <li> The caps don&#x27;t fit snuggly and constantly fall off; second, the actual brow stick when the cap came off</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to like this product after initially seeing it on QVC</li>
            <li> The brush actually removes to much of the product.</li>
            <li> and it just looks so natural.</li>
            <li> I ordered another one before my old one was used up -</li>
            <li> Looks natural, stays on, doesn&#x27;t smudge, etc.  </li>
            <li> Although it is a stick, it looks like a powder on--thus the natural thing it has going</li>
            <li> Not harsh.</li>
            <li> The spooly end brush gives a natural, polished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then again, I don&#x27;t think that can be helped since my face develops natural oils through out the day and</li>
            <li> I struggled and struggled with eyebrow pencils over the years, trying to find a color that did not look absurd on my fair, freckled face.  </li>
            <li> The oval-shaped tip is perfect for both thin and thick brows.</li>
            <li> Fell out right away never really got to try it</li>
            <li> This brow pencil was reccommended to me by a friend and when i sadly shelled out $22 for it, i was pretty pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Broke after first use, also I think it&#x27;s old, because it&#x27;s much harder, than the one I purchased in a store.</li>
            <li> This is my only high end makeup product...</li>
            <li> Yeah - it&#x27;s cool that the color matches pretty much every hair color depending on how thick you apply it, but  other than that</li>
            <li> If you have super blonde brows or black brows, this MAY not work for you as it may be too light for black brows and too dark for super blonde brows.</li>
            <li> (I was able to slip it back inside, but I make sure all the product is twisted down before I apply the cap now).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and either within a few hours or by the end of the day it was always obvious that I had filled them in.</li>
            <li> The pencil I was using before made my brows look okay as long as I was in the house, but when I went outside and looked at my eyebrows in the sun they always looked a little orangey</li>
            <li> This looks very natural and I look years younger.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and really looks natural.</li>
            <li> This pencil is super thin which allows me to gradually fill in with wispy strokes exactly where I need it.</li>
            <li> So I was looking for a similar product that performed like the old Models Prefer version.  </li>
            <li> I have overplucked brows and blonde hair and this blends naturally.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the &#x27;universal&#x27; color, but I have to say it absolutely works for a brunette with fair skin and black brows.</li>
            <li> Not only are they super light in contrast to my dark hair, but thin and patchy especially after pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> Depending on how dark you want your brows depends on how much you want to press and build the color up.</li>
            <li> In general, we apply the same pressure to our eyes as we do to the skin on the rest of our face.</li>
            <li> I barely have any eyebrows and this helps immensely!!</li>
            <li> and this seems to keep it looking soft until long after I&#x27;ve made it home from work.</li>
            <li> I use it as a light base to shape/apply growth ingredients, then my favorite brown pencil last...</li>
            <li> I was able to retrieve it and put it back in the barrel, but i am not happy that it came apart, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I received this in a gift package, and was astounded at how much it was an improvement over my previous eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it everyday, so it certainly was not over-used.  </li>
            <li> I do like this eyebrow pencil, but I think it&#x27;s a little pricy for how much product it holds.  </li>
            <li> If your eyebrows have gone missing, this pencil will certainly help get them back.  </li>
            <li> I personally like to draw a very thin line on top of brow as this lifts my eye.</li>
            <li> Gives a very natural look and oddly, the same universal color works well for me (brown brows) and for my mother (gray brows.  </li>
            <li> , while I am waiting during the painfully slow and awkward process of growing out my brows, it&#x27;s good to know that until then I can look like a normal human being in the meantime!</li>
            <li> My brows are sparse due to plucking when I was young</li>
            <li> Like other comments, I am completely mystified by IT changjng this product.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how that was accomplished</li>
            <li> I am a victim of the 90&#x27;s overwaxing/overplucking, and growing out my brows has been the most difficult thing I&#x27;ve ever done.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, but not great either.</li>
            <li> It is not waterproof, but very long lasting.</li>
            <li> The pencil itself was a bit dry and it broke the second time I went to use it and for the price it shouldn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> I used to only use a $1 brow pencil from the brand NYC and that used to be good for me but after using this omg that $1 brow pencil is crap</li>
            <li> and it apparently went the other way and came out</li>
            <li> and you do have to really press hard to get it to show up.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product because I have very thin eyebrows and currently use a pencil.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use this as long as I can.</li>
            <li> just blended so well that you cannot tell that my eye brows are from a pencil and not natural</li>
            <li> With just a few strokes I can even out the natural color in my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> long wearing</li>
            <li> It was about two inches long.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s lasted me for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Will keep this product on hand for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> and it stays on all day long!</li>
            <li> Did not see what was so different about this as any other item.  </li>
            <li> I used this brow pencil for a month and couldn&#x27;t tell that it was any different from any other brow pencil.  </li>
            <li> I like to apply in a few long broad strokes, rather than use the feathered-stroke approach.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews on Amazon and other sites selling Brow Powder, and several others had the same experience.  </li>
            <li> It still gets a little shiny but only after several hours.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize what a gem I&#x27;d found until I ran out and went back to some other leftover products.</li>
            <li> the longer it takes it to dry out.</li>
            <li> I was a devout Anastasia Brow user, but I never new I could have all-in one bliss.</li>
            <li> Universal color brow pens are rarely universal and specific colors are so hard to nail.</li>
            <li> The broader pencil makes this a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is for really thick brows, not delicate ones like mine.</li>
            <li> , the pencil does stay on all day and I use a loose powder concealer on my face which defuses the darkness of the pencil.</li>
            <li> It usually comes out like black ink or red brown comparing to my natural brow color.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gone from sparse to bushy in the last months, but the brows have increased growth in previously sparse areas.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; (or whatever its called!) lasts a long time, and I never have any trouble with it smashing back into the pencil.  </li>
            <li> and I have very thin, dark eyebrows with huge gaps that I have to fill in.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t appreciate it any more or less than any of the other less expensive eye brow pencils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> there is I guess a little bit of wax in it, but totally blendable before it sets.</li>
            <li> Asian &amp; my hair is very dark brown.</li>
            <li> I still have brows, but they have become sparse and need this pencil to fill in empty spots.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tries gels, powders, wax pencils, etc.</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful as to not brush it all away because then you will have to re-apply.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> In my 50&#x27;s my brow were getting very thin and everything I tried either looked harsh or was too light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried literally every single drugstore pencil/powder out there, and they are all reddish and fake looking and way too dark and come right off (too waxy).  </li>
            <li> Also, I have trouble with the pencil being broken off in the case when I first opened it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews saying they went through the product in a month...</li>
            <li> it was empty!</li>
            <li> I like the spoolie on the other end too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether to give it another chance, thinking maybe only a small percentage are defective</li>
            <li> Also small enough to stick in my backpack or purse.</li>
            <li> I believe all nasty ingredients used in most cosmetics; non-organic or natural cosmetics, are not safe to use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Press harder for darker hair, including medium brown to black.</li>
            <li> Oh and the caps keep falling off too which is frustrating because you do not want to lose the precious, EXPENSIVE pencil that continually falls out.</li>
            <li> Be careful that the little pencil doesn&#x27;t fall out</li>
            <li> so then i add just a touch of this pencil on them and it makes them more noticeable but not in a dark dramatic fake way.</li>
            <li> and I feel as though it is too dark for me</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and the color</li>
            <li> my hair was a dark dark brown.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil has the ability of filling out sparse brow areas regardless of your hair color (past and present) and isn&#x27;t harsh looking.</li>
            <li> I could also see it working for dark hair.  </li>
            <li> The color was too dark  --  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re blonde, you might not have to press as hard to fill in your brows, but as a brunette, it does take a little effort to get the pencil to show up.  </li>
            <li> I have black hair and therefore black brows and this &amp;#34;universal taupe&amp;#34; color they have works for me.</li>
            <li> this cant even be compared to the typical pencils you buy in the store.</li>
            <li> I make my brows slightly darker up to the arch and lighter at the tail.</li>
            <li> the less time a roll up product is exposed to air..</li>
            <li> Applied with a heavy hand makes it dark; if you want a lighter shade, you just use less pressure.  </li>
            <li> For one thing, it is too dark!  </li>
            <li> This little tool helps to fill in the areas and the brush on the end grooms your brows as well.</li>
            <li> I put a little bit of translucent powder over the finished brow.  </li>
            <li> i have a few by my eye that my husband always said he likes and putting cover up make up on almost fades them.</li>
            <li> What a waste.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These brow pencils infuse a blend of conditioning ingredients including saw palmetto, nettle extract, green tea, biotin, lecithin, grape seed, panthenol, and vitamins A, C, and E.</li>
            <li> The products either got shiny, slipped or wiped off (I have an oily t-zone), or looked too harsh to begin with.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve never had an issue of it looking too harsh.</li>
            <li> On me, I used it too heavily and it came out too taupe/</li>
            <li> so I started coloring and experimenting with everything from henna, highlighting to black!</li>
            <li> It looked like I got a jet black sharpy colored in my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I started getting a few grays in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I usually just go over it with a powder in the morning</li>
            <li> I was referred by a past user.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past couple of years, and nothing compares.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, since  the first time I used it all of the brow pencil came out of the exterior holder.</li>
            <li> For such an expensive eye brow pencil, you don&#x27;t expect that.</li>
            <li> I have eyebrows but very thin and sometimes white hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have tried to use other pencils, powders that are less expensive, but nothing colors, covers or stays on like It</li>
            <li> Buy on QVC where you can at least return if not satisfied</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing a brow pencil that claims to be a \\&quot;universal shade\\&quot; for all hair colors, because my hair is a dark reddish auburn and even the brow pencils that are auburn-hued look weird on me.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me and was hard to apply.</li>
            <li> You can adjust the color by how hard you press.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, there is no better eyebrow product out there (and I have tried plenty!).  </li>
            <li> if you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> They are very thin, and one is thicker than the other.</li>
            <li> I think this is very expensive for a brow pencil, but it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use and</li>
            <li> I seriously almost gave up,</li>
            <li> It is subtle.</li>
            <li> The brow power applicator is not too thick or thin.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it took me awhile to run out of the eyebrow wax I was using and to start using this product, as now it&#x27;s past the return period.</li>
            <li> color  is very hard..  </li>
            <li> HAD USED M.P. BROW PENCIL AND WAS ADDICTED.  </li>
            <li> It was broken in a week, and</li>
            <li> if I just got a &#x27;bad&#x27; one or if this is typical of this brow pencil.</li>
            <li> They definitely changed the product for the worst, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s useless for me.  </li>
            <li> I had tried everything, powders, expensive pencils from department stores.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look fake.  </li>
            <li> And NOT worth it!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyebrows and have been filling them in for over 50 yrs.</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyebrows, so I don&#x27;t leave the house without something to define them.</li>
            <li> Also very thin.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad eye brows from over plucking</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> was so disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> and this is very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> This is very disappointing, I do like the color.</li>
            <li> I am one plagued by sparse brows and fall in the category of the fearful in going for a permanent/tattoo fix.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Shockingly my husband who never comliments or notices anything, noticed  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this pencil. On my 2nd pencil now!</li>
            <li> Best invention ever. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really like this brow pencil because you can make it as light or as dark as you want. Long lasting and really looks natural.</li>
            <li> I do like the brow pencil however, I&#x27;m gray to very light blonde and I feel as though it is too dark for me, the pencil does stay on all day and I use a loose powder concealer on my face which defuses the darkness of the pencil.</li>
            <li> If you have salt &amp; pepper hair and brows to match, this is the only brow pencil you&#x27;ll need.  It works perfectly, lasts all day and since you&#x27;re only using it once a day, the pencil itself lasts a VERY long time.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> It is perfect to make natural looking Eybrows.The Color is just right. This is the second time that I buy this Item</li>
            <li> Love that this pencil works for just about everyone.  It works on my dark brows with a heavier hand, as well as my daughter&#x27;s light brows with a lighter one.  Having the brush on the end is very convenient.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyebrow pencil, I wont use anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blonde and have always had sparse eyebrows.  I&#x27;ve used everything from pencils to powders to get my brows to show up and look nice, but nothing ever worked as well as this pencil.  Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it!  Press lightly for lighter brows, harder for darker ones.  There&#x27;s no need to sharpen...the pencil dials out as you need it.  And it&#x27;s so handy!  Fill in your brows, then flip the pencil around and use the brush end to polish and smooth them.  The color is absolutely perfect as well.  The pencil I was using before made my brows look okay as long as I was in the house, but when I went outside and looked at my eyebrows in the sun they always looked a little orangey and you could definitely see where I had &amp;#34;drawn&amp;#34; my brow shape in.  Not so with this one....my brows look pretty and natural, even in sunlight! I would definitely recommend this brow pencil!</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow pencil I have ever used. I have very thin eyebrows and have been filling them in for over 50 yrs. Color also blends in with my natural brows.  Have used many different pencils including one expensive pencil.</li>
            <li> I have been using brow power for at least a year and love it! Some over-tweezing has grown back and what hasn&#x27;t gets remedied:)</li>
            <li> I used to buy a similar product from Models Prefer on QVC.  When the product moved to HSN it didn&#x27;t seem the same.  So I was looking for a similar product that performed like the old Models Prefer version.  I think I found it!  This eyebrow pencil does just what I need.  I still have brows, but they have become sparse and need this pencil to fill in empty spots.  It does cost more for one than I used to pay for two, but it works, so I will pay the price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best brow pencil ever</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my It Cosmetics Brow Power Universal Eyebrow Pencil.  It was just as described. The color is very natural looking.  It stays put all day just as promised.  I was very impressed, and very happy with this brow pencil!  I would definitely order again!  If you are thinking of ordering an eyebrow pencil, order this one!  You will be happy that  you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 4/3/13 - I changed my mind about the original 5 star review.  For one thing, it is too dark!  It LOOKS like you have drawn on brows. I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking before; thinking the color looked natural.  It didn&#x27;t on me when I got out in the light.  Another issue I have is that this product is not organic.  I believe all nasty ingredients used in most cosmetics; non-organic or natural cosmetics, are not safe to use on a daily basis.  So I have switched to all organic/natural products.</li>
            <li> works well to fill in lashes in sparse areas. very natural looking.</li>
            <li> This is the last Brow Pencil I will ever purchase. It matches perfectly with my hair color and stays on until I take it off. Looks completely natural.[[ASIN:B003VPTA2U It Cosmetics Brow Power Universal Eyebrow Pencil, Universal .16 g]]</li>
            <li> I had used the eyebrow pencil from Models Prefer but that was discontinued.Since then, I have tried other products and have not been happy. Then I found this one and tried it.  I love it!!  This is almost the exact same pencil as the Models Prefer.  I will be purchasing it again and again.  Works great and color is wonderful. Try it and see!</li>
            <li> I love this handy pencil. Very natural- looking and perfect for traveling. This is my third and will continue to order. Nothing I&#x27;ve tried is as good as this.</li>
            <li> I always fill in my brows. I cannot go anywhere without filling them in, so its safe to say that ive gone through my fair share of different brow pencils and powders. Most of them got the job done but none of them every matched the color of my brows well. This brow pencil was reccommended to me by a friend and when i sadly shelled out $22 for it, i was pretty pleased with the product. $22 is a bit much but totally worth it to me because it matches perfectly!! I dont twist the pencil up too much as im worried it might snap, I also make quick and light strokes as to not snap the pencil as well. It blends out so well with the spooli brush too. I have medium brown eye brows and it works for me. If you have super blonde brows or black brows, this MAY not work for you as it may be too light for black brows and too dark for super blonde brows.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my brows thinning.  I had read about this product in In Style Magazine--I tried it.  The article stated some people have experienced the brows growing back--so I tried it.  Not only does it define my brows and give them great shape--I am seeing them growing in.  Excellent product--no regrets.</li>
            <li> AM A NEW CUSTOMER FOR THIS PRODUCT AND SO WAS INITIALLY---UNSURE.  HAD USED M.P. BROW PENCIL AND WAS ADDICTED.  WHEN THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS I SEARCHED AND TRIED AND FOUND NOTHING I LIKED AS MUCH.  THEN I FOUND THIS.  I LOVE IT, LOVE IT.  IT IS EVERY BIG AS GOOD AS M.P., MAYBE EVEN BETTER!  I SHALL LOOK NO FURTHER.  IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR GOOD COLOR (TAUPE) AND REAL EASE AND ACCURACY OF USE THIS IS FOR YOU.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff ... great color match and I have experienced increased brow growth. I haven&#x27;t gone from sparse to bushy in the last months, but the brows have increased growth in previously sparse areas.</li>
            <li> Because I received this as a gift, I do like it.  If I had paid for it myself, I might not like it as much.  The brush is a very good brow brush.  The pencil is very, very light and you do have to really press hard to get it to show up.  If you&#x27;re blonde, you might not have to press as hard to fill in your brows, but as a brunette, it does take a little effort to get the pencil to show up.  But I do like that the pencil does give you a more subtle fill-in, and from using this product, I&#x27;ve realized how important it is to fill in your brows - it makes a big difference for me!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and matches well!</li>
            <li> Nothing works to make your filled-in eyebrows look as natural as this pencil.  I&#x27;ve tried others, but none compare, so I keep paying the price to buy this one each time it runs out.  The good thing is that, even though it&#x27;s not cheap, one pencil does last several months.  Applied with a heavy hand makes it dark; if you want a lighter shade, you just use less pressure.  Use the brush before and after you pencil; this makes it look even more natural.  Be careful that the little pencil doesn&#x27;t fall out - I did that once with a brand new one and never found it.  I should have told the seller, I guess; didn&#x27;t think of that.  Just be careful with that and enjoy having perfect eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a pencil until a make up artist recommended it and urged me to practice.  I found this at Ulta first and bought one in Amazon for back up. It&#x27;s the best eyebrow pencil and it made it easier for me to pencil in my brows. I&#x27;m now an &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34; in my eyes! :)</li>
            <li> I got this eyebrow pencil free as a part of the :\Look Good, Feel Better program for women with cancer. I had never used an eyebrow pencil before but when mine fell out, it was necessary and they are not all created equal. Most eyebrows just wiped off or sweated off my face. This one kept on most of the day and the color is much more natural than some of the other browns I tried. I loved it so much that when my brows grew back in, I came back to pay for another one.  I think this is very expensive for a brow pencil, but it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use and it really makes me look better.</li>
            <li> have bought this product for many years.  it is my favorite eyebrow product.  Will continue to use this as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I have really bad eye brows from over plucking and I saw this product advertised in a magazine and decided to try it.  I have used many brow powders and they work okay but this product is the best I have found.  The first thing I liked was they showed you how to draw the brow (looks very natural) and then I was amazed at how the pencil matches the color of your brow exactly.  All of the powders I have are dark even if they say for blondes but this really blends perfectly.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it works very well and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  In my opinion, there is no better eyebrow product out there (and I have tried plenty!).  Great value, lasts all day, and is very easy to adjust the color to your liking just by applying with less or more pressure which leaves less or more product on your brows.  I hope they never stop making this brow pencil because I have finally found the perfect solution to my sparse brows.</li>
            <li> I ordered a \\&quot;It Cosmetics Brow Power\\&quot; pencil.  The Brow Power closely matches my hair color that is a cool brown. I shop for cool browns without the warm, red tones. The brow power applicator is not too thick or thin.  The second purchase, a \\&quot;Sorme True Taupe\\&quot; brow pencil is definitely a warm reddish brown, non-waterproof pencil.  I haven&#x27;t found a waterproof product but will continue shopping.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have very sparse eyebrows and this is the only eyebrow pencil I will use anymore. It is not waterproof, but very long lasting.</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account! I have been looking for a eyebrow pencil that is easy to use and looks natural. Just let me say I will look no further!! I love love love this pencil!! It has such great control and looks very natural. Depending on how dark you want your brows depends on how much you want to press and build the color up. I will NEVER use anything else!! A little pricy but worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this product! I got a deluxe sample size of this from my Ipsy bag a couple months ago and so I bought one for $18 on eBay 2 weeks after using the sample size because I just fell in LOVE. I&#x27;m still using the sample size btw. I&#x27;ve read other reviews saying they went through the product in a month... idk maybe they really draw on their brows but I mostly just fill and shape the outer halves of my brows. I have black hair and therefore black brows and this &amp;#34;universal taupe&amp;#34; color they have works for me. It&#x27;s so easy to use, awesome texture, and looks sooo good! This is my only high end makeup product... it&#x27;s the only thing I spend a lot of money on because it&#x27;s so good. I used to only use a $1 brow pencil from the brand NYC and that used to be good for me but after using this omg that $1 brow pencil is crap 😂. I just learned that QVC sells this as a trio (so you get 3 brow pencils and full size) every April and August for $42 so I literally just ordered it even though I still have my sample size and the $18 one from eBay. I just can&#x27;t run out of this!</li>
            <li> I struggled and struggled with eyebrow pencils over the years, trying to find a color that did not look absurd on my fair, freckled face.  This pencil does the trick and more!  I use a few brush strokes of stronger color to enhance the shaping and get wonderful compliments on my eyes--more so than ever!  I hope they never stop making this product!</li>
            <li> months later..update review.&lt;br /&gt;wow this brow pencil still lives up to its claim. not to mention i had my brows waxed recently and they completely messed them up spacing them too far apart in the middle and uneven. omg i wanted to cry... and thank goodness this brow pencil saved the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my brows are not bad by themselves or should i say were since this lady messed them all up...but that extra touch even makes a big difference. i make the ends come out a little farther where they are supposed to and fill them in just a bit more so theres no lighter areas. its amazing even just the slightest coloring makes your whole face enhanced. this cant even be compared to the typical pencils you buy in the store. it has a color to it that really does shade in completely natural. my mom is a redhead and complete different hair and skintone than me and her eyebrows are almost nonexistent as most redheads have blondish brows and lashes. i got this for her and she loves it. shes never had visible brows before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip i found out is that this works great to enhance any facial beauty marks you may have. i have a few by my eye that my husband always said he likes and putting cover up make up on almost fades them. so then i add just a touch of this pencil on them and it makes them more noticeable but not in a dark dramatic fake way.</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyebrows, so I don&#x27;t leave the house without something to define them. That said, I also change my hair color with the seasons (more strawberry blonde in summer, more auburn in the winter) this works perfect with every color and covers the grays. Yay, now I only have to have 1 brow product in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> The universal color is great.  I have dark hair and the color just blended so well that you cannot tell that my eye brows are from a pencil and not natural</li>
            <li> This is a terrific eyebrow pencil.  It seems to work well no matter what your coloring is and it stays on all day long!</li>
            <li> Nothing on the package said it makes hair grow, which was the reason we chose this one.  The color is fine, but we could have gotten one cheaper that works just as well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyebrow pen, it goes on easily and the color can be manipulated through application. I love the brush at the end for blending and perfecting the look! I have light eyebrows and this works pretty well for me. Pleased with the product, no irritation, washes off w/o problem.</li>
            <li> I am a victim of the 90&#x27;s overwaxing/overplucking, and growing out my brows has been the most difficult thing I&#x27;ve ever done.  Not only are they super light in contrast to my dark hair, but thin and patchy especially after pregnancy.  I&#x27;ve tried literally every single drugstore pencil/powder out there, and they are all reddish and fake looking and way too dark and come right off (too waxy).  I&#x27;m not trying to look like Halloween in August if you know what I mean.  I seriously almost gave up, but then I found this on a whim at Ulta, and the sample size is only $12.00!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while I am waiting during the painfully slow and awkward process of growing out my brows, it&#x27;s good to know that until then I can look like a normal human being in the meantime!</li>
            <li> Although the product is good and does blend well, there isn&#x27;t enough of it, for the price that is paid.</li>
            <li> I cannot say how much I love this pencil. It is the perfect color and exceeds all my expectations. I love it and it&#x27;s the only eyebrow pencil I will use.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil is magnificent LOVE IT products! Highly recommend this for anyone considering getting their eyebrows tattooed! Doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit!</li>
            <li> If your eyebrows have gone missing, this pencil will certainly help get them back.  I&#x27;ve practically tried everything out there and this brow pencil has certainly given me the best results by far.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil was voted &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; by one of the beauty magazines. I have to agree. The pencil comes in one color. Use a lighter hand for a more natural brow or use more pressure if you want a darker brow. For me being a brunette, I like a softer, defined brow, this pencil does the trick. I like it.</li>
            <li> Adds natural looking hair where yours might not exist.  one end adds brow and the brush end shapes.  My brows look as good as they did when I was 20!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Goes on easy and stays put. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years, and it never disappoints</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, but from Ulta, so I could try it on before buying, I love this pencil.&lt;br /&gt;I have tatooed eyebrows, so have a great shape to begin with, but am 70 and getting a load of grey hairs, this pencil is great.  With just a few strokes I can even out the natural color in my eyebrows.  Shockingly my husband who never comliments or notices anything, noticed  He even said that my eyes look great.  Its the pencil because liner, upper and lower and eyebrows have been permanent for years.  I was hesitant as I  thought it abit pricey, but find the universal pencil is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> There was no brow pencil- it was empty!</li>
            <li> The tip of this is like a slider crayon that is shaped like an oval instead of a circle. I love this because it makes it a bit easier to make quick brow strokes. The color is great too, not overpowering. Lasts all day but isn&#x27;t a pain to get off either.</li>
            <li> works wonders on brows of all colors fills in exrends looks natural great product</li>
            <li> If you are unsure about the item DO NOT BUY.  you cannot return this item if used even though it is an Amazon verified seller.  Buy on QVC where you can at least return if not satisfied and it is the same price.  Pencil goes on dark unless you apply VERY lightly...Also very thin.  I prefer to use Sorme which is half the price and a better product.</li>
            <li> Great product matches my brows exactly. long wearing</li>
            <li> The Brow Power pencil is great!&lt;br /&gt;It further darkened my dark brows very easily. This was my first time using a brow pencil.</li>
            <li> Best pencil &amp; brush set I have ever used. Goes on smoothly &amp; when brushed looks very natural. Have ordered 4 &amp; will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Only used this product a couple of times a week since I purchased it.  Looked good, but the mechanism in the pencil broke &amp; there is still a lot of the lead left that I cannot use.  Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Did not see what was so different about this as any other item.  Maybe not using it properly?  Anyway,  I did not like this.</li>
            <li> Have tried several brow pencils....this is definitely the best one.  I recently ran out and tried another on, let&#x27;s just say I never want to run out of this one again !!!!!!</li>
            <li> You know how sometimes you use an eyebrow pencil &amp; it feels like it&#x27;s made out of wax? This pencil is the opposite, it&#x27;s GREAT! I happened to get a travel size locally to try it out, had no clue Amazon sold it. I thought universal taupe wasn&#x27;t going to be for me because I&#x27;m Asian &amp; my hair is very dark brown. But it really is how you apply it. Using like strokes give you a lighter effect &amp; surprise the more you apply, the darker it&#x27;ll get. It has a slight ash tone to it, which is something I appreciate because how many browns are there out there that go reddish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula keeps my unruly brows in shape all day &amp; I haven&#x27;t noticed any smudging, even during this hot summer. Humidity doesn&#x27;t seem to budge it either... which makes me feel good about wearing it to the beach. The spoolie seems really durable &amp; doesn&#x27;t bend or feel cheap like some. It&#x27;s NOT a pencil to powder... there is I guess a little bit of wax in it, but totally blendable before it sets. I also like that it&#x27;s self sharpening &amp; fills in where my hair doesn&#x27;t grow in at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use this when I don&#x27;t use the pomade or powder! Try it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!  I&#x27;ve had difficulty trying to find a color that fits without looking &amp;#34;made up.&amp;#34;  I have platinum hair and am very fair and most color appear &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; on me, but this one truly measures up to what it touts.  I can apply it as light or dark as I want and the brush really helps blend it well so that my brows appear more &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  Since I&#x27;m in my 60s now, my brows are VERY light and sparse, so this fills in well without looking like they were drawn in with a crayon, like so many others do.  Clinique has a nice color too, but it doesn&#x27;t have the brush and it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as this.  No more looking for the perfect brow pencil/powder for me!</li>
            <li> The first one I bought was perfect, a 5 star product.  However, I bought two more and the pencil immediately fell out of both pencils the second I opened the box.  They definitely changed the product for the worst, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this brand. . You have to learn to use a light hand or you will have very dark eyebrows</li>
            <li> I have been through many brown pencils for my medium brown eyebrows. Many of the eyebrow pencils I have used have had hints of red in them, but this brow pencil is the perfect brown. It also works perfectly for my sister&#x27;s much lighter eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brow routine consists of coloring in my brows with this pencil then using Benefit Gimme Brow (linked below) in medium brown to brush my eyebrows up and make my eyebrows look even more natural. However, I also use this pencil on its own and my eyebrows look better than they ever have using any other product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyebrow pencil has become a staple of my routine and I will definitely continue to purchase it! I definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00EIRG5IW Benefit Cosmetics Gimme Brow - light/medium]]</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil is okay but has a tendency to be smudgy as the day wears on. I think people who use this type of product are looking for something with a more natural look. Also, I have trouble with the pencil being broken off in the case when I first opened it. This is a bit aggravating because you have to pick it up, wherever it falls, and put it back in the case so it can be used. This has happened with more than one of the pencils I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product and fell in love. The taupe color easily matches several shades depending on how the user applies​. I actually have seen my sparse brows grow fuller since beginning to use this product. I am thrilled with the Brow Power Brow Pencil.</li>
            <li> this is great product and I am so glad I am able to replace the sample one I had.</li>
            <li> Needed to fill in brows and tried many different types of products. This is quick and lasts. The brush fell off and I had to glue it back. Otherwise, perfect.</li>
            <li> This brow pencil is amazing. When I was young my hair was a dark dark brown. I started getting a few grays in my late 20&#x27;s so I started coloring and experimenting with everything from henna, highlighting to black! Now I am naturally gray, but choose to be medium golden brown. I learned that certain hair colors look best with my complexion and no longer experiment. My point is this....... This eyebrow pencil has the ability of filling out sparse brow areas regardless of your hair color (past and present) and isn&#x27;t harsh looking. My brows are sparse due to plucking when I was young and I have several gray hairs popping up! This little tool helps to fill in the areas and the brush on the end grooms your brows as well.</li>
            <li> The seller&#x27;s performance was great--received quickly. Thebrow pencil itself is junk. It was broken in a week, and no. I didn&#x27;t drop it or anything. If I had bought it in person I would take it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> I returned this product to Amazon.  What a disappointment!  The product came out of the holder after just one use.  What a waste.  This is the second try for me with this pencil.  The first time it happened, I considered it an accident.  Then, I realized its just a faulty product, with a big price tag.</li>
            <li> I have overplucked brows and blonde hair and this blends naturally. I never colored my brows before using this, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It worked fine the first time but the second time I could not get the liner to come out and it apparently went the other way and came out the brush end.  I have never had a problem with IT cosmetics and this is very disappointing.  I will exchange it and hope it was just a defective product.</li>
            <li> I love love love this brow pencil!! I love how universal the shade is, it&#x27;s just perfect for almost any shades of hair color! It last all day too!!</li>
            <li> so natural ! my husband who does not even understand if i am wearing lipstick or not, never fails to see the difference whenever i apply this ! love it :)</li>
            <li> My brows are growing back after years of plucking! The color works well for me...I use it as a light base to shape/apply growth ingredients, then my favorite brown pencil last...it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this item.  Its in my daily beauty routine.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow pencil that I have ever used! I barely have any eyebrows and this helps immensely!!</li>
            <li> I did like this product and gave it a raving review until it broke on me 3 weeks later and the sellers policy was no refund or replacement for hygiene reasons.  The pencil fell out and will not go back in so it&#x27;s useless for me.  Although I had it for 3 weeks I didn&#x27;t use it everyday, so it certainly was not over-used.  $20 is too much money for me to pay for a product that lasts a few short weeks.</li>
            <li> I have really messed up brows. They are very thin, and one is thicker than the other. I had tried everything, powders, expensive pencils from department stores. This is the best eyebrow product! It&#x27;s natural looking, easy to apply and makes my brows look better than they have in years. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I do not wear much make up, but I use this every day. I will buy another one when used up.</li>
            <li> I used this brow pencil for a month and couldn&#x27;t tell that it was any different from any other brow pencil.  After a month, it broke!  The swivel mechanism to push the pencil out broke.  I was so disappointed.  I did like the color of the pencil, though.  Oh, well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it took me awhile to run out of the eyebrow wax I was using and to start using this product, as now it&#x27;s past the return period. Two main issues. The caps don&#x27;t fit snuggly and constantly fall off; second, the actual brow stick when the cap came off was in the cap. I had to tap it out and stick it back into the &amp;#34;pencil&amp;#34; and now it falls out constantly. Another issue, which I don&#x27;t know if it is due to the product itself or an allergy from using it, but as I&#x27;m putting it on it pulls out my eyebrows; to elaborate, as I stroke color onto my brow I lift up the pencil and there are eyebrows attached to the end of the brow stick, any where from 5-10 every time I use it. I was really hoping to like this product after initially seeing it on QVC and I&#x27;m not sure if I just got a &#x27;bad&#x27; one or if this is typical of this brow pencil. Either way, based on my experience I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Loved it best brow pencil</li>
            <li> Love it. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and easy to use! Woukd recommend!</li>
            <li> Like other comments, I am completely mystified by IT changjng this product.  The crayon is wide, waxy and is Nothing like original product.  If you liked the original you will not want tbis!</li>
            <li> Love this .looks very natural. Once I started using this I feel like I can&#x27;t leave the house without it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me and was hard to apply.</li>
            <li> The most natural looking eyebrow pencil I have. I carry it in my purse all the time for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> Love this brow pencil. Will never use another kind.</li>
            <li> Excellent brow pencil. Gives a very natural look and oddly, the same universal color works well for me (brown brows) and for my mother (gray brows.  Not sure how that was accomplished but we are both big fans.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the &#x27;universal&#x27; color, but I have to say it absolutely works for a brunette with fair skin and black brows. The stick is thicker than regular brow pencils and applies smoothly. I like to apply in a few long broad strokes, rather than use the feathered-stroke approach. The broader pencil makes this a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is for really thick brows, not delicate ones like mine. The brush actually removes to much of the product. I prefer the spoolie brush on the Anastasia Brow Wiz.  However this pencil is so much better than the Anastasia product.&lt;br /&gt;I was quite satisfied with my brows after just using the Brow Power pencil. However, incorporating the Brow Power pencil into my regular routine (brow wax, pencil, brow powder, spoolie brush) gave me the best brows ever. The reason for only 4 stars...the price and the brush.</li>
            <li> I was a devout Anastasia Brow user, but I never new I could have all-in one bliss. The color is perfect, the wax helps it stay in place forever and it just looks so natural. My brows have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I loved the color and texture of this, but the lead broke and fell out just days after I started using it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyebrow pencil.  The &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; (or whatever its called!) lasts a long time, and I never have any trouble with it smashing back into the pencil.  It never needs sharpened, and the lead never breaks.  I received this in a gift package, and was astounded at how much it was an improvement over my previous eyebrow pencil.  The color is great - I don&#x27;t like a pencil that looks reddish brown - I have dark brown hair - and it matches perfectly without being really dark.  I ordered another one before my old one was used up - I didn&#x27;t want to go a day without one.  Try it - I think you will love it!</li>
            <li> I do like this eyebrow pencil, but I think it&#x27;s a little pricy for how much product it holds.  One time I took the cap off and the product was stuck to the cap and came out in one piece (I was able to slip it back inside, but I make sure all the product is twisted down before I apply the cap now).  It was about two inches long.  I know that is a lot for an eyebrow pencil, but it seems like it could hold a lot more.  I&#x27;ll probably buy it again though.  The color is great and can be applied darker if you press harder.  I like that since some pencils can be way too dark even with a light hand.  I like the spoolie on the other end too.</li>
            <li> I COMPLETELY agree with all of the wonderful reviews about how well this product works.  When I first tried it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use and how it perfectly matched my brow color.  Looks natural, stays on, doesn&#x27;t smudge, etc.  The only problem is that IT BROKE AFTER ONLY 3-4 USAGES!  What a disappointment to find the perfect brow pencil, and it either breaks (or just slips out of the swivel container since it doesn&#x27;t seem to actually be attached in any way to hold the product in place).  I read other reviews on Amazon and other sites selling Brow Powder, and several others had the same experience.  I don&#x27;t know whether to give it another chance, thinking maybe only a small percentage are defective and I was just unlucky this time--or whether to give up on the product since it&#x27;s a lot of trouble to return products (even as easy as Amazon makes it for us).  How about others out there?  Have you encountered one that breaks all together or one in which the product slips out no where to be found?</li>
            <li> It is just OK, i thought it would glide on better. When I opened it today, there was no tip...it had fallen off in the lid. I was able to retrieve it and put it back in the barrel, but i am not happy that it came apart, especially for the price. disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fell out right away never really got to try it</li>
            <li> This pencil is an easy way to fill in sparse brows.  By using pressure on the pencil, you can adjust the darkness.  I have only two reservations with this product;  It can be wiped off rather easily and it would be great if the point was refillable.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  All in one.</li>
            <li> The potential for greatness lies in the color. Universal color brow pens are rarely universal and specific colors are so hard to nail. The pencil is customizable color wise by the pressure used. I make my brows slightly darker up to the arch and lighter at the tail. Although it is a stick, it looks like a powder on--thus the natural thing it has going and why so many love it. I personally like to draw a very thin line on top of brow as this lifts my eye. It is subtle. This did not work the first time I used it. My face is oily...so I cleansed by brows with a mild astringent and tried again and carefully drew my line by tilting the pen at a 90 degree angle. Brows look fabulous. Even in sunlight. Not harsh. Practice makes perfect and I wasn&#x27;t sure about this pen based on reviews stating it was too dark.In general, we apply the same pressure to our eyes as we do to the skin on the rest of our face. We should use 1/4 of that pressure. So, a light touch is truly light...feather touch. If this pen can take a day on my oily face AND doesn&#x27;t break prematurely ..I will come back and give it a 5. I am sure the one thing to do is avoid turning the pencil until there is a need to...the less time a roll up product is exposed to air..the longer it takes it to dry out. But, I am hopeful with this pen. My favorite...an actual pencil I found in a boutique in Atlanta was discontinued. It had it all. Maybe this is the end of my search</li>
            <li> This brow pencil really works.  It stays on and I don&#x27;t have to worry about smearing it or hoping it will stay on until I wash it off.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I thought I might need to practice to get nice looking brows, but the first time I used this, I was impressed; no practice needed. It is very easy to use and natural looking.</li>
            <li> The best brow pencil ever.  Stays on all day and looks natural!</li>
            <li> i used before and it is the only thing that looks natural for me and is easy to use</li>
            <li> Best pencil I have ever used!</li>
            <li> broke after the third application had to trow it out</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but a very easy to use brow color.  And it really does last and doesn&#x27;t come off easily.</li>
            <li> Broke after first use, also I think it&#x27;s old, because it&#x27;s much harder, than the one I purchased in a store.</li>
            <li> This is my first brow pencil and I am very happy with it.  I am a Blonde, so I go gently with the coloring and like the natural results.</li>
            <li> This product really does what is promised. In my 50&#x27;s my brow were getting very thin and everything I tried either looked harsh or was too light. This looks very natural and I look years younger. Can&#x27;t wait to try more Of It Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This has really impressed me.  A girlfriend who has had cancer was at a survivors seminar and this was recommended for cancer patients who had lost eyebrows.  I used hers and loved it.  I have eyebrows but very thin and sometimes white hairs.  This pencil is fantastic for &amp;#34;drawing&amp;#34; towards your nose and extending outward.  It doesn&#x27;t look fake.  I will definitely be keeping this in stock.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil works well. It is drier than some of the gel types and pulls somewhat but that also makes it easier to control. It is still a touch darker for me than I would like, no matter how light I apply but it goes on where I need it, travels well and stays neat.  This is a universal  long-wear eyebrow pencil infused with brow-enhancing ingredients and technology. The oval-shaped tip is perfect for both thin and thick brows. The spooly end brush gives a natural, polished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brow pencils infuse a blend of conditioning ingredients including saw palmetto, nettle extract, green tea, biotin, lecithin, grape seed, panthenol, and vitamins A, C, and E. The shade partially adjusts to every hair color and gives a beautiful, natural-looking brow. It&#x27;s also paraben-free, fragrance-free, phthalate-free, and sulfate-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply lighter, softer strokes to match my lighter color hair. Press harder for darker hair, including medium brown to black. As a finishing touch, I  lightly brush through brows with the spooly brush for a natural, polished look. A full brow-lift instruction diagram is included with each pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 04-14-14</li>
            <li> Love this pencil. Worth the extra cost. You can adjust the color by how hard you press. Great pencil, stays put all day. Had this for a couple months with no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow product I&#x27;ve ever used. I over-plucked as a teenager and I have very thin, dark eyebrows with huge gaps that I have to fill in. I&#x27;ve tries gels, powders, wax pencils, etc. I&#x27;ve tried them all and either within a few hours or by the end of the day it was always obvious that I had filled them in. The products either got shiny, slipped or wiped off (I have an oily t-zone), or looked too harsh to begin with. This pencil is super thin which allows me to gradually fill in with wispy strokes exactly where I need it. It also starts out light and gets darker the more you put on or the harder you swipe. This allows me to control the amount of product and the color of the product so I&#x27;ve never had an issue of it looking too harsh. It stays on all day, I&#x27;ve even slept with it on and it never came off throughout the night. It still gets a little shiny but only after several hours. I usually just go over it with a powder in the morning and this seems to keep it looking soft until long after I&#x27;ve made it home from work. In the heat it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long, but still by far the best thing I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Most eyebrow pencil does not draw natural.  It usually comes out like black ink or red brown comparing to my natural brow color.  This IT cosmetics pencil draw natural in shape and color and it lasts for a reasonable time.  I finished my 4th pencil so I have to order again!</li>
            <li> Wish I had read all the reviews.  It seems this brow treatment formula has changed. I was referred by a past user. The pencil i received is very waxy and a few precious eyebrow hairs have even been pulled out as I am applying it. Does it stay on? Yes. But actually &#x27;getting IT on&#x27; is the trick. It&#x27;s not at all as described.</li>
            <li> Purchased this first time from a shopping network. The price was right this time and the pencil works great. My brows look natural and expressive-- all day long</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the price. Yeah - it&#x27;s cool that the color matches pretty much every hair color depending on how thick you apply it, but  other than that, I didn&#x27;t appreciate it any more or less than any of the other less expensive eye brow pencils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know these existed -- until it was time I looked at my thinning brows.  The color (medium brown) is perfect for me.  I can put it on in the morning and it stays on all day, with or without makeup.  Some reviewer said she found it to be &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; but I don&#x27;t find it to be waxy at all.  I&#x27;ve only bought one pencil but it&#x27;s lasted me for a long time.  It&#x27;s my wonderful little helper</li>
            <li> Whether my hair is highlighted blonde or is its natural, light brown, this remains my favorite brow filler of all time. You can easily adjust the shade by the amount that you apply so I could also see it working for dark hair.  It&#x27;s super easy to apply, does not look cakey, blends beautifully, looks natural and is the PERFECT shade (no red undertones whatsoever).  I have never found another like it.  It beats MAC, Smashbox and Too Faced Brow Envy (I&#x27;ve tried them all and more) hands down!!  LOVE!!!!!  It&#x27;s pricey but I keep coming back for the perfectly neutral color.</li>
            <li> ok, but you can do the same thing with any brow pencil and a lash brush</li>
            <li> I will use this forever!  It adapts to all hair and skin colors and looks great even as I age.</li>
            <li> I am one plagued by sparse brows and fall in the category of the fearful in going for a permanent/tattoo fix.  So, that leaves me in the same tough spot with the rest of you who find yourself researching on the best product to frame your faces with.  I&#x27;ve tried many good ones from Tart, Billion Doller Brow, and Anastasia Dip Brow Pomade. The best of these is the Dip Brow, but even that took too long to apply and wasn&#x27;t as waterproof as I hoped it would be.  I decided to Google and oogle through reviews and came across It Universal Brow Pencil.  JACKPOT! Love how easy this is to use, how it blends with my natural color, and how long lasting it is.  The conclusion after using this product for about a week now is that search is over!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had full eyebrows for many years and have tried many products.  This one actually works, stays on all day until I wash it off in the evening.  I now can look at myself and see eyebrows where there were none before.  Will keep this product on hand for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Best brush and color by far and I&#x27;ve tried many!!  I&#x27;m a brunette, but my blonde friends love it, too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past couple of years, and nothing compares. I have tried to use other pencils, powders that are less expensive, but nothing colors, covers or stays on like It Brow Power. It goes on well, stays on and looks like real eye brows. You can make the color as dark or as light as you want. When you first start using it, you just have to work with it and learn what works best for you. Practice using it. Brows can be tricky. But, once you master it, this is the perfect and best pencil on the market. I have tried many, and nothing compares or is better.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the colour pay off of thsi brow pencil, but then this morning, the pencil broke and fell off from the holder. was so disappointed in this. I had many other brow pencil simiilar to this, but this the first time it happend to me considering the pencil is pretty new.</li>
            <li> The pencil went on darker than I thought, which I liked. I also got compliments on my brows after using the product, even though I have always drawn in my brows the same way. The only thing is, it is stated as being water proof but it does rub off at some point during the day. But then again, I don&#x27;t think that can be helped since my face develops natural oils through out the day and the product is not oil proof. This will be my go to brow pencil from now on.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brow pencil but very hard to find!</li>
            <li> It lasts forever, is a color that is never fake looking, and is easy to use...no sharpening. It also has an excellent brush for grooming eyebrows</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, since  the first time I used it all of the brow pencil came out of the exterior holder. When this happened I lost a good portion of the brow pencil since it broke off, plus it made a mess to put the larger pieces of the brow pencil back in the dispenser.</li>
            <li> This really works. Smudging the pencil lines with the brush is so real looking and it stays on.  I put a little bit of translucent powder over the finished brow.  Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing a brow pencil that claims to be a \\&quot;universal shade\\&quot; for all hair colors, because my hair is a dark reddish auburn and even the brow pencils that are auburn-hued look weird on me.  This pencil is perfect!  I love the spooly brush on the end, and I first use that before application of the pencil.  I then lightly fill in my brows with short strokes, following the direction of natural hair growth.  I lightly use the spooly brush again to soften the color and blend it into my brows.  After a few seconds, the waxy consistency of the pencil seems to \\&quot;set,\\&quot; providing a way to keep my brows looking neat and tidy.  I would highly recommend this pencil to anyone, particularly those who have a difficulty time in finding a natural-looking color match.</li>
            <li> great product.  easy to use and excellent results</li>
            <li> This pencil is for any color brows you have. The pressure you use makes the difference. I am now on my second one. The first one lasted almost a year!</li>
            <li> So after watching the infomercial I was roped into wanting one of these. I thought it would be a great way to make my eyebrows look more natural but when you put it on you can see the color of the pen on your eyebrows. Of course, you can use the brush end to blend it in some but you have to be careful as to not brush it all away because then you will have to re-apply. In all honesty I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money. However I will still give it a 3 star because I do still use it in moderation.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions carefully. On me, I used it too heavily and it came out too taupe/almost orangeish.  For the price I can&#x27;t say I would buy it again as I&#x27;m always on the hunt for the perfect eyebrow pencil. I have sparse and light eyebrows and this was no miracle product for me. Not bad, but not great either.</li>
            <li> Goes on so easy and is simple to layer for a darker color.  It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t leave my eyebrows waxy feeling.  The color doesn&#x27;t smudge or run with sweat.  Yet it&#x27;s easy to wash off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This is my second brow pencil.  Loved the first one and had to get another one.  You can get any color you like by using the brush side.  Looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize what a gem I&#x27;d found until I ran out and went back to some other leftover products. This is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Beat brow pencil I ever used. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow pencil ever!!!!!</li>
            <li> This brow pencil is awesome! I can go as light or dark as I want with my eyebrows. The brow comb is great as well. I received my package about three days after I ordered. It stays on for a good long time and it is easy to apply. Also small enough to stick in my backpack or purse.</li>
            <li> I received this and ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.  IT IS THE BEST BROW PENCIL I have ever used.  I gave it a 2 because it did not last anytime at all.  I used it, maybe, 10 times and POOF, it was all gone.</li>
            <li> The color was too dark  --  suppose to be a universal color&lt;br /&gt;It does not make your brow hairs grow -  not so&lt;br /&gt;The video also miss represented information</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a universal color, well its NOT!!!!!!! I sent this back immediately!!! I have eyebrows, I just wanted a more defined look. It looked like I got a jet black sharpy colored in my eyebrows! This product is over priced!!! And NOT worth it!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> What an amazing eyebrow pencil could not do without it.  Defines my hairless brows so perfect that it looks like I was born with them.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;lead&#x27; / color  is very hard..  I actually have to press &#x27;&#x27;til it hurts&#x27; to get it on.  Not a value at all!</li>
            <li> GREAT COMB/COLOR PENCIL.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow pencil,it&#x27;s a very good product,I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product because I have very thin eyebrows and currently use a pencil.  When I saw how this worked, I thought I could make my brows look more natural.  The pencil itself was a bit dry and it broke the second time I went to use it and for the price it shouldn&#x27;t do that.  I received a refund, but will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This pencil is excellent.  It stays on all day until I take it off.  You must apply with light strokes for a natural looking brow and I like the brush which is on the other end of the pencil to finish.</li>
            <li> The best color for my eyebrows... I love this product and can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned.  But probably will not buy it again.  This time, the lead keeps falling out.  For such an expensive eye brow pencil, you don&#x27;t expect that.</li>
            <li> If only the pencil would stop falling out, I would give this 5 stars. Oh and the caps keep falling off too which is frustrating because you do not want to lose the precious, EXPENSIVE pencil that continually falls out. WHY do I put up with this? Because it really looks very natural and matches any color. Everything else looks like cartoon eyebrows. This one look great. I bought two. One for home and one for my travel make-up bag. I cannot be without it.</li>
            <li> This pencil is amazing.  On my second one.</li>
            <li> The brow pencil fell after the first use, I was able to put it back in without breaking it and it did twist up and down, but then fell out again upon the second use.  This is very disappointing, I do like the color.</li>
