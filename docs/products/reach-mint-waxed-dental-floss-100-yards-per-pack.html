            <li>The taste is great too !!</li>
            <li>The size is perfect for home or travel use too!</li>
            <li>It comes just as it says and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>This is the best dental floss I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Cleans between my teeth the best of any dental floss I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a happy camper to have some again!</li>
            <li>The taste is very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>(Because guess what, teflon is non-stick, which doesn&#x27;t make it ideal for gunk removal.)  </li>
            <li>The spearmint is wonderful and I like the cinnamon one even more!  </li>
            <li>The seller was great</li>
            <li>so this is actually really great that there&#x27;s 4 that I&#x27;m purchasing instead of one.</li>

            <li>Good strength and I like the minty hint.</li>
            <li>The price was good.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good floss.</li>
            <li>but this is still a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this floss.</li>
            <li>is that I can&#x27;t get a good grip when I use it.</li>

            <li>Reach Clean Burst Dental Floss is the best Dental Floss I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>a good buy Subscribe and save more !</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best floss ever created and has a powerful minty flavor to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These were nice and a good price when I bough them- $1 for one</li>
            <li>Cleans my teeth, feels good, nice stuff.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side - it smells nice and has a good taste</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The mint flavoring is delightful and the floss does such a great job.  </li>
            <li>so I have perfect straight teeth).</li>
            <li>Nice minty flavor.  </li>
            <li>The floss leaves a nice minty taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li>like some floss does which is nice.</li>
            <li>The minty flavor is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Has a good taste, easily gets between the teeth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super inexpensive, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>The string breaks and gets stuck in my teeth very easily.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very easy to break and works as you&#x27;d expect it to.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was giving these away, bought alot they work fine, good name, reach</li>
            <li>i agree with J&amp;J that is more effective.  </li>
            <li>Go get the Plackers floss thingies instead --- they never break, and since getting them I&#x27;ve been a consistent and happy flosser.</li>
            <li>This floss is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t cut your gums and when done leaves a clean pleasant taste in your mouth</li>
            <li>We love the waxed floss.  </li>
            <li>and this makes it so that many floss just gets stuck or just</li>
            <li>It is my favorite floss</li>
            <li>Love me some waxed dental floss.</li>
            <li>I love having a lot of it around, a feeling of security :)</li>
            <li>And it has a minty quality to it which is refreshing for the mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using J&amp;J Reach floss for many years.</li>
            <li>Not the awesome Total Care Floss that rocks my world.</li>
            <li>Floss that breaks creates more problems than it solves.</li>
            <li>Sure am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>The quality is excellent, and I have a couple extra now, so I will not run out of it anytime soon.</li>
            <li>If you have gaps between teeth and want to dig out more in one try, this is it.</li>
            <li>my teeth would get a space more and more if i use it everyday.&lt;br</li>
            <li>let me know if you find a better one though.</li>
            <li>Being able to buy it in bulk saves me money and gas running to the store when I run out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was amazed at how much more this cleaned from my teeth and have never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have used a number of different dental flosses in search of the perfect one.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I have used better ones for sure.</li>
            <li>The floss is more durable .Overall</li>
            <li>Everyone loves glide, but I feel like this cleans so much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this floss.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my all time favorite</li>
            <li>This is an excellent deal for a four-pack of Reach brand floss at a generic sale price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a refreshing surprise to have the minty flavor as you floss.</li>
            <li>Very nice and fast.  </li>
            <li>Does the job pretty good.  </li>
            <li>and it is some pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li>it works just fine, works like floss lol, but in all seriousness it a decent product.</li>
            <li>For most people this floss may be fine</li>
            <li>It is true that the floss does tear very easily.</li>
            <li>I guess Johnson &amp; Johnson made the floss cheap so that you would have to go and purchase more.</li>
            <li>gosh this so such a good quality and deal!</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s the only thing I can say good about the product!  </li>
            <li>Floss breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>so it goes between the teeth easily.  </li>
            <li>have bunch of these lying around everywhere, bedroom, living room, bathroom and even in the office for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;Buy in packs and save money.</li>
            <li>Buying in bulk makes sure I don&#x27;t run out and that I maintain clean teeth.</li>
            <li>I like the tape shape which makes easy to use.</li>
            <li>Does the job and easily.</li>
            <li>This does seem to clean better than glide.  </li>
            <li>It does shred easily and gets stuck between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Easy on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this floss as it cleans well and is easy to see to dispose of after cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>It shreds easily and it not made of quality.</li>
            <li>Hands down THE best dental floss anywhere!</li>
            <li>The best thing about it is the cost, which is usually about a dollar at most brick-and-mortar stores.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and pack of 4, why not for a deal!</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite floss!</li>
            <li>I love this floss , the other kinds shred too easy from my teeth as they are so close together !!!</li>
            <li>Great flavor but the 55 yards is too short.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value, probably about the same price as Walmart!</li>
            <li>Went for cheap floss, and received cheap floss.  </li>
            <li>(cheap)</li>
            <li>I really like this kind of shopping.</li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t used much of this since I bought it</li>
            <li>and I have used almost all of the products available .</li>
            <li>I like this floss, not my favorite but definitely tastes good and does the job</li>
            <li>dunno, I think is kind of fun, haha :)&lt;</li>
            <li>BUT as far as floss goes this is good stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just good old run-of-the-mill floss.</li>
            <li>Great floss, leaves teeth feeling extra clean.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, not much i can say about dental floss, I always have a pack with me, what more needs to be said :P</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a brand that one can become loyal to quite easily.</li>
            <li>This is decent floss, it has a nice flavor, it tastes like spearmint gum.</li>
            <li>I purchaed Reach Clean Burst Dental Floss to see if it worked better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this dental floss because it glides through the teeth easily and leaves mouth feeling minty fresh.</li>
            <li>This floss cleans between my teeth easily with a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This reach clean burst floss&lt;</li>
            <li>This floss is strong and just the right thickness and does the job.</li>
            <li>I love this classic floss!</li>
            <li>&quot; dental floss made by Johnson &amp; Johnson for many years, and noticed the thickness of the filaments: They are getting thinner, and thus, much easier to get frayed.</li>
            <li>I just prefer dental floss that glides far more easily in between the gum and teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mint scent on this is very strong and i been using it for a long time and still has plenty more to go.</li>
            <li>These came quickly, but I am giving a 3 star for the fraying and getting stuck.</li>
            <li>This floss is perfect for daily use and it a fraction of the cost compared to the local Target!</li>
            <li>Since I have dental problems, having floss around that&#x27;s easy to use is a big deal,  This is reasonably priced, and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Packing could be more environmentally conscious</li>
            <li>Wish Johnson and Johnson would make their labels/packaging more clear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to a different kind now.</li>
            <li>and minty fresh.</li>
            <li>In addition, on more than one of these the roll of floss has come completely out of the box along with the cutter mechanism.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d listen to him, but I just bought whatever over the years, right?  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the right thickness, shape, flavor, etc.  </li>
            <li>Good buy - good floss - can &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; the slight minty flavor which is pleasant - does tend to slightly shred on my sharp tooth edges</li>
            <li>The flavor is good, not very strong.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of getting into tight spaces within my teeth.</li>
            <li>but they are good and much cheaper than the drugstore or the other leading brands.</li>
            <li>It is thin, easily splits, and isn&#x27;t terribly pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, smooth feeling, yet it is strong enough that the fibers in the floss strand don&#x27;t come apart as I&#x27;m flossing tight spots.  </li>
            <li>Finally found my favorite floss again.</li>
            <li>My teeth are pretty close together.  </li>
            <li>This is simple wax thread, nothing more.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and luxurious to use, so far as flosses go.</li>
            <li>Reach dental floss is so far the best I&#x27;ve used, not slippery, very durable and not too thick for kids.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I have pretty close together teeth, and it never snags.  </li>
            <li>The only real downside is that it will easily shred if you try to clean it perpendicularly, across the floss.</li>
            <li>There are other flavors of this floss, but the cleanburst is the best, and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find, so I was really excited when I saw amazon had it.  </li>
            <li>Wow- talk about fresh!</li>
            <li>It glidese back and forth ver smoothly with a fresh taste of mint.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty much all I like about this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usually a little cheaper in stores, but this is still way cheaper than most floss!</li>
            <li>There is another product for double the quantity, but this suits me fine.</li>
            <li>not as flat but still easy to use.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are really compacted.. or close together</li>
            <li>And the shipping was quite fast.</li>
            <li>I like the dental floss but discovered I paid way too much purchasing from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Now I won&#x27;t be wasting so much floss.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize there was much of a diff in dental floss except for flavored and not flavored.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected for such cheap flouse.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>But I really like this product</li>
            <li>Nothing unusual.  </li>
            <li>By the way, I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because, really, how can you &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; floss?</li>
            <li>She suggested I floss really, really well with the one I had been using then</li>
            <li>really annoys me about this product</li>
            <li>Ever use floss and it glides too gently you wonder if it even picked up anything?</li>
            <li>Only it does not glide as smoothly as some.</li>
            <li>The cleanburst mint flavor leaves your mouth a nice subtle minty fresh.</li>
            <li>Well this is gently waxed but definitely can clean your teeth well.</li>
            <li>but it must be less than most that are advertised as waxed.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is strong, can fit between tight spaces, and yet also cleans larger gaps well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest you try this.</li>
            <li>This is one of those staples you don&#x27;t realize you need until you run out, then are mystified at the high price and dismal selection at whatever store</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did; it&#x27;s cheaper, and it&#x27;s green (the colour</li>
            <li>When are people going to realize that &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; and other teflon-coated products slide between your teeth easily, but DON&#x27;T actually remove very much gunk from between your teeth?  </li>
            <li>And Reach usually has a coupon out--before the coupon was for $1 off one, making the floss free!  </li>
            <li>Go to your local grocery store to get the exact same Reach Clean Burst dental floss and same some money.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great deal on the package too because dental floss can be strangely expensive when purchased individually!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft not course and makes flossing not seem like a hassle belive it or not</li>
            <li>You only break the plastic when you&#x27;re ready to use it.</li>
            <li>This is old fashioned floss.  </li>
            <li>However, I had no trouble with the floss tearing.</li>
            <li>It is soft and doesn&#x27;t damage my gums.</li>
            <li>Fresh minty taste, fairly wide strands.  </li>
            <li>Yes this is more expensive, but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>you hate mint or awesome things</li>
            <li>Not fine enough, but still OK to use.</li>
            <li>It has become very difficult for me to find in local stores, so I was happy to find it on Amazon in a multi-pack for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Actually, I was looking for the large size dental floss, and could not find it anywhere locally.  </li>
            <li>This floss shreds easily and becomes very slippery - very hard to floss the back teeth with this product.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it wasn&#x27;t the right type for my teeth which are fairly tight.</li>
            <li>Complete and utter</li>
            <li>I have to be super careful or else risk having floss fibers jammed between my teeth as it tears apart.  </li>
            <li>The floss is thick enough so it won&#x27;t break easily and waxed</li>
            <li>It is not too thick, but still strong enough to do the work.</li>
            <li>The wax makes it glide through my very tight contacts between my teeth, and the burst of flavor makes my mouth feel so fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>but one lost its cutter not long after I used it.</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I expected when I expected it.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great price!</li>
            <li> The taste is great too !!</li>
            <li> The size is perfect for home or travel use too!</li>
            <li> It comes just as it says and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Awesome.</li>
            <li> This is the best dental floss I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Cleans between my teeth the best of any dental floss I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a happy camper to have some again!</li>
            <li> The taste is very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> (Because guess what, teflon is non-stick, which doesn&#x27;t make it ideal for gunk removal.)  </li>
            <li> The spearmint is wonderful and I like the cinnamon one even more!  </li>
            <li> The seller was great</li>
            <li> so this is actually really great that there&#x27;s 4 that I&#x27;m purchasing instead of one.</li>
            <li> Great floss.</li>

            <li> I am always in need of floss and this is great for the price.</li>
            <li> The product is great.</li>
            <li> I think they have lowered the coupon amount to $1 off two, but 50 cents for one is still a great price.</li>
            <li> If you need floss and don&#x27;t mind waiting for it, this is a great way to get it.</li>
            <li> Great price either.</li>
            <li> The price is attractive.</li>

            <li> Good floss to use.</li>
            <li> Good price too.</li>

            <li> Does a good job.</li>
            <li> Good price for quanity, I like it alot.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> This is not the one I used to buy, the reason I bought this is that the price is good.</li>
            <li> Good strength and I like the minty hint.</li>
            <li> The price was good.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good floss.</li>
            <li> but this is still a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this floss.</li>
            <li> is that I can&#x27;t get a good grip when I use it.</li>
            <li> This is good quality for a good price.</li>
            <li> Reach Clean Burst Dental Floss is the best Dental Floss I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> a good buy Subscribe and save more !</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best floss ever created and has a powerful minty flavor to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These were nice and a good price when I bough them- $1 for one</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth, feels good, nice stuff.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side - it smells nice and has a good taste</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The mint flavoring is delightful and the floss does such a great job.  </li>
            <li> so I have perfect straight teeth).</li>
            <li> Nice minty flavor.  </li>
            <li> The floss leaves a nice minty taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> like some floss does which is nice.</li>
            <li> The minty flavor is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Has a good taste, easily gets between the teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super inexpensive, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> The string breaks and gets stuck in my teeth very easily.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very easy to break and works as you&#x27;d expect it to.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was giving these away, bought alot they work fine, good name, reach</li>
            <li> i agree with J&amp;J that is more effective.  </li>
            <li> Go get the Plackers floss thingies instead --- they never break, and since getting them I&#x27;ve been a consistent and happy flosser.</li>
            <li> This floss is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t cut your gums and when done leaves a clean pleasant taste in your mouth</li>
            <li> We love the waxed floss.  </li>
            <li> and this makes it so that many floss just gets stuck or just</li>
            <li> It is my favorite floss</li>
            <li> Love me some waxed dental floss.</li>
            <li> I love having a lot of it around, a feeling of security :)</li>
            <li> And it has a minty quality to it which is refreshing for the mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using J&amp;J Reach floss for many years.</li>
            <li> Not the awesome Total Care Floss that rocks my world.</li>
            <li> Floss that breaks creates more problems than it solves.</li>
            <li> Sure am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> The quality is excellent, and I have a couple extra now, so I will not run out of it anytime soon.</li>
            <li> If you have gaps between teeth and want to dig out more in one try, this is it.</li>
            <li> my teeth would get a space more and more if i use it everyday.&lt;br</li>
            <li> let me know if you find a better one though.</li>
            <li> Being able to buy it in bulk saves me money and gas running to the store when I run out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was amazed at how much more this cleaned from my teeth and have never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have used a number of different dental flosses in search of the perfect one.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I have used better ones for sure.</li>
            <li> The floss is more durable .Overall</li>
            <li> Everyone loves glide, but I feel like this cleans so much better.  </li>
            <li> I love this floss.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my all time favorite</li>
            <li> This is an excellent deal for a four-pack of Reach brand floss at a generic sale price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a refreshing surprise to have the minty flavor as you floss.</li>
            <li> Very nice and fast.  </li>
            <li> Does the job pretty good.  </li>
            <li> and it is some pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li> it works just fine, works like floss lol, but in all seriousness it a decent product.</li>
            <li> For most people this floss may be fine</li>
            <li> It is true that the floss does tear very easily.</li>
            <li> I guess Johnson &amp; Johnson made the floss cheap so that you would have to go and purchase more.</li>
            <li> gosh this so such a good quality and deal!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s the only thing I can say good about the product!  </li>
            <li> Floss breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> so it goes between the teeth easily.  </li>
            <li> have bunch of these lying around everywhere, bedroom, living room, bathroom and even in the office for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;Buy in packs and save money.</li>
            <li> Buying in bulk makes sure I don&#x27;t run out and that I maintain clean teeth.</li>
            <li> I like the tape shape which makes easy to use.</li>
            <li> Does the job and easily.</li>
            <li> This does seem to clean better than glide.  </li>
            <li> It does shred easily and gets stuck between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this floss as it cleans well and is easy to see to dispose of after cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> It shreds easily and it not made of quality.</li>
            <li> Hands down THE best dental floss anywhere!</li>
            <li> The best thing about it is the cost, which is usually about a dollar at most brick-and-mortar stores.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery and pack of 4, why not for a deal!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite floss!</li>
            <li> I love this floss , the other kinds shred too easy from my teeth as they are so close together !!!</li>
            <li> Great flavor but the 55 yards is too short.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value, probably about the same price as Walmart!</li>
            <li> Went for cheap floss, and received cheap floss.  </li>
            <li> (cheap)</li>
            <li> I really like this kind of shopping.</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t used much of this since I bought it</li>
            <li> and I have used almost all of the products available .</li>
            <li> I like this floss, not my favorite but definitely tastes good and does the job</li>
            <li> dunno, I think is kind of fun, haha :)&lt;</li>
            <li> BUT as far as floss goes this is good stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just good old run-of-the-mill floss.</li>
            <li> Great floss, leaves teeth feeling extra clean.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, not much i can say about dental floss, I always have a pack with me, what more needs to be said :P</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brand that one can become loyal to quite easily.</li>
            <li> This is decent floss, it has a nice flavor, it tastes like spearmint gum.</li>
            <li> I purchaed Reach Clean Burst Dental Floss to see if it worked better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this dental floss because it glides through the teeth easily and leaves mouth feeling minty fresh.</li>
            <li> This floss cleans between my teeth easily with a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This reach clean burst floss&lt;</li>
            <li> This floss is strong and just the right thickness and does the job.</li>
            <li> I love this classic floss!</li>
            <li> &quot; dental floss made by Johnson &amp; Johnson for many years, and noticed the thickness of the filaments: They are getting thinner, and thus, much easier to get frayed.</li>
            <li> I just prefer dental floss that glides far more easily in between the gum and teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mint scent on this is very strong and i been using it for a long time and still has plenty more to go.</li>
            <li> These came quickly, but I am giving a 3 star for the fraying and getting stuck.</li>
            <li> This floss is perfect for daily use and it a fraction of the cost compared to the local Target!</li>
            <li> Since I have dental problems, having floss around that&#x27;s easy to use is a big deal,  This is reasonably priced, and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Packing could be more environmentally conscious</li>
            <li> Wish Johnson and Johnson would make their labels/packaging more clear.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to a different kind now.</li>
            <li> and minty fresh.</li>
            <li> In addition, on more than one of these the roll of floss has come completely out of the box along with the cutter mechanism.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d listen to him, but I just bought whatever over the years, right?  </li>
            <li> This stuff is the right thickness, shape, flavor, etc.  </li>
            <li> Good buy - good floss - can &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; the slight minty flavor which is pleasant - does tend to slightly shred on my sharp tooth edges</li>
            <li> The flavor is good, not very strong.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of getting into tight spaces within my teeth.</li>
            <li> but they are good and much cheaper than the drugstore or the other leading brands.</li>
            <li> It is thin, easily splits, and isn&#x27;t terribly pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice, smooth feeling, yet it is strong enough that the fibers in the floss strand don&#x27;t come apart as I&#x27;m flossing tight spots.  </li>
            <li> Finally found my favorite floss again.</li>
            <li> My teeth are pretty close together.  </li>
            <li> This is simple wax thread, nothing more.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and luxurious to use, so far as flosses go.</li>
            <li> Reach dental floss is so far the best I&#x27;ve used, not slippery, very durable and not too thick for kids.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have pretty close together teeth, and it never snags.  </li>
            <li> The only real downside is that it will easily shred if you try to clean it perpendicularly, across the floss.</li>
            <li> There are other flavors of this floss, but the cleanburst is the best, and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find, so I was really excited when I saw amazon had it.  </li>
            <li> Wow- talk about fresh!</li>
            <li> It glidese back and forth ver smoothly with a fresh taste of mint.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty much all I like about this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually a little cheaper in stores, but this is still way cheaper than most floss!</li>
            <li> There is another product for double the quantity, but this suits me fine.</li>
            <li> not as flat but still easy to use.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are really compacted.. or close together</li>
            <li> And the shipping was quite fast.</li>
            <li> I like the dental floss but discovered I paid way too much purchasing from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Now I won&#x27;t be wasting so much floss.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize there was much of a diff in dental floss except for flavored and not flavored.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected for such cheap flouse.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> But I really like this product</li>
            <li> Nothing unusual.  </li>
            <li> By the way, I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because, really, how can you &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; floss?</li>
            <li> She suggested I floss really, really well with the one I had been using then</li>
            <li> really annoys me about this product</li>
            <li> Ever use floss and it glides too gently you wonder if it even picked up anything?</li>
            <li> Only it does not glide as smoothly as some.</li>
            <li> The cleanburst mint flavor leaves your mouth a nice subtle minty fresh.</li>
            <li> Well this is gently waxed but definitely can clean your teeth well.</li>
            <li> but it must be less than most that are advertised as waxed.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is strong, can fit between tight spaces, and yet also cleans larger gaps well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest you try this.</li>
            <li> This is one of those staples you don&#x27;t realize you need until you run out, then are mystified at the high price and dismal selection at whatever store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did; it&#x27;s cheaper, and it&#x27;s green (the colour</li>
            <li> When are people going to realize that &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; and other teflon-coated products slide between your teeth easily, but DON&#x27;T actually remove very much gunk from between your teeth?  </li>
            <li> And Reach usually has a coupon out--before the coupon was for $1 off one, making the floss free!  </li>
            <li> Go to your local grocery store to get the exact same Reach Clean Burst dental floss and same some money.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great deal on the package too because dental floss can be strangely expensive when purchased individually!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft not course and makes flossing not seem like a hassle belive it or not</li>
            <li> You only break the plastic when you&#x27;re ready to use it.</li>
            <li> This is old fashioned floss.  </li>
            <li> However, I had no trouble with the floss tearing.</li>
            <li> It is soft and doesn&#x27;t damage my gums.</li>
            <li> Fresh minty taste, fairly wide strands.  </li>
            <li> Yes this is more expensive, but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> you hate mint or awesome things</li>
            <li> Not fine enough, but still OK to use.</li>
            <li> It has become very difficult for me to find in local stores, so I was happy to find it on Amazon in a multi-pack for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I was looking for the large size dental floss, and could not find it anywhere locally.  </li>
            <li> This floss shreds easily and becomes very slippery - very hard to floss the back teeth with this product.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it wasn&#x27;t the right type for my teeth which are fairly tight.</li>
            <li> Complete and utter</li>
            <li> I have to be super careful or else risk having floss fibers jammed between my teeth as it tears apart.  </li>
            <li> The floss is thick enough so it won&#x27;t break easily and waxed</li>
            <li> It is not too thick, but still strong enough to do the work.</li>
            <li> The wax makes it glide through my very tight contacts between my teeth, and the burst of flavor makes my mouth feel so fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> but one lost its cutter not long after I used it.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I expected when I expected it.</li>
            <li> Yes, I know how tempting it is do shopping with Amazon with a few clicks but ,for this particularly product, pick it up at your local store.</li>
            <li> Price a little high with shipping costs.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but the bright green color is somewhat unappealing and artificial.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I twirl it around my fingers to the point that I&#x27;m very close to cutting my blood circulation!</li>
            <li> Other users have complained that these thin filaments fray easily, and they are (100%) right.</li>
            <li> This is average as far as floss goes.  </li>
            <li> It runs easily through my awkward teeth without breaking while still having a slight subtle tackiness which makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe how long I ignored this product.</li>
            <li> This is my dental floss now, for as long as it will be on the market.</li>
            <li> Overall, it was cheaper to buy them here in bulk than to buy at Walmart or other discount stores.</li>
            <li> This floss is made of yarn that is coated with wax; it is heavily coated, which allows the floss to glide easily without irritating your gums.</li>
            <li> I was clearly being lazy buying</li>
            <li> This product is too thick for normal teeth (i.e. my teeth).</li>
            <li> The ribbon dental floss I was used previously would break on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this without realizing, then ended up with tiny little floss shreds stuck in my teeth.</li>
            <li> 6 boxes of floss- as expected</li>
            <li> Maybe because I have gaps in between my teeth (not really, I had braces when I was a teenager</li>
            <li> This product works as expected.  </li>
            <li> This floss may take a few days for you to get used to if you like using pro-glide floss, as the material is very different.</li>
            <li> The floss is as I expected.</li>
            <li> But if you are careful, there&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li> Not much you can say about dental floss other than we find this to be a high-quality product.</li>
            <li> A four pack of a reliable product - Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Reach - at a cost of less than a single 55 yard pack.</li>
            <li> You should too!&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried these and my family have tried other brands and</li>
            <li> It keeps slipping!</li>
            <li> In other words, it won&#x27;t slice into your finger like a vienna sausage when you wrap it around and tug.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s floss</li>
            <li> particular variety has a strange texture, which makes it a bit difficult to pull out of the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I can&#x27;t stand is the powerful artificial mint flavor.</li>
            <li> The string shredded a little, but did not get stuck in my mouth like other flosses.</li>
            <li> Quality product and the price was one half of what I pay for two at cvs.  </li>
            <li> If you want a usable floss for less money, this works.</li>
            <li> Though it is slightly flavored, which is why I gave it a 4 instead ofa  5.</li>
            <li> Buying this way is cheaper and much less time than going out to Walmart.</li>
            <li> Made of wax coated yarn for slick gliding between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> this Reach Clean Burst Dental Floss Waxed is by far the worst I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have tight gaps between my teeth</li>
            <li> I do have some tight areas in my teeth that it seems to get  hung up on.</li>
            <li> type of floss is a little bit thicker, which I like.</li>
            <li> I sometimes get scared getting it out because it gets a little stuck-</li>
            <li> It does shred just a little</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be the extra thin gliding type floss.</li>
            <li> All of the generic brands, are just too thin, with the irony being that they break in your teeth and get stuck.</li>
            <li> The wax is not overly heavy like some others.</li>
            <li> , just gotta say, maybe it wouldn&#x27;t tear if you floss everyday.</li>
            <li> I like the scene and the green color.</li>
            <li> so these were a little too thick for me.</li>
            <li> floss, I don&#x27;t know, but don&#x27;t waste your money like I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just lazy with some stuff and don&#x27;t want to fool around with wrapping it around my fingers.</li>
            <li> But this floss is unbelievably slippery.</li>
            <li> so I usually order off Amazon.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not so slick that it slips off of your fingers while you floss.</li>
            <li> I have to wrap it around my fingers so tightly to the point of cutting off circulation just to get it taught enough to get between my teeth...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> was hard to find at the pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> I shred and break floss like crazy and this fits around middle of the pack in that regard.</li>
            <li> but nothing too negative either.  </li>
            <li> Never had a problem with the thread breaking, subtle flavor.  </li>
            <li> Really helps with bad breath but it shreds a little on my bad teeth.</li>
            <li> This is not good.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of dental work that shreds weak floss, but the glide stuff tends to also rip.  </li>
            <li> this is very thick.</li>
            <li> It is well coated in wax, not too thin, and won&#x27;t hurt the gums.</li>
            <li> I am so tired of floss that breaks or leaves fuzzy strings between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> A poor product and I will never buy this floss ever again.</li>
            <li> These packs of Reach dental floss may not be the top-of-the-line on the market, but the bundles of waxed thin filaments are made to remove food and plaque from your teeth.</li>
            <li> Unless someone comes up with dental floss made of Kevlar thread, expect these thin filaments to fray while flossing between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Seriously, what a difference!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the thin side, but not as bad as some I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that some of the shreds get left behind in your teeth so that after you floss for food particles you get to floss again to get the floss particles out.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they all suck.</li>
            <li> Dental Floss is, to me, a necessary evil.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the worst to try to break it away and pull through (back teeth).</li>
            <li> It got stuck between teeth and getting teared up which is not good and annoying and difficult.</li>
            <li> I have retarded teeth that shreds the crap out of other brands of dental floss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Reach Unflavoured Dental Floss (Waxed), and Oral-B Glide Pro Health Floss, and this product is awkward to use compared to both of them.</li>
            <li> This happens at least once a floss which is very annoying.  </li>
            <li> But it has become very difficult to obtain un-waxed floss, so I decided to try Reach out of desperation.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very difficult to get it out of my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find though</li>
            <li> /&gt;i wish i could get a refund of it!!&lt;br /&gt;bad bad..</li>
            <li> My bad.  </li>
            <li> so part of me hates it (as much as I hate flossing)</li>
            <li> The floss can shred at times, and the shredded floss can get stuck in-between your teeth, getting the shredded floss out from in-between your teeth can be annoying, you may have to brush or floss it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had the very bad misfortune of jumping on a deal for 4 of these</li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>
            <li> However, I hate the product itself!  </li>
            <li> Just awful stuff!  </li>
            <li> has to be the worst dental floss made.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unbelievable, this floss shreds and that isn&#x27;t even the worst part.  </li>
            <li> Just the worst floss ever made.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We love the waxed floss.  The taste is very pleasant.  This is a great price!</li>
            <li> I love this floss , the other kinds shred too easy from my teeth as they are so close together !!! The taste is great too !!</li>
            <li> This is a good brand of floss. It is well coated in wax, not too thin, and won&#x27;t hurt the gums.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, not much i can say about dental floss, I always have a pack with me, what more needs to be said :P</li>
            <li> Floss breaks easily.  I have to be super careful or else risk having floss fibers jammed between my teeth as it tears apart.  It&#x27;s pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> For most people this floss may be fine but I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are really compacted.. or close together and this makes it so that many floss just gets stuck or just shreds apart in my teeth. Very annoying.</li>
            <li> I like this floss, not my favorite but definitely tastes good and does the job well. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Finally found my favorite floss again. Thank you! And the shipping was quite fast. Good experience.</li>
            <li> I buy these all the time!! You should too!&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried these and my family have tried other brands and gosh this so such a good quality and deal! It&#x27;s soft not course and makes flossing not seem like a hassle belive it or not</li>
            <li> This product was as advertised.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite floss</li>
            <li> I like the dental floss but discovered I paid way too much purchasing from Amazon.  Go to your local grocery store to get the exact same Reach Clean Burst dental floss and same some money.  Yes, I know how tempting it is do shopping with Amazon with a few clicks but ,for this particularly product, pick it up at your local store.</li>
            <li> Very nice and fast.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Love me some waxed dental floss.</li>
            <li> Price a little high with shipping costs.</li>
            <li> Great product, refreshing flavor!</li>
            <li> Good product. Received on time.</li>
            <li> What can you say about dental floss??  It works.</li>
            <li> The mint flavoring is delightful and the floss does such a great job.  My family loves this stuff.  Good pricing on amazon.</li>
            <li> Quality product and the price was one half of what I pay for two at cvs.  The supply should last for months</li>
            <li> I have had worse floss, but I expected more out of this. The string breaks and gets stuck in my teeth very easily.  This happens at least once a floss which is very annoying.  These came quickly, but I am giving a 3 star for the fraying and getting stuck.</li>
            <li> The ribbon dental floss I was used previously would break on a regular basis. Perhaps it wasn&#x27;t the right type for my teeth which are fairly tight. I purchaed Reach Clean Burst Dental Floss to see if it worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, with the Reach floss, I no longer have that problem with breakage. Now I won&#x27;t be wasting so much floss. Also, the unit price (by the yard) is cheaper than what I was paying before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that would improve this product is to reduce the number of plastic dispensers for the equivalent number of yards. e.g. 110 yards in 2 dispensers or 220 yards in one dispenser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Does not break&lt;br /&gt;- Cheaper unit price (by the yard) compared to what I paid before&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Packing could be more environmentally conscious</li>
            <li> One thing that struck me was that this dental floss is actually individually packed for sanitary purposes. You only break the plastic when you&#x27;re ready to use it. Very nice touch.</li>
            <li> This floss is perfect for daily use and it a fraction of the cost compared to the local Target! The size is perfect for home or travel use too!</li>
            <li> Really helps with bad breath but it shreds a little on my bad teeth.</li>
            <li> Husband is a dentist.  You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d listen to him, but I just bought whatever over the years, right?  Then, I ran out of what was in my vanity drawer, .....so I crossed over to grab some out of his drawer to use.  Seriously, what a difference!  I didn&#x27;t realize there was much of a diff in dental floss except for flavored and not flavored.  This stuff is the right thickness, shape, flavor, etc.  You can see that I&#x27;m sold.  I got on Amazon the next day, and ordered a LOT of this stuff.  Everyone in this house will be set for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Since I have dental problems, having floss around that&#x27;s easy to use is a big deal,  This is reasonably priced, and does a good job.  I love having a lot of it around, a feeling of security :)</li>
            <li> These were nice and a good price when I bough them- $1 for one so I bought 5 or 6 of them and they lasted about 6 months.</li>
            <li> The seller was great ~ my order arrived promptly and well packaged.  However, I hate the product itself!  It splits and breaks and gets stuck between my teeth.  Just awful stuff!  I do like the minty taste but that&#x27;s the only thing I can say good about the product!  Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;waxed&amp;#34; floss, I don&#x27;t know, but don&#x27;t waste your money like I did!</li>
            <li> It comes just as it says and works perfectly.  I love this classic floss!</li>
            <li> This floss is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t cut your gums and when done leaves a clean pleasant taste in your mouth</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe how long I ignored this product. I was constantly searching for un-waxed floss because the waxed products were always too slippery for me. But it has become very difficult to obtain un-waxed floss, so I decided to try Reach out of desperation. And I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It runs easily through my awkward teeth without breaking while still having a slight subtle tackiness which makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I like this dental floss because it glides through the teeth easily and leaves mouth feeling minty fresh. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected for such cheap flouse.  Fresh minty taste, fairly wide strands.  I really like it.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> 55 yards is too short. Great flavor but the 55 yards is too short. Quick delivery and pack of 4, why not for a deal!</li>
            <li> When are people going to realize that &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; and other teflon-coated products slide between your teeth easily, but DON&#x27;T actually remove very much gunk from between your teeth?  (Because guess what, teflon is non-stick, which doesn&#x27;t make it ideal for gunk removal.)  My dentist hates the teflon-coated flosses, and told me to always buy waxed.  This floss is strong and just the right thickness and does the job.</li>
            <li> 6 boxes of floss- as expected</li>
            <li> I like the taste and how well the floss holds up under use. I think it&#x27;s a great deal on the package too because dental floss can be strangely expensive when purchased individually!</li>
            <li> I am so tired of floss that breaks or leaves fuzzy strings between my teeth.  The floss is thick enough so it won&#x27;t break easily and waxed so it goes between the teeth easily.  I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> My teeth are pretty close together.  This brand seems to do the trick without bleeding my gums nor breaking.  Like the mint flavor as well</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s floss, it seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This type of floss is a little bit thicker, which I like. It won&#x27;t be the extra thin gliding type floss. And it has a minty quality to it which is refreshing for the mouth.</li>
            <li> Work great.&lt;br /&gt;I have bunch of these lying around everywhere, bedroom, living room, bathroom and even in the office for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;Buy in packs and save money.</li>
            <li> I got this in 2012 and still have one left. I actually forgot about them for months since they were pushed to the back of my cabinet. They were packaged well but one lost its cutter not long after I used it. Overall, it was cheaper to buy them here in bulk than to buy at Walmart or other discount stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using J&amp;J Reach floss for many years. The cleanburst mint flavor leaves your mouth a nice subtle minty fresh. Buying in bulk makes sure I don&#x27;t run out and that I maintain clean teeth.</li>
            <li> This floss cleans between my teeth easily with a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Reach Clean Burst Dental Floss is the best Dental Floss I have ever used.  I highly suggest you try this.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say. Got exactly what I expected when I expected it. Good work. Keep it up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s floss. I use it to floss. Works as it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I shred and break floss like crazy and this fits around middle of the pack in that regard. What I can&#x27;t stand is the powerful artificial mint flavor. Truly makes me feel like I have a chem lab going off in my mouth.</li>
            <li> works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint scent on this is very strong and i been using it for a long time and still has plenty more to go.</li>
            <li> This brand was recommended by my oral hygienist. It works fine, but the bright green color is somewhat unappealing and artificial.</li>
            <li> I try to buy generic brands whenever possible for stuff like this. Safeway, Walgreens, etc... you name it, I&#x27;ve probably tried it. Unfortunately they all suck. All of the generic brands, are just too thin, with the irony being that they break in your teeth and get stuck. Yes this is more expensive, but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Saved me a trip to the supermarket/ Walmart. It&#x27;s a great value, probably about the same price as Walmart! Awesome.</li>
            <li> Good floss, waxed and flavored. Part of my daily brush routine.</li>
            <li> Wow- talk about fresh!</li>
            <li> This is the only dental floss we like to use. The wax is not overly heavy like some others. Not much you can say about dental floss other than we find this to be a high-quality product.</li>
            <li> Dental Floss is, to me, a necessary evil.  You need to use it but don&#x27;t need to invest in it.  This stuff does the job.  Not as good as a Teflon type product, but a heck of a lot cheaper, and after all its going in the trash when done.  If you&#x27;re concerned about what your friends think about your medicine cabinet, go upscale.  If you want a usable floss for less money, this works.</li>
            <li> Good floss to use. Good price too. I like the tape shape which makes easy to use. Totally like it.</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting something else (see review for Reach Total Care).  Wish Johnson and Johnson would make their labels/packaging more clear.  This is old fashioned floss.  Not the awesome Total Care Floss that rocks my world.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of dental work that shreds weak floss, but the glide stuff tends to also rip.  This stuff is strong, can fit between tight spaces, and yet also cleans larger gaps well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best floss ever created and has a powerful minty flavor to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hate mint or awesome things you may not like it.</li>
            <li> This is one of those staples you don&#x27;t realize you need until you run out, then are mystified at the high price and dismal selection at whatever store you happen to be at when you remember to restock this.  The solution? A four pack of a reliable product - Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Reach - at a cost of less than a single 55 yard pack.</li>
            <li> I like hygiene. I like to floss and I use a lot of floss so this is actually really great that there&#x27;s 4 that I&#x27;m purchasing instead of one. It is true that the floss does tear very easily. However, I had no trouble with the floss tearing. Maybe because I have gaps in between my teeth (not really, I had braces when I was a teenager so I have perfect straight teeth). But I really like this product, just gotta say, maybe it wouldn&#x27;t tear if you floss everyday.</li>
            <li> Does the job and easily. Great floss. You can taste the mint, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t break or catch on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Floss that breaks creates more problems than it solves. Go get the Plackers floss thingies instead --- they never break, and since getting them I&#x27;ve been a consistent and happy flosser.</li>
            <li> Stick to the unflavoured variants of dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular variety has a strange texture, which makes it a bit difficult to pull out of the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Reach Unflavoured Dental Floss (Waxed), and Oral-B Glide Pro Health Floss, and this product is awkward to use compared to both of them.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Nice minty flavor.  Does a good job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s...floss. I was clearly being lazy buying it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m glad I did; it&#x27;s cheaper, and it&#x27;s green (the colour, I have no idea where it stands in terms of environmentalist stuff), which I dunno, I think is kind of fun, haha :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered it for the second time.</li>
            <li> Actually, I was looking for the large size dental floss, and could not find it anywhere locally.  When I searched Amazon, I saw this, and ordered it, even tho&#x27; it is the smaller size.  Sure am glad I did.  The quality is excellent, and I have a couple extra now, so I will not run out of it anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores! Love it!</li>
            <li> Nothing unusual.  This product works as expected.  It&#x27;s very effective. It&#x27;s a brand that one can become loyal to quite easily.</li>
            <li> This product is too thick for normal teeth (i.e. my teeth). If you have gaps between teeth and want to dig out more in one try, this is it.</li>
            <li> This does seem to clean better than glide.  not as flat but still easy to use.  i agree with J&amp;J that is more effective.  was hard to find at the pharmacy.  great price here.</li>
            <li> Went for cheap floss, and received cheap floss.  It is thin, easily splits, and isn&#x27;t terribly pleasant to use.  However, it does remove food between teeth.  So, take your pick, price vs quality.  This one isn&#x27;t about the quality!</li>
            <li> It does shred easily and gets stuck between my teeth. I&#x27;ve switched to a different kind now.</li>
            <li> This dental floss over-excedes my expectation because it never tears or breaks when you use it . It glidese back and forth ver smoothly with a fresh taste of mint.</li>
            <li> This is the best dental floss I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great floss, leaves teeth feeling extra clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s floss... so part of me hates it (as much as I hate flossing) BUT as far as floss goes this is good stuff. Minty, fits my teeth well and does the job.</li>
            <li> This is decent floss, it has a nice flavor, it tastes like spearmint gum. This floss may take a few days for you to get used to if you like using pro-glide floss, as the material is very different. This floss is made of yarn that is coated with wax; it is heavily coated, which allows the floss to glide easily without irritating your gums. This 4 pack lasts us about 5 months with two people flossing almost daily. The floss can shred at times, and the shredded floss can get stuck in-between your teeth, getting the shredded floss out from in-between your teeth can be annoying, you may have to brush or floss it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Great flavor, tastes like spearmint gum.&lt;br /&gt;- Made of wax coated yarn for slick gliding between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The floss sometimes shreds at times and can get stuck in-between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Country of Origin: Brazil</li>
            <li> The floss leaves a nice minty taste in your mouth. The string shredded a little, but did not get stuck in my mouth like other flosses. This floss gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I like this floss as it cleans well and is easy to see to dispose of after cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth, feels good, nice stuff.  Good price for quanity, I like it alot.  Great floss....Really Great Floss. Yes.</li>
            <li> Here is the haiku I composed about this floss:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reach clean burst floss&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t shred too easily&lt;br /&gt;Nice and minty fresh.</li>
            <li> This product works.  Never had a problem with the thread breaking, subtle flavor.  It just works.  No need to go for anything fancy here, anything more expensive is just paying for marketing.  This is simple wax thread, nothing more.</li>
            <li> this is very thick. my teeth would get a space more and more if i use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;i wish i could get a refund of it!!&lt;br /&gt;bad bad..</li>
            <li> REACH has always worked well for me.  It&#x27;s a good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> this product seems too waxy. In addition, on more than one of these the roll of floss has come completely out of the box along with the cutter mechanism.  they don&#x27;t seem to want to stay in place.</li>
            <li> This is not the one I used to buy, the reason I bought this is that the price is good. Not fine enough, but still OK to use.</li>
            <li> Does the job pretty good.  It isn&#x27;t very easy to break and works as you&#x27;d expect it to.  Though it is slightly flavored, which is why I gave it a 4 instead ofa  5.</li>
            <li> it works just fine, works like floss lol, but in all seriousness it a decent product. let me know if you find a better one though. (cheap)</li>
            <li> Being able to buy it in bulk saves me money and gas running to the store when I run out.</li>
            <li> Been using this floss for years. Good strength and I like the minty hint. Buying this way is cheaper and much less time than going out to Walmart. By the way, I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because, really, how can you &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; floss?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure why I&#x27;m rating this five star, but rating it any lower just seemed like I&#x27;d have to justify myself on what was wrong with it. It&#x27;s just good old run-of-the-mill floss. Has a great minty taste. It is soft and doesn&#x27;t damage my gums. It is comfortable and luxurious to use, so far as flosses go.</li>
            <li> Good buy - good floss - can &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; the slight minty flavor which is pleasant - does tend to slightly shred on my sharp tooth edges</li>
            <li> I was low on dental floss, I needed some, and couldn&#x27;t be bothered to go to the store to get some. LOL. So I found this valu-pak and bought it.</li>
            <li> I am always in need of floss and this is great for the price. There is another product for double the quantity, but this suits me fine.</li>
            <li> An hygenist suggested it to me.  I&#x27;ve used several different types of floss over the years.  She suggested I floss really, really well with the one I had been using then floss with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at how much more this cleaned from my teeth and have never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might be too dense for someone who has teeth too close together, but it&#x27;s a dream for me.</li>
            <li> The floss is as I expected. We&#x27;ve used this floss regularly for years. It arrived timely and packed well. The price was good.</li>
            <li> The product is great. It was packaged well and I don&#x27;t have to go to the store. I really like this kind of shopping.</li>
            <li> This is average as far as floss goes.  Nothing remarkable about it but nothing too negative either.  The best thing about it is the cost, which is usually about a dollar at most brick-and-mortar stores.  And Reach usually has a coupon out--before the coupon was for $1 off one, making the floss free!  I think they have lowered the coupon amount to $1 off two, but 50 cents for one is still a great price.</li>
            <li> The product came on time and was packaged well.  I had no problems with it.  If you need floss and don&#x27;t mind waiting for it, this is a great way to get it.</li>
            <li> This is not good. It got stuck between teeth and getting teared up which is not good and annoying and difficult.</li>
            <li> I floss religiously and this floss does not make me want to floss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a number of different dental flosses in search of the perfect one.&lt;br /&gt;and this Reach Clean Burst Dental Floss Waxed is by far the worst I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait till I finish all four of them to move on to the next kind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get the job done for flossing between my teeth but it&#x27;s very difficult to get it out of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It hurts almost.  I do not recommend.  I have used better ones for sure.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000GGHS0S Johnson &amp; Johnson Reach Floss, Cleanburst, Spearmint, Waxed]]&lt;br /&gt;This has to be the worst dental floss made. It shreds easily and it not made of quality. I guess Johnson &amp; Johnson made the floss cheap so that you would have to go and purchase more. A poor product and I will never buy this floss ever again.</li>
            <li> I added this to my monthly subscriptions on a whim but they are good and much cheaper than the drugstore or the other leading brands. The floss is more durable .Overall a good buy Subscribe and save more !</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t used much of this since I bought it but it&#x27;s good floss. I&#x27;m just lazy with some stuff and don&#x27;t want to fool around with wrapping it around my fingers. I think I&#x27;ll go with the floss picks next time but this is still a good product at a good price. 55 yards should last a while.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this floss. I am freak about dental hygiene and I have used almost all of the products available . This one definitely stands out .</li>
            <li> Has a good taste, easily gets between the teeth but still I get the feeling that it cleans well. Great price either. This is my dental floss now, for as long as it will be on the market.</li>
            <li> Reach dental floss is so far the best I&#x27;ve used, not slippery, very durable and not too thick for kids. The price is attractive.</li>
            <li> I like the minty flavor. That&#x27;s pretty much all I like about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tight gaps between my teeth so these were a little too thick for me. I sometimes get scared getting it out because it gets a little stuck- I feel like I&#x27;m going to pull my teeth out at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really annoys me about this product is that I can&#x27;t get a good grip when I use it. It keeps slipping! No matter how many times I twirl it around my fingers to the point that I&#x27;m very close to cutting my blood circulation! This didn&#x27;t happen with Oral-B waxed floss..</li>
            <li> This is good quality for a good price. This does not split into smaller threads like some floss does which is nice.</li>
            <li> These packs of Reach dental floss may not be the top-of-the-line on the market, but the bundles of waxed thin filaments are made to remove food and plaque from your teeth. Other users have complained that these thin filaments fray easily, and they are (100%) right. I have been using these \\&quot;teensy weensy\\&quot; dental floss made by Johnson &amp; Johnson for many years, and noticed the thickness of the filaments: They are getting thinner, and thus, much easier to get frayed. Unless someone comes up with dental floss made of Kevlar thread, expect these thin filaments to fray while flossing between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Please disregard all the following (after completion of this paragraph) please.  I mistakenly was using a different floss than what I purchased here at Amazon.  Just realized my mistake when I went to throw it all out.  That&#x27;s when I discovered this floss from Amazon wasn&#x27;t even opened yet.  My bad.  I&#x27;ve now actually used this floss and it is some pretty good stuff.  It does shred just a little but it doesn&#x27;t come apart.  I would recommend and I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable, this floss shreds and that isn&#x27;t even the worst part.  The worst part is that some of the shreds get left behind in your teeth so that after you floss for food particles you get to floss again to get the floss particles out.  Complete and utter FAIL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the very bad misfortune of jumping on a deal for 4 of these so I get to throw 3 1/2 of them in the trash.  For some reason, Amazon&#x27;s return policy only lasts 45 days on this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid, you&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
            <li> Maybe mine is defective.. But this floss is unbelievably slippery. I have to wrap it around my fingers so tightly to the point of cutting off circulation just to get it taught enough to get between my teeth... And it still slips. And then it shreds. Just the worst floss ever made.</li>
            <li> Cleans between my teeth the best of any dental floss I&#x27;ve used. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Ever use floss and it glides too gently you wonder if it even picked up anything? Well this is gently waxed but definitely can clean your teeth well.</li>
            <li> This floss shreds easily and becomes very slippery - very hard to floss the back teeth with this product. On the plus side - it smells nice and has a good taste</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite floss! It&#x27;s super inexpensive, but it works great.  Everyone loves glide, but I feel like this cleans so much better.  I have pretty close together teeth, and it never snags.  There are other flavors of this floss, but the cleanburst is the best, and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find, so I was really excited when I saw amazon had it.  It&#x27;s usually a little cheaper in stores, but this is still way cheaper than most floss!</li>
            <li> I like it alright . It does a good job of getting into tight spaces within my teeth. Only it does not glide as smoothly as some. I know it says waxed but it must be less than most that are advertised as waxed.  I do have some tight areas in my teeth that it seems to get  hung up on. It does work .... eventually.  I just prefer dental floss that glides far more easily in between the gum and teeth.</li>
            <li> It is not too thick, but still strong enough to do the work. I like the scene and the green color.</li>
            <li> Hands down THE best dental floss anywhere! Very difficult to find though so I usually order off Amazon. I use ALOT of floss!!</li>
            <li> This is great floss.  It has a nice, smooth feeling, yet it is strong enough that the fibers in the floss strand don&#x27;t come apart as I&#x27;m flossing tight spots.  The minty flavor is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I love this floss.  The spearmint is wonderful and I like the cinnamon one even more!  It has become very difficult for me to find in local stores, so I was happy to find it on Amazon in a multi-pack for a reasonable price.  The wax makes it glide through my very tight contacts between my teeth, and the burst of flavor makes my mouth feel so fresh after using it. This is the only floss that makes me actually WANT to floss every day, and I hope J&amp;J never stops making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to say that it&#x27;s been YEARS since I&#x27;ve found the cinnamon one in local stores. It&#x27;s my all time favorite and I&#x27;m a happy camper to have some again!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent deal for a four-pack of Reach brand floss at a generic sale price. The flavor is good, not very strong. It&#x27;s a little on the thin side, but not as bad as some I&#x27;ve tried. In other words, it won&#x27;t slice into your finger like a vienna sausage when you wrap it around and tug. And it&#x27;s not so slick that it slips off of your fingers while you floss. The only real downside is that it will easily shred if you try to clean it perpendicularly, across the floss. I&#x27;ve done this without realizing, then ended up with tiny little floss shreds stuck in my teeth. But if you are careful, there&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li> I have retarded teeth that shreds the crap out of other brands of dental floss. With J&amp;J Reach I can floss without snagging on my fangs.</li>
            <li> I prefer this floss over others because it is thicker and doesn&#x27;t cut into my gums like others do. It&#x27;s also a refreshing surprise to have the minty flavor as you floss. It doesn&#x27;t break at all but I have noticed for my teeth that are closer together, it&#x27;s gotten caught a couple of times and it&#x27;s the worst to try to break it away and pull through (back teeth). This doesn&#x27;t bother me but might bother others so I&#x27;ll mention that the waxy flavor / thickness is a bit sticky on your fingers. Other than that, it&#x27;s floss and it does its job.</li>
            <li> Amazon was giving these away, bought alot they work fine, good name, reach does it job. But you cant beat the price</li>
