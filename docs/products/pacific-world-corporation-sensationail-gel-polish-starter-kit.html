            <li>(Still loving the system btw!)</li>
            <li>(Still loving the system btw!)</li>
            <li>I bought Sally Hanson gel polish because they had some nice colors, however the polish chipped and peeled after 2 days, every time I&#x27;ve used them!</li>
            <li>Nice color!</li>
            <li>If you can paint your nails you can successfully create a salon quality gel manicure at home</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with results!</li>
            <li>Not as good as OPI but a great deal</li>
            <li>The shine is spectacular!  </li>
            <li>I was much more impressed with Nailene than with the RCM.</li>
            <li>Love the product, great colours!</li>
            <li>Very happy :)</li>
            <li>Def a Must have if you Love your nails flawless!</li>
            <li>Love love... !!!</li>
            <li>Worth it!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to do and my manicure has been perfect for 10 days!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and looks great!  </li>
            <li>I am fine with the removal if i can get a two week perfect manicure</li>
            <li>A good investment instead of paying salon prices every 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Along with the quality being good, you&#x27;ll also save yourself tons of money.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li>looks just as good as salon</li>
            <li>She loved it.  </li>
            <li>This product and this system (gel) fit my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li>I use a good hand moisturizer on the night between manicures to replenish the moisture that the acetone takes</li>
            <li>Soak for about 15 minutes and you are good.</li>
            <li>(good deal seeing that each shellac manicure is about $30).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll take a couple of times to start getting good at it</li>
            <li>/&gt;After14 days this product still looked quite good.</li>
            <li>The hand with all the SensatioNAIL products (but using the color and LED light from SH) is PERFECT.</li>
            <li>I hope I get good results.  </li>
            <li>It was a good price for what all I received.  </li>
            <li>The sensationail scraper is a good product.  </li>
            <li>However, the Sensationail polish lasts until I feel it has grown out from looking good</li>
            <li>The polish on my toe nails has been on for 5 weeks now and it looks as good as the day I applied it.</li>
            <li>I had my nails done at a salon a couple weeks ago, and I honestly think I did much better on myself at home with this kit!!</li>
            <li>Be sure they look good before you cure!  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and my nails look great after 18 days today.</li>
            <li>A really great kit and very easy to use</li>
            <li>This helps tremendously to provide for the best opportunity for a good result.</li>
            <li>it is so easy!!  </li>
            <li>The polish cures in 60 seconds as the instructions state and shine beautifully after using the top coat and gel cleanser.  </li>
            <li>9 full days of wet-glossy, absolutely perfect looking nails, and</li>
            <li>:when you buy Sensational nail polish it comes in a .25 fl oz bottle @ 11.99/</li>
            <li>I am a tremendous skeptic but have been very happy with this kit.</li>
            <li>Also, Sensationail has the best customer service, quick and reliable.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Great for anyone with commitment issues :)</li>

            <li>I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a beautiful soft creamy coral &#x3D; perfect for summer.</li>
            <li>, I think Sensationail is still very worthwhile.</li>
            <li>The finish is strong and has a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li>The color is great and very true to what is shown on the box.  </li>
            <li>sure you remove any gel polish you get on your skin before using the LED lamp!</li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed with the UV lamp -</li>
            <li>I have had my first application on for two weeks now and besides my outgrowth my nails look perfect still.  </li>
            <li>Love this kit!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>You will love doing your nails gel style!</li>
            <li>The best way to avoid this is to swirl the brush around the inside of the bottle to remove excess polish first.</li>
            <li>Love this Kit!</li>
            <li>Once this problem was solved,i I have to say I love this product!</li>
            <li>This is my first gel nail system and it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li>But then after putting the nails under the light they come out looking beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>I really love the color!</li>
            <li>once you have the lamp, i don&#x27;t see why you cant buy creative nail designs shellac or whatever brand you like (through amazon) products in largr sizes with the lamp you already have now !</li>

            <li>The light does a great job curing the gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Led light works great.</li>
            <li>I own the nail wraps</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t let it deter you from this kit as the lamp is really nice.</li>
            <li>i have always kind of slopped polish on knowing the shower would wash away they excess,</li>
            <li>Does a nice job.</li>
            <li>The methods I tried was to soak the fingers in warm acetone and another time using the foil wraps.  </li>
            <li>Nice UV</li>
            <li>Let your nails grow out or do your own fills.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>If you try this method make sure you have a good surface to work with and a glass bowl.</li>
            <li>If you try this method make sure you have a good surface to work with and a glass bowl.</li>
            <li>the polish didn&#x27;t look nice, it like shrank on my nail.  </li>
            <li>Kind of hit and miss product quality in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This is a nice convenient and affordable way to keep your nails looking nice at home.</li>
            <li>It came with all you need for a nice gel manicure</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll get better at it in time, but it looks good</li>
            <li>And get this they can ship a hazardous item as nail polish</li>
            <li>sometimes if its not as nice as I would like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this.</li>
            <li>Nice coverage.  </li>
            <li>Rather, it kind of \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; off in layers as I used the removal tool.</li>
            <li>Novice at doing my own nails with gel.</li>
            <li>This gel polish is nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>I really liked this kit.</li>
            <li>I also really liked the color of the polish.</li>
            <li>I noticed how nice her nails are, they are shiny and look like salon done.</li>
            <li>I am by no means good at manicures or painting nails, but I was able to use this kit with no problems.</li>
            <li>I just spend $35 and can do my own nails time and time again.</li>
            <li>It looked flawless on my toes for three weeks, and only then just because my nails were growing lol.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s kind of the point, isn&#x27;t it??</li>
            <li>A nice sassy color.</li>
            <li>So if you want to get into doing your own soak off gels</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how nice they turned out and my manicure lasted about 2 weeks with the shine still there.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe a home gel manicure could look so nice.</li>
            <li>I have also found that Sensationail&#x27;s remover tool is quite handy and seems to make the polish easier to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>CVS has their own brand, cheaper and a lot of times on sale buy</li>
            <li>The color was beautiful and I really love it, but the light stopped working almost immediately.</li>
            <li>The thing I&#x27;m most impressed with is how pretty the polish looks on your nails.  </li>
            <li>You can also buy the sensational nails removal tool :)</li>
            <li>It was easy, the UV lamp was good quality, and my nails came out really nice.</li>
            <li>The UV lamp is excellent and very high quality, much better than the battery-operated lamps that some of these kits include.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End</li>
            <li>I can now have the best of both worlds, nails that last for two weeks and look good for work, and nails</li>
            <li>Product is very easy to use if you have experience painting and shaping your nails.</li>
            <li>its very easy to use (however, a lot of steps)</li>
            <li>I also find the removal is very easy contrary to what others have said of the gel polish removal.  </li>
            <li>Application was very easy.  </li>
            <li>Its very easy to do and very easy to remove off skin BEFORE curing.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the busy working woman!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love love it!</li>
            <li>Stick to sensationail polish, I would love if they came out with more colors!</li>
            <li>...be sure to check out my lovely hands in my pics!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure more will be coming!</li>
            <li>and it still works as great as it did the first time!</li>
            <li>Ok, I NEVER paint my own nails, just didn&#x27;t do it well.</li>
            <li>The led light is good and there is a timer with the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I am loving it more with each application.</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with this kit so far.</li>
            <li>far as the polish while wearing, it has been great!  </li>
            <li>great alternative that is affordable, doable, and worth the time.</li>
            <li>anyway, great product and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>and WOW this is awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy so far.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a more affordable option than the OPI one in Sephora and the color options are just amazing.</li>
            <li>As far as wear goes, this is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>I like being able to do my own nails</li>
            <li>&amp; this was the best nail purchase I&#x27;ve made by far.</li>
            <li>The best part is its so easy to put on, i love that UV lamp, no worries about smudging or not being able to use your hands till the nail polish hardens ( always a lost cause, am i right ladies?).</li>
            <li>The polish removes fairly easily!</li>
            <li>And you can change colors and often as you want, and it&#x27;s easy to take off!</li>
            <li>This is a great and complete set to get my nails done, quickly, easily and they look GREAT.  </li>
            <li>This isnt perfect for a full 14 days but pretty close.</li>
            <li>Very nice kit that I used it right away  </li>
            <li>The hand that I did with all the SH products came out very nicely, however I feel like maybe the primer helps provide better and more full coverage of the polish.</li>
            <li>I added some glitter polish to cover up my not so perfect freehand French manicure, and I am very happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li>I am a very satisfied customer since I can paint my nails, have them dry immediately, and then to look perfect for a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Final result, however, is pretty awesome considering it was my first time doing a gel manicure on my own.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product, the light, the polish, the process.  </li>
            <li>I imagine both will give you great nails that are pretty durable.</li>
            <li>I imagine both will give you great nails that are pretty durable.</li>
            <li>The process went very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It makes my nails feel nice and strong.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect perfect results the first couple of times, it takes some practice to get it right.</li>
            <li>While the outcome was beautiful it began peeling off the first time I did an easy set of dishes.  </li>
            <li>The kit is complete, works awesome, and it&#x27;s easy to do.  </li>
            <li>it loved it so much!!</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I really love them!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not too impressed with the quality of the solid polish.</li>
            <li>With more practice I am sure I will get better at it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my nails now.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>adore the lamp :)</li>
            <li>I love this kit of sensationail gel polish.</li>
            <li>I applied a bit more around the edges and capped them a bit better even if I got polish on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this kit.</li>
            <li>I hope to get more proficient</li>
            <li>soak time was really more like 20-25 minutes before I could get gel off - and it did not slide off...</li>
            <li>/&gt;6-16-15: I really am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love my nails and with 1 more manicure, my starter kit (+1 color) will have paid for itself.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>- i have received many compliments.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how forgiving the product</li>
            <li>I love having &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; looking nails, but I am NOT one to baby my nails.  </li>
            <li>(Be sure to swipe with the cleanser or rubbing alcohol to remove any residue at the end, or your nails will be sticky and not shiny.)  </li>
            <li>I have had acrylics many times and my nails are ruined afterwards.</li>
            <li>I did get some on my cuticles, but overall I am very happy and believe I&#x27;ll get better with time.</li>
            <li>I know I should have better restraint, however, I do</li>
            <li>So, I am GREATLY pleased by this product and recommend it to anyone else who is polish challenged.  </li>
            <li>I love to get my nails done</li>
            <li>:  Too many steps in application and REMOVAL is a pain in the A**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so then you soak some more, hack some more and meanwhile your fingers are wrinkly and smell like acetone not to mention what all this roughness does to the nails.  </li>
            <li>Love the light!</li>
            <li>You will love this light!</li>
            <li>and I love Sensationail nail colors, so</li>
            <li>I LOVE it and am still using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More fuzzies all over my nails.</li>
            <li>but thankfully since my nails are not set I am able to remove some of them as I am applying polish.</li>
            <li>It turns out that the polish IS set underneath the sticky layer on top and you can just wipe it away with the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure adding heat would have helped</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure adding heat would have helped</li>
            <li>The kit has more than paid for itself.</li>
            <li>I also wish they had a better selection of colors to choose from with the kit.</li>
            <li>I got the starter kit in Raspberry Wine, and I love the color.</li>
            <li>Ok, so here&#x27;s my thoughts....</li>
            <li>Try not to get any polish on your skin, and if you do, make sure you wipe it off before curing it.</li>
            <li>much better quality</li>
            <li>Some reviews mentioned there were too many steps, but considering you apply every 2 weeks instead of every 2 days</li>
            <li>I am SO glad that I invested in this kit.</li>
            <li>and I love them both.</li>
            <li>This meant I would spend lots of time changing my nail polish which in the end was more damaging than the soak off from this product.</li>
            <li>Be sure to buff off all of the shiny top coat before beginning the soak-off.</li>
            <li>I think this is more of a problem with darker colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this at home and cured my nails more than suggested since they were not setting.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to use a $2 off manufacturer&#x27;s coupon for them as well).</li>
            <li>I washed my hands and treated my nails and cuticles with my favorite oil, added my favorite hand lotion to my hands and let my nails breathe overnight.</li>
            <li>It seemed to me to probably be the most forgiving</li>
            <li>I thought perhaps I could avoid using the top coat to keep from having layers that got too thick-feeling, but after removing the tacky moisture layer from one finger after curing the raspberry wine, there was no shine.</li>
            <li>Hopefully that will also make it easier to remove without more damage to my nails till it&#x27;s all used up</li>
            <li>THOUT touching the edge.</li>

            <li>Hopefully that will also make it easier to remove without more damage to my nails till it&#x27;s all used up</li>
            <li>It is better than the gel polish they have switched to at the salon that I go to.</li>
            <li>I love getting gel polish done at the salon</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love being able to do my nails at home, and be in charge of when and how I&#x27;ll take care of my nails.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>I get to be creative and save money bc</li>
            <li>I picked most of it off just while taking my dog for a walk, then got the remainder off with the removal tool they sell at Walmart ($4.99).  </li>
            <li>I have had many compliments on my nails.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind spending the time on a perfect manicure knowing it will last two weeks.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the current color on for 3 days and it still looks awesome.</li>
            <li>Watched youtube tutorials describing how to maximize the most wear from this product.</li>
            <li>Followed these directions to a T..still chipping and peeling and the MOST I got out of these Sensationail products was three days.</li>
            <li>AT MOST.</li>
            <li>I have been using the sensationail line for over 6 months and love it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you have the removal tool for easier removal.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even embedded gems in the top coat with no problems.</li>
            <li>I love this gel polish kit.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get more colors.  </li>
            <li>While Im sure the manufacturers didn&#x27;t intend for consumers to use the product with regular nail polish, I find it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I love changing my polish often</li>
            <li>Hope this helps...for someone that never got more than a day or two of polished nails before chips appeared..</li>
            <li>Love the end results.</li>
            <li>Gel polish is a pain to remove no matter what, though.  :-)</li>
            <li>(if you apply properly, CAP EDGE OF NAIL!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMOVAL - Here is the best way to remove and it takes all of about 7 minutes of soak time.&lt;br /&gt;Soak</li>
            <li>cotton ball in acetone, put on top of nail, cover with aluminum foil (all in kit directions).  </li>
            <li>A HEATING PAD ON TOP OF YOUR SOAKING NAILS.  </li>
            <li>You should be able to just lift the polish off without having to scrape.  </li>
            <li>#34;LOVE IT&amp;#34;.  Wasn&#x27;t sure how well the gel polish would hold up on my nails.  </li>
            <li>At $49.99 a box at most local retailers, etc., this is the best kit you could ask for if you are a gel nail person.  </li>
            <li>The result was ok, but not all fingers came out like starburst pattern on box.  </li>
            <li>The lamp alone makes this purchase worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re looking for a lamp and a chance just to try out the gel polish.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product!</li>
            <li>I bought this in raspberry wine from target (because I didn&#x27;t want to wait for the shipping) and immediately I was in love.</li>
            <li>I am pleased and would recommend this to others.  </li>
            <li>If you value healthy nails</li>
            <li>and it was more like sample sizes.</li>
            <li>Nothing I did was able to remove.</li>
            <li>I love how the polish looks like I just did it.</li>
            <li>It works better when you heat the water in the microwave for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I paid $13 more.</li>
            <li>The polish comes off easier and it&#x27;s better for your hands.</li>
            <li>Spoilt by the fact that there is tax to be paid on this item before you can get it from the post office/man, more than doubled the price quoted on line.  </li>
            <li>MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>not even sure if it is a viable purchase for retailers.  </li>
            <li>The light has a built in timer which is handy.  </li>
            <li>and you need to make sure you follow the directions or</li>
            <li>I will be buying more soon</li>
            <li>still love the kit!I</li>
            <li>Love this product because it lasts and keeps me from biting my nails.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love gel nails.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this kit after a friend told me about how her and her daughter love this item.</li>
            <li>so make sure you shop around before purchasing.</li>
            <li>I got many compliments....</li>
            <li>and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE gel polish.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m finally free of the sadistic manicurists!  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s longevity is way better than the salon.</li>
            <li>My nails have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I love gel nail polish and</li>
            <li>I used the cotton ball soaked in acetone then wrapped in foil, and it took over 20 minutes to be able to get the gel off.  </li>
            <li>It was gooey for the most of a day.  </li>
            <li>My mom and I is enjoying this kit.</li>
            <li>We will buy more gel polish once we run out.</li>
            <li>and they ALL have a way better price than amazon.</li>
            <li>and I can get a lot more use out of it.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Walmart and paid about $5 more for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more colors today</li>
            <li>Pour yourself a glass of wine and watch a favorite show while you wait for the remover to work.</li>
            <li>Any more</li>
            <li>Better 2 apply 3 coats as opposed to 1 or 2 thicker ones.</li>
            <li>Try to avoid touching the polish to your skin.</li>
            <li>I receive many compliments on my nails whenever I use this product, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li>so the polish sticks better-</li>
            <li>love this product-</li>
            <li>so the base/top may be better too.  </li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>I love that there is no drying time</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad i took my chances on this.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say, I first noticed the cap wearing off after day 7 or so as well, so still remarkable wear all the way around.</li>
            <li>This time I used the rasberry wine color (very pretty) and I can say I&#x27;m still very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to save money by doing my own manicures.  </li>
            <li>The color is nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>This color is great and lasts, highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li>I received this product for $39.00 - a $20 discount and feel that this was a great price for a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Not only did I succeed at doing a manicure, it was so easy and looks so wonderful!  </li>
            <li>The manicure lasted for two weeks - looking as good as the first day.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good at home Shellac system.</li>
            <li>Anyways when I first used it I loved how it looked</li>
            <li>I bought this kit for my sister for Xmas and was surprised at how easy it was!!!</li>
            <li>They have a new tool now that looks like a scraper, costs about $5 and works GREAT in helping remove polish.</li>
            <li>They have a new tool now that looks like a scraper, costs about $5 and works GREAT in helping remove polish.</li>
            <li>Love this product, my nails are strong and it&#x27;s been 4 days and no chips, still shine like the day I put the polish on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite easy to use. :-)</li>
            <li>Easy to use, plenty of product to do many manicures.  </li>
            <li>Super nice gel nail system.</li>
            <li>The greatest boon for me is that I don&#x27;t have to wait to dry...</li>
            <li>I bought this kit specifically because I&#x27;d used a friend&#x27;s light who had this same one and thought it was the perfect one for my needs.</li>
            <li>This is great -- I never had nice looking nails before, but this polish finally changed that.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the pink chiffon and raspberry wine shades best and really love the shiny finish that lasts for the duration of my manicure and pedicure.</li>
            <li>:) Capping the nail is definitely important; I&#x27;d also add that gel polish works better on longer nails.</li>
            <li>Really, it&#x27;s much easier to schedule time for removal of still great looking polish, than to fit in time for a polish as well.</li>
            <li>I pleased that they are coming out with more colors as the original ones didn&#x27;t knock me out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to do by yourself and fun to do with friends:)</li>
            <li>Great product for those of us that would like to find a cheaper way to still have a professional look.</li>
            <li>but I do my thumbs separately for better light curing coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great so far</li>
            <li>also love the fact that this is an LED light and not UV.</li>
            <li>I use sensationail colors with gelish&#x27;s foundation and their separate top coat and my gels stay on chip free FOREVER basically until I decide to remove them.</li>
            <li>So far, 5 days and counting and my nails are as shiny and perfect as the first day.</li>
            <li>Capping is the most important step and you should do this with each cure.  </li>
            <li>I had gel nails done at a salon and loved it so much that I bought this kit to do it at home.  </li>
            <li>I took the good advice of another reviewer who said to put the primer on very sparingly.  </li>
            <li>but the kit itself was nice and it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and it comes with a quick step guide sheet.</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use, even the right hand looks ok!</li>
            <li>but they were expired, I wrote to them to let them know and within 24 hrs responded giving me new coupons that are good until July and that I can print and use as many times as I want.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My less-than-happy previous update is now replaced with me being a very happy long-term user that is quite satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>My less-than-happy previous update is now replaced with me being a very happy long-term user that is quite satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I am sure that as they get more popular they will add a bigger selection of colors, for now I will just order Pigment Gel and mix my own colors.</li>
            <li>Overall, loved the kit!  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this brand specifically because it had the best reviews out of all the other options I had.</li>
            <li>This product was super easy to use!</li>
            <li>I watched one of my favorite shows while doing this, so I had fun!</li>
            <li>Having got the salon shellac, it was easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>OMG it did NOT come off easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply if you follow the instructions provided.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal, and so much better then paying $35+ at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gel fell off so easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy as that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I get more into gel polish I may get a larger lamp but for now this is great for home use.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m not one to change colors all the time, but like my nails to look nice, I really appreciate getting more time out of each manicure before removal</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m not one to change colors all the time, but like my nails to look nice, I really appreciate getting more time out of each manicure before removal</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t buff before hand, wrap the foils on for 10 minutes and it easily scrapes off.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use once you get the hang of how to do it</li>
            <li>Directions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>easy to do</li>
            <li>so easy and no damage to my nails.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Easy to do.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are easy to understand and seemingly thorough.  </li>
            <li>Easy to do after watching the tutorial on the Nailene Sensationail website.</li>
            <li>I removed the polish today fairly easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove.</li>
            <li>It was really easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is soooo easy to apply and after two uses it pays for itselt.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed at how easy it is to get a professional-looking manicure at home with SensatioNail Gel Polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;a easy to nake at home.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Came out ugly!\\&quot; - make sure you clean your nails</li>
            <li>My nails were strong, and I had no evidence of the shellac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Taking this stuff off is kind of a pain because they just don&#x27;t lift very much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Sensationail gel polish kit if you want to have a gorgeous, affordable manicure.</li>
            <li>At first, I was thrilled with the results of this gel polish.  </li>
            <li>It comes with the full size LED lamp, with plug, and that alone makes the purchase worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>Also, you have to buff the top layer to roughen it, and then give them the full 15 minutes in the remover....</li>
            <li>This is actually really impressive considering some of the other products out there!</li>
            <li>The way that a gel mani cures so quickly, with no drying time after, is really a huge plus!  </li>
            <li>(I know a lot of people like to be pampered and go to the spa as they do not have time to DIY- which is also fine)</li>
            <li>The lamp works just fine &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent deal to get the whole kit for this price (though generally it is cheaper in stores).</li>
            <li>Turn your finger from side to side to be able to see the edges better and know exactly how close you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Turn your finger from side to side to be able to see the edges better and know exactly how close you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I do get a chip its easy to touch up since I have the light and colors at home.  </li>
            <li>yes the starter bottles are small, yes it has many steps, for some it is a pain to remove, isn&#x27;t that why WE use it.......because it is a beautiful shiny manicure!</li>
            <li>After reading reviews of this product I was slightly hesitant to purchase it, however after receiving this and using it, I am very happy that I ordered it!</li>
            <li>My manicure looks PERFECT one week later on the first try.</li>
            <li>and I had a measurable way to realize that my nails grow more quickly than I might have guessed.</li>
            <li>The variety of gel colors is more than adequate.  </li>
            <li>Since I have found out how to remove it quickly, I am giving more stars.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how long my polish lasts before chipping, but right now I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to apply and looked great on but only lasted about 3-4 days before it started peeling.</li>
            <li>The directions are incredibly easy, it takes barely any time at all, and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>I found it very easy to use and my first manicure lasted 9 days without a chip before I decided I wanted to change it</li>
            <li>I think I didn&#x27;t cap the nail perfectly and thats why it lifted, but it didn&#x27;t take me long to re-do it and the other nails looked great.</li>
            <li>Lo and behold, this wonderful little system!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied and would recommend!</li>
            <li>Heat helps speed the process too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to be able to use this product you will have to have a very steady hand and be able to keep the product off of your skin and cuticles as you work.</li>
            <li>This gives you the best \\&quot;feel\\&quot; for using the product with confidence and you&#x27;ll be able to quickly see some obvious do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts that should help you tackle the opposite (more challenging) hand.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how easy the kit was to use, and I am so excited I can do my nails now myself.  </li>
            <li>After about 6 months and a huge investment in nail polish colors the lamp no longer hardens the polish.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a huge amount of time saved that you&#x27;d otherwise spend redoing your manicure/pedicure</li>
            <li>is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li>important things to consider include:&lt;br /&gt;Follow</li>
            <li>I did put gel polish on the tip of the nail to seal it properly although I did not do a great job with it.</li>
            <li>free wipes,&lt;br /&gt;double</li>
            <li>The kit is basically the price of the purchase of a UV/LED light.</li>
            <li>I was looking at buying a cheap lamp with replaceable bulbs until I could afford a LED</li>
            <li>To remove... lightly file the surface, apply acetone on a cotton ball, wrap in foil, wait 15-20 minutes, remove and scrape away.</li>
            <li>it was when I tried forcing my nail free of my finger tip and getting a cut below my nail.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried a few but scraping it off works best for me.  </li>
            <li>We did one hand at a time and then cured with the light.</li>
            <li>The light will blink to let you know when 15 or 30 seconds are up for the curing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helpful that they give you a summarized reference card in addition to detailed instructions</li>
            <li>Take the lint free wipe, put some \\&quot;Gel</li>
            <li>You receive a buffer/filer, cleansing gel and lint free wipes, primer, the base/top coat, and polish plus the lamp.</li>
            <li>Also, the polish goes on much nicer if it&#x27;s warm</li>
            <li>It stays on great, but only for 5-8 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT POINT:</li>
            <li>bought this at Walmart for $50, it&#x27;s a great deal, especially because it has the LED lamp AND a color.  </li>
            <li>I lightly buffed off the shine.  </li>
            <li>It is also important to not get the product on your skin as some people can become allergic to gel products with repeated exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I went on the search for products cured with LED light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>Gel-ish has a free pamphlet in Sally&#x27;s stores that gives curing equivalents for LED lights</li>
            <li>Gel-ish has a free pamphlet in Sally&#x27;s stores that gives curing equivalents for LED lights</li>
            <li>Great alternative to traditional polish</li>
            <li>Manicures look great, would probably last 2 weeks</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic, comes with the light and everything you need to do up to 10 gel manicures yourself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard this light works with OPI</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li>Bought this kit today &amp; attempted to use it &amp; the LED light appears to be defective would not even turn on.</li>
            <li>I bought this on sale, the kit with the light, after soaking off acrylic, polished my nails with this.</li>
            <li>Light has automatic alarm for 30 seconds and shuts off after 60 seconds, so you don&#x27;t even need to time the curing process.  </li>
            <li>Spread it on lightly.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>it is available at Walmart for $49.99.</li>
            <li>so I ordered it online with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>tip (where I go to is cheap)</li>
            <li>Instead of soaking all my fingers in acetone, I soaked lint free pads in 100% acetone, placed on my nails and wrapped in strips of aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>I ended up seeing the Sally Hansen gel nail LED light kit in Walgreens for $69.99</li>
            <li>Always remembering to use the LED light for 30 seconds in between layers.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see what the improvement of having a 60 light would give you.</li>
            <li>The lint free wipes are re-usable, I got about 8 uses out of one.  </li>
            <li>Remember though, paper towels are also lint free and seem to work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is that I got my kit on sale with an addtional 20% off promtion and free shipping at another website.  </li>
            <li>I ordered two Gelish colors and am going to try them with this LED light.  </li>
            <li>I had better success with this than any product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>to remove if you add acetone to cotton pad, wrap in foil, put on plastic gloves, and then lightly scrape after 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I got the kit for the LED light.</li>
            <li>I use this light with Gelish, Ibd,Sally Hansons soak off gel and bluesky gels</li>
            <li>If there was one thing I could change, it would be the size of the light, but even that isn&#x27;t a huge deal to me.</li>
            <li>the polish on what was left of my nail still looked great and didn&#x27;t flake off!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>: Definitely lightly buff your nails.  </li>
            <li>You can use the lint free pads they give you</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really fantastic.</li>
            <li>The nail polish doesn&#x27;t set until you put it under the LED light-</li>
            <li>Once you put it under that light though, consider it a temporarily permanent extension of yourself.</li>
            <li>As soon as it cures in the light you can go about your day-</li>
            <li>Gelish are much better with the salon quality colors that are fun and classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheap and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s an LED light rather than UV like some.  </li>
            <li>the end, I ended up using the light but buying CND base/top coat and Gelish colors.  </li>
            <li>I will probably try Gelish base/top as the colors last great</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Gorgeous, mirror like shine, gel manicure that looks incredibly professional.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to remove it completely yet without some stripping/weakening of my own nails.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to remove it completely yet without some stripping/weakening of my own nails.</li>
            <li>I tried several brands and this one is really the best.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I immediately bought 6 more colors.</li>
            <li>And wonderful nails two weeks at least :)</li>
            <li>Gel peeled right off, I bought the \\&quot;spatula\\&quot; for $5 that Sensationail sells, but you could do it with an orange stick too, make sure you lightly buff off the shine before soaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this product, I can finally say I love my nails!!</li>
            <li>The little light thingy is awesome and keeps the time for you and truly it was a painless, smellless and quick procedure.  </li>
            <li>Using their lint free wipe, clean nails with \\&quot;Gel Cleanser\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The result after using this product could be comparable to getting acrylics but for me not nearly as painful and my nails seem fine.</li>
            <li>The application of the polish was easy and quick.</li>
            <li>Normally I would blame the shipping company for something like this but the exterior packaging was in perfect condition leading me to believe that the product was in this condition when it left the warehouse...</li>
            <li>The kit has easy to follow directions and the application time is quick.</li>
            <li>best part is that the whole kit costs less than a full set of gels :)</li>
            <li>long as you follow the steps included your results will be great.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t go out of my way to write reviews for products, but I am so impressed with this that I had to!</li>
            <li>100% worth trying!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got the time, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>and I am still using the original primer.</li>
            <li>I originally put it in plastic and it melted the plastic.</li>
            <li>I originally put it in plastic and it melted the plastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so excited to have found this product.</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive and excited to receive this product</li>
            <li>Also, gel lasts a long time and is great for any one who has to spend a lot of time typing or sorting files/filing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for myself but ended up giving it to my sister in law.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Super quick shipping&#x27; ordered on wed, got Friday!</li>
            <li>definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this set.  </li>
            <li>Fast and easy to use!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be sure to read the instructions first before you start working on your nails specially if you haven&#x27;t used this type of contraption before and don&#x27;t allow distraction while you are doing your nails.</li>
            <li>I clean them well with a $1.07 bottle of  91% alchool and papertowels ( no lint).</li>
            <li>(File, clean, etc.)</li>
            <li>Someone told me that it is not quite the same as this kind of gel product, but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li>The same person also recommended using a product called \\&quot;Nail Envy\\&quot;, which she says the pros use and is best for strengthening natural nails and preventing damage.</li>
            <li>Someone told me that it is not quite the same as this kind of gel product, but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li>The same person also recommended using a product called \\&quot;Nail Envy\\&quot;, which she says the pros use and is best for strengthening natural nails and preventing damage.</li>
            <li>I am one of those whose manicure is rarely ever perfect for more then 2 minutes after having it done - can&#x27;t ever seem to make it without getting a nick on my nails, so when the manicurist offered gel with no dry time, it was a no-brainer to try it, despite the extra $15.</li>
            <li>This nail kit is great for people who don&#x27;t like waiting for nails to dry...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still giving the product 5 stars because my nails looked amazing for days and days, and my removal troubles were most likely user error.</li>
            <li>All in all after using this product for a few months it works great for an at home kit and is definitely better than paying salon prices.</li>
            <li>As far as the light quality goes, I&#x27;ve had mine for 6 months with no issue but lets be honest, this isn&#x27;t commercial/professional grade</li>
            <li>After finishing all coats and topcoat, clean the nail with the cleaner provided or alcohol.</li>
            <li>The company offers a nice variety of additional colors if you&#x27;re like me and enjoy mixing it up a bit.</li>
            <li>it was fast and good thanks</li>
            <li>and I have discovered it can easily be covered up successfully with a darker gel color without removing the entire manicure first.</li>
            <li>For the most part the polish came off in large chunks from my nail.</li>
            <li>You have to soak your nails in pure acetone for more than 15 min.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take more effort to clean off polish but as you are not having to paint your nails as often, I don&#x27;t find it to be that much of a hardship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyone having trouble with this system isn&#x27;t very bright and didn&#x27;t read the directions.</li>
            <li>I am hard on my hands so that is impressive!</li>
            <li>I am hard on my nails and this was a great investment!  </li>
            <li>a loaded brush full of product is not your friend with gel polish.  </li>
            <li>NEVER lasts two full weeks for me.  </li>
            <li>and I can get a good ten days out of my manicure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, a better solution would help.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I really do recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I had a good 1/8 of an inch re-growth, which to me was quite enough</li>
            <li>A chunk of change, but reasonable considering the cost of LED lights sold separately online was more than that just for the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then gently push it through the gel bubble to top it off.</li>
            <li>Then gently push it through the gel bubble to top it off.</li>
            <li>It is smaller which is good for keeping it in the drawer.</li>
            <li>I was glad to discover the  video as I was very worried about the difficulty in removing the polish.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this kit, I really did.</li>
            <li>The pros always used OPI and when I used a color from a different line it was never as good.</li>
            <li>I wrap acetone soaked pads around my fingers with aluminum foil and wait about 5 minutes and this removes the top layer of gel and the polish and then the bottom layer of gel i gently scrape off with my fingernail...</li>
            <li>it was full size when I opened</li>
            <li>While it is true that the removal is cumbersome, they do pratically peel off, but not in one full swoop.  </li>
            <li>I now have my nails done for a week and it still looks as good as the same day</li>
            <li>3/4 &#x27;s. Paid full price.</li>
            <li>A nail professional warned me of that when I told her what kind of gel polish I had.</li>
            <li>I waited to write my review until I had gone through a full \\&quot;wear\\&quot; cycle.  </li>
            <li>The polish stayed on for 2 full weeks.  </li>
            <li>I looked up on YouTube as much as I can to make sure I did them correctly</li>
            <li>I used this kit multiple time with good results.</li>
            <li>I love it so much i bought one off of groupon for my mother.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The LED curing unit works well, and after the final cure/clean I am good to go...</li>
            <li>I tried Shellac gel polish in the salon last year and loved it.  </li>
            <li>My manicure is still gorgeous a week later!</li>
            <li>I figure with some practice, I can get the full 2 weeks out of it that I get when I get a gel manicure at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to try it again and see if I can get the full 2 weeks out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting full size bottles.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the full 2 weeks with ALL my nails, but I&#x27;d say I get 2 weeks with about 7-8 of them.</li>
            <li>really, don&#x27;t cheat on this, more time does make it quite a bit easier to get off.</li>
            <li>The majority of the timesaved during application is lost during the removal process, but when you think of the quality of the nails during wear, time saved not applying top coats every day, and the fast application</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty easy to get the hang of and gratifying</li>
            <li>The first time I did it, one nail did chip, but it&#x27;s so easy to fix it.  </li>
            <li>Shiny, easy, and fast!</li>
            <li>it hasn&#x27;t destroyed my nail, and it seems pretty easy to do after two weeks-</li>
            <li>I like the colors of SH MUCH BETTER, and the fact that their light is 30 seconds (which is exactly how much time SensatioNAIL says you need to do it...</li>
            <li>I like the colors of SH MUCH BETTER, and the fact that their light is 30 seconds (which is exactly how much time SensatioNAIL says you need to do it...</li>
            <li>At this point nails are still super, super tacky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like super glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a quick update.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like super glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a quick update.</li>
            <li>My water was actually more on the hot side, but not too hot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll add color to get another 1-2 weeks or more before removal and provide the most strength possible as my nails grow out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll add color to get another 1-2 weeks or more before removal and provide the most strength possible as my nails grow out.</li>
            <li>Regular polish with a bit of top coat works better.</li>
            <li>I had an issue with my order and it was dealt with quickly and politely.</li>
            <li>i quickly redo the nail in question.  </li>
            <li>, my nails grow quick so after a week you can start to see the color pull away from the cuticle area.</li>
            <li>Quick.  </li>
            <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t last the 2 weeks, as claimed, I think money wise, it was worth it.</li>
            <li>However, compared to regular polish a week without chips is exceptional.  </li>
            <li>Before starting, I read the instructions from top to bottom twice to make sure I understood them and to make the process easier</li>
            <li>STUFF WORKS!!!!! My polish stayed on for over two weeks and it was always super shiney like I had just walked out of a nail salon.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go for a few more days.</li>
            <li>but honestly I don&#x27;t find them totally lint free.</li>
            <li>I love the lamp - it is a high quality lamp.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and a professional gel manicure right now, but I will update after I see how it wears.</li>
            <li>I go super light on the first color application</li>
            <li>, I am overall very satisfied with the outcome.</li>
            <li>My first application, I did not apply primer, at the suggestion of one blogger, and so far my nails still look beautiful after nearly a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I had such a great experience with my starter kit, I&#x27;ve already purchased 2 more colors from this same brand.</li>
            <li>loved this kit and was amazed at how long the color lasted.  </li>
            <li>, it came off beautifully and without any trouble or damage to my nails.</li>
            <li>, it came off beautifully and without any trouble or damage to my nails.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product which I would recommend for someone starting to do their own gels.</li>
            <li>so if your polish is not coming off easily you will need to soak your nails in pure acetone to soften if you have trouble.ne piece, it sort of shaved off...</li>
            <li>That was almost a week and a half ago and my nails still look pretty good!</li>
            <li>my sister who is a hairdresser said to apply nail oil regularly to keep your nails in good condition which is a good idea regardless if you&#x27;re doing gel or any other polish.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it and can&#x27;t wait to try new colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps the main reason I&#x27;m so in love with Sensationail right now, is the quality of my nails after wearing the polish for almost two weeks:</li>
            <li>and I really have been intentionally not being easy on it.</li>
            <li>it came off so easily when I was ready to switch colors</li>
            <li>The actual nail kit was a gift, but my friend seems to love it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more colors for this kit soon!</li>
            <li>When i first got it i never stopped talking about it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I was certain I was going to get the SensatioNAIL kit, I bought their primer/gel cleanser/top coat/base coat kit, that did NOT contain the LED light.</li>
            <li>Tough to remove however, but I have found a great product that ships to many destinations including England and my gel polish is removed in 10mins.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered new colors and am excited to continue using it!</li>
            <li>Maybe when I become more familiar with the process, and better at giving myself a manicure, it will be less labor</li>
            <li>I really do like the lint free wipes and hope I can find some replacement ones when I need them.  </li>
            <li>but I also did one nail at a time since I have a needy toddler who demands attention frequently  :)  </li>
            <li>although I can see that the tips are beginning to wear (this could be my own fault though for not sealing the tip properly).</li>
            <li>I was able to achieve professional looking results that lasted for two weeks without a chip, dent, or scratch.</li>
            <li>This product may seem fun and safe, but it can ruin your natural nails.  </li>
            <li>(Amazon/Walmart offers a better price @ 36.00 than the company website @</li>
            <li>Next time I will trying the soaking method with a bowl of warm water as I&#x27;ve seen suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li>IT is so well worth the $$$.  </li>
            <li>The results are worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still working on the removal process but the results are worth a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li>but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have larger bottles of product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the fun one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the fun one.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Anyone can do it.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Someone in a review here gave the tip about using 100% acetone and putting the bowl holding the remover in a larger bowl with warm water.  </li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s worth the time and effort.  </li>
            <li>have also had success using Gelish nail polish with the lamp which is a bonus.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really fun.</li>
            <li>For the time and cost, it really isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>The base/top coat is ok though since it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li>and I love getting them done professionally.</li>
            <li>so I thought it was worth</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails for several decades.  </li>
            <li>This product is well worth the price, if you can paint nails, you can do this.</li>
            <li>, I thought it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>I decided it was worth the try.</li>
            <li>and they are still shiny and look freshly polished.</li>
            <li>It was worth $50!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gone with just the clear topcoat for a natural look and loved</li>
            <li>She says she gets 2 weeks out of them, which she said between that and the look of the gel, well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>My advice is to take your time and make sure everything is comfortably near you.</li>
            <li>The raspberry wine color is also beautiful, though it doesn&#x27;t seem as dark in person as the box shows, I still love the deep red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i would say its definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>and it is so worth the price of the kit.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I wore acrylic nails for years, and finally was able to break free from them, saving my nails, and thousands of dollars.</li>
            <li>It really does last a GOOD 10-14 days.</li>
            <li>Of those three, nailuv is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny and paid for itself in just one use.</li>
            <li>Some tips I&#x27;ve discovered useful</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.   </li>
            <li>Just did my first DIY Gel mani last night and it was so easy and looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>my right hand looks as amazing as my left...</li>
            <li>Once gel is soft it can easily be removed with the flat side of the manicure stick included with the Sensational kit.</li>
            <li>Also, its just as easy to apply as normal nail polish.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use gloves to clean or wash dishes so my nail polish would never last more than 3-4 days without chipping and</li>
            <li>I will admit, the french tips tear easily but are relatively easy to apply -</li>
            <li>Very upset with this I was so excited when I got ....</li>
            <li>For those of you who complain the product \\&quot;peels right</li>
            <li>It takes time and patience to get it right.</li>
            <li>I just had a coupon and it was also on sale so the timing was right for the purchase because of the discounts.</li>
            <li>I just had a coupon and it was also on sale so the timing was right for the purchase because of the discounts.</li>
            <li>Right now, I&#x27;m using the gelish basics kit with my color gels.  </li>
            <li>Take your time and do it right.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase a gel kit, but after reading a lot of positive reviews (and since it was on sale!)</li>
            <li>Honestly, when I bought this kit I didn&#x27;t expect the polish to stay on my nails because nothing has in the past for more than a day.</li>
            <li>I chose to try my own method first before utilizing those listed in various reviews online or even in the directions.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the LED over UV light and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the LED over UV light and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>far I am happy with the results, I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if it lasts as long as the salon manicure</li>
            <li>I bought the kit with Raspberry Wine, its a beautiful, deep color with tiny sparkles.</li>
            <li>, I changed the color after 7 days but had absolutely no chipping, that was using the sensational bonder, base/top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think Sensational says some people&#x27;s nails are harder to remove it from than others.</li>
            <li>Follow the (simple) instructions and you will have a beautiful, lasting manicure.</li>
            <li>Just use the product the color is more of a dark rose pink, but system is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>THEY PEEL/CHIP VERY EASILY AND YELLOW.</li>
            <li>Gel are not good but LED Lamp device is very good.</li>
            <li>Nails still going strong after 12 days, still looking like professional job, but you must follow directions to the T!</li>
            <li>My nails look beautiful and wasn&#x27;t as hard to do as I thought .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of a nutball when it comes to painting my nails, so I do take my time, but I can complete a new set in about 45 minutes (not including removal time).  </li>
            <li>I find that the foil wrap method is the best - it keeps acetone off the back of your fingers and is less drying, the polish seems to come off quicker, plus you will have semi-functional mobility with your hands even with the wraps on.</li>
            <li>In the meantime I am using regular polish with one clear gel coat of SensatioNail on top for strength and protection to give better wear.</li>
            <li>In the meantime I am using regular polish with one clear gel coat of SensatioNail on top for strength and protection to give better wear.</li>
            <li>I used the color Caffeine Fix (about $15)and got the most amazing deep purplish red color on my nails.</li>
            <li>The polish is beautiful and stays that way for at least two Weeks.</li>
            <li>I just tried my first home gel manicure, and so far, I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic starter kit for those who want to save a little money and do their own Gel Nail Polish at home.</li>
            <li>Lamp only fits 4 fingers but great overall</li>
            <li>You could just as easily use clear.</li>
            <li>The system is very easy--it has a quick step-by-step guide and no timer is needed because there&#x27;s automatic shut-off.</li>
            <li>That said, the clear stays on easily two weeks.</li>
            <li>I tried this kit and was surprised at how easy it was.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second application currently, and I think it&#x27;s going great</li>
            <li>It certainly looks nice for a long time but to me, it just wasn&#x27;t worth the time and aggrivation.  </li>
            <li>dry time is almost instantaneous with this product, so application should take quite a bit LESStime than with conventional polish, and the finish is perfect.</li>
            <li>Considering I could never get a mani to last more than 5 days in the past, I welcome 12.</li>
            <li>Nice for growing out problem nails, but not so great to have manicures done on a regular basis at a salon because with such fast re-growth a new professional manicure every 10 days would be cost-prohibitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your natural nails are pretty strong then you can probably get away with this method as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your natural nails are pretty strong then you can probably get away with this method as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is unbelievably quick as well--which is good because I have no patience and have always messed up my polish in the past.</li>
            <li>I have been using my Gel system and have made marvelous discoveries: I simply use the clear gel on my natural clear nails.</li>
            <li>This kit, which included an LED drying lamp was very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>not sure what the convenience factor is of having a 60 sec light), is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>not sure what the convenience factor is of having a 60 sec light), is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>like I said, very very forgiving.</li>
            <li>Its 7 watts vs. other light systems with way more wattage 25, 36 &amp; even 54 watts</li>
            <li>A quick google will show that many individuals who own pets have found that the beep is not a great thing.  </li>
            <li>I like the gel polish it lasts longer than regular polish and is so easy and quick to use.  </li>
            <li>On the fourth try I used the stick to clean it up and about 20 minutes post application all of my nails are free from my finger tips and the edges are cleaned up which is where it tended to be the areas where I would first see the polish breaking away or falling off about 10 days in.</li>
            <li>After doing the first nail</li>
            <li>if you are willing to put in the time, this kit will produce salon quality results.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>My first application of this lasted over a week.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much harder to do my own nails than if I had a friend helping me.</li>
            <li>I had healthy nails my entire life until I used this product.  </li>
            <li>2)Always wipe nails with gel cleanser/ alcohol after you apply and cure the final top coat.</li>
            <li>I used the kit for the first time</li>
            <li>The first time I tried wrapping my nails in foil with acetone soaked cotton.</li>
            <li>The second time I tried soaking my nails in 100% acetone and that worked better but still a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li>followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li>When I added the 2nd coat of polish and top coat, some of the polish moved around and let a &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34; on my nail.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m pleased with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would rate it higher</li>
            <li>I remove the tacky film with the alcohol and apply my favorite REGULAR NAIL polish color!</li>
            <li>more like a scrape, but it was only 12 days out.</li>
            <li>I never bother writing product reviews (this is my first)</li>
            <li>It worked exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll admit i ignored this the first three applications.</li>
            <li>The only thing that made me give three stars was there were many steps to application.  </li>
            <li>First of all who has time to soak their hands in acetone for 15 minutes and then hack away fleck by fleck?  </li>
            <li>And it does NOT work well the first time</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Polish looks great for at least two weeks.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using this</li>
            <li>It was not difficult whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Your hands don&#x27;t look pretty during this process.</li>
            <li>Some people put the bowl of acetone into another bowl of hot water.</li>
            <li>Some people put the bowl of acetone into another bowl of hot water.</li>
            <li>This is much better than the tiny one finger lamp some of the starter sets have.</li>
            <li>finished manicure is just as glossy and smooth as any professional can achieve.</li>
            <li>The reds are stunning, especially the ruby shade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous top coats and anti chip polishes and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>Make sure you push back your cuticles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d love to see the seller offer some variety packs of nail polish, rather than buying only one at a time...</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for and this product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Do not cure the product with it on your cuticles - you will not be able to remove it later.</li>
            <li>I would appreciate seeing more of a color selection in the future from Nailene</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first time using DIY gel product</li>
            <li>It should be nearly hot.  </li>
            <li>It look so pretty and shiny, but after a couple of hours I washed the dishes and the gel started to fall out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it looks pretty as your putting it on</li>
            <li>I finally gave in and tried it, and I&#x27;m soooo glad I did.  </li>
            <li>but it was my first time doing gel nails</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried an at home gel polish.  </li>
            <li>this will shorten the life of my manicure, but I&#x27;l get better at it next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, this was my first experience with any gel nail product.  </li>
            <li>, I used the expresso colored nail polish, application went faster because I knew what to do much better the second time.</li>
            <li>I love the look of painted nails, but given the countless dishes and baby bottles</li>
            <li>Requires more layers and curing time than regular gel colors.  </li>
            <li>Just removed my first manicure with this kit.</li>
            <li>and you get so much more wear out of this than regular polish,</li>
            <li>The light has a timer and does stay on for the full 60 seconds, but does beep at the 30 second mark</li>
            <li>but then, I had to have a first run.  </li>
            <li>and here I am 8  days later still enjoying the application.  </li>
            <li>I love to paint my nails but have gotten fed up with polish chipping the next day.</li>
            <li>Place the acetone bowl inside of the hot water bowl.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>so I figure I should only get better with the application process.  </li>
            <li>Nails are shiney, durable, and the color is pretty.</li>
            <li>love the colors, especially the magnetic polish.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the French mani, but I don&#x27;t have any pics (yet)</li>
            <li>today is day 10 and mine have grown out from the cuticle to nail area and that doesn&#x27;t look pretty</li>
            <li>Considering that a regular manicure lasts about 20 minutes on me, it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I never used to paint my nails because they would chip or get ruined the very day I painted them!</li>
            <li>First off, if you have NEVER went to a salon and got gelish, CND Shellac or OPI gels nails first, please do so before buying.</li>
            <li>It will get you acquainted with this process, especially the removal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S Do your thumbs first, then your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cured for an extra 15-30 secs to be on the \\&quot;safe side\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The color in this kit is really pretty too.</li>
            <li>Works exactly like it does in nail salon.</li>
            <li>First file, shape and buff.</li>
            <li>Really lasts!</li>
            <li>It looks really pretty and shiny, and I like the color.</li>
            <li>I would definitely see if there are better deals in your area before purchasing from here.</li>
            <li>The first time I did my nails, I took my time and used the video on the SensatioNail website as a guide.</li>
            <li>being my first time doing the manicure and not sealing the edges thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I had ordwred this after having my gel nails done at a salon for the first time.</li>
            <li>In my first try, the gel polish didn&#x27;t harden AT ALL.  </li>
            <li>After a shower the next morning, more peeling nails.</li>
            <li>If you are interested, Sensationail has coupons to print on their page, a $5 off on the starter kit and a $1 off for the polishes.  </li>
            <li>Over two weeks without so much as a chip!</li>
            <li>I did my first manicure at home</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this investment is way better than dropping $7 - $9 on regular polish that chips in 1-2 days.</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy it locally because I was sure it wouldn&#x27;t work on my nails.</li>
            <li>If you are careful, you CAN do reasonably nice touchups.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product has SAVED me time, with better looking nails as a result.</li>
            <li>(most times I can still see my nail through it) then on the second coat of color</li>
            <li>I bought this as my first \\&quot;gel\\&quot; kit.  </li>
            <li>I cap the ends of my nails first, and then paint them to avoid a ridge at the end.</li>
            <li>I also do both thumbs first, start to finish, and then the four fingers on each hand at a time.</li>
            <li>The first application lasted 17 days, and I type all day at work, and hand wash the dishes.  </li>
            <li>but this one really works!</li>
            <li>time: my first chip happened on day 12 of wear.</li>
            <li>All but one of my nails left the removal process undamaged, and I&#x27;m confident that what I learned from the first removal will prevent any recurrent scrapes in the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The LED cure lamp is very well made, and looks very nice, and big enough for 4 fingers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love these gel polishes because my natural nails are very strong, but the regular polsh NEVER lasts more than a few days..............</li>
            <li>light is only big enough for 4 fingers at a time and thumbs together, which may be best since if you put your whole hand in leaves your thumb naturally at a side.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the application is super easy and much faster than regular polishes.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Sensational nail kit for a little over a month.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really easy to use and didn&#x27;t take a super long time, however if you have to remove gel polish and prep your nails</li>
            <li>I also keep the finger I&#x27;m working on flat on the top of the counter or table.</li>
            <li>I bought the removal tool as well, but they came off cleanly and with NO damage to my natural nails.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t soak, any longer, I simply sand off any/some Gel that has lifted or wants to come off and re-apply more get.</li>
            <li>the Sensationail Nail Colors used with the KISS Top and Base Coats and LED lamp are a PERFECT combination!!!</li>
            <li>Be sure to use the blade parallel to your nail and very s-l-o-w-l-y</li>
            <li>Be sure to use the blade parallel to your nail and very s-l-o-w-l-y</li>
            <li>Looked at several different kits and this one had lots of good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Even not doing that I find if I use three coats of color instead of two I will easily get a full two weeks without a single chip!  </li>
            <li>The actual LED light differences are that the SensatioNAIL LED light has a 60 second light, and the Sally Hansen has a 30 second light.</li>
            <li>LED lamp works beautifully and is a very big upgrade from the single-nail lamp I was previously using.  </li>
            <li>I also did the nails of other women and Sensational have new fans.</li>
            <li>The color is spotty and looks strange but I still used the top coat and primer.</li>
            <li>I have found that the polish will last much longer if you really pay attention to capping the nail with the polish and top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a newbie at home manicures and found this pretty straight forward to use.</li>
            <li>started kit pretty much had everything.</li>
            <li>I used to get my nails done regularly, but after becoming unemployed, I stopped.</li>
            <li>The polish lasts through a lot of dish washing, house work, laundry and some pretty intense cleaning.</li>
            <li>but I really wanted to have a pretty manicure.  </li>
            <li>I have had salon gel manis in the past, and really loved the shine and longevity.  </li>
            <li>I figure it&#x27;s worth the money since I&#x27;d normally pay around $50 per gel manicure at the salon.</li>
            <li>LATER:&lt;br /&gt;I have learned that as long as I don&#x27;t use too many layers of the product, it comes off nicely without damage to my nails (particularly when I rough it up with the Emory board they provide).</li>
            <li>LATER:&lt;br /&gt;I have learned that as long as I don&#x27;t use too many layers of the product, it comes off nicely without damage to my nails (particularly when I rough it up with the Emory board they provide).</li>
            <li>Also the fact that you can go to Walmart and pick up additional colors for special occasions is a major plus!</li>
            <li>First I shaped my nails with the file provided, pushed my cuticles back and lightly buffed my nails.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and results last!</li>
            <li>There are multiple videos on Youtube that show you easy ways to remove the polish</li>
            <li>It is deep and red and very sexy.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about gel polish is not having to wait for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li>Easy on and looked great—but only for two days.</li>
            <li>Overall, I found this kit neat, easy to use, and convenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easily corrected the 2nd time around.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The resulting manicure looked just as good though didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>The resulting manicure looked just as good though didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>First time I put it on, I applied it like I applied regular nail polish and also experienced a little peeling.</li>
            <li>I used pure acetone</li>
            <li>When I tried to get it off it took 2 hours of soaking in pure acetone and scraping.  </li>
            <li>hope this helps!t be certain.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a large variety of colors</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply, and dries so much faster than regular polish...</li>
            <li>After investing in this starter kit, I have purchased 4 other colors, and I have mastered the process to get my polish to last for a week, which is amazing to me!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review when I see how long this lasts compared to professional manicures - but so far I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with results (this is gelon my natural nails, not acrylic).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve invested about $75 in polish/lamp/refills so far, and I easily have 10 more manicures left in the various colors I&#x27;ve got.  </li>
            <li>Mine worked great in the beginning, I agree it is tough to get it off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this for any first time user.</li>
            <li>This was better better than my usual 3 times a week polish change!!</li>
            <li>This will prove to be a huge no-no later with the lint from cotton.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The LED light is also much safer than similar UV application</li>
            <li>I found this polish much easier to put on and much prettier afterwards.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really take care of them like I should.  </li>
            <li>I really like the LED</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I cleared off as much polish as I could from my skin before I cure them.</li>
            <li>I am fairly accomplished at nail polishing and nail art, and I found the gel polish to have a bit of a learning curve.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well, IF YOU FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS.</li>
            <li>However, I get FULL 10 days out of the manicure before I start seeing general wear that prompts me to take it off and start over.  </li>
            <li>(the whole reason I use Gel is No Drying Time)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really hurts the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The second you put your hand under the LED light you will be able to clearly see all mistakes and learn what not to do next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second: T-A-K-E  Y-O-U-R  </li>
            <li>It is critical IMHO to brace or secure EACH hand and some fingers as you apply the gel polish.</li>
            <li>: Pay attention to the warnings about using too much gel polish on the brush at once.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier than you think to get too much.</li>
            <li>When applying top coat, be careful not to get carried away.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see that it removes any of the shine, but it does leave a smooth feel without any detectable bubble (if done properly, you can&#x27;t tell there was a bubble, either by sight or feel; except on VERY close, intense inspection).</li>
            <li>and then when it&#x27;s grown out too much to my liking</li>
            <li>and I really like the strength of my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Really stays on for two weeks with out peeling</li>
            <li>Stays shiny the whole time, looks just like a salon manicure.</li>
            <li>and I really like this one.</li>
            <li>And cures very well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the nail polish gel colour too much</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>is more pink</li>
            <li>The more you use, the harder it will be to remove.  </li>
            <li>But who wants to pay $90 for a gel mani/pedi?</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t end up using it that much</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for your DIY gel manicure needs!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve found that it is much easier to just peal it off.  </li>
            <li>it takes FORVER (like 25 minutes of soaking) to really loosen it, and then I have to scrape my nails with a metal scraper to get it off to the point where sometimes I&#x27;ve damaged the nail bed.</li>
            <li>Takes about 15-30 minutes to finish (I applied four layers) and saves you SOOOO much money from having to go to the salon.  </li>
            <li>you cannot put your whole hand in the uv lamp.  </li>
            <li>From start to finish the whole process took about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Color is even better than I expected, too.</li>
            <li>VERY flimsy.</li>
            <li>It kept coming apart the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Also, it is very shiny and stays that way for the whole two weeks.</li>
            <li>My nails are longer than they have ever been, thanks to the added strength of the gel.</li>
            <li>it really is a starter kit .</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I removed the pink polish yesterday, I was actually able to peel it off with acetone</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still very shiny.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re getting pooling, you&#x27;ve got too much on your brush.</li>
            <li>still highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>But the light and the actual polish from SH are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>VERY DISSATISFIED...</li>
            <li>This is a 7 Watt lamp which will cost almost as much as the kit itself and can be use with any brand of led gel</li>
            <li>I do like the kit, just can&#x27;t believe how much it is on here.</li>
            <li>It took me about an hour for the whole process.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;tknow why Amazon is charging so much.  </li>
            <li>voila ready to tackle the world with no worries...</li>
            <li>I used the same light and it works well.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the instructions carefully and faithfully to succeed.</li>
            <li>The whole thing took 30 minuts tops</li>
            <li>(I was being very carefull).</li>
            <li>But, it really does work</li>
            <li>I was dreading removal, but really didn&#x27;t have any problems getting it off.</li>
            <li>I found I really had to sit at the table, spread everything out in front of me, and work through it methodically.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not out that much money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, it is MUCH cheaper than going to the salon.</li>
            <li>Shake polishes VERY well.  </li>
            <li>You can remove them with cotton balls/rounds and tinfoil pieces, but buying the pre-made ones are so much easier.</li>
            <li>sounding too infomercial-ly, I can tell you that this product really solved all of those problems</li>
            <li>I believe part of the reason that the polish is only lasting a week is based on my own faults in application.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased the Gelish kit by Harmony for over $50.00 but found myself  looking for a LED light as my old 20ish year old UV lamp was only nine watts</li>
            <li>I have had naturally strong and long nails my whole life.  </li>
            <li>An old makeup brush dipped in acetone before I cure cleans things right</li>
            <li>Ive had no problems with this, I find it easy to use and as long as you follow the directions</li>
            <li>My nails are soooo long now because they are amazingly strong with the polish on them.</li>
            <li>Before I knew it, all my nails were clean and ready to go to the next step.</li>
            <li>All my other nails seem OK</li>
            <li>Normally I would had to have painted them 3 times by now!</li>
            <li>At this point I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has some skill doing their own nails and wants to save one money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have also used other gel polishes with this system and it works, gives you more choices of color.</li>
            <li>Make sure the regular polish is completely dry, then do a final top coat and cure.</li>
            <li>It was even easy to spice it up by sprinkling on a little glitter before curing the second coat and adding the top coat.</li>
            <li>The polish doesn&#x27;t really dry, so it makes that part easy.</li>
            <li>I figured out during process that if lint sticks to polish after curing you can clean it up with the \\&quot;Gel Cleanser\\&quot; and continue on to next step of polishing.</li>
            <li>I washed the dishes after, clean up, and open packages after and I did not find any chip at all.</li>
            <li>I garden with them, clean with them, change my bike inter tube tires multiple times with them;</li>
            <li>If you go in a circle around the edge as described, the center portion will lift off quite easily and then the edges will come off better once the center part is gone.</li>
            <li>The key to doing it right is to follow all the directions!</li>
            <li>They have a good selection of color but not super extensive.  </li>
            <li>This is far better than trying to paint my nails and let them dry before my daughter wakes up from a nap.</li>
            <li>It stays glossy and chip free  as long as you cap each nail off as directed.</li>
            <li>First, the product beeps to let you know when 30 seconds has passed (the time it take to cure the clear polish) which scared my dog a lot.  </li>
            <li>FOR COLORS: Don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t have completely even coverage of the first color coat.</li>
            <li>FOR COLORS: Don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t have completely even coverage of the first color coat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small but well made and works nicely.</li>
            <li>The small gel polishes, alcohol, wipes, and primer are nice additions, however I have to say the quality of the color polish is lacking.</li>
            <li>The instruction are not bad as some people mentioned (read before doing), hence my advice above (get a professional gel manicure first).</li>
            <li>did a test: one hand got the full treatment of SensatioNAIL products, in the correct order, following the directions to the letter.</li>
            <li>I bought this a couple days before I went &amp; got my first professional Shellac manicure, so I had to wait a couple wks to use it on myself.</li>
            <li>Although my professional Shellac mani was pretty....</li>
            <li>After that I found I was easily able to use my thumbnail to gently push/scrape the flakes from my entire nail in long steady light pressure motions starting from the cuticle to the tip.</li>
            <li>LED lights are also usually very expensive but with this kit you get a nice little LED light and trial sizes of the Sensationail products for a good price.</li>
            <li>Because there are so many other reviews I won&#x27;t go into that other than to say it was easy for me and my nails look amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wait to try new colors!</li>
            <li>I could go much longer without a fill because my nails still look new and shiny even after 3+ weeks of nail growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you find a bubble, use a mostly dry brush to smooth it till it&#x27;s satisfactory.</li>
            <li>If you find a bubble, use a mostly dry brush to smooth it till it&#x27;s satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Application with the pink chiffon was quite easy.  </li>
            <li>The more you put on, the more difficult it is to take off gel.</li>
            <li>The more you put on, the more difficult it is to take off gel.</li>
            <li>To me, this was gentler on my hands than soaking my fingers in acetone because the moist paper towel was only on top of my nails and not all over my fingers/skin (except for the crook of alternated fingers on the opposite</li>
            <li>Make sure that cuticles are pushed back and the product is covering ONLY the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so pleased to have a completed manicure in such a short time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very nimble and was still able to apply it so my nails looks as if professionally done.  </li>
            <li>My nail polish usually last one day if I&#x27;m lucky with out chipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the main reason I use it.</li>
            <li>Especially since for all 12 days it looked much better than any of the 5 days of a regular mani.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>think this is a great product and think it should last at least 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The bottles of polish were smaller than I was expecting but for the price and knowing I will want a variety of colors I will definitely be looking for more.  </li>
            <li>this became my holiday/Valentine&#x27;s Day red just because it is more  red in color than the box color indicates.  </li>
            <li>I started getting manicures because my nails were feeling weak, but the people would buff my nails too much making them weaker and once they didn&#x27;t even put the top coat on right and my nails were matte in certain areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used with Gelish polishes also and they work too (cured for 30 seconds, 2 coats) - this is important because the SensatioNail color palette is somewhat limited (though expanding).</li>
            <li>I got the French manicure set at my local Walmart and was very excited about it.</li>
            <li>Very tricky to get right and last 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>it looked high quality.</li>
            <li>Price is sort of high.</li>
            <li>I researched the various products available and weighed the info and concerns related to UV light versus LED during the time the initial gel manicure was growing out.</li>
            <li>Once it pools in the cuticle area or along the sides, or even gets on your skin, it&#x27;s really challenging to clean up easily without just wiping it all off and starting over, thereby wasting expensive product.</li>
            <li>and all, I highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li>One day I went to the salon and had shellac done, it was a little more pricey</li>
            <li>Every time I have painted my nails, it gets a little better.  </li>
            <li>I use a very good base coat, top coat, and thinner layers and still chips the next day.</li>
            <li>Rotate the flat finger from left to right to be sure you&#x27;re covering close enough to each side edge.</li>
            <li>Additionally, with regular polish, I would have been preserving my polish with a new top coat daily or at least every other day, but with Sensationail I did nothing and had a beautiful gloss on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LED lamp is big enough to fit your whole hand</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s used it three times so far and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It really does look like I got my nails professionally done, and I&#x27;ve already used the kit to do my friend&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li>NOT TO MENTION VERY DAMAGING TO THE NATURAL NAILS...</li>
            <li>I have had better luck with Sally Hansen Miracle Gel (no light) and the Miracle Gel topcoat.</li>
            <li>I pray they will begin to grow out normally again.  </li>
            <li>My nails would always chip with normal polish</li>
            <li>we recently had fun with water-marbeling on our nails and he Gel kept the polish on for over a week.</li>
            <li>Finally, apply one more thin coat of \\&quot;Base/Top Coat\\&quot; and cure for 30 more</li>
            <li>The traces of gel normally stick to where you had placed your primer.</li>
            <li>It was fun but don&#x27;t expect it to last weeks or anything.</li>

            <li>It was fun but don&#x27;t expect it to last weeks or anything.</li>
            <li>So, top coat seems necessary with colors (except the clear French kit).</li>
            <li>: I have come up with my own solution to remove missed bubbles (which I somehow have managed to have at least one of on one finger each time).</li>

            <li>: I have come up with my own solution to remove missed bubbles (which I somehow have managed to have at least one of on one finger each time).</li>
            <li>I had the second color on for 8 days, it was starting to peel up next to the cuticle, but I&#x27;m still happy it lasted that long.</li>
            <li>It starts chipping almost immediately with normal wear.</li>
            <li>Saves lots of money considering it is normally about $35-40 in the city for a gel manicure.  </li>
            <li>Lasted the full 2 weeks only one small chip love the color</li>
            <li>Its rare for me to find a product I like enough to leave a review</li>
            <li>I agree the instructions are pretty long but worth reading since the outcome looks like my professional gel manicure.</li>
            <li>Proper removal is worth the time and effort.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find removal to take awhile, but the trade off is worth it to me since I only polish every 10 days or so</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the tiny splurge.</li>
            <li>The polish would not last but a week but the lamp itself was well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>so if your polish is not coming off easily you will need to soak your nails in pure acetone to soften if you have trouble.</li>
            <li>BEFORE you cure it with the light, if you mess up polishing take a foam eye shadow applicator dipped in a tiny bit of nail polish remover and clean up your cuticles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it is relatively easy, if a bit time consuming because you must be careful.</li>
            <li>I love this set, and the convenience of having my nails dry instantly!</li>
            <li>polish stays on up to three weeks (toes last longer then finger nails) and is easy enough to remove.</li>
            <li>I have a new, clean straight edge and literally VERY CAREFULLY shave the head</li>
            <li>I have a new, clean straight edge and literally VERY CAREFULLY shave the head</li>
            <li>By day 2, my thumb nail began chipping and polish peeled right off on my upper part of the nail.</li>
            <li>My nails are very short right now</li>
            <li>Not only do instructions not tell you that curing doesn&#x27;t set your base/top coat but your nail surfaces are quite sticky right now</li>
            <li>I can use Genadur over my Nailene manicure and the nails soak it right up, which means that the Nailene product allows your nails to absorb treatment products even while you are wearing gel polish; it does not prevent your nails from getting enough oxygen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was less impressed with the other tiny, tiny, bottles of gel cleanser, base/top coat, gel color, and primer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Knowing what I know today, I would have found a bigger light for the same price, but this product is decent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m only on my second application, so keep that in mind, but I did wear the first application out till the first chip and went through the removal process, and have much to say about Sensationail!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I followed the directions on the back, except I let the last coat of polish dry under the light twice to make sure it had set properly.</li>
            <li>This is awesome, for less then one regular mani/pedi lasting about one day you can get ten manis lasting 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>I was so excited until I opened it and saw that the primer was COMPLETELY EMPTY.</li>
            <li>You will need to cure thumbs separately due to the space under light.  </li>
            <li>For those who are insinuating that their gel polish came off in just days due to the product being cheap, ineffective, etc.</li>
            <li>The LED light also works with other brands of gel polish.  </li>
            <li>I use my own, that is a little bit finer, which might make the next part a non issue for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>n&#x27;t it&#x27;s a flaw I&#x27;ve learned to live with.  </li>
            <li>We live in the country and have animals and I garden and do not wear gloves.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in live with the color.</li>
            <li>but the polish was still shiny and new .</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon and they immediately shipped out a new kit with 2 day delivery.  </li>
            <li>and I definitely learned several lessons right away with the first application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to scrape off the polish without using any remover and very little effort with that handy little tool and it only takes a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li>Fairly easy, took about a half hr.</li>
            <li>I like the sheer pink look anyway and had used that on my nails more than anything else for years</li>
            <li>and I have a nice investment in my regular polish that I didn&#x27;t want to waste.</li>
            <li>I did also find that if you use regular nail polish, apply the gel coat to it, and let it cure under the light for two minutes (each hand, alternating); you get the same results as using the shellac nail polish.  </li>
            <li>At the end of all the steps my nails were dry and set and super shiny.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I have is the timer on the UV light is only for 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Not sure how they justified shipping it out in the first place.</li>
            <li>but I did not due to the limited colors that are available from this maker.</li>
            <li>so it was a very natural combination and look for me.</li>
            <li>You do have to be very careful when applying, as anything touching your cuticles or skin will ruin the lasting power of the mani, but with practice this is not hard to do.</li>
            <li>And there is normally a clear difference, since I&#x27;m not ambidextrous!  </li>
            <li>I was happy to see several products become available to the general public for home use, but was skeptical about quality and DIY results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am excited to try the French Nail Tips kit that were recently launched.</li>
            <li>Refill kits I think are slightly higher or around same price.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Do use care when using the scraper not to dig in and damage natural nail!</li>
            <li>Do use care when using the scraper not to dig in and damage natural nail!</li>
            <li>I have some polish on my skin which hasn&#x27;t washed off despite frequently scrubbing my hands, but whatever, I just know to be more careful next</li>
            <li>/&gt;ONE MONTH LATER:&lt;br /&gt;After using the product several times now I can say with certainty that I am most likely going to abandon use of SensatioNail after the current supply from the starter kit is used up.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased my first essentials replacement items.</li>
            <li>This gets a definite thumbs-up from me and a recommendation to anyone interested in a low-cost DIY home gel kit that doesn&#x27;t give UV exposure.</li>

            <li>If it is too hot, your hands will burn inside the smaller bowl with the acetone.  </li>
            <li>I have a professional looking manicure which I can do myself while spending time with family, or watching TV!  </li>
            <li>I never had such pretty hands until now.  </li>
            <li>First, I didn&#x27;t buy this through Amazon, but through my local drugstore.</li>
            <li>Plus, they take more drying time than I have to give, and I usually end up with dings or smudges in the polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, I did my first application the night before I left on vacation... and therefore, after the 45 minutes I allowed myself to do my nails, I immediately had to finish packing.</li>
            <li>To put it in perspective, before this, my regular polish would last a maximum of 3 days before there was significant wear at the tip of my nail which WAS noticeable, that I would feel the need to touch up.</li>
            <li>I purchased several other colors at about 10 bucks each, but I will never have to go to a salon again for nice, just like new, deep, shiny wet-look nails.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Around that time, Walgreen&#x27;s had a sale on Nailene&#x27;s SensatioNail with $10 off the starter kit (bringing it down to $49.99) and $2 off each nail product (manufacturer&#x27;s coupons which were available at the Walgreen&#x27;s beauty counter and also usable WITH the sale price.</li>
            <li>: Hold your fingers up in the light at different angles and move them around so you can see that there are no bubbles or uneven areas and that the gel is evenly distributed as the light shines on various parts of your nails.</li>

            <li>I simply use NON ACETONE polish remover and the regular polish comes off without harming the Gel.&lt;br /&gt;Sincemy original purchase of the kit, I have added a bottle of the Naile Base/Top Coat (Nailene Professional UV Gel Kit #71356 $15.75)coat</li>
            <li>slide it smoothly across till you meet with slight resistance (the bubble).</li>
            <li>I will be switching to CND&#x27;s Shellac and still using the LED light, but for half the curing time.</li>

            <li>After 23 years no more visits to the salon to sit for two hours paying oodles of $ for something I really didn&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li>I am not fond of putting nail polish because it chips easily and just a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li>When I initially had the professional do the first gel manicure (Shellac is her product of choice)</li>
            <li>When I initially had the professional do the first gel manicure (Shellac is her product of choice)</li>
            <li>(so if you have to cure it for longer, you need to press for another cycle), and the beep is unusually loud, but those are both minor and worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an affordable gel kit  after reading reviews on gel nails I have decided to try it since I have my own natural nails that would constantly chip and regular polish would only last a day .</li>
            <li>In 10-15 minutes your nails are completely painted, dry and ready for everything!!</li>
            <li>I have used this kit with several other brands of base coat, top coat, and color and all have worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Instead of being weak and breaking on the edge at the quick, which they used to almost always do, they were now breaking off in a jagged chunk of a piece or section at the tips causing me to continually shorten them to the length of the one that most recently got dinged.</li>
            <li>I love this color, its not pink pink but its not red either.</li>
            <li>Yes, I spent a little more by buying the kit and nail polishes, but in a month I have already started saving that money and my mom and cousins have also benefited!</li>
            <li>Pros:  Fairly simple, long lasting color, love the shine and toughness&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I was really surprised that this would even compare to a gel manicure from the salon, but it exceeded my expectations by far!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions carefully, and my nails looked very pretty.</li>
            <li>In some instances you may be able to turn you hand upside down for a couple of seconds and let gravity help redistribute the gel toward the center if too much is close to the side edges.</li>
            <li>In some instances you may be able to turn you hand upside down for a couple of seconds and let gravity help redistribute the gel toward the center if too much is close to the side edges.</li>
            <li>so it is very important to go slowly and methodically.</li>
            <li>Wine\\&quot; that came with the kit I ordered is very pretty for winter (a deep maroon with tiny sparkly pigments)&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These colors do not last as long as my OPI manicures - my OPI manicures would last 3 weeks without so much as a chip - the got so grown out that I would &#x27;fill&#x27; them in with regular nail polish and blend it over the top for an ombre effect.</li>
            <li>went and purchased pure acetone from the beauty shop (it comes in plastic bottle in different sizes).</li>
            <li>primer may be the key to not having streaks, I cannot be certain.</li>
            <li>I buffed the shine off the nails, put pure acetone on cotton, put the cotton on my fingers, wrapped my fingers in foil, put my hands under a heating pad, waited about 10 minutes, scraped off the gel with this tool, buffed my nails with a file, pushed back my cuticles, put on some lotion and put some cuticle oil on my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed a little bit of shrinkage from the edges of my nails after curing them in the LED light (as I was trying to avoid my skin per the instructions).</li>
            <li>If little bit remains after soaking, lightly buff the nail with a file.</li>
            <li>This product is also fantastic for mothers of little kids who do not have time to sit and paint their nails.</li>
            <li>If not, just fill in with light even strokes with little polish on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little backstory, no matter what I do, I cannot get a home-done manicure to last more than 2 days.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money on something that actually lasts.</li>
            <li>, I had a hard time convincing people</li>
            <li>Other reviewers seem to say that is key to easy removal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other reviewers seem to say that is key to easy removal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very durable nail polish that set hard immediately out of the LED light.  </li>
            <li>clear transparent LED gel top/base coat,&lt;br /&gt;.12</li>
            <li>After I cure the clear Gel</li>
            <li>This is clear</li>
            <li>If this is a concern of yours, you could still purchase this kit and do a clear gel overlay on your nails instead.</li>
            <li>I love getting a nice manicure, but hate paying salon price.</li>
            <li>Also, with Nailene, you do not have to use color each time; you can also do a clear manicure, which means you get the protection of gel for your nails</li>
            <li>but once I did, it completely removed the sticky feeling so</li>
            <li>complete ALL the steps because they will be tacky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all directions completely (having said that, I have been doubling the time with the lamp because that is what was done at my nail</li>
            <li>This is common among most home gel kit lamps in this price range though</li>
            <li>this kit has fixed my problems with waiting.</li>
            <li>I had a professional apply gel polish to see what it was all about, it lasted 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>off\\&quot; you have to buff your natural nail before applying to help it adhere.</li>
            <li>I just got mine today and it took about 30 minutes to complete.</li>
            <li>One suggestion:  put the primer coat around the outside of the nail, not the whole nail surface.  </li>
            <li>I switched to Red Carpet Manicure and this product is much easier to remove.  </li>
            <li>No big deal really.</li>
            <li>And last, the whole UV lamp thing does concern me.</li>
            <li>Looks like it was professionally done.</li>
            <li>I really wished I&#x27;d looked on Amazon before buying this at my local drug</li>
            <li>I bought professional strength acetone at Walmart (inexpensive) and followed the directions.  </li>
            <li>Where have you been all of my adult life gel polish???</li>
            <li>If I can do this anyone can because I&#x27;m far from a girlie girl.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller, so it doesn&#x27;t fit your thumb in with your fingers, so it takes just a bit longer than in the salon, but it was simple enough and worked as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I suspect I could have gone at least 3-4 more days.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time &amp; money buying this product.</li>
            <li>Complete rip off</li>
            <li>I actually bought it at Walmart and paid $50 because I didn&#x27;t want to wait for shipping, but I paid that much for 1 gel manicure in a salon</li>
            <li>also purchased the French manicure kit, and I didn&#x27;t have much luck with the adhesive tips, but I will try again.</li>
            <li>I did have to use three coats of color to get a complete cover.  </li>
            <li>And I still didn&#x27;t get all of it completely off.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old can do her nails herself</li>
            <li>The only real requirements are to read the directions and, to be patient in the application of the gel -- dry/cure</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>I have so far done my fingernails and toenails</li>
            <li>This stuff is legit, it keeps up with a 16 month old, house work, showers and even scrubbing dishes.</li>
            <li>The finished results look professional.</li>
            <li>The WHOLE point of gel manicures is for the color to last for weeks.</li>
            <li>It really does last 2 weeks when done correctly.  </li>
            <li>Some of the old gel polish I had on before must have stuck on and I didn&#x27;t see it, and that&#x27;s what it is.</li>
            <li>The hardest part was soaking off my professional gel manicure I had on before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten my nails done professionally for years,  tons of cash;</li>
            <li>I only paid $36 for the whole kit.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>LEDs are faster than UV lights and safer as far as skin cancer is concerned.</li>
            <li>NO COMPLAINTS SO FAR.</li>
            <li>Going to a nail salon for professional nails is just not in my budget</li>
            <li>My favorite is the complaint about the sticky residue.</li>
            <li>Given the cost of professional gel manicures vs this system, If I got 2 uses out of it, it was a wash.</li>
            <li>as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s acetone wraps followed with some scraping.</li>
            <li>If you try this and it doesn&#x27;t work for you, the instructions say to only add the primer layer around the edges of your nail and it&#x27;ll come off much easier.</li>
            <li>The SensatioNail mani&#x27;s I done on 3 relatives looked just as professional.</li>
            <li>fingers are ready to go for the next set.</li>
            <li>This allows me to take breaks between since they are complete.  </li>
            <li>far as the removal process, I soaked in acetone-soaked cotton rounds wrapped in tin foil for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>However, by the time I was out the door and rushing to the airport, my nails were completely FLAWLESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can never get a manicure to last more than a few days without a chip.</li>
            <li>Compared to the price and hassle of spending my time in my local salon, it&#x27;s definitely been worth it.  </li>
            <li>It helps you learn what you might need to refine without likely having to re-do the entire manicure right away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I am assuming the reader of this review has 10 fingers, please adjust my recommendation accordingly as I mean no discrimination :)</li>
            <li>I was applying and messing up because my hands weren&#x27;t able to apply well enough due to the tiny</li>
            <li>, I spent a good half an hour alternating hands under the lamp to try and dry it.  </li>
            <li>The gel polish won&#x27;t dry too quickly like regular polish does, so you have the time to be meticulous and fix issues before you cure it.</li>
            <li>So if long lasting color is worth the time of application and removal</li>
            <li>It lasted a full fourteen days with NO issues and I am ROUGH on my nails (wash my hands a lot, typing daily, messing with the dogs, dishes, etc.)</li>
            <li>Each polish has a slightly different viscosity and coverage, so if the first one you try isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;opaque&amp;#34; enough, I&#x27;d encourage you to try another color.  </li>
            <li>They still actually looked fine when I removed them, but they were lifting in the corners slightly.</li>
            <li>this gives you a lot of opportunity for damage control (using the little wooden cuticle pusher you can easily wipe away excess polish).</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to a friend, and have told several coworkers about this kit!</li>
            <li>No big messes, smooth glossy coats, and it lasted about a week and a half.  </li>
            <li>I waited a bit and then read reviews online and couldn&#x27;t find many negatives (mostly the bad reviews seemed to be related to user error/issues)</li>
            <li>This gel nail really lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t chip.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that it barely had any.</li>
            <li>nails really do feel nearly invincible while I&#x27;m wearing Sensationail gel polish, and therefore, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to regular polish again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty rough on my hands</li>
            <li>Might be equal or longer than drying time of normal polish.  </li>
            <li>It took me about 40 minutes the first time because I was really careful to follow step by step.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will definitely want to make sure you have all your tools out and ready to use and that you use THIN coats of polish.</li>
            <li>All in all, if you follow the directions exactly, I find that it takes me about 45 minutes to do the full application of 2 color coats and the base and top coat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally: I was just too curious to wait longer than a week after my initial sheer pink manicure and the re-growth was already showing; so I cleaned my nails with alcohol to remove any lint and added raspberry wine right over the existing pink manicure (two coats of raspberry plus one clear top coat).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally: I was just too curious to wait longer than a week after my initial sheer pink manicure and the re-growth was already showing; so I cleaned my nails with alcohol to remove any lint and added raspberry wine right over the existing pink manicure (two coats of raspberry plus one clear top coat).</li>
            <li>Hours later, my nails were still not hard, but rather rubbery.  </li>
            <li>It is a little pricey for nail polish, but the results are salon worthy.</li>
            <li>Wow, did I fall in love with not only the durability but the slick, shiny, and raised look of gel nails!</li>
            <li>Put hot water in the medium sized bowl and pure actone in the small bowl.</li>
            <li>There may be tiny little areas that stay, I just used a light buffing to remove.  </li>
            <li>The light should be a little bigger so that my entire hand can go under the light, the light is so small that my thumb does not fit in.</li>
            <li>So far 3 days on my nails and not a single chip.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been afraid of giving yourself a gel manicure (even if you&#x27;re not that great at giving yourself a regular manicure) give this a try!</li>
            <li>salon)&lt;br /&gt;Polish removal can be a bear, so be sure to rough up polish with a heavy duty nail file to speed up removal.&lt;br /&gt;The lamp</li>
            <li>this product did not do what it said it would anyone who wants to try this just letting you know that it peel off the next day does not last for 14 day</li>
            <li>I have only done one manicure so far, and thus far I like this product.</li>
            <li>My husband recently bought this product for me as a late birthday gift, because he knows I love to polish my nails.</li>
            <li>My nails are extremely thin and brittle and I never thought I would be able to do without professional acrylics or shellac.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that the cost is pretty much the same as acrylic tips or silk wraps but doesn&#x27;t last as  long.  </li>
            <li>True this starter kit offers quite small bottles, I still feel like you get a lot of bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>It fits 4 fingers easily and this method made me go slowly and patiently</li>
            <li>You can also just use the clear gel polish to create a strong base for nails and paint regular nail polish over that if you like to change the color more frequently (because the gel polish DOES last a solid 8 days minimum - my first attempt lasted 9 before they began to lift anywhere and</li>
            <li>Originally I thought it was rather small, too.</li>
            <li>There are a number of steps, and I followed the suggestion to do my thumbs first followed by the rest of one hand, and then the other.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the removal process of gel polish either, but I will try the soak-off method with hot water (heated in the microwave) that other posters here recommended when the time comes.</li>
            <li>It was pretty easy to apply and not at all difficult to remove.</li>
            <li>you are free to get back to your activities and you wont mess up your nails!</li>
            <li>In fact, the polish rolled right off, with just using pressure from my thumbnail, in less than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>But then I realized that I was going right back into the nail financial burden that I was stuck in for so long.</li>
            <li>(I am NOT a professional but have always been decent at painting both hands myself).</li>
            <li>Since gel manicures (without any type of false nail) is typically $30-$40 at local salons, this product is a great deal considering one gets 10 manicures out of the starter kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Coffee Bean or Espresso Bean which looks like a dark brown online is more of a bronze that glimmers with green and yellowish tints and in sunlight looks like a (not dark) brown.</li>
            <li>The only downside I have discovered is that if the regular polish is too thick and not quite dry when you apply the gel top coat it can get somewhat of a ripply affect but often times that can be smoothed out by applying pressure to the nail to press it down smooth....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I haven&#x27;t gotten acrylic lately I still enjoy polishing my nails at home.</li>
            <li>All together I got the starter kit with LED light in Raspberry Wine, a sheer pink French kit, clear French kit, Sugar Plum color and extra French tips, for around $90 including tax.</li>
            <li>And it really does last a long time.</li>
            <li>am currently only using the clear so can&#x27;t speak to the application of the color.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, with normal polish, my clothes and luggage would have ended up wearing more polish than my nails...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I took my old polish off using regular remover and cotton.</li>
            <li>far, manicures are lasting me about 10 days.</li>
            <li>Then stroke the sides, being careful to stay away from the skin or leaving too much polish that might run or pool.</li>
            <li>Then stroke the sides, being careful to stay away from the skin or leaving too much polish that might run or pool.</li>
            <li>Not worth spending almost an hour doing my manicure to get a whopping three days of pretty nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several friends ask if I got my nails done professionally.</li>
            <li>I usually finish the entire set in about 40 minutes (with extra 30-secs curing for final top coat).  </li>
            <li>I chose to try the sheer pink without tips for my first experiment.</li>
            <li>My nails are so thin and brittle that even the priciest of guarantee&#x27;s never lasted more than 24 hours on my nails before they started chipping and/or peeling off.  </li>
            <li>Thus, not more than 5 minutes after curing my topcoat, my nails got the full assault.</li>
            <li>I loved the color and how long it lasted, unfortunately it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>She said it did take a few times to get the process down, but once she did, her nails look lovely.</li>
            <li>I am stay at home mom, so for me any nail polish i tried wont last more than 2 days, as i have to be constantly cleaning something and with a 1 year old baby its hard to do your nails or even go to salon!</li>
            <li>The application process takes a bit longer than regular polish, but there&#x27;s zero time spent waiting for it to dry (it really IS cured/dry as fast as the kit says, and you can go about your business without worrying you&#x27;ll smudge or scuff your nails)...</li>
            <li>I recommend using your dominant hand (likely the one you write with) to do your &#x60;other&#x27; hand first.</li>
            <li>gel goes on very smoothly and it is easier than regular polish to apply smoothly in thin layer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before purchasing anything I went to a professional and got a clear gel manicure to test the wear and see how long it would last for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other gel polishes and SensatioNails is of much poorer quality.</li>
            <li>Typically every 3 weeks I would get a gel mani for $35; with this you&#x27;ll pay around $50 and you&#x27;ll just have to purchase gel polish (which btw the light works with other brands).</li>
            <li>You can gently and slowly push the brush a little closer toward the cuticle if necessary to get as close as possible WITHOUT touching the edge.</li>
            <li>This is particularly important if you are going to use a color, especially a dark or red color.</li>
            <li>I think I will always start with a sheer, clear or French manicure</li>
            <li>I think I will always start with a sheer, clear or French manicure</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll add a photo, I used the French nails manicure kit, but initially purchased this complete set.  </li>
            <li>So I used that to my advantage - I completely manicured and cured 1 thumb, then the opposite thumb, then 4 fingers on non dominant hand, and finally the 4 fingers on my dominant hand.</li>
            <li>The first time it took me a long time, but I expected that.</li>
            <li>NO DRY TIME involved.</li>
            <li>The gel polish does not dry until its cured</li>
            <li>Removal time and effort is expected to be high.</li>
            <li>You can buy the same exact product/ kit for less than $50 at Walmart.</li>
            <li>It may be a little less strong than the gel treatments at the salon</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and I used this kit several times before buying other colors and brands of gel polish, rubbing alcohol, wipes and additional tools.  </li>
            <li>This is revolutionary to me as I can usually not get away with more than 1.5 days of a regular manicure without chipping due to my weak, peeling nails.</li>
            <li>The first application requires some patience, but I am on my fifth round of DIY nails.</li>
            <li>After removal, I filed my nails down since they had grown so much in the 17 days</li>
            <li>The only downside is that gel nails are rather hard to remove, but I believe wrapping acetone-soaked cotton will work, based on many other reviews.</li>
            <li>My nails are super shiny, and hard.</li>
            <li>Once you begin polishing, start with a long single stroke down the center of the nail from near the inside of the nail bed area to the end of the nail to see how much gel you really are working with.</li>
            <li>I have a two year old, so not having any dry time</li>
            <li>I tried it twice and the polish doesn&#x27;t harden and dry like the professional machine and polish.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the manicure will last because I just put it on, but it feels just like the applications I&#x27;ve had at the salon so far.  </li>
            <li>Terrified to know what Raspberry Wine looks like since that looks pink online--it will probably be hot pink or something</li>
            <li>so keeping my nails looking good all the time was nearly impossible before.</li>
            <li>Not a huge deal, especially since this is my first time</li>
            <li>It goes on thin and strong</li>
            <li>This product was easy to apply, dries rock hard instantly and lasted for 11 days, even after completely all the everyday chores.  </li>
            <li>This little kit is going to save me so much money...</li>
            <li>a few other gems of information - I researched this polish on ewg.org, which rates the danger of cosmetic ingredients, and many of the polishes have a low or moderate ranking (the darker ones seem to hit the moderate category) and do not have a lot of the standard cancer causing agents found in other polishes.</li>
            <li>The nasty discolored, bumpy sections of the previously abused nails are still growing out and color just doesn&#x27;t look good on them yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two or three coats of the clear gel, and my nails are nice and firm.  </li>
            <li>My first application lasted a little over a week (and survived a long weekend in Vegas).</li>
            <li>This stuff is tough; you can see it forms a real shield on your nails and that really protects them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s weird to have 4 coats of polish on my nails and have them be instantly dry and usable all due to that little magic light box.  </li>
            <li>Directions are long, but it&#x27;s basically the same process as doing your nails regularly (file, clean, base coat, paint, top coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>and so far it didnt crack or loose its shine!</li>

            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> Very good deal on the Sensational gel polish starter kit.</li>
            <li> I really love this!!</li>
            <li> but I love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this!!</li>
            <li> I bought these for LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> Very important things to remember for the best results:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been five days and the manicure still looks amazing!</li>
            <li> Its amazing!</li>
            <li> I noticed that I could do that at home and researched many gel kits and this was the one with the best reviews.</li>
            <li> (Still loving the system btw!)</li>
            <li> (Still loving the system btw!)</li>
            <li> I bought Sally Hanson gel polish because they had some nice colors, however the polish chipped and peeled after 2 days, every time I&#x27;ve used them!</li>
            <li> Nice color!</li>
            <li> If you can paint your nails you can successfully create a salon quality gel manicure at home</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with results!</li>
            <li> Not as good as OPI but a great deal</li>
            <li> The shine is spectacular!  </li>
            <li> I was much more impressed with Nailene than with the RCM.</li>
            <li> Love the product, great colours!</li>
            <li> Very happy :)</li>
            <li> Def a Must have if you Love your nails flawless!</li>
            <li> Love love... !!!</li>
            <li> Worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to do and my manicure has been perfect for 10 days!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks great!  </li>
            <li> I am fine with the removal if i can get a two week perfect manicure</li>
            <li> A good investment instead of paying salon prices every 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Along with the quality being good, you&#x27;ll also save yourself tons of money.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li> looks just as good as salon</li>
            <li> She loved it.  </li>
            <li> This product and this system (gel) fit my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> I use a good hand moisturizer on the night between manicures to replenish the moisture that the acetone takes</li>
            <li> Soak for about 15 minutes and you are good.</li>
            <li> (good deal seeing that each shellac manicure is about $30).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll take a couple of times to start getting good at it</li>
            <li> /&gt;After14 days this product still looked quite good.</li>
            <li> The hand with all the SensatioNAIL products (but using the color and LED light from SH) is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I hope I get good results.  </li>
            <li> It was a good price for what all I received.  </li>
            <li> The sensationail scraper is a good product.  </li>
            <li> However, the Sensationail polish lasts until I feel it has grown out from looking good</li>
            <li> The polish on my toe nails has been on for 5 weeks now and it looks as good as the day I applied it.</li>
            <li> I had my nails done at a salon a couple weeks ago, and I honestly think I did much better on myself at home with this kit!!</li>
            <li> Be sure they look good before you cure!  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and my nails look great after 18 days today.</li>
            <li> A really great kit and very easy to use</li>
            <li> This helps tremendously to provide for the best opportunity for a good result.</li>
            <li> it is so easy!!  </li>
            <li> The polish cures in 60 seconds as the instructions state and shine beautifully after using the top coat and gel cleanser.  </li>
            <li> 9 full days of wet-glossy, absolutely perfect looking nails, and</li>
            <li> :when you buy Sensational nail polish it comes in a .25 fl oz bottle @ 11.99/</li>
            <li> I am a tremendous skeptic but have been very happy with this kit.</li>
            <li> Also, Sensationail has the best customer service, quick and reliable.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Great for anyone with commitment issues :)</li>
            <li> Great for anyone with commitment issues :)</li>
            <li> works great love</li>
            <li> and i was more than happy with how my manicure turned out in the end.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a beautiful soft creamy coral &#x3D; perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> , I think Sensationail is still very worthwhile.</li>
            <li> The finish is strong and has a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> The color is great and very true to what is shown on the box.  </li>
            <li> sure you remove any gel polish you get on your skin before using the LED lamp!</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed with the UV lamp -</li>
            <li> I have had my first application on for two weeks now and besides my outgrowth my nails look perfect still.  </li>
            <li> Love this kit!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> You will love doing your nails gel style!</li>
            <li> The best way to avoid this is to swirl the brush around the inside of the bottle to remove excess polish first.</li>
            <li> Love this Kit!</li>
            <li> Once this problem was solved,i I have to say I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is my first gel nail system and it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> But then after putting the nails under the light they come out looking beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> But I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this kit!</li>
            <li> I love this nail kit!</li>
            <li> Price much better than Walmart!</li>
            <li> I really love the color!</li>
            <li> once you have the lamp, i don&#x27;t see why you cant buy creative nail designs shellac or whatever brand you like (through amazon) products in largr sizes with the lamp you already have now !</li>
            <li> Lovely Nails for one&#x27;s pleasure!</li>
            <li> Love this polish!</li>
            <li> If you love to paint your nails buy this product!</li>
            <li> I love this kit!  </li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Sensationail Gel Polish!</li>
            <li> No snaggy edges, and as I said they are still growing out, but they look so much better than I thought they would!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My nails came out so perfect the first time</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> although I will probably end up spending it on more polish colors!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The polish was easy to apply and came out looking great.  </li>
            <li> I did my own gel manicure for the first time yesterday and my nails came out wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Great, easy....</li>
            <li> So easy to use and looks great, anyone can do this.&lt;br /&gt;what</li>
            <li> It also shipped very quickly and was in great condition when I received it.</li>
            <li> The directions were easy to follow and they have a great selection of colors.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and the color is great.  </li>
            <li> I wash dishes and clean a lot and still have beautiful polished nails.</li>
            <li> Great light and gel system.</li>
            <li> but this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> This kit is amazing.</li>
            <li> The LED light is great.</li>
            <li> set is amazing.  </li>
            <li> it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The light does a great job curing the gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Led light works great.</li>
            <li> I own the nail wraps</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t let it deter you from this kit as the lamp is really nice.</li>
            <li> i have always kind of slopped polish on knowing the shower would wash away they excess,</li>
            <li> Does a nice job.</li>
            <li> The methods I tried was to soak the fingers in warm acetone and another time using the foil wraps.  </li>
            <li> Nice UV</li>
            <li> Let your nails grow out or do your own fills.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> If you try this method make sure you have a good surface to work with and a glass bowl.</li>
            <li> If you try this method make sure you have a good surface to work with and a glass bowl.</li>
            <li> the polish didn&#x27;t look nice, it like shrank on my nail.  </li>
            <li> Kind of hit and miss product quality in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a nice convenient and affordable way to keep your nails looking nice at home.</li>
            <li> It came with all you need for a nice gel manicure</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll get better at it in time, but it looks good</li>
            <li> And get this they can ship a hazardous item as nail polish</li>
            <li> sometimes if its not as nice as I would like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this.</li>
            <li> Nice coverage.  </li>
            <li> Rather, it kind of \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; off in layers as I used the removal tool.</li>
            <li> Novice at doing my own nails with gel.</li>
            <li> This gel polish is nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> I really liked this kit.</li>
            <li> I also really liked the color of the polish.</li>
            <li> I noticed how nice her nails are, they are shiny and look like salon done.</li>
            <li> I am by no means good at manicures or painting nails, but I was able to use this kit with no problems.</li>
            <li> I just spend $35 and can do my own nails time and time again.</li>
            <li> It looked flawless on my toes for three weeks, and only then just because my nails were growing lol.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s kind of the point, isn&#x27;t it??</li>
            <li> A nice sassy color.</li>
            <li> So if you want to get into doing your own soak off gels</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how nice they turned out and my manicure lasted about 2 weeks with the shine still there.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe a home gel manicure could look so nice.</li>
            <li> I have also found that Sensationail&#x27;s remover tool is quite handy and seems to make the polish easier to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> CVS has their own brand, cheaper and a lot of times on sale buy</li>
            <li> The color was beautiful and I really love it, but the light stopped working almost immediately.</li>
            <li> The thing I&#x27;m most impressed with is how pretty the polish looks on your nails.  </li>
            <li> You can also buy the sensational nails removal tool :)</li>
            <li> It was easy, the UV lamp was good quality, and my nails came out really nice.</li>
            <li> The UV lamp is excellent and very high quality, much better than the battery-operated lamps that some of these kits include.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End</li>
            <li> I can now have the best of both worlds, nails that last for two weeks and look good for work, and nails</li>
            <li> Product is very easy to use if you have experience painting and shaping your nails.</li>
            <li> its very easy to use (however, a lot of steps)</li>
            <li> I also find the removal is very easy contrary to what others have said of the gel polish removal.  </li>
            <li> Application was very easy.  </li>
            <li> Its very easy to do and very easy to remove off skin BEFORE curing.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the busy working woman!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love it!</li>
            <li> Stick to sensationail polish, I would love if they came out with more colors!</li>
            <li> ...be sure to check out my lovely hands in my pics!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure more will be coming!</li>
            <li> and it still works as great as it did the first time!</li>
            <li> Ok, I NEVER paint my own nails, just didn&#x27;t do it well.</li>
            <li> The led light is good and there is a timer with the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I am loving it more with each application.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with this kit so far.</li>
            <li> far as the polish while wearing, it has been great!  </li>
            <li> great alternative that is affordable, doable, and worth the time.</li>
            <li> anyway, great product and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> and WOW this is awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy so far.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a more affordable option than the OPI one in Sephora and the color options are just amazing.</li>
            <li> As far as wear goes, this is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> I like being able to do my own nails</li>
            <li> &amp; this was the best nail purchase I&#x27;ve made by far.</li>
            <li> The best part is its so easy to put on, i love that UV lamp, no worries about smudging or not being able to use your hands till the nail polish hardens ( always a lost cause, am i right ladies?).</li>
            <li> The polish removes fairly easily!</li>
            <li> And you can change colors and often as you want, and it&#x27;s easy to take off!</li>
            <li> This is a great and complete set to get my nails done, quickly, easily and they look GREAT.  </li>
            <li> This isnt perfect for a full 14 days but pretty close.</li>
            <li> Very nice kit that I used it right away  </li>
            <li> The hand that I did with all the SH products came out very nicely, however I feel like maybe the primer helps provide better and more full coverage of the polish.</li>
            <li> I added some glitter polish to cover up my not so perfect freehand French manicure, and I am very happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li> I am a very satisfied customer since I can paint my nails, have them dry immediately, and then to look perfect for a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Final result, however, is pretty awesome considering it was my first time doing a gel manicure on my own.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, the light, the polish, the process.  </li>
            <li> I imagine both will give you great nails that are pretty durable.</li>
            <li> I imagine both will give you great nails that are pretty durable.</li>
            <li> The process went very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It makes my nails feel nice and strong.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect perfect results the first couple of times, it takes some practice to get it right.</li>
            <li> While the outcome was beautiful it began peeling off the first time I did an easy set of dishes.  </li>
            <li> The kit is complete, works awesome, and it&#x27;s easy to do.  </li>
            <li> it loved it so much!!</li>
            <li> I love this kit.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> and I really love them!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not too impressed with the quality of the solid polish.</li>
            <li> With more practice I am sure I will get better at it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my nails now.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> adore the lamp :)</li>
            <li> I love this kit of sensationail gel polish.</li>
            <li> I applied a bit more around the edges and capped them a bit better even if I got polish on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this kit.</li>
            <li> I hope to get more proficient</li>
            <li> soak time was really more like 20-25 minutes before I could get gel off - and it did not slide off...</li>
            <li> /&gt;6-16-15: I really am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love my nails and with 1 more manicure, my starter kit (+1 color) will have paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> - i have received many compliments.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how forgiving the product</li>
            <li> I love having &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; looking nails, but I am NOT one to baby my nails.  </li>
            <li> (Be sure to swipe with the cleanser or rubbing alcohol to remove any residue at the end, or your nails will be sticky and not shiny.)  </li>
            <li> I have had acrylics many times and my nails are ruined afterwards.</li>
            <li> I did get some on my cuticles, but overall I am very happy and believe I&#x27;ll get better with time.</li>
            <li> I know I should have better restraint, however, I do</li>
            <li> So, I am GREATLY pleased by this product and recommend it to anyone else who is polish challenged.  </li>
            <li> I love to get my nails done</li>
            <li> :  Too many steps in application and REMOVAL is a pain in the A**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so then you soak some more, hack some more and meanwhile your fingers are wrinkly and smell like acetone not to mention what all this roughness does to the nails.  </li>
            <li> Love the light!</li>
            <li> You will love this light!</li>
            <li> and I love Sensationail nail colors, so</li>
            <li> I LOVE it and am still using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More fuzzies all over my nails.</li>
            <li> but thankfully since my nails are not set I am able to remove some of them as I am applying polish.</li>
            <li> It turns out that the polish IS set underneath the sticky layer on top and you can just wipe it away with the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure adding heat would have helped</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure adding heat would have helped</li>
            <li> The kit has more than paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I also wish they had a better selection of colors to choose from with the kit.</li>
            <li> I got the starter kit in Raspberry Wine, and I love the color.</li>
            <li> Ok, so here&#x27;s my thoughts....</li>
            <li> Try not to get any polish on your skin, and if you do, make sure you wipe it off before curing it.</li>
            <li> much better quality</li>
            <li> Some reviews mentioned there were too many steps, but considering you apply every 2 weeks instead of every 2 days</li>
            <li> I am SO glad that I invested in this kit.</li>
            <li> and I love them both.</li>
            <li> This meant I would spend lots of time changing my nail polish which in the end was more damaging than the soak off from this product.</li>
            <li> Be sure to buff off all of the shiny top coat before beginning the soak-off.</li>
            <li> I think this is more of a problem with darker colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this at home and cured my nails more than suggested since they were not setting.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to use a $2 off manufacturer&#x27;s coupon for them as well).</li>
            <li> I washed my hands and treated my nails and cuticles with my favorite oil, added my favorite hand lotion to my hands and let my nails breathe overnight.</li>
            <li> It seemed to me to probably be the most forgiving</li>
            <li> I thought perhaps I could avoid using the top coat to keep from having layers that got too thick-feeling, but after removing the tacky moisture layer from one finger after curing the raspberry wine, there was no shine.</li>
            <li> Hopefully that will also make it easier to remove without more damage to my nails till it&#x27;s all used up</li>
            <li> THOUT touching the edge.</li>

            <li> It is better than the gel polish they have switched to at the salon that I go to.</li>
            <li> I love getting gel polish done at the salon</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love being able to do my nails at home, and be in charge of when and how I&#x27;ll take care of my nails.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it would meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I get to be creative and save money bc</li>
            <li> I picked most of it off just while taking my dog for a walk, then got the remainder off with the removal tool they sell at Walmart ($4.99).  </li>
            <li> I have had many compliments on my nails.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind spending the time on a perfect manicure knowing it will last two weeks.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the current color on for 3 days and it still looks awesome.</li>
            <li> Watched youtube tutorials describing how to maximize the most wear from this product.</li>
            <li> Followed these directions to a T..still chipping and peeling and the MOST I got out of these Sensationail products was three days.</li>
            <li> AT MOST.</li>
            <li> I have been using the sensationail line for over 6 months and love it.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you have the removal tool for easier removal.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even embedded gems in the top coat with no problems.</li>
            <li> I love this gel polish kit.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get more colors.  </li>
            <li> While Im sure the manufacturers didn&#x27;t intend for consumers to use the product with regular nail polish, I find it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> I love changing my polish often</li>
            <li> Hope this helps...for someone that never got more than a day or two of polished nails before chips appeared..</li>
            <li> Love the end results.</li>
            <li> Gel polish is a pain to remove no matter what, though.  :-)</li>
            <li> (if you apply properly, CAP EDGE OF NAIL!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMOVAL - Here is the best way to remove and it takes all of about 7 minutes of soak time.&lt;br /&gt;Soak</li>
            <li> cotton ball in acetone, put on top of nail, cover with aluminum foil (all in kit directions).  </li>
            <li> A HEATING PAD ON TOP OF YOUR SOAKING NAILS.  </li>
            <li> You should be able to just lift the polish off without having to scrape.  </li>
            <li> #34;LOVE IT&amp;#34;.  Wasn&#x27;t sure how well the gel polish would hold up on my nails.  </li>
            <li> At $49.99 a box at most local retailers, etc., this is the best kit you could ask for if you are a gel nail person.  </li>
            <li> The result was ok, but not all fingers came out like starburst pattern on box.  </li>
            <li> The lamp alone makes this purchase worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re looking for a lamp and a chance just to try out the gel polish.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this in raspberry wine from target (because I didn&#x27;t want to wait for the shipping) and immediately I was in love.</li>
            <li> I am pleased and would recommend this to others.  </li>
            <li> If you value healthy nails</li>
            <li> and it was more like sample sizes.</li>
            <li> Nothing I did was able to remove.</li>
            <li> I love how the polish looks like I just did it.</li>
            <li> It works better when you heat the water in the microwave for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I paid $13 more.</li>
            <li> The polish comes off easier and it&#x27;s better for your hands.</li>
            <li> Spoilt by the fact that there is tax to be paid on this item before you can get it from the post office/man, more than doubled the price quoted on line.  </li>
            <li> MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> not even sure if it is a viable purchase for retailers.  </li>
            <li> The light has a built in timer which is handy.  </li>
            <li> and you need to make sure you follow the directions or</li>
            <li> I will be buying more soon</li>
            <li> still love the kit!I</li>
            <li> Love this product because it lasts and keeps me from biting my nails.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love gel nails.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this kit after a friend told me about how her and her daughter love this item.</li>
            <li> so make sure you shop around before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I got many compliments....</li>
            <li> and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE gel polish.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m finally free of the sadistic manicurists!  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s longevity is way better than the salon.</li>
            <li> My nails have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I love gel nail polish and</li>
            <li> I used the cotton ball soaked in acetone then wrapped in foil, and it took over 20 minutes to be able to get the gel off.  </li>
            <li> It was gooey for the most of a day.  </li>
            <li> My mom and I is enjoying this kit.</li>
            <li> We will buy more gel polish once we run out.</li>
            <li> and they ALL have a way better price than amazon.</li>
            <li> and I can get a lot more use out of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart and paid about $5 more for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more colors today</li>
            <li> Pour yourself a glass of wine and watch a favorite show while you wait for the remover to work.</li>
            <li> Any more</li>
            <li> Better 2 apply 3 coats as opposed to 1 or 2 thicker ones.</li>
            <li> Try to avoid touching the polish to your skin.</li>
            <li> I receive many compliments on my nails whenever I use this product, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> so the polish sticks better-</li>
            <li> love this product-</li>
            <li> so the base/top may be better too.  </li>
            <li> I love this kit.</li>
            <li> I love that there is no drying time</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad i took my chances on this.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say, I first noticed the cap wearing off after day 7 or so as well, so still remarkable wear all the way around.</li>
            <li> This time I used the rasberry wine color (very pretty) and I can say I&#x27;m still very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to save money by doing my own manicures.  </li>
            <li> The color is nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> This color is great and lasts, highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I received this product for $39.00 - a $20 discount and feel that this was a great price for a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Not only did I succeed at doing a manicure, it was so easy and looks so wonderful!  </li>
            <li> The manicure lasted for two weeks - looking as good as the first day.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good at home Shellac system.</li>
            <li> Anyways when I first used it I loved how it looked</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my sister for Xmas and was surprised at how easy it was!!!</li>
            <li> They have a new tool now that looks like a scraper, costs about $5 and works GREAT in helping remove polish.</li>
            <li> They have a new tool now that looks like a scraper, costs about $5 and works GREAT in helping remove polish.</li>
            <li> Love this product, my nails are strong and it&#x27;s been 4 days and no chips, still shine like the day I put the polish on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite easy to use. :-)</li>
            <li> Easy to use, plenty of product to do many manicures.  </li>
            <li> Super nice gel nail system.</li>
            <li> The greatest boon for me is that I don&#x27;t have to wait to dry...</li>
            <li> I bought this kit specifically because I&#x27;d used a friend&#x27;s light who had this same one and thought it was the perfect one for my needs.</li>
            <li> This is great -- I never had nice looking nails before, but this polish finally changed that.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the pink chiffon and raspberry wine shades best and really love the shiny finish that lasts for the duration of my manicure and pedicure.</li>
            <li> :) Capping the nail is definitely important; I&#x27;d also add that gel polish works better on longer nails.</li>
            <li> Really, it&#x27;s much easier to schedule time for removal of still great looking polish, than to fit in time for a polish as well.</li>
            <li> I pleased that they are coming out with more colors as the original ones didn&#x27;t knock me out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to do by yourself and fun to do with friends:)</li>
            <li> Great product for those of us that would like to find a cheaper way to still have a professional look.</li>
            <li> but I do my thumbs separately for better light curing coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great so far</li>
            <li> also love the fact that this is an LED light and not UV.</li>
            <li> I use sensationail colors with gelish&#x27;s foundation and their separate top coat and my gels stay on chip free FOREVER basically until I decide to remove them.</li>
            <li> So far, 5 days and counting and my nails are as shiny and perfect as the first day.</li>
            <li> Capping is the most important step and you should do this with each cure.  </li>
            <li> I had gel nails done at a salon and loved it so much that I bought this kit to do it at home.  </li>
            <li> I took the good advice of another reviewer who said to put the primer on very sparingly.  </li>
            <li> but the kit itself was nice and it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and it comes with a quick step guide sheet.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use, even the right hand looks ok!</li>
            <li> but they were expired, I wrote to them to let them know and within 24 hrs responded giving me new coupons that are good until July and that I can print and use as many times as I want.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My less-than-happy previous update is now replaced with me being a very happy long-term user that is quite satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> My less-than-happy previous update is now replaced with me being a very happy long-term user that is quite satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I am sure that as they get more popular they will add a bigger selection of colors, for now I will just order Pigment Gel and mix my own colors.</li>
            <li> Overall, loved the kit!  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this brand specifically because it had the best reviews out of all the other options I had.</li>
            <li> This product was super easy to use!</li>
            <li> I watched one of my favorite shows while doing this, so I had fun!</li>
            <li> Having got the salon shellac, it was easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> OMG it did NOT come off easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply if you follow the instructions provided.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal, and so much better then paying $35+ at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gel fell off so easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy as that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I get more into gel polish I may get a larger lamp but for now this is great for home use.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not one to change colors all the time, but like my nails to look nice, I really appreciate getting more time out of each manicure before removal</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not one to change colors all the time, but like my nails to look nice, I really appreciate getting more time out of each manicure before removal</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buff before hand, wrap the foils on for 10 minutes and it easily scrapes off.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use once you get the hang of how to do it</li>
            <li> Directions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> easy to do</li>
            <li> so easy and no damage to my nails.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Easy to do.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are easy to understand and seemingly thorough.  </li>
            <li> Easy to do after watching the tutorial on the Nailene Sensationail website.</li>
            <li> I removed the polish today fairly easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove.</li>
            <li> It was really easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is soooo easy to apply and after two uses it pays for itselt.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed at how easy it is to get a professional-looking manicure at home with SensatioNail Gel Polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;a easy to nake at home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Came out ugly!\\&quot; - make sure you clean your nails</li>
            <li> My nails were strong, and I had no evidence of the shellac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Taking this stuff off is kind of a pain because they just don&#x27;t lift very much.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Sensationail gel polish kit if you want to have a gorgeous, affordable manicure.</li>
            <li> At first, I was thrilled with the results of this gel polish.  </li>
            <li> It comes with the full size LED lamp, with plug, and that alone makes the purchase worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> Also, you have to buff the top layer to roughen it, and then give them the full 15 minutes in the remover....</li>
            <li> This is actually really impressive considering some of the other products out there!</li>
            <li> The way that a gel mani cures so quickly, with no drying time after, is really a huge plus!  </li>
            <li> (I know a lot of people like to be pampered and go to the spa as they do not have time to DIY- which is also fine)</li>
            <li> The lamp works just fine &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent deal to get the whole kit for this price (though generally it is cheaper in stores).</li>
            <li> Turn your finger from side to side to be able to see the edges better and know exactly how close you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Turn your finger from side to side to be able to see the edges better and know exactly how close you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I do get a chip its easy to touch up since I have the light and colors at home.  </li>
            <li> yes the starter bottles are small, yes it has many steps, for some it is a pain to remove, isn&#x27;t that why WE use it.......because it is a beautiful shiny manicure!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews of this product I was slightly hesitant to purchase it, however after receiving this and using it, I am very happy that I ordered it!</li>
            <li> My manicure looks PERFECT one week later on the first try.</li>
            <li> and I had a measurable way to realize that my nails grow more quickly than I might have guessed.</li>
            <li> The variety of gel colors is more than adequate.  </li>
            <li> Since I have found out how to remove it quickly, I am giving more stars.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long my polish lasts before chipping, but right now I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to apply and looked great on but only lasted about 3-4 days before it started peeling.</li>
            <li> The directions are incredibly easy, it takes barely any time at all, and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> I found it very easy to use and my first manicure lasted 9 days without a chip before I decided I wanted to change it</li>
            <li> I think I didn&#x27;t cap the nail perfectly and thats why it lifted, but it didn&#x27;t take me long to re-do it and the other nails looked great.</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, this wonderful little system!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied and would recommend!</li>
            <li> Heat helps speed the process too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to be able to use this product you will have to have a very steady hand and be able to keep the product off of your skin and cuticles as you work.</li>
            <li> This gives you the best \\&quot;feel\\&quot; for using the product with confidence and you&#x27;ll be able to quickly see some obvious do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts that should help you tackle the opposite (more challenging) hand.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how easy the kit was to use, and I am so excited I can do my nails now myself.  </li>
            <li> After about 6 months and a huge investment in nail polish colors the lamp no longer hardens the polish.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a huge amount of time saved that you&#x27;d otherwise spend redoing your manicure/pedicure</li>
            <li> is a huge bonus.</li>

            <li> I did put gel polish on the tip of the nail to seal it properly although I did not do a great job with it.</li>
            <li> free wipes,&lt;br /&gt;double</li>
            <li> The kit is basically the price of the purchase of a UV/LED light.</li>
            <li> I was looking at buying a cheap lamp with replaceable bulbs until I could afford a LED</li>
            <li> To remove... lightly file the surface, apply acetone on a cotton ball, wrap in foil, wait 15-20 minutes, remove and scrape away.</li>
            <li> it was when I tried forcing my nail free of my finger tip and getting a cut below my nail.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried a few but scraping it off works best for me.  </li>
            <li> We did one hand at a time and then cured with the light.</li>
            <li> The light will blink to let you know when 15 or 30 seconds are up for the curing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helpful that they give you a summarized reference card in addition to detailed instructions</li>
            <li> Take the lint free wipe, put some \\&quot;Gel</li>
            <li> You receive a buffer/filer, cleansing gel and lint free wipes, primer, the base/top coat, and polish plus the lamp.</li>
            <li> Also, the polish goes on much nicer if it&#x27;s warm</li>
            <li> It stays on great, but only for 5-8 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT POINT:</li>
            <li> bought this at Walmart for $50, it&#x27;s a great deal, especially because it has the LED lamp AND a color.  </li>
            <li> I lightly buffed off the shine.  </li>
            <li> It is also important to not get the product on your skin as some people can become allergic to gel products with repeated exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I went on the search for products cured with LED light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> Gel-ish has a free pamphlet in Sally&#x27;s stores that gives curing equivalents for LED lights</li>
            <li> Gel-ish has a free pamphlet in Sally&#x27;s stores that gives curing equivalents for LED lights</li>
            <li> Great alternative to traditional polish</li>
            <li> Manicures look great, would probably last 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic, comes with the light and everything you need to do up to 10 gel manicures yourself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard this light works with OPI</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this kit today &amp; attempted to use it &amp; the LED light appears to be defective would not even turn on.</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale, the kit with the light, after soaking off acrylic, polished my nails with this.</li>
            <li> Light has automatic alarm for 30 seconds and shuts off after 60 seconds, so you don&#x27;t even need to time the curing process.  </li>
            <li> Spread it on lightly.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> it is available at Walmart for $49.99.</li>
            <li> so I ordered it online with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> tip (where I go to is cheap)</li>
            <li> Instead of soaking all my fingers in acetone, I soaked lint free pads in 100% acetone, placed on my nails and wrapped in strips of aluminum foil.</li>
            <li> I ended up seeing the Sally Hansen gel nail LED light kit in Walgreens for $69.99</li>
            <li> Always remembering to use the LED light for 30 seconds in between layers.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see what the improvement of having a 60 light would give you.</li>
            <li> The lint free wipes are re-usable, I got about 8 uses out of one.  </li>
            <li> Remember though, paper towels are also lint free and seem to work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is that I got my kit on sale with an addtional 20% off promtion and free shipping at another website.  </li>
            <li> I ordered two Gelish colors and am going to try them with this LED light.  </li>
            <li> I had better success with this than any product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> to remove if you add acetone to cotton pad, wrap in foil, put on plastic gloves, and then lightly scrape after 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I got the kit for the LED light.</li>
            <li> I use this light with Gelish, Ibd,Sally Hansons soak off gel and bluesky gels</li>
            <li> If there was one thing I could change, it would be the size of the light, but even that isn&#x27;t a huge deal to me.</li>
            <li> the polish on what was left of my nail still looked great and didn&#x27;t flake off!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> : Definitely lightly buff your nails.  </li>
            <li> You can use the lint free pads they give you</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really fantastic.</li>
            <li> The nail polish doesn&#x27;t set until you put it under the LED light-</li>
            <li> Once you put it under that light though, consider it a temporarily permanent extension of yourself.</li>
            <li> As soon as it cures in the light you can go about your day-</li>
            <li> Gelish are much better with the salon quality colors that are fun and classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheap and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s an LED light rather than UV like some.  </li>
            <li> the end, I ended up using the light but buying CND base/top coat and Gelish colors.  </li>
            <li> I will probably try Gelish base/top as the colors last great</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Gorgeous, mirror like shine, gel manicure that looks incredibly professional.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to remove it completely yet without some stripping/weakening of my own nails.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to remove it completely yet without some stripping/weakening of my own nails.</li>
            <li> I tried several brands and this one is really the best.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I immediately bought 6 more colors.</li>
            <li> And wonderful nails two weeks at least :)</li>
            <li> Gel peeled right off, I bought the \\&quot;spatula\\&quot; for $5 that Sensationail sells, but you could do it with an orange stick too, make sure you lightly buff off the shine before soaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this product, I can finally say I love my nails!!</li>
            <li> The little light thingy is awesome and keeps the time for you and truly it was a painless, smellless and quick procedure.  </li>
            <li> Using their lint free wipe, clean nails with \\&quot;Gel Cleanser\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The result after using this product could be comparable to getting acrylics but for me not nearly as painful and my nails seem fine.</li>
            <li> The application of the polish was easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Normally I would blame the shipping company for something like this but the exterior packaging was in perfect condition leading me to believe that the product was in this condition when it left the warehouse...</li>
            <li> The kit has easy to follow directions and the application time is quick.</li>
            <li> best part is that the whole kit costs less than a full set of gels :)</li>
            <li> long as you follow the steps included your results will be great.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t go out of my way to write reviews for products, but I am so impressed with this that I had to!</li>
            <li> 100% worth trying!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got the time, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> and I am still using the original primer.</li>
            <li> I originally put it in plastic and it melted the plastic.</li>
            <li> I originally put it in plastic and it melted the plastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so excited to have found this product.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive and excited to receive this product</li>
            <li> Also, gel lasts a long time and is great for any one who has to spend a lot of time typing or sorting files/filing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for myself but ended up giving it to my sister in law.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Super quick shipping&#x27; ordered on wed, got Friday!</li>
            <li> definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this set.  </li>
            <li> Fast and easy to use!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be sure to read the instructions first before you start working on your nails specially if you haven&#x27;t used this type of contraption before and don&#x27;t allow distraction while you are doing your nails.</li>
            <li> I clean them well with a $1.07 bottle of  91% alchool and papertowels ( no lint).</li>
            <li> (File, clean, etc.)</li>
            <li> Someone told me that it is not quite the same as this kind of gel product, but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> The same person also recommended using a product called \\&quot;Nail Envy\\&quot;, which she says the pros use and is best for strengthening natural nails and preventing damage.</li>
            <li> Someone told me that it is not quite the same as this kind of gel product, but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> The same person also recommended using a product called \\&quot;Nail Envy\\&quot;, which she says the pros use and is best for strengthening natural nails and preventing damage.</li>
            <li> I am one of those whose manicure is rarely ever perfect for more then 2 minutes after having it done - can&#x27;t ever seem to make it without getting a nick on my nails, so when the manicurist offered gel with no dry time, it was a no-brainer to try it, despite the extra $15.</li>
            <li> This nail kit is great for people who don&#x27;t like waiting for nails to dry...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still giving the product 5 stars because my nails looked amazing for days and days, and my removal troubles were most likely user error.</li>
            <li> All in all after using this product for a few months it works great for an at home kit and is definitely better than paying salon prices.</li>
            <li> As far as the light quality goes, I&#x27;ve had mine for 6 months with no issue but lets be honest, this isn&#x27;t commercial/professional grade</li>
            <li> After finishing all coats and topcoat, clean the nail with the cleaner provided or alcohol.</li>
            <li> The company offers a nice variety of additional colors if you&#x27;re like me and enjoy mixing it up a bit.</li>
            <li> it was fast and good thanks</li>
            <li> and I have discovered it can easily be covered up successfully with a darker gel color without removing the entire manicure first.</li>
            <li> For the most part the polish came off in large chunks from my nail.</li>
            <li> You have to soak your nails in pure acetone for more than 15 min.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take more effort to clean off polish but as you are not having to paint your nails as often, I don&#x27;t find it to be that much of a hardship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyone having trouble with this system isn&#x27;t very bright and didn&#x27;t read the directions.</li>
            <li> I am hard on my hands so that is impressive!</li>
            <li> I am hard on my nails and this was a great investment!  </li>
            <li> a loaded brush full of product is not your friend with gel polish.  </li>
            <li> NEVER lasts two full weeks for me.  </li>
            <li> and I can get a good ten days out of my manicure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, a better solution would help.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I really do recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I had a good 1/8 of an inch re-growth, which to me was quite enough</li>
            <li> A chunk of change, but reasonable considering the cost of LED lights sold separately online was more than that just for the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then gently push it through the gel bubble to top it off.</li>
            <li> Then gently push it through the gel bubble to top it off.</li>
            <li> It is smaller which is good for keeping it in the drawer.</li>
            <li> I was glad to discover the  video as I was very worried about the difficulty in removing the polish.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this kit, I really did.</li>
            <li> The pros always used OPI and when I used a color from a different line it was never as good.</li>
            <li> I wrap acetone soaked pads around my fingers with aluminum foil and wait about 5 minutes and this removes the top layer of gel and the polish and then the bottom layer of gel i gently scrape off with my fingernail...</li>
            <li> it was full size when I opened</li>
            <li> While it is true that the removal is cumbersome, they do pratically peel off, but not in one full swoop.  </li>
            <li> I now have my nails done for a week and it still looks as good as the same day</li>
            <li> 3/4 &#x27;s. Paid full price.</li>
            <li> A nail professional warned me of that when I told her what kind of gel polish I had.</li>
            <li> I waited to write my review until I had gone through a full \\&quot;wear\\&quot; cycle.  </li>
            <li> The polish stayed on for 2 full weeks.  </li>
            <li> I looked up on YouTube as much as I can to make sure I did them correctly</li>
            <li> I used this kit multiple time with good results.</li>
            <li> I love it so much i bought one off of groupon for my mother.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The LED curing unit works well, and after the final cure/clean I am good to go...</li>
            <li> I tried Shellac gel polish in the salon last year and loved it.  </li>
            <li> My manicure is still gorgeous a week later!</li>
            <li> I figure with some practice, I can get the full 2 weeks out of it that I get when I get a gel manicure at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to try it again and see if I can get the full 2 weeks out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting full size bottles.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the full 2 weeks with ALL my nails, but I&#x27;d say I get 2 weeks with about 7-8 of them.</li>
            <li> really, don&#x27;t cheat on this, more time does make it quite a bit easier to get off.</li>
            <li> The majority of the timesaved during application is lost during the removal process, but when you think of the quality of the nails during wear, time saved not applying top coats every day, and the fast application</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty easy to get the hang of and gratifying</li>
            <li> The first time I did it, one nail did chip, but it&#x27;s so easy to fix it.  </li>
            <li> Shiny, easy, and fast!</li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t destroyed my nail, and it seems pretty easy to do after two weeks-</li>
            <li> I like the colors of SH MUCH BETTER, and the fact that their light is 30 seconds (which is exactly how much time SensatioNAIL says you need to do it...</li>
            <li> I like the colors of SH MUCH BETTER, and the fact that their light is 30 seconds (which is exactly how much time SensatioNAIL says you need to do it...</li>
            <li> At this point nails are still super, super tacky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like super glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a quick update.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like super glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a quick update.</li>
            <li> My water was actually more on the hot side, but not too hot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add color to get another 1-2 weeks or more before removal and provide the most strength possible as my nails grow out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add color to get another 1-2 weeks or more before removal and provide the most strength possible as my nails grow out.</li>
            <li> Regular polish with a bit of top coat works better.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with my order and it was dealt with quickly and politely.</li>
            <li> i quickly redo the nail in question.  </li>
            <li> , my nails grow quick so after a week you can start to see the color pull away from the cuticle area.</li>
            <li> Quick.  </li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t last the 2 weeks, as claimed, I think money wise, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> However, compared to regular polish a week without chips is exceptional.  </li>
            <li> Before starting, I read the instructions from top to bottom twice to make sure I understood them and to make the process easier</li>
            <li> STUFF WORKS!!!!! My polish stayed on for over two weeks and it was always super shiney like I had just walked out of a nail salon.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go for a few more days.</li>
            <li> but honestly I don&#x27;t find them totally lint free.</li>
            <li> I love the lamp - it is a high quality lamp.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and a professional gel manicure right now, but I will update after I see how it wears.</li>
            <li> I go super light on the first color application</li>
            <li> , I am overall very satisfied with the outcome.</li>
            <li> My first application, I did not apply primer, at the suggestion of one blogger, and so far my nails still look beautiful after nearly a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I had such a great experience with my starter kit, I&#x27;ve already purchased 2 more colors from this same brand.</li>
            <li> loved this kit and was amazed at how long the color lasted.  </li>
            <li> , it came off beautifully and without any trouble or damage to my nails.</li>
            <li> , it came off beautifully and without any trouble or damage to my nails.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product which I would recommend for someone starting to do their own gels.</li>
            <li> so if your polish is not coming off easily you will need to soak your nails in pure acetone to soften if you have trouble.ne piece, it sort of shaved off...</li>
            <li> That was almost a week and a half ago and my nails still look pretty good!</li>
            <li> my sister who is a hairdresser said to apply nail oil regularly to keep your nails in good condition which is a good idea regardless if you&#x27;re doing gel or any other polish.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it and can&#x27;t wait to try new colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps the main reason I&#x27;m so in love with Sensationail right now, is the quality of my nails after wearing the polish for almost two weeks:</li>
            <li> and I really have been intentionally not being easy on it.</li>
            <li> it came off so easily when I was ready to switch colors</li>
            <li> The actual nail kit was a gift, but my friend seems to love it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more colors for this kit soon!</li>
            <li> When i first got it i never stopped talking about it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I was certain I was going to get the SensatioNAIL kit, I bought their primer/gel cleanser/top coat/base coat kit, that did NOT contain the LED light.</li>
            <li> Tough to remove however, but I have found a great product that ships to many destinations including England and my gel polish is removed in 10mins.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered new colors and am excited to continue using it!</li>
            <li> Maybe when I become more familiar with the process, and better at giving myself a manicure, it will be less labor</li>
            <li> I really do like the lint free wipes and hope I can find some replacement ones when I need them.  </li>
            <li> but I also did one nail at a time since I have a needy toddler who demands attention frequently  :)  </li>
            <li> although I can see that the tips are beginning to wear (this could be my own fault though for not sealing the tip properly).</li>
            <li> I was able to achieve professional looking results that lasted for two weeks without a chip, dent, or scratch.</li>
            <li> This product may seem fun and safe, but it can ruin your natural nails.  </li>
            <li> (Amazon/Walmart offers a better price @ 36.00 than the company website @</li>
            <li> Next time I will trying the soaking method with a bowl of warm water as I&#x27;ve seen suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li> IT is so well worth the $$$.  </li>
            <li> The results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on the removal process but the results are worth a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li> but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have larger bottles of product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the fun one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the fun one.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Anyone can do it.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Someone in a review here gave the tip about using 100% acetone and putting the bowl holding the remover in a larger bowl with warm water.  </li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s worth the time and effort.  </li>
            <li> have also had success using Gelish nail polish with the lamp which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really fun.</li>
            <li> For the time and cost, it really isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> The base/top coat is ok though since it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li> and I love getting them done professionally.</li>
            <li> so I thought it was worth</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for several decades.  </li>
            <li> This product is well worth the price, if you can paint nails, you can do this.</li>
            <li> , I thought it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> I decided it was worth the try.</li>
            <li> and they are still shiny and look freshly polished.</li>
            <li> It was worth $50!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gone with just the clear topcoat for a natural look and loved</li>
            <li> She says she gets 2 weeks out of them, which she said between that and the look of the gel, well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> My advice is to take your time and make sure everything is comfortably near you.</li>
            <li> The raspberry wine color is also beautiful, though it doesn&#x27;t seem as dark in person as the box shows, I still love the deep red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i would say its definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> and it is so worth the price of the kit.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I wore acrylic nails for years, and finally was able to break free from them, saving my nails, and thousands of dollars.</li>
            <li> It really does last a GOOD 10-14 days.</li>
            <li> Of those three, nailuv is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny and paid for itself in just one use.</li>
            <li> Some tips I&#x27;ve discovered useful</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.   </li>
            <li> Just did my first DIY Gel mani last night and it was so easy and looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> my right hand looks as amazing as my left...</li>
            <li> Once gel is soft it can easily be removed with the flat side of the manicure stick included with the Sensational kit.</li>
            <li> Also, its just as easy to apply as normal nail polish.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use gloves to clean or wash dishes so my nail polish would never last more than 3-4 days without chipping and</li>
            <li> I will admit, the french tips tear easily but are relatively easy to apply -</li>
            <li> Very upset with this I was so excited when I got ....</li>
            <li> For those of you who complain the product \\&quot;peels right</li>
            <li> It takes time and patience to get it right.</li>
            <li> I just had a coupon and it was also on sale so the timing was right for the purchase because of the discounts.</li>
            <li> I just had a coupon and it was also on sale so the timing was right for the purchase because of the discounts.</li>
            <li> Right now, I&#x27;m using the gelish basics kit with my color gels.  </li>
            <li> Take your time and do it right.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase a gel kit, but after reading a lot of positive reviews (and since it was on sale!)</li>
            <li> Honestly, when I bought this kit I didn&#x27;t expect the polish to stay on my nails because nothing has in the past for more than a day.</li>
            <li> I chose to try my own method first before utilizing those listed in various reviews online or even in the directions.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the LED over UV light and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the LED over UV light and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> far I am happy with the results, I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if it lasts as long as the salon manicure</li>
            <li> I bought the kit with Raspberry Wine, its a beautiful, deep color with tiny sparkles.</li>
            <li> , I changed the color after 7 days but had absolutely no chipping, that was using the sensational bonder, base/top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think Sensational says some people&#x27;s nails are harder to remove it from than others.</li>
            <li> Follow the (simple) instructions and you will have a beautiful, lasting manicure.</li>
            <li> Just use the product the color is more of a dark rose pink, but system is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> THEY PEEL/CHIP VERY EASILY AND YELLOW.</li>
            <li> Gel are not good but LED Lamp device is very good.</li>
            <li> Nails still going strong after 12 days, still looking like professional job, but you must follow directions to the T!</li>
            <li> My nails look beautiful and wasn&#x27;t as hard to do as I thought .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of a nutball when it comes to painting my nails, so I do take my time, but I can complete a new set in about 45 minutes (not including removal time).  </li>
            <li> I find that the foil wrap method is the best - it keeps acetone off the back of your fingers and is less drying, the polish seems to come off quicker, plus you will have semi-functional mobility with your hands even with the wraps on.</li>
            <li> In the meantime I am using regular polish with one clear gel coat of SensatioNail on top for strength and protection to give better wear.</li>
            <li> In the meantime I am using regular polish with one clear gel coat of SensatioNail on top for strength and protection to give better wear.</li>
            <li> I used the color Caffeine Fix (about $15)and got the most amazing deep purplish red color on my nails.</li>
            <li> The polish is beautiful and stays that way for at least two Weeks.</li>
            <li> I just tried my first home gel manicure, and so far, I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic starter kit for those who want to save a little money and do their own Gel Nail Polish at home.</li>
            <li> Lamp only fits 4 fingers but great overall</li>
            <li> You could just as easily use clear.</li>
            <li> The system is very easy--it has a quick step-by-step guide and no timer is needed because there&#x27;s automatic shut-off.</li>
            <li> That said, the clear stays on easily two weeks.</li>
            <li> I tried this kit and was surprised at how easy it was.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second application currently, and I think it&#x27;s going great</li>
            <li> It certainly looks nice for a long time but to me, it just wasn&#x27;t worth the time and aggrivation.  </li>
            <li> dry time is almost instantaneous with this product, so application should take quite a bit LESStime than with conventional polish, and the finish is perfect.</li>
            <li> Considering I could never get a mani to last more than 5 days in the past, I welcome 12.</li>
            <li> Nice for growing out problem nails, but not so great to have manicures done on a regular basis at a salon because with such fast re-growth a new professional manicure every 10 days would be cost-prohibitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your natural nails are pretty strong then you can probably get away with this method as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your natural nails are pretty strong then you can probably get away with this method as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is unbelievably quick as well--which is good because I have no patience and have always messed up my polish in the past.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Gel system and have made marvelous discoveries: I simply use the clear gel on my natural clear nails.</li>
            <li> This kit, which included an LED drying lamp was very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> not sure what the convenience factor is of having a 60 sec light), is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> not sure what the convenience factor is of having a 60 sec light), is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> like I said, very very forgiving.</li>
            <li> Its 7 watts vs. other light systems with way more wattage 25, 36 &amp; even 54 watts</li>
            <li> A quick google will show that many individuals who own pets have found that the beep is not a great thing.  </li>
            <li> I like the gel polish it lasts longer than regular polish and is so easy and quick to use.  </li>
            <li> On the fourth try I used the stick to clean it up and about 20 minutes post application all of my nails are free from my finger tips and the edges are cleaned up which is where it tended to be the areas where I would first see the polish breaking away or falling off about 10 days in.</li>
            <li> After doing the first nail</li>
            <li> if you are willing to put in the time, this kit will produce salon quality results.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> My first application of this lasted over a week.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much harder to do my own nails than if I had a friend helping me.</li>
            <li> I had healthy nails my entire life until I used this product.  </li>
            <li> 2)Always wipe nails with gel cleanser/ alcohol after you apply and cure the final top coat.</li>
            <li> I used the kit for the first time</li>
            <li> The first time I tried wrapping my nails in foil with acetone soaked cotton.</li>
            <li> The second time I tried soaking my nails in 100% acetone and that worked better but still a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li> followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li> When I added the 2nd coat of polish and top coat, some of the polish moved around and let a &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34; on my nail.</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m pleased with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would rate it higher</li>
            <li> I remove the tacky film with the alcohol and apply my favorite REGULAR NAIL polish color!</li>
            <li> more like a scrape, but it was only 12 days out.</li>
            <li> I never bother writing product reviews (this is my first)</li>
            <li> It worked exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll admit i ignored this the first three applications.</li>
            <li> The only thing that made me give three stars was there were many steps to application.  </li>
            <li> First of all who has time to soak their hands in acetone for 15 minutes and then hack away fleck by fleck?  </li>
            <li> And it does NOT work well the first time</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Polish looks great for at least two weeks.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using this</li>
            <li> It was not difficult whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Your hands don&#x27;t look pretty during this process.</li>
            <li> Some people put the bowl of acetone into another bowl of hot water.</li>
            <li> Some people put the bowl of acetone into another bowl of hot water.</li>
            <li> This is much better than the tiny one finger lamp some of the starter sets have.</li>
            <li> finished manicure is just as glossy and smooth as any professional can achieve.</li>
            <li> The reds are stunning, especially the ruby shade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous top coats and anti chip polishes and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Make sure you push back your cuticles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d love to see the seller offer some variety packs of nail polish, rather than buying only one at a time...</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and this product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Do not cure the product with it on your cuticles - you will not be able to remove it later.</li>
            <li> I would appreciate seeing more of a color selection in the future from Nailene</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first time using DIY gel product</li>
            <li> It should be nearly hot.  </li>
            <li> It look so pretty and shiny, but after a couple of hours I washed the dishes and the gel started to fall out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it looks pretty as your putting it on</li>
            <li> I finally gave in and tried it, and I&#x27;m soooo glad I did.  </li>
            <li> but it was my first time doing gel nails</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried an at home gel polish.  </li>
            <li> this will shorten the life of my manicure, but I&#x27;l get better at it next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, this was my first experience with any gel nail product.  </li>
            <li> , I used the expresso colored nail polish, application went faster because I knew what to do much better the second time.</li>
            <li> I love the look of painted nails, but given the countless dishes and baby bottles</li>
            <li> Requires more layers and curing time than regular gel colors.  </li>
            <li> Just removed my first manicure with this kit.</li>
            <li> and you get so much more wear out of this than regular polish,</li>
            <li> The light has a timer and does stay on for the full 60 seconds, but does beep at the 30 second mark</li>
            <li> but then, I had to have a first run.  </li>
            <li> and here I am 8  days later still enjoying the application.  </li>
            <li> I love to paint my nails but have gotten fed up with polish chipping the next day.</li>
            <li> Place the acetone bowl inside of the hot water bowl.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> so I figure I should only get better with the application process.  </li>
            <li> Nails are shiney, durable, and the color is pretty.</li>
            <li> love the colors, especially the magnetic polish.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the French mani, but I don&#x27;t have any pics (yet)</li>
            <li> today is day 10 and mine have grown out from the cuticle to nail area and that doesn&#x27;t look pretty</li>
            <li> Considering that a regular manicure lasts about 20 minutes on me, it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I never used to paint my nails because they would chip or get ruined the very day I painted them!</li>
            <li> First off, if you have NEVER went to a salon and got gelish, CND Shellac or OPI gels nails first, please do so before buying.</li>
            <li> It will get you acquainted with this process, especially the removal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S Do your thumbs first, then your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cured for an extra 15-30 secs to be on the \\&quot;safe side\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The color in this kit is really pretty too.</li>
            <li> Works exactly like it does in nail salon.</li>
            <li> First file, shape and buff.</li>
            <li> Really lasts!</li>
            <li> It looks really pretty and shiny, and I like the color.</li>
            <li> I would definitely see if there are better deals in your area before purchasing from here.</li>
            <li> The first time I did my nails, I took my time and used the video on the SensatioNail website as a guide.</li>
            <li> being my first time doing the manicure and not sealing the edges thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I had ordwred this after having my gel nails done at a salon for the first time.</li>
            <li> In my first try, the gel polish didn&#x27;t harden AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> After a shower the next morning, more peeling nails.</li>
            <li> If you are interested, Sensationail has coupons to print on their page, a $5 off on the starter kit and a $1 off for the polishes.  </li>
            <li> Over two weeks without so much as a chip!</li>
            <li> I did my first manicure at home</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this investment is way better than dropping $7 - $9 on regular polish that chips in 1-2 days.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy it locally because I was sure it wouldn&#x27;t work on my nails.</li>
            <li> If you are careful, you CAN do reasonably nice touchups.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product has SAVED me time, with better looking nails as a result.</li>
            <li> (most times I can still see my nail through it) then on the second coat of color</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first \\&quot;gel\\&quot; kit.  </li>
            <li> I cap the ends of my nails first, and then paint them to avoid a ridge at the end.</li>
            <li> I also do both thumbs first, start to finish, and then the four fingers on each hand at a time.</li>
            <li> The first application lasted 17 days, and I type all day at work, and hand wash the dishes.  </li>
            <li> but this one really works!</li>
            <li> time: my first chip happened on day 12 of wear.</li>
            <li> All but one of my nails left the removal process undamaged, and I&#x27;m confident that what I learned from the first removal will prevent any recurrent scrapes in the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The LED cure lamp is very well made, and looks very nice, and big enough for 4 fingers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love these gel polishes because my natural nails are very strong, but the regular polsh NEVER lasts more than a few days..............</li>
            <li> light is only big enough for 4 fingers at a time and thumbs together, which may be best since if you put your whole hand in leaves your thumb naturally at a side.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the application is super easy and much faster than regular polishes.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sensational nail kit for a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really easy to use and didn&#x27;t take a super long time, however if you have to remove gel polish and prep your nails</li>
            <li> I also keep the finger I&#x27;m working on flat on the top of the counter or table.</li>
            <li> I bought the removal tool as well, but they came off cleanly and with NO damage to my natural nails.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t soak, any longer, I simply sand off any/some Gel that has lifted or wants to come off and re-apply more get.</li>
            <li> the Sensationail Nail Colors used with the KISS Top and Base Coats and LED lamp are a PERFECT combination!!!</li>
            <li> Be sure to use the blade parallel to your nail and very s-l-o-w-l-y</li>
            <li> Be sure to use the blade parallel to your nail and very s-l-o-w-l-y</li>
            <li> Looked at several different kits and this one had lots of good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Even not doing that I find if I use three coats of color instead of two I will easily get a full two weeks without a single chip!  </li>
            <li> The actual LED light differences are that the SensatioNAIL LED light has a 60 second light, and the Sally Hansen has a 30 second light.</li>
            <li> LED lamp works beautifully and is a very big upgrade from the single-nail lamp I was previously using.  </li>
            <li> I also did the nails of other women and Sensational have new fans.</li>
            <li> The color is spotty and looks strange but I still used the top coat and primer.</li>
            <li> I have found that the polish will last much longer if you really pay attention to capping the nail with the polish and top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie at home manicures and found this pretty straight forward to use.</li>
            <li> started kit pretty much had everything.</li>
            <li> I used to get my nails done regularly, but after becoming unemployed, I stopped.</li>
            <li> The polish lasts through a lot of dish washing, house work, laundry and some pretty intense cleaning.</li>
            <li> but I really wanted to have a pretty manicure.  </li>
            <li> I have had salon gel manis in the past, and really loved the shine and longevity.  </li>
            <li> I figure it&#x27;s worth the money since I&#x27;d normally pay around $50 per gel manicure at the salon.</li>
            <li> LATER:&lt;br /&gt;I have learned that as long as I don&#x27;t use too many layers of the product, it comes off nicely without damage to my nails (particularly when I rough it up with the Emory board they provide).</li>
            <li> LATER:&lt;br /&gt;I have learned that as long as I don&#x27;t use too many layers of the product, it comes off nicely without damage to my nails (particularly when I rough it up with the Emory board they provide).</li>
            <li> Also the fact that you can go to Walmart and pick up additional colors for special occasions is a major plus!</li>
            <li> First I shaped my nails with the file provided, pushed my cuticles back and lightly buffed my nails.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and results last!</li>
            <li> There are multiple videos on Youtube that show you easy ways to remove the polish</li>
            <li> It is deep and red and very sexy.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about gel polish is not having to wait for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> Easy on and looked great—but only for two days.</li>
            <li> Overall, I found this kit neat, easy to use, and convenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easily corrected the 2nd time around.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The resulting manicure looked just as good though didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> The resulting manicure looked just as good though didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> First time I put it on, I applied it like I applied regular nail polish and also experienced a little peeling.</li>
            <li> I used pure acetone</li>
            <li> When I tried to get it off it took 2 hours of soaking in pure acetone and scraping.  </li>
            <li> hope this helps!t be certain.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a large variety of colors</li>
            <li> It is so easy to apply, and dries so much faster than regular polish...</li>
            <li> After investing in this starter kit, I have purchased 4 other colors, and I have mastered the process to get my polish to last for a week, which is amazing to me!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review when I see how long this lasts compared to professional manicures - but so far I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with results (this is gelon my natural nails, not acrylic).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve invested about $75 in polish/lamp/refills so far, and I easily have 10 more manicures left in the various colors I&#x27;ve got.  </li>
            <li> Mine worked great in the beginning, I agree it is tough to get it off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this for any first time user.</li>
            <li> This was better better than my usual 3 times a week polish change!!</li>
            <li> This will prove to be a huge no-no later with the lint from cotton.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The LED light is also much safer than similar UV application</li>
            <li> I found this polish much easier to put on and much prettier afterwards.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really take care of them like I should.  </li>
            <li> I really like the LED</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I cleared off as much polish as I could from my skin before I cure them.</li>
            <li> I am fairly accomplished at nail polishing and nail art, and I found the gel polish to have a bit of a learning curve.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well, IF YOU FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS.</li>
            <li> However, I get FULL 10 days out of the manicure before I start seeing general wear that prompts me to take it off and start over.  </li>
            <li> (the whole reason I use Gel is No Drying Time)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really hurts the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second you put your hand under the LED light you will be able to clearly see all mistakes and learn what not to do next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second: T-A-K-E  Y-O-U-R  </li>
            <li> It is critical IMHO to brace or secure EACH hand and some fingers as you apply the gel polish.</li>
            <li> : Pay attention to the warnings about using too much gel polish on the brush at once.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier than you think to get too much.</li>
            <li> When applying top coat, be careful not to get carried away.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see that it removes any of the shine, but it does leave a smooth feel without any detectable bubble (if done properly, you can&#x27;t tell there was a bubble, either by sight or feel; except on VERY close, intense inspection).</li>
            <li> and then when it&#x27;s grown out too much to my liking</li>
            <li> and I really like the strength of my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> and I really like the strength of my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really stays on for two weeks with out peeling</li>
            <li> Stays shiny the whole time, looks just like a salon manicure.</li>
            <li> and I really like this one.</li>
            <li> And cures very well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the nail polish gel colour too much</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> is more pink</li>
            <li> The more you use, the harder it will be to remove.  </li>
            <li> But who wants to pay $90 for a gel mani/pedi?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t end up using it that much</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for your DIY gel manicure needs!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve found that it is much easier to just peal it off.  </li>
            <li> it takes FORVER (like 25 minutes of soaking) to really loosen it, and then I have to scrape my nails with a metal scraper to get it off to the point where sometimes I&#x27;ve damaged the nail bed.</li>
            <li> Takes about 15-30 minutes to finish (I applied four layers) and saves you SOOOO much money from having to go to the salon.  </li>
            <li> you cannot put your whole hand in the uv lamp.  </li>
            <li> From start to finish the whole process took about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Color is even better than I expected, too.</li>
            <li> VERY flimsy.</li>
            <li> It kept coming apart the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Also, it is very shiny and stays that way for the whole two weeks.</li>
            <li> My nails are longer than they have ever been, thanks to the added strength of the gel.</li>
            <li> it really is a starter kit .</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I removed the pink polish yesterday, I was actually able to peel it off with acetone</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still very shiny.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re getting pooling, you&#x27;ve got too much on your brush.</li>
            <li> still highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> But the light and the actual polish from SH are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> VERY DISSATISFIED...</li>
            <li> This is a 7 Watt lamp which will cost almost as much as the kit itself and can be use with any brand of led gel</li>
            <li> I do like the kit, just can&#x27;t believe how much it is on here.</li>
            <li> It took me about an hour for the whole process.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;tknow why Amazon is charging so much.  </li>
            <li> voila ready to tackle the world with no worries...</li>
            <li> I used the same light and it works well.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the instructions carefully and faithfully to succeed.</li>
            <li> The whole thing took 30 minuts tops</li>
            <li> (I was being very carefull).</li>
            <li> But, it really does work</li>
            <li> I was dreading removal, but really didn&#x27;t have any problems getting it off.</li>
            <li> I found I really had to sit at the table, spread everything out in front of me, and work through it methodically.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not out that much money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way, it is MUCH cheaper than going to the salon.</li>
            <li> Shake polishes VERY well.  </li>
            <li> You can remove them with cotton balls/rounds and tinfoil pieces, but buying the pre-made ones are so much easier.</li>
            <li> sounding too infomercial-ly, I can tell you that this product really solved all of those problems</li>
            <li> I believe part of the reason that the polish is only lasting a week is based on my own faults in application.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased the Gelish kit by Harmony for over $50.00 but found myself  looking for a LED light as my old 20ish year old UV lamp was only nine watts</li>
            <li> I have had naturally strong and long nails my whole life.  </li>
            <li> An old makeup brush dipped in acetone before I cure cleans things right</li>
            <li> Ive had no problems with this, I find it easy to use and as long as you follow the directions</li>
            <li> My nails are soooo long now because they are amazingly strong with the polish on them.</li>
            <li> Before I knew it, all my nails were clean and ready to go to the next step.</li>
            <li> All my other nails seem OK</li>
            <li> Normally I would had to have painted them 3 times by now!</li>
            <li> At this point I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has some skill doing their own nails and wants to save one money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also used other gel polishes with this system and it works, gives you more choices of color.</li>
            <li> Make sure the regular polish is completely dry, then do a final top coat and cure.</li>
            <li> It was even easy to spice it up by sprinkling on a little glitter before curing the second coat and adding the top coat.</li>
            <li> The polish doesn&#x27;t really dry, so it makes that part easy.</li>
            <li> I figured out during process that if lint sticks to polish after curing you can clean it up with the \\&quot;Gel Cleanser\\&quot; and continue on to next step of polishing.</li>
            <li> I washed the dishes after, clean up, and open packages after and I did not find any chip at all.</li>
            <li> I garden with them, clean with them, change my bike inter tube tires multiple times with them;</li>
            <li> If you go in a circle around the edge as described, the center portion will lift off quite easily and then the edges will come off better once the center part is gone.</li>
            <li> The key to doing it right is to follow all the directions!</li>
            <li> They have a good selection of color but not super extensive.  </li>
            <li> This is far better than trying to paint my nails and let them dry before my daughter wakes up from a nap.</li>
            <li> It stays glossy and chip free  as long as you cap each nail off as directed.</li>
            <li> First, the product beeps to let you know when 30 seconds has passed (the time it take to cure the clear polish) which scared my dog a lot.  </li>
            <li> FOR COLORS: Don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t have completely even coverage of the first color coat.</li>
            <li> FOR COLORS: Don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t have completely even coverage of the first color coat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but well made and works nicely.</li>
            <li> The small gel polishes, alcohol, wipes, and primer are nice additions, however I have to say the quality of the color polish is lacking.</li>
            <li> The instruction are not bad as some people mentioned (read before doing), hence my advice above (get a professional gel manicure first).</li>
            <li> did a test: one hand got the full treatment of SensatioNAIL products, in the correct order, following the directions to the letter.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple days before I went &amp; got my first professional Shellac manicure, so I had to wait a couple wks to use it on myself.</li>
            <li> Although my professional Shellac mani was pretty....</li>
            <li> After that I found I was easily able to use my thumbnail to gently push/scrape the flakes from my entire nail in long steady light pressure motions starting from the cuticle to the tip.</li>
            <li> LED lights are also usually very expensive but with this kit you get a nice little LED light and trial sizes of the Sensationail products for a good price.</li>
            <li> Because there are so many other reviews I won&#x27;t go into that other than to say it was easy for me and my nails look amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wait to try new colors!</li>
            <li> I could go much longer without a fill because my nails still look new and shiny even after 3+ weeks of nail growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you find a bubble, use a mostly dry brush to smooth it till it&#x27;s satisfactory.</li>
            <li> If you find a bubble, use a mostly dry brush to smooth it till it&#x27;s satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Application with the pink chiffon was quite easy.  </li>
            <li> The more you put on, the more difficult it is to take off gel.</li>
            <li> The more you put on, the more difficult it is to take off gel.</li>
            <li> To me, this was gentler on my hands than soaking my fingers in acetone because the moist paper towel was only on top of my nails and not all over my fingers/skin (except for the crook of alternated fingers on the opposite</li>
            <li> Make sure that cuticles are pushed back and the product is covering ONLY the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so pleased to have a completed manicure in such a short time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very nimble and was still able to apply it so my nails looks as if professionally done.  </li>
            <li> My nail polish usually last one day if I&#x27;m lucky with out chipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the main reason I use it.</li>
            <li> Especially since for all 12 days it looked much better than any of the 5 days of a regular mani.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> think this is a great product and think it should last at least 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The bottles of polish were smaller than I was expecting but for the price and knowing I will want a variety of colors I will definitely be looking for more.  </li>
            <li> this became my holiday/Valentine&#x27;s Day red just because it is more  red in color than the box color indicates.  </li>
            <li> I started getting manicures because my nails were feeling weak, but the people would buff my nails too much making them weaker and once they didn&#x27;t even put the top coat on right and my nails were matte in certain areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used with Gelish polishes also and they work too (cured for 30 seconds, 2 coats) - this is important because the SensatioNail color palette is somewhat limited (though expanding).</li>
            <li> I got the French manicure set at my local Walmart and was very excited about it.</li>
            <li> Very tricky to get right and last 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> it looked high quality.</li>
            <li> Price is sort of high.</li>
            <li> I researched the various products available and weighed the info and concerns related to UV light versus LED during the time the initial gel manicure was growing out.</li>
            <li> Once it pools in the cuticle area or along the sides, or even gets on your skin, it&#x27;s really challenging to clean up easily without just wiping it all off and starting over, thereby wasting expensive product.</li>
            <li> and all, I highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> One day I went to the salon and had shellac done, it was a little more pricey</li>
            <li> Every time I have painted my nails, it gets a little better.  </li>
            <li> I use a very good base coat, top coat, and thinner layers and still chips the next day.</li>
            <li> Rotate the flat finger from left to right to be sure you&#x27;re covering close enough to each side edge.</li>
            <li> Additionally, with regular polish, I would have been preserving my polish with a new top coat daily or at least every other day, but with Sensationail I did nothing and had a beautiful gloss on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> LED lamp is big enough to fit your whole hand</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s used it three times so far and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> It really does look like I got my nails professionally done, and I&#x27;ve already used the kit to do my friend&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> NOT TO MENTION VERY DAMAGING TO THE NATURAL NAILS...</li>
            <li> I have had better luck with Sally Hansen Miracle Gel (no light) and the Miracle Gel topcoat.</li>
            <li> I pray they will begin to grow out normally again.  </li>
            <li> My nails would always chip with normal polish</li>
            <li> we recently had fun with water-marbeling on our nails and he Gel kept the polish on for over a week.</li>
            <li> Finally, apply one more thin coat of \\&quot;Base/Top Coat\\&quot; and cure for 30 more</li>
            <li> The traces of gel normally stick to where you had placed your primer.</li>
            <li> It was fun but don&#x27;t expect it to last weeks or anything.</li>
            <li> The traces of gel normally stick to where you had placed your primer.</li>
            <li> It was fun but don&#x27;t expect it to last weeks or anything.</li>
            <li> So, top coat seems necessary with colors (except the clear French kit).</li>
            <li> : I have come up with my own solution to remove missed bubbles (which I somehow have managed to have at least one of on one finger each time).</li>

            <li> : I have come up with my own solution to remove missed bubbles (which I somehow have managed to have at least one of on one finger each time).</li>
            <li> I had the second color on for 8 days, it was starting to peel up next to the cuticle, but I&#x27;m still happy it lasted that long.</li>
            <li> It starts chipping almost immediately with normal wear.</li>
            <li> Saves lots of money considering it is normally about $35-40 in the city for a gel manicure.  </li>
            <li> Lasted the full 2 weeks only one small chip love the color</li>
            <li> Its rare for me to find a product I like enough to leave a review</li>
            <li> I agree the instructions are pretty long but worth reading since the outcome looks like my professional gel manicure.</li>
            <li> Proper removal is worth the time and effort.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find removal to take awhile, but the trade off is worth it to me since I only polish every 10 days or so</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the tiny splurge.</li>
            <li> The polish would not last but a week but the lamp itself was well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> so if your polish is not coming off easily you will need to soak your nails in pure acetone to soften if you have trouble.</li>
            <li> BEFORE you cure it with the light, if you mess up polishing take a foam eye shadow applicator dipped in a tiny bit of nail polish remover and clean up your cuticles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it is relatively easy, if a bit time consuming because you must be careful.</li>
            <li> I love this set, and the convenience of having my nails dry instantly!</li>
            <li> polish stays on up to three weeks (toes last longer then finger nails) and is easy enough to remove.</li>
            <li> I have a new, clean straight edge and literally VERY CAREFULLY shave the head</li>
            <li> I have a new, clean straight edge and literally VERY CAREFULLY shave the head</li>
            <li> By day 2, my thumb nail began chipping and polish peeled right off on my upper part of the nail.</li>
            <li> My nails are very short right now</li>
            <li> Not only do instructions not tell you that curing doesn&#x27;t set your base/top coat but your nail surfaces are quite sticky right now</li>
            <li> I can use Genadur over my Nailene manicure and the nails soak it right up, which means that the Nailene product allows your nails to absorb treatment products even while you are wearing gel polish; it does not prevent your nails from getting enough oxygen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was less impressed with the other tiny, tiny, bottles of gel cleanser, base/top coat, gel color, and primer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Knowing what I know today, I would have found a bigger light for the same price, but this product is decent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m only on my second application, so keep that in mind, but I did wear the first application out till the first chip and went through the removal process, and have much to say about Sensationail!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed the directions on the back, except I let the last coat of polish dry under the light twice to make sure it had set properly.</li>
            <li> This is awesome, for less then one regular mani/pedi lasting about one day you can get ten manis lasting 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I was so excited until I opened it and saw that the primer was COMPLETELY EMPTY.</li>
            <li> You will need to cure thumbs separately due to the space under light.  </li>
            <li> For those who are insinuating that their gel polish came off in just days due to the product being cheap, ineffective, etc.</li>
            <li> The LED light also works with other brands of gel polish.  </li>
            <li> I use my own, that is a little bit finer, which might make the next part a non issue for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> n&#x27;t it&#x27;s a flaw I&#x27;ve learned to live with.  </li>
            <li> We live in the country and have animals and I garden and do not wear gloves.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in live with the color.</li>
            <li> but the polish was still shiny and new .</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon and they immediately shipped out a new kit with 2 day delivery.  </li>
            <li> and I definitely learned several lessons right away with the first application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to scrape off the polish without using any remover and very little effort with that handy little tool and it only takes a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li> Fairly easy, took about a half hr.</li>
            <li> I like the sheer pink look anyway and had used that on my nails more than anything else for years</li>
            <li> and I have a nice investment in my regular polish that I didn&#x27;t want to waste.</li>
            <li> I did also find that if you use regular nail polish, apply the gel coat to it, and let it cure under the light for two minutes (each hand, alternating); you get the same results as using the shellac nail polish.  </li>
            <li> At the end of all the steps my nails were dry and set and super shiny.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have is the timer on the UV light is only for 30 seconds</li>
            <li> Not sure how they justified shipping it out in the first place.</li>
            <li> but I did not due to the limited colors that are available from this maker.</li>
            <li> so it was a very natural combination and look for me.</li>
            <li> You do have to be very careful when applying, as anything touching your cuticles or skin will ruin the lasting power of the mani, but with practice this is not hard to do.</li>
            <li> And there is normally a clear difference, since I&#x27;m not ambidextrous!  </li>
            <li> I was happy to see several products become available to the general public for home use, but was skeptical about quality and DIY results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am excited to try the French Nail Tips kit that were recently launched.</li>
            <li> Refill kits I think are slightly higher or around same price.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Do use care when using the scraper not to dig in and damage natural nail!</li>
            <li> Do use care when using the scraper not to dig in and damage natural nail!</li>
            <li> I have some polish on my skin which hasn&#x27;t washed off despite frequently scrubbing my hands, but whatever, I just know to be more careful next</li>
            <li> /&gt;ONE MONTH LATER:&lt;br /&gt;After using the product several times now I can say with certainty that I am most likely going to abandon use of SensatioNail after the current supply from the starter kit is used up.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased my first essentials replacement items.</li>
            <li> This gets a definite thumbs-up from me and a recommendation to anyone interested in a low-cost DIY home gel kit that doesn&#x27;t give UV exposure.</li>

            <li> If it is too hot, your hands will burn inside the smaller bowl with the acetone.  </li>
            <li> I have a professional looking manicure which I can do myself while spending time with family, or watching TV!  </li>
            <li> I never had such pretty hands until now.  </li>
            <li> First, I didn&#x27;t buy this through Amazon, but through my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Plus, they take more drying time than I have to give, and I usually end up with dings or smudges in the polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, I did my first application the night before I left on vacation... and therefore, after the 45 minutes I allowed myself to do my nails, I immediately had to finish packing.</li>
            <li> To put it in perspective, before this, my regular polish would last a maximum of 3 days before there was significant wear at the tip of my nail which WAS noticeable, that I would feel the need to touch up.</li>
            <li> I purchased several other colors at about 10 bucks each, but I will never have to go to a salon again for nice, just like new, deep, shiny wet-look nails.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Around that time, Walgreen&#x27;s had a sale on Nailene&#x27;s SensatioNail with $10 off the starter kit (bringing it down to $49.99) and $2 off each nail product (manufacturer&#x27;s coupons which were available at the Walgreen&#x27;s beauty counter and also usable WITH the sale price.</li>
            <li> : Hold your fingers up in the light at different angles and move them around so you can see that there are no bubbles or uneven areas and that the gel is evenly distributed as the light shines on various parts of your nails.</li>

            <li> I simply use NON ACETONE polish remover and the regular polish comes off without harming the Gel.&lt;br /&gt;Sincemy original purchase of the kit, I have added a bottle of the Naile Base/Top Coat (Nailene Professional UV Gel Kit #71356 $15.75)coat</li>
            <li> slide it smoothly across till you meet with slight resistance (the bubble).</li>

            <li> After 23 years no more visits to the salon to sit for two hours paying oodles of $ for something I really didn&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li> I am not fond of putting nail polish because it chips easily and just a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> When I initially had the professional do the first gel manicure (Shellac is her product of choice)</li>
            <li> When I initially had the professional do the first gel manicure (Shellac is her product of choice)</li>
            <li> (so if you have to cure it for longer, you need to press for another cycle), and the beep is unusually loud, but those are both minor and worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an affordable gel kit  after reading reviews on gel nails I have decided to try it since I have my own natural nails that would constantly chip and regular polish would only last a day .</li>
            <li> In 10-15 minutes your nails are completely painted, dry and ready for everything!!</li>
            <li> I have used this kit with several other brands of base coat, top coat, and color and all have worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Instead of being weak and breaking on the edge at the quick, which they used to almost always do, they were now breaking off in a jagged chunk of a piece or section at the tips causing me to continually shorten them to the length of the one that most recently got dinged.</li>
            <li> I love this color, its not pink pink but its not red either.</li>
            <li> Yes, I spent a little more by buying the kit and nail polishes, but in a month I have already started saving that money and my mom and cousins have also benefited!</li>
            <li> Pros:  Fairly simple, long lasting color, love the shine and toughness&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that this would even compare to a gel manicure from the salon, but it exceeded my expectations by far!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions carefully, and my nails looked very pretty.</li>
            <li> In some instances you may be able to turn you hand upside down for a couple of seconds and let gravity help redistribute the gel toward the center if too much is close to the side edges.</li>
            <li> In some instances you may be able to turn you hand upside down for a couple of seconds and let gravity help redistribute the gel toward the center if too much is close to the side edges.</li>
            <li> so it is very important to go slowly and methodically.</li>
            <li> Wine\\&quot; that came with the kit I ordered is very pretty for winter (a deep maroon with tiny sparkly pigments)&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These colors do not last as long as my OPI manicures - my OPI manicures would last 3 weeks without so much as a chip - the got so grown out that I would &#x27;fill&#x27; them in with regular nail polish and blend it over the top for an ombre effect.</li>
            <li> went and purchased pure acetone from the beauty shop (it comes in plastic bottle in different sizes).</li>
            <li> primer may be the key to not having streaks, I cannot be certain.</li>
            <li> I buffed the shine off the nails, put pure acetone on cotton, put the cotton on my fingers, wrapped my fingers in foil, put my hands under a heating pad, waited about 10 minutes, scraped off the gel with this tool, buffed my nails with a file, pushed back my cuticles, put on some lotion and put some cuticle oil on my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed a little bit of shrinkage from the edges of my nails after curing them in the LED light (as I was trying to avoid my skin per the instructions).</li>
            <li> If little bit remains after soaking, lightly buff the nail with a file.</li>
            <li> This product is also fantastic for mothers of little kids who do not have time to sit and paint their nails.</li>
            <li> If not, just fill in with light even strokes with little polish on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little backstory, no matter what I do, I cannot get a home-done manicure to last more than 2 days.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money on something that actually lasts.</li>
            <li> , I had a hard time convincing people</li>
            <li> Other reviewers seem to say that is key to easy removal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other reviewers seem to say that is key to easy removal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very durable nail polish that set hard immediately out of the LED light.  </li>
            <li> clear transparent LED gel top/base coat,&lt;br /&gt;.12</li>
            <li> After I cure the clear Gel</li>
            <li> This is clear</li>
            <li> If this is a concern of yours, you could still purchase this kit and do a clear gel overlay on your nails instead.</li>
            <li> I love getting a nice manicure, but hate paying salon price.</li>
            <li> Also, with Nailene, you do not have to use color each time; you can also do a clear manicure, which means you get the protection of gel for your nails</li>
            <li> but once I did, it completely removed the sticky feeling so</li>
            <li> complete ALL the steps because they will be tacky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all directions completely (having said that, I have been doubling the time with the lamp because that is what was done at my nail</li>
            <li> This is common among most home gel kit lamps in this price range though</li>
            <li> this kit has fixed my problems with waiting.</li>
            <li> I had a professional apply gel polish to see what it was all about, it lasted 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> off\\&quot; you have to buff your natural nail before applying to help it adhere.</li>
            <li> I just got mine today and it took about 30 minutes to complete.</li>
            <li> One suggestion:  put the primer coat around the outside of the nail, not the whole nail surface.  </li>
            <li> I switched to Red Carpet Manicure and this product is much easier to remove.  </li>
            <li> No big deal really.</li>
            <li> And last, the whole UV lamp thing does concern me.</li>
            <li> Looks like it was professionally done.</li>
            <li> I really wished I&#x27;d looked on Amazon before buying this at my local drug</li>
            <li> I bought professional strength acetone at Walmart (inexpensive) and followed the directions.  </li>
            <li> Where have you been all of my adult life gel polish???</li>
            <li> If I can do this anyone can because I&#x27;m far from a girlie girl.</li>
            <li> It looks so natural</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller, so it doesn&#x27;t fit your thumb in with your fingers, so it takes just a bit longer than in the salon, but it was simple enough and worked as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I suspect I could have gone at least 3-4 more days.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time &amp; money buying this product.</li>
            <li> Complete rip off</li>
            <li> I actually bought it at Walmart and paid $50 because I didn&#x27;t want to wait for shipping, but I paid that much for 1 gel manicure in a salon</li>
            <li> also purchased the French manicure kit, and I didn&#x27;t have much luck with the adhesive tips, but I will try again.</li>
            <li> I did have to use three coats of color to get a complete cover.  </li>
            <li> And I still didn&#x27;t get all of it completely off.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old can do her nails herself</li>
            <li> The only real requirements are to read the directions and, to be patient in the application of the gel -- dry/cure</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> I have so far done my fingernails and toenails</li>
            <li> This stuff is legit, it keeps up with a 16 month old, house work, showers and even scrubbing dishes.</li>
            <li> The finished results look professional.</li>
            <li> The WHOLE point of gel manicures is for the color to last for weeks.</li>
            <li> It really does last 2 weeks when done correctly.  </li>
            <li> Some of the old gel polish I had on before must have stuck on and I didn&#x27;t see it, and that&#x27;s what it is.</li>
            <li> The hardest part was soaking off my professional gel manicure I had on before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten my nails done professionally for years,  tons of cash;</li>
            <li> I only paid $36 for the whole kit.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> LEDs are faster than UV lights and safer as far as skin cancer is concerned.</li>
            <li> NO COMPLAINTS SO FAR.</li>
            <li> Going to a nail salon for professional nails is just not in my budget</li>
            <li> My favorite is the complaint about the sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Given the cost of professional gel manicures vs this system, If I got 2 uses out of it, it was a wash.</li>
            <li> as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s acetone wraps followed with some scraping.</li>
            <li> If you try this and it doesn&#x27;t work for you, the instructions say to only add the primer layer around the edges of your nail and it&#x27;ll come off much easier.</li>
            <li> The SensatioNail mani&#x27;s I done on 3 relatives looked just as professional.</li>
            <li> fingers are ready to go for the next set.</li>
            <li> This allows me to take breaks between since they are complete.  </li>
            <li> far as the removal process, I soaked in acetone-soaked cotton rounds wrapped in tin foil for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> However, by the time I was out the door and rushing to the airport, my nails were completely FLAWLESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can never get a manicure to last more than a few days without a chip.</li>
            <li> Compared to the price and hassle of spending my time in my local salon, it&#x27;s definitely been worth it.  </li>
            <li> It helps you learn what you might need to refine without likely having to re-do the entire manicure right away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**I am assuming the reader of this review has 10 fingers, please adjust my recommendation accordingly as I mean no discrimination :)</li>
            <li> I was applying and messing up because my hands weren&#x27;t able to apply well enough due to the tiny</li>
            <li> , I spent a good half an hour alternating hands under the lamp to try and dry it.  </li>
            <li> The gel polish won&#x27;t dry too quickly like regular polish does, so you have the time to be meticulous and fix issues before you cure it.</li>
            <li> So if long lasting color is worth the time of application and removal</li>
            <li> It lasted a full fourteen days with NO issues and I am ROUGH on my nails (wash my hands a lot, typing daily, messing with the dogs, dishes, etc.)</li>
            <li> Each polish has a slightly different viscosity and coverage, so if the first one you try isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;opaque&amp;#34; enough, I&#x27;d encourage you to try another color.  </li>
            <li> They still actually looked fine when I removed them, but they were lifting in the corners slightly.</li>
            <li> this gives you a lot of opportunity for damage control (using the little wooden cuticle pusher you can easily wipe away excess polish).</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to a friend, and have told several coworkers about this kit!</li>
            <li> No big messes, smooth glossy coats, and it lasted about a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> I waited a bit and then read reviews online and couldn&#x27;t find many negatives (mostly the bad reviews seemed to be related to user error/issues)</li>
            <li> This gel nail really lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t chip.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that it barely had any.</li>
            <li> nails really do feel nearly invincible while I&#x27;m wearing Sensationail gel polish, and therefore, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to regular polish again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty rough on my hands</li>
            <li> Might be equal or longer than drying time of normal polish.  </li>
            <li> It took me about 40 minutes the first time because I was really careful to follow step by step.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will definitely want to make sure you have all your tools out and ready to use and that you use THIN coats of polish.</li>
            <li> All in all, if you follow the directions exactly, I find that it takes me about 45 minutes to do the full application of 2 color coats and the base and top coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally: I was just too curious to wait longer than a week after my initial sheer pink manicure and the re-growth was already showing; so I cleaned my nails with alcohol to remove any lint and added raspberry wine right over the existing pink manicure (two coats of raspberry plus one clear top coat).</li>

            <li> Hours later, my nails were still not hard, but rather rubbery.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey for nail polish, but the results are salon worthy.</li>
            <li> Wow, did I fall in love with not only the durability but the slick, shiny, and raised look of gel nails!</li>
            <li> Put hot water in the medium sized bowl and pure actone in the small bowl.</li>
            <li> There may be tiny little areas that stay, I just used a light buffing to remove.  </li>
            <li> The light should be a little bigger so that my entire hand can go under the light, the light is so small that my thumb does not fit in.</li>
            <li> So far 3 days on my nails and not a single chip.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been afraid of giving yourself a gel manicure (even if you&#x27;re not that great at giving yourself a regular manicure) give this a try!</li>
            <li> salon)&lt;br /&gt;Polish removal can be a bear, so be sure to rough up polish with a heavy duty nail file to speed up removal.&lt;br /&gt;The lamp</li>
            <li> this product did not do what it said it would anyone who wants to try this just letting you know that it peel off the next day does not last for 14 day</li>
            <li> I have only done one manicure so far, and thus far I like this product.</li>
            <li> My husband recently bought this product for me as a late birthday gift, because he knows I love to polish my nails.</li>
            <li> My nails are extremely thin and brittle and I never thought I would be able to do without professional acrylics or shellac.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that the cost is pretty much the same as acrylic tips or silk wraps but doesn&#x27;t last as  long.  </li>
            <li> True this starter kit offers quite small bottles, I still feel like you get a lot of bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> It fits 4 fingers easily and this method made me go slowly and patiently</li>
            <li> You can also just use the clear gel polish to create a strong base for nails and paint regular nail polish over that if you like to change the color more frequently (because the gel polish DOES last a solid 8 days minimum - my first attempt lasted 9 before they began to lift anywhere and</li>
            <li> Originally I thought it was rather small, too.</li>
            <li> There are a number of steps, and I followed the suggestion to do my thumbs first followed by the rest of one hand, and then the other.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the removal process of gel polish either, but I will try the soak-off method with hot water (heated in the microwave) that other posters here recommended when the time comes.</li>
            <li> It was pretty easy to apply and not at all difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> you are free to get back to your activities and you wont mess up your nails!</li>
            <li> In fact, the polish rolled right off, with just using pressure from my thumbnail, in less than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> But then I realized that I was going right back into the nail financial burden that I was stuck in for so long.</li>
            <li> (I am NOT a professional but have always been decent at painting both hands myself).</li>
            <li> Since gel manicures (without any type of false nail) is typically $30-$40 at local salons, this product is a great deal considering one gets 10 manicures out of the starter kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Coffee Bean or Espresso Bean which looks like a dark brown online is more of a bronze that glimmers with green and yellowish tints and in sunlight looks like a (not dark) brown.</li>
            <li> The only downside I have discovered is that if the regular polish is too thick and not quite dry when you apply the gel top coat it can get somewhat of a ripply affect but often times that can be smoothed out by applying pressure to the nail to press it down smooth....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I haven&#x27;t gotten acrylic lately I still enjoy polishing my nails at home.</li>
            <li> All together I got the starter kit with LED light in Raspberry Wine, a sheer pink French kit, clear French kit, Sugar Plum color and extra French tips, for around $90 including tax.</li>
            <li> And it really does last a long time.</li>
            <li> am currently only using the clear so can&#x27;t speak to the application of the color.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, with normal polish, my clothes and luggage would have ended up wearing more polish than my nails...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I took my old polish off using regular remover and cotton.</li>
            <li> far, manicures are lasting me about 10 days.</li>
            <li> Then stroke the sides, being careful to stay away from the skin or leaving too much polish that might run or pool.</li>
            <li> Then stroke the sides, being careful to stay away from the skin or leaving too much polish that might run or pool.</li>
            <li> Not worth spending almost an hour doing my manicure to get a whopping three days of pretty nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several friends ask if I got my nails done professionally.</li>
            <li> I usually finish the entire set in about 40 minutes (with extra 30-secs curing for final top coat).  </li>
            <li> I chose to try the sheer pink without tips for my first experiment.</li>
            <li> My nails are so thin and brittle that even the priciest of guarantee&#x27;s never lasted more than 24 hours on my nails before they started chipping and/or peeling off.  </li>
            <li> Thus, not more than 5 minutes after curing my topcoat, my nails got the full assault.</li>
            <li> I loved the color and how long it lasted, unfortunately it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> She said it did take a few times to get the process down, but once she did, her nails look lovely.</li>
            <li> I am stay at home mom, so for me any nail polish i tried wont last more than 2 days, as i have to be constantly cleaning something and with a 1 year old baby its hard to do your nails or even go to salon!</li>
            <li> The application process takes a bit longer than regular polish, but there&#x27;s zero time spent waiting for it to dry (it really IS cured/dry as fast as the kit says, and you can go about your business without worrying you&#x27;ll smudge or scuff your nails)...</li>
            <li> I recommend using your dominant hand (likely the one you write with) to do your &#x60;other&#x27; hand first.</li>
            <li> gel goes on very smoothly and it is easier than regular polish to apply smoothly in thin layer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before purchasing anything I went to a professional and got a clear gel manicure to test the wear and see how long it would last for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other gel polishes and SensatioNails is of much poorer quality.</li>
            <li> Typically every 3 weeks I would get a gel mani for $35; with this you&#x27;ll pay around $50 and you&#x27;ll just have to purchase gel polish (which btw the light works with other brands).</li>
            <li> You can gently and slowly push the brush a little closer toward the cuticle if necessary to get as close as possible WITHOUT touching the edge.</li>
            <li> This is particularly important if you are going to use a color, especially a dark or red color.</li>
            <li> I think I will always start with a sheer, clear or French manicure</li>
            <li> I think I will always start with a sheer, clear or French manicure</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll add a photo, I used the French nails manicure kit, but initially purchased this complete set.  </li>
            <li> So I used that to my advantage - I completely manicured and cured 1 thumb, then the opposite thumb, then 4 fingers on non dominant hand, and finally the 4 fingers on my dominant hand.</li>
            <li> The first time it took me a long time, but I expected that.</li>
            <li> NO DRY TIME involved.</li>
            <li> The gel polish does not dry until its cured</li>
            <li> Removal time and effort is expected to be high.</li>
            <li> You can buy the same exact product/ kit for less than $50 at Walmart.</li>
            <li> It may be a little less strong than the gel treatments at the salon</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and I used this kit several times before buying other colors and brands of gel polish, rubbing alcohol, wipes and additional tools.  </li>
            <li> This is revolutionary to me as I can usually not get away with more than 1.5 days of a regular manicure without chipping due to my weak, peeling nails.</li>
            <li> The first application requires some patience, but I am on my fifth round of DIY nails.</li>
            <li> After removal, I filed my nails down since they had grown so much in the 17 days</li>
            <li> The only downside is that gel nails are rather hard to remove, but I believe wrapping acetone-soaked cotton will work, based on many other reviews.</li>
            <li> My nails are super shiny, and hard.</li>
            <li> Once you begin polishing, start with a long single stroke down the center of the nail from near the inside of the nail bed area to the end of the nail to see how much gel you really are working with.</li>
            <li> I have a two year old, so not having any dry time</li>
            <li> I tried it twice and the polish doesn&#x27;t harden and dry like the professional machine and polish.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the manicure will last because I just put it on, but it feels just like the applications I&#x27;ve had at the salon so far.  </li>
            <li> Terrified to know what Raspberry Wine looks like since that looks pink online--it will probably be hot pink or something</li>
            <li> so keeping my nails looking good all the time was nearly impossible before.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, especially since this is my first time</li>
            <li> It goes on thin and strong</li>
            <li> This product was easy to apply, dries rock hard instantly and lasted for 11 days, even after completely all the everyday chores.  </li>
            <li> This little kit is going to save me so much money...</li>
            <li> a few other gems of information - I researched this polish on ewg.org, which rates the danger of cosmetic ingredients, and many of the polishes have a low or moderate ranking (the darker ones seem to hit the moderate category) and do not have a lot of the standard cancer causing agents found in other polishes.</li>
            <li> The nasty discolored, bumpy sections of the previously abused nails are still growing out and color just doesn&#x27;t look good on them yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two or three coats of the clear gel, and my nails are nice and firm.  </li>
            <li> My first application lasted a little over a week (and survived a long weekend in Vegas).</li>
            <li> This stuff is tough; you can see it forms a real shield on your nails and that really protects them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird to have 4 coats of polish on my nails and have them be instantly dry and usable all due to that little magic light box.  </li>
            <li> Directions are long, but it&#x27;s basically the same process as doing your nails regularly (file, clean, base coat, paint, top coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> and so far it didnt crack or loose its shine!</li>
            <li> Mine were trimmed fairly short - they did not extend past my fingertips, which made the application challenging because it was really hard to cap each nail without getting the gel on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was surprised that the gel manicure held up extremely well with no chips or peeling</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have the blade flat enough you will gouge the layer</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have the blade flat enough you will gouge the layer</li>
            <li> Giving it 4 stars because I only just painted them last night so we shall see how long they last.....</li>
            <li> As for how long it will last, only time will tell (I&#x27;ll up date my review if and when the lamp dies).&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think I left the wraps on long enough</li>
            <li> just do not last long enough.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about gel because it took me about 3 years to get my natural nails healthy and didn&#x27;t want to do anything to damage them.</li>
            <li> You will need 100% pure acetone and 2 glass bowls (medium size and small size).</li>
            <li> Darker color a little harder to work with, but the kit has already paid for itself, and I find the gel polish much easier to work with than regular nail</li>
            <li> The LED lamp is a FANTASTIC size, however the magnetic bottom falls off and it doesn&#x27;t cure the gel as well as my other lamp.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> Polish usually lasts about 5-7 days for me depending on how much effort I put into prep work and the type of polish I use.</li>
            <li> I bought the unit and was not surprised with how small the products were because I had done so much research, but still thought they could have been bigger.</li>
            <li> Long lasting!</li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s why I bought the product, so it would stay on my nails for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> It seemed longer to soak off and didn&#x27;t last all that long.  </li>
            <li> my nails are STRONGER than they ever have been before, AND for once all my nails are long at the same time!</li>
            <li> Its super shiny and tough.</li>
            <li> I add a little more, but still quite thin by all standards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as replacing these items, I&#x27;m a bit blown away that the little bottles of polish sell for not much less than the salon sized bottles of other brands.  </li>
            <li> The dry time was instant, and I was so amazed!  </li>
            <li> I tend to do my nails at night, when salons aren&#x27;t open, and I need my nails to be completely dry before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not gone back to using the acetone at all and continue to just remove polish by scraping it off dry.</li>
            <li> I have not gone back to using the acetone at all and continue to just remove polish by scraping it off dry.</li>
            <li> The entire process from removal to end dry product is a couple hours.  </li>
            <li> Of course, the regular polish will have to air dry.  </li>
            <li> It was also harder to do my left hand, as I am left handed.</li>
            <li> I tend to be rough on my nail between doing dishes, working in a lab where I&#x27;m constantly putting on and taking off nitrile gloves and just the constant wear of dealing with paperwork and rifling though a bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Nails are super thin now\\</li>
            <li> I chose to use regular polish because the gel polish colors are limited</li>
            <li> Normally I can polish my nails with regular polish using a base coat, one or two coats of polish and a top coat</li>
            <li> You can always add a little more if needed, but it&#x27;s nearly impossible to remove polish with just the brush if you start with too much.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy having polished nails, but haven&#x27;t had them in years because I&#x27;m very hard on my hands and conventional polishes</li>
            <li> for those who have problems getting the polish off (which was another one of my original reluctance to purchase), it really isn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews that you can use regular polish, i am going to try that next.  </li>
            <li> It obviously takes a bit longer than regular polish to apply but not much longer when you consider you have to wait for it to dry.  </li>
            <li> When I apply properly, they last and last...even through the endless handwashings I do as a</li>
            <li> I held/pressed a small square of moistened paper towel over each nail at a time for approximately two minutes, using the crook of my finger on the other hand to &#x60;warm&#x27; it and keep it from drying out in the air.</li>
            <li> This only took about 5-10 minutes of soaking with foils and then what little was left scraped off with the included wooden stick with no nail</li>
            <li> The only bad part is that I have to buy a million more colors to go with my hundreds of regular polish at home!</li>
            <li> each) still pretty small to a comparable average size of nail</li>
            <li> Regular polish that last 2-3 days is just not worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will need a nail buffer or small grained emory board to get some of it off, but at the ACTUAL cost of $5 an applicaton vs. $35-40 per application for a salon tech to do them for you, I don&#x27;t see what reason one would have to NOT purchase this product if yoru are cost conscious.  </li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long.  </li>
            <li> I did my 1st application a few days ago and my manicure is still completely intact, shiny, and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The gel polish does last up to two weeks as advertised and continues to look wet and shiny for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructions were LONG.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to read the long instructions over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though it seems like long process, it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Save money in long run (maybe not time because of removal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t believe how long my nails are getting since they&#x27;re not breaking off.  </li>
            <li> Long process though.</li>
            <li> If your nails are shorter you&#x27;ll need to be careful to use the wooden stick to remove any gel from your skin BEFORE you cure</li>
            <li> it looks used the box was open, the nail polishes were almost empty and the polish clenser was</li>
            <li> I did this during grid locked traffic last week and had absolutely no polish on by the time I got home!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you prime the entire nail before polishing, it will be harder to get off.</li>
            <li> This lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> At first I panicked &amp; thought the product was an epic fail.</li>
            <li> I would have paid for 3 pink and white fills at $35/pop (stretched it out to three weeks between because I so did not look forward to the pain.)  </li>
            <li> The quality of the color and base coats is good.  </li>
            <li> I finally bit the bullet and purchased this set since it was on sale at a local retailer for less than the cost of one gel manicure.  </li>
            <li> My acrylic could last for weeks if not for the surface polish (regular nail polish) that will have chipped or dulled in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Each color was $7.99 less $2 and the French kits were marked down too</li>
            <li> The polish is hard as expected and almost never chips, but I have had a whole nail completely peel off a few times.  </li>
            <li> Shortly after removing the gel polish (no easy task!), I developed very strange bumps and ridges on four of my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> I did purchase a little dremel to help  rough up the old gel surface before re-applying.  </li>
            <li> Even when I soaked other hand for longer I still had same experience.</li>
            <li> Even when I soaked other hand for longer I still had same experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought this kit over the weekend and realized I should have done it a long time ago!</li>
            <li> After that I spend several hours reading reviews, watching videos, and other researched.</li>
            <li> The color didn&#x27;t stay on very long, maybe a week or so</li>
            <li> I was looking for an affordable gel polish kit for a very long time</li>
            <li> My nails were totally dry and not tacky when I was done.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s easier then sitting around and waiting for nail polish to dry.</li>
            <li> and let it dry..</li>
            <li> The brush was DRY also.</li>
            <li> I really like that this is my natural nail and doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> The gel process takes about 10 minutes or so, but you&#x27;re not just sitting waiting for them to dry, when you&#x27;re done, you&#x27;re done,</li>
            <li> cuz your nails are totally dry.</li>
            <li> I should have no trouble getting this to last at least 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that this was less messy and since gel wasn&#x27;t soft from acetone soak, came off in bigger chunks.</li>
            <li> I found that this was less messy and since gel wasn&#x27;t soft from acetone soak, came off in bigger chunks.</li>
            <li> Then I cleaned my nails with the cleaner that came with the kit and then started the process of layering base coat, clear coat, 2 coats of polish and top coat.</li>
            <li> It does not have one single chip on it anywhere</li>
            <li> As for removal, yes, it is somewhat time consuming, but considering I am only doing it once per two weeks vs. 2-3 times a week with conventional polish, I&#x27;d say the removal time is a wash between the two types.</li>
            <li> a few resounding complaints:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It peels off right away\\&quot;- you put it on too thick-</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because I only felt comfortable having the nail salon give me a gel mani/pedi...</li>
            <li> I am not kind to my nails, and I hate waiting for them to dry, so this is such a great purchase for me.</li>
            <li> a nutshell I apply the primer product to the tip or perimeter of my nail only, then apply the gel base coat and cure, then apply regular polish, allow to dry and apply the gel top coat and cure.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, everything you need is included, follow the steps and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> For those of you who say it ruins your nails and you prefer acrylics, the result is the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a little practice to do and may take a little longer than an normal paint polish</li>
            <li> The Mis Behave or whatever it&#x27;s called that looks like a dark, blood red</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It can get messy (if your not careful)</li>
            <li> After using this twice, they have peeling and broke down to where I do not think it is possible to get any shorter.  </li>
            <li> I was sick of always going to the salon and having to pay to get a nice gel nail manicure so decided to try this based on some other reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as usage---The instruction card is very clear, and as long as you follow the instructions (DO USE THIN COATS!)</li>
            <li> Typically, it&#x27;ll start to peel up around my cuticle bed on day 11 and will get caught in my hair as I&#x27;m shampooing or it raises on the tip of my nail just enough for me to notice dirt has gotten in between the nail and the polish which drives me to distraction and causes me to start picking away at it.  </li>
            <li> Probably less time than removing regular polish would take.  </li>
            <li> Half of these steps I already do when I put regular polish on anyway.</li>
            <li> and they cost the same or less.  </li>
            <li> The colour is slightly thinner than a regular nail polish and with practice</li>
            <li> I play varsity basketball and work in a kitchen where I am constantly required to wear gloves (which usually cause regular nail polish to chip off within 1 hour) and work with my hands.  </li>
            <li> cause my nail was super sticky, I failed to use the gel cleanser after the nail was completed</li>
            <li> The next morning I began the new manicure, which took approximately 20 minutes start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Sensationail stays on very well, in fact it is a little hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> At this point I notice little fuzzies  everywhere on my nails from cotton earlier.</li>
            <li> I wish the lamp was a little bigger though</li>
            <li> It does take a little longer than regular polish to apply BUT THEN YOU&#x27;RE DONE FOR TWO WEEKS!!!</li>
            <li> so you dont have to sit and wonder if its dry or not, once you finish drying with the lamp (30 sec base coat, 60 sec each polish coat and 30 sec top coat comes to 3 minutes total)</li>
            <li> I found the darker colors are a little harder to apply, when you have to cap the edges (you get excess polish on your finger that you have to wipe off, although I keep my nails rather short).  </li>
            <li> Frankly, I am surprised that it came out on the market, it&#x27;s going to give salons a hard time.</li>
            <li> I am hard on my hands, cook a lot, work with my hands and therefore wash them frequently.  </li>
            <li> I was previously using a gel strip polish, but they were *very* expensive and, unless you love animal prints and stripes, the color selection is limited.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to keep the gel polish off the cuticle though, especially when doing my left hand.</li>
            <li> It was more difficult to remove than gel polish from the salon, but by wrapping with aluminum foil and acetone and being patient it isn&#x27;t too hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Time consuming to remove gel polish but manageable and to be expected with gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not needed in the center of the nail.  </li>
            <li> Not much product in kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wanted to update on removal methods (and it&#x27;s really not that bad!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure</li>
            <li> She did mention that it&#x27;s a bit harder to get off than the Gelish brand, but she says it lasts a bit longer without chipping</li>
            <li> So, your nails will be tacky, sticky and seem wet until you use the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions that were provided with the kit carefully since I&#x27;ve never used gel polish before.</li>
            <li> Repeat the same process to avoid bubbles or uneven coverage.</li>
            <li> Repeat the same process to avoid bubbles or uneven coverage.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been bummed that the colors are not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not gentle on my nails.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 15 minutes to do both hands; 1/3 of the time spent at a salon.</li>
            <li> I am rough on my hands during the day, so I am hoping that my polish will stand up to the abuse.  </li>
            <li> The starter kit is about $49.95 and comes in two shades: a paler pink and a darker raspberry shade; the raspberry is called \\&quot;raspberry wine.\\</li>
            <li> LONG TERM DAMAGE NOT WORTH IT</li>
            <li> (it was so pink</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no ability with doing my nails</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few months, I finally feel like I&#x27;ve got the hang of</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very cosmetically savvy.</li>
            <li> I purchased my SensatioNail kit a few wks back</li>
            <li> It seems doubtful that I will get 7 more from that tiny bottle of base/top coat, but we will see.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottles of polish and top and base coats were bigger but it works for now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disappointed as I cannot get hold of the gel base and top coat as its all sold out, waiting for further supplies otherwise will be returning it all as I cannot use it as it is.</li>
            <li> The website is not accurate about what is in stock at the local stores.</li>
            <li> The bottle lid seems to leak a bit making it difficult to store unless you store yours right side up all the time.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the size of bottles that came with the kit, but you only need to use light coats so perhaps it will actually last longer than I think.  </li>
            <li> I opened the box and 1 of the bottles was broke and empty and the other items were sticky.  </li>
            <li> it was hard work on my nails, I&#x27;m not surprised, and only one chipped).</li>
            <li> A slight sparkle gives it a little something extra too.</li>
            <li> If you get bored with polishes after a few days, my next advice is to do a clear gel mani, then paint over that with your regular polish.</li>
            <li> If the product is coming off in whole pieces, it&#x27;s likely because the gel base or polish was applied to the cuticle where it will not adhere properly and thus cause the entire gel to come off.</li>
            <li> I will also be trying this lamp with other gel polishes.</li>
            <li> have seen other reviewers complain about the size of the LED lamp in this kit.</li>
            <li> I have been eyeballing this kit for several months but was afraid to spend that kind of money on another useless product.  </li>
            <li> I first saw this kit at Walmart and thought it was too expensive to try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The other peel off method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The other peel off method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quick tip - if you have chubby hands like me, cure 4 fingers on one hand, then 2 thumbs, and then 4 fingers on other hand so that you do not inadvertently bump nails before they are fully cured**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as shinny as other gel manicures I have done myself, let alone not even comparable to salon quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can do 1 hand while she eats breakfast, play with some blocks, do the other hand while she plays by herself, make lunch, and finish my thumbs during nap</li>
            <li> /&gt;The other hand got all the Sally Hansen products.</li>
            <li> FINISHED MY OTHER 9 NAILS.....</li>
            <li> I like the sensationail line but for me it never works as well as the other brands of soak off gel.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other color brands yet.  </li>
            <li> Usually with regular nail polish I end up scuffs 1 or 2 nails before they&#x27;re fully cured from 4 layers of polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s necessary</li>
            <li> I ve tried other brands and it wasnt even close to shellac in salon</li>
            <li> I do find my nails a bit dry after removal of polish, so I put a little oil on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat slippery and moves around the nail, so be very careful to wipe excess off the brush.....</li>
            <li> and you have to be very careful.</li>
            <li> very careful not to get this on your cuticles.</li>
            <li> (I know bad, but I have strong nails).</li>
            <li> I will say it was harder to get the polish off this time than my previous manicure.</li>
            <li> The primer seems to be a waste of time and has to air dry.</li>
            <li> My nails are normally chipped before walking out the door of the salon, or at least within a day or two, what a waste!</li>
            <li> Less chance of the wet polish running.</li>
            <li> it very disappointment peel  off the next day can&#x27;t believe that this product did not work when I got the product the base coat was open and spilled all over had to run to the store and get a new one because I got this item because I had to go to  a wedding I would not recommend this product to anyone would love my money back for it</li>
            <li> Thick with No lumps, not sticky, and no strange smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very hard on my nails and so far they&#x27;ve held up for...17 days with no chipping</li>
            <li> so I spent a little over $80.</li>
            <li> ( clean and buff nails, apply primer liberally, thin coat of bottom coat/top coat and two thin coats of polish, cap nails).</li>
            <li> I think the combo base/top coat is what makes the sensationail less durable than the other brands.</li>
            <li> it would usually take me to do the same with regular, non-gel polish, and we are talking a serious time-saver application-wise.</li>
            <li> Last around 2 weeks and does not seem that hard to remove.</li>
            <li> In fairness, the polish does not so much lift as I get bored and start chipping it off</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s difficult to remove when it&#x27;s on real nails.</li>
            <li> The process is long enough and having to do thumbs separately is somewhat frustrating.</li>
            <li> My only negative thing to say is that it is a pain to remove</li>
            <li> Of course, I was skeptical, but once I googled and saw how much people like it, I was overwhelmed with excitement to try for myself.</li>
            <li> I will be returning if gel doesn&#x27;t not last at least 1 week.</li>
            <li> With regular nail polish I&#x27;ll usually end up chipping it within a few hours of painting my nails.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth 5$.  </li>
            <li> Second go round, the polish dried, but peeled off within 2 hours!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the color that came with the set -- way to dark and looked almost purple.</li>
            <li> but I usually can&#x27;t wait that long to change my nail color.</li>
            <li> The directions clearly state apply in THIN coats.</li>
            <li> This lasts on my nails 2 weeks and my nails are longer because the gel polish is thick enough to protect them.</li>
            <li> (I prefer Kiss Top and Base Coat)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t need to be thick or it may pool or run if it is applied too liberally; however it does need to cover each side edge properly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t need to be thick or it may pool or run if it is applied too liberally; however it does need to cover each side edge properly.</li>
            <li> They swapped out for one that doesn&#x27;t require a top or base coat.</li>
            <li> The key is to not put the polish on thick.  </li>
            <li> The kit had instead of the gel base and top coat, transparent polish (as well as the colour</li>
            <li> Then top coat, then the SALLY HANSEN GEL POLISH, then the base coat.</li>
            <li> BUT, I love the primer/gel cleanser/top and base coat kit from SensatioNAIL.</li>
            <li> BUT, I love the primer/gel cleanser/top and base coat kit from SensatioNAIL.</li>
            <li> , I will put down here</li>
            <li> I ENDED UP BREAKING 2 OF MY NAILS DURING REMOVAL AND HAD TO FILE ALL MY NAILS DOWN....</li>
            <li> Since the Gel is self- leveling, it fills the voids from the previous application.</li>
            <li> With this added tool I can remove my polish in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> With this added tool I can remove my polish in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I thought it would probably show less if I did a less-than-perfect job (and that turned out to be correct).</li>
            <li> so I will use that as my guideline (on cursory review it seems to be about half the time).</li>
            <li> so I will use that as my guideline (on cursory review it seems to be about half the time).</li>
            <li> ** and paid less for it.</li>
            <li> For about half a day.</li>
            <li> no more endless waiting time for wet nails!</li>
            <li> Plus I imagine as I get used to doing it it will take less time.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Once I started using the polish tool it took less than a couple minutes to get the polish off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These peeled off my nails in less than two days.</li>
            <li> It also started to peel in less than two weeks.  </li>
            <li> If i let this go until it looked like my usual breaking point with a regular manicure (which is pretty bad)</li>
            <li> It has been about four months since I used this product, and my nails are still a mess.  </li>
            <li> If you are not good at painting your nails, I would suggest starting with a lighter color.  </li>
            <li> Those did work; however, they assisted in the demise of my &#x60;real&#x27; nails and really too expensive and inconvenient to maintain.  </li>
            <li> but I have a small apartment and not much workable space to do anything.</li>
            <li> but I have a small apartment and not much workable space to do anything.</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t mess with it again.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty difficult time removing gel polish, this and salon gels nail techs had a hard time removing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also going to try the easy off Base.</li>
            <li> it was already used which made me more disappointed and mad because I paid for a new product.</li>
            <li> Just buy the little tool that scrapes it off.  </li>
            <li> Once they grow out a little</li>
            <li> Each time I use this, I get a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a minute or two I rubbed a little of the flaking gel off with the towel square onto another section of paper towel, re-moistened the square and held it again for another minute or two.</li>
            <li> I use the corner of my bathroom counter or a table and anchor my little finger of the hand holding the brush for steadiness.</li>
            <li> but I usually change it by the tenth day  due to nail growth.  </li>
            <li> but I think it takes a little practice.</li>
            <li> Peeling off will not only remove the gel but lift up layers of your nail causing them to be frail and weak.</li>
            <li> The gel polish took me a little bit of time to conquer because I&#x27;d never used gel polish before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little upset that I didn&#x27;t check Amazon before buying this in a store.</li>
            <li> I bought the Sensationail &amp;#34;scraper&amp;#34; (sounds horrific, but it&#x27;s actually really gentle) and I can get back to bare nails in about 20 minutes or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes removal a little easier.</li>
            <li> , etc- you don&#x27;t mop your floor when it&#x27;s covered in junk, why would you paint your nails if you haven&#x27;t done a little nail-scaping?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have one or two nails with a few little bumps on them.</li>
            <li> The only thing I find are that the polishes are a little thin and needs 3 coats sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this kit to anyone.</li>
            <li> Yes, the polish bottles are small, but the manicure lasts at least a week (I&#x27;ll update after 2 and see where we are at) - so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Get as close to your cuticle as possible, create a smooth line at the base and CAP YOUR NAIL!  </li>
            <li> It does take awhile but after a few times you get a lot faster.</li>
            <li> I feel it is a reaction to the harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> This kit comes with everything you need to do quite a few manis out of the box plus a LED UV 7 watt lamp.</li>
            <li> so I had trouble capping the nail.</li>
            <li> This excess polish broke free by day two but its annoying.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was going to save a lot of money and time with this kit by doing my nails at home, but I just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> -- I actually thought it looked thin and streaky.  </li>
            <li> Would NOT recommend this product waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> A few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it pays for itself after a few uses.</li>
            <li> but it chipped within a few hours</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m repairing a nail everyday.</li>
            <li> Few issues with this product:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I just posted a few pictures of my nails on the products page...</li>
            <li> I decided to give Sensationail a try just after Christmas, so I&#x27;ve been through quite a few manicures since then.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also really impatient</li>
            <li> Worst part is I wanted to return it and Amazon won&#x27;t accept it as a return because they claim you can&#x27;t return items that contain hazardous materials.</li>
            <li> I plan to try again, but so far I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> key to any of these polishes is to apply a thin, thin later.  </li>
            <li> Apply a thin coat (I do 2 coats total)  </li>
            <li> It left my nails really thin, the polish would stain my cuticles something fierce and all too often, I&#x27;d smudge them while waiting for them to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on that gooey removal kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, to save money I thought I&#x27;d give this a try since it&#x27;s not a huge investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed that my nails started to chip so quickly.</li>
            <li> Some of the pale colors don&#x27;t cover so well..</li>
            <li> I did find that I had to leave my nails under the lamp a bit longer for the polish to set than the instructions said, but that is probably due to my too thick polish</li>
            <li> No strong odors at all.</li>
            <li> she didn&#x27;t realize that its not easy to get off</li>
            <li> Usually about 24 hours later my thin nails would bend and crack the polish and then the flaking starts.</li>
            <li> the nail polish sizes were a little small, but you can always buy refills.</li>
            <li> At first, I was frustrated.  </li>
            <li> Regarding the soak off process, it is a little annoying but worth it for the amount of wear I get out of the polish.</li>
            <li> My nails have always broken off but now they are long!</li>
            <li> I had on hand that was previously purchased at Wal-Mart (least expensive place I had found it locally) with a square of absorbent paper towel.</li>
            <li> If you put the polish on too thick or get any on the cuticle, it will peel once your nail grows out a little.  </li>
            <li> Then SOME of it dried and it was hard to get off,</li>
            <li> I was never really able to do a satisfactory job painting my nails.  </li>
            <li> As with others I have in the past resorted to costly bi-weekly acrylic nails.  </li>
            <li> I run the tool around the edge of the polish which usually lifts it from my nail so that the remaining polish just peels off in one pass.</li>
            <li> No more wasting time reapplying nail polish every 3 days...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting my nails done for years (usually acrylic)</li>
            <li> Have already recommended this product to a few people!</li>
            <li> However that size can make it difficult to cure the thumbs and fingers at the same time.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it is holding since she went to her home which is about 8 hrs away and has had the flu since.  </li>
            <li> Doubt no more, this product is here to stay.</li>
            <li> I will not be using the removal method as the instructions, but rather the method the salon uses:  soak a small piece of cotton in acetone, place on your nail and wrap with aluminum foil.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure I would follow the directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> It is expensive and does not last.</li>
            <li> Seemingly about 3/4 pages in on the T&amp;C a SMALL paragraph does tell u this.  </li>
            <li> THAT U READ ALL OF THE SMALL PRINT.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t follow the directions don&#x27;t get annoyed when it doesn&#x27;t turn out as expected.</li>
            <li> So not pleased</li>
            <li> Since the salon is pricey, for the past couple of months I decided to save money and paint my nails at home.</li>
            <li> No more nail salon for me.</li>
            <li> No more spending $25 plus</li>
            <li> The bottles are all small, but it&#x27;s a starter kit</li>
            <li> I also found removal using that wooden stick useless.</li>
            <li> Also, the size of the bottles are SMALL.  </li>
            <li> as usually when I do them I have time.  </li>
            <li> I watched a few YouTube videos, and they are all correct, you must apply this product correctly to ensure you get the results you want!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing kits like these for the last year or so and have been intrigued, but have held off due to the price and thinking that I&#x27;d do a bad job of applying it and end up with messy looking nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I totally skip the buffing of the nail because over time it just leaves them thin and weak.  </li>
            <li> key is to just use VERY thin layers.  </li>
            <li> Very few chips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even my grandma loves it, and she&#x27;s at that age where she a little shaky and her nails still come out</li>
            <li> It takes too much time and effort, and when removal time comes, you can&#x27;t get the polish off with a nuclear bomb :(  ...</li>
            <li> further tip I have is that after curing the base coat, wipe off the sticky layer with a dry lint-free pad.</li>
            <li> Dull color.</li>
            <li> I came across a deal online that was too hard to pass up</li>
            <li> This one does not seem to seal the nail like my other brand and it is definitely not as shiny :(  </li>
            <li> Then I used the cloth/gel cleanser and the tackiness immediately went away and my nails were rock hard.</li>
            <li> So therefore I hardly ever polished my nails but like the look of polished nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get off.</li>
            <li> and I was almost too scared to try it since the removal process sounded so hard.  </li>
            <li> Shiny, hard, and glossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> where hard</li>
            <li> I found the SensatioNail magnet hard to work with, so I just use the magnet from another magnetic polish and it works</li>
            <li> I have done hard yard work and not damaged it.</li>
            <li> HARD AS A ROCK.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard hard, hard on my hands and polish chips off immediately.  </li>
            <li> It dries rock hard.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews but felt I must about this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> But since using Gelish colors and cotton disks rather than cotton balls, I have hardly any sraping after 10 mins in tin</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult to paint my dominant hand, and that meant I put the polish on a little too thick, so it chipped in about a week on that hand.</li>
            <li> Disappointed because it took so long to get here just for the primer to be empty</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll update again after I&#x27;ve used CND products for at least a</li>
            <li> That is my one OPI complaint.</li>
            <li> I have not one complaint.</li>
            <li> By day 3, my nails looked icky and I removed the polish.</li>
            <li> I thought for #35 even if it sucks</li>
            <li> for the time involved in polishing/removing, which others have complained about...</li>
            <li> I was painting them at least once a day, and chipping them off, and doing it again.</li>
            <li> I was so slow</li>
            <li> Too thick</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just slow</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t go overboard on the primer!</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t go overboard on the primer!</li>
            <li> The tips (with the exception of one small spot on my thumb) did not chip or peel at all!  </li>
            <li> The bottles are small but it is a starter kit!  </li>
            <li> I was getting so tired of the constant painting and chipping and hated how when I got gel done at a salon they would insist on filing my nails which after a few times left them paper thin.  </li>
            <li> The bottles of paint are very small - trial size.</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t even tell because it&#x27;s so ridiculously shiny.</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult for me not to get the polish on my cutical</li>
            <li> Not good for people that like to switch colors often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy a &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34; as I am not terribly good at doing my nails to begin with.</li>
            <li> When they say, apply a thin coat, they MEAN apply a thin coat.</li>
            <li> when the instructions say thin, they mean REALLY thin.</li>
            <li> My nails have always been weak and break at the slightest activity.  </li>
            <li> So I used the starter kit and was disappointed when my nails started chipping/ peeling the next day, so I figured</li>
            <li> What a total disappointment!  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to remove once cured.</li>
            <li> Tough to remove</li>
            <li> No more $25 manicures twice a month!!</li>
            <li> so I just pick it off starting at the base of my nail.</li>
            <li> so take your time, apply it thin,</li>
            <li> so I recommend cleaning up behind your nails and around the cuticle.</li>
            <li> I gave this a try, however I am not happy with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apply thin layer of \\&quot;Base/Top Coat\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t tell whether I was applying thin or not.</li>
            <li> Apply thin layer of \\&quot;Color Gel Polish\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> And when you are tired of your manicure all you do is peel it off each finger in one piece.</li>
            <li> And when you are tired of your manicure all you do is peel it off each finger in one piece.</li>
            <li> The 4 layers polish are thin and shine.</li>
            <li> I was also worried my nails would get too thin from using the nail file as a scraper.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was tired of paying $30-$40 for a shellac manicure every 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> When she opened it the packaging was beat up and the presentation was poor.</li>
            <li> Was given as a gift, when opened found broken bottles.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ahead of the game.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> When they say use thin coats seriously, use THIN coats!</li>
            <li> and I HATE letting the polish dry.</li>
            <li> the polish peeled off the next day and the products weakened and dehydrated my nails so bad!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done with boring old nail polish!</li>
            <li> I had stopped painting my nails because they would usually look bad within hours with chips, smudges, and oftentimes broken nails.  </li>
            <li> As I am doing this I accidentally swiped my other hand with cured base coat against my sweater sleeve.</li>
            <li> I just got my kit yesterday, but I am a little disappointed because the lamp had some scratches on it.</li>
            <li> I am sold and I&#x27;m usually a tough customer!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed bringing this product back to the store tomorrow!!</li>
            <li> a side note, this price is really expensive compared to Walmart (where I got my kit).</li>
            <li> and if I do something wrong I can do it all over again without offending anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been looking at LED UV lamps and they are so expensive.</li>
            <li> not satisfied at all, disappointed, not shiny&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
            <li> Yes it is a bit tedious to get off but all gel polish is.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the two week</li>
            <li> Not that any of it was complicated, but there were a lot of steps involved.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Removing the existing gel was not at all difficult.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t difficult and came offeasily.</li>
            <li> but it is SO expensive.</li>
            <li> My nails feel really weird and tacky</li>
            <li> I had seen this starter kit and always thought it was too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was so angry.</li>
            <li> (I get bored of</li>
            <li> I paint my nails every week, not because I get bored with colors, but because they chip, even with my pricey polishes.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s as difficult as some people say then I might change my rating.</li>
            <li> However I didn&#x27;t find the application remotely difficult like some did</li>
            <li> THE ACETONE REMOVER AND FOIL REMOVAL METHOD IS TEDIOUS...</li>
            <li> Sadly, their colors are not well represented by the color title either.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not impressed with the polish itself.  </li>
            <li> or when I get bored and want a change (around 3 weeks) and not once have they lifted/peeled.</li>
            <li> then SCRAPE and scrape to get it off your nails - and even then it is difficult to get it all off.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> other problem I have is that I am terrible at avoiding my cuticles.</li>
            <li> Is it dangerous to be using this thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does shine like crazy however.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t difficult or too time consuming once you get into the rhythm of it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical before using the kit, but now I&#x27;m a believer!  </li>
            <li> FALSE!!)  </li>
            <li> but that can get very expensive.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about it.</li>
            <li> Too bad no one will tip me $15 to give myself a mani-pedi.</li>
            <li> i bought this set and it was so bad...</li>
            <li> (mine were really bad).</li>
            <li> I was frustrated</li>
            <li> used to get frustrated with removal but foil</li>

            <li> The color you get is a crap shoot.  :(</li>
            <li> So I am very unhappy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The fuzzies are annoying me</li>
            <li> The base coat cures in 30 seconds and each coat of polish cures in 60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get any on fingers or cuticle, cuz water/dirt will get under base coat and polish</li>
            <li> Use the base coat provided (although I found a strengthener I like).</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product, but decided to take a chance, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I also hated all of their colors, so I did NOT get any of their gel</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased a lighter color polish with my starter kit in case my home manicure turned out nasty -</li>
            <li> When I say &#x60;scrape it off&#x27; it isn&#x27;t as horrible as you think.  </li>
            <li> The WORST part was removal.  </li>
            <li> I used Sally Hansen before Sensationail, and it was awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> just recieved product and lamp will not work ! and now i cant return it!!!</li>
            <li> Loved the kit! Long lasting! A bit time consuming but I also did one nail at a time since I have a needy toddler who demands attention frequently  :)  I found that if I do my nails in front of the tv I don&#x27;t find it as time consuming (obviously).  After doing the first nail I was frustrated cause my nail was super sticky, I failed to use the gel cleanser after the nail was completed but once I did, it completely removed the sticky feeling so try not to touch your nails to you complete ALL the steps because they will be tacky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll add a photo, I used the French nails manicure kit, but initially purchased this complete set.  Ignore my son and his Tupperware hat in the background!</li>
            <li> I love this kit. I wash dishes and clean a lot and still have beautiful polished nails. It stays glossy and chip free  as long as you cap each nail off as directed. It does take awhile but after a few times you get a lot faster. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Dull color. Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!!!!!</li>
            <li> if you are willing to put in the time, this kit will produce salon quality results.&lt;br /&gt;Some important things to consider include:&lt;br /&gt;Follow all directions completely (having said that, I have been doubling the time with the lamp because that is what was done at my nail salon)&lt;br /&gt;Polish removal can be a bear, so be sure to rough up polish with a heavy duty nail file to speed up removal.&lt;br /&gt;The lamp will not allow your entire hand with enough room for drying. I do fingers then thumb for each and it works out great.&lt;br /&gt;The color selection is great and in two months I have already paid for the kit three times over.</li>
            <li> Works great and came in when it was supposed to!!!</li>
            <li> After following directions to the letter, this polish still won&#x27;t stay on my nails. I can peel it off just hours later. I have had better luck with Sally Hansen Miracle Gel (no light) and the Miracle Gel topcoat.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit after having my eye on it for a while.  The Raspberry Wine color is beautiful.  This is a great starter kit for people wanting to save money and do their nails at home.  I found this polish much easier to put on and much prettier afterwards.  I was never really able to do a satisfactory job painting my nails.  My first application of this lasted over a week.  I&#x27;m pretty rough on my hands and I don&#x27;t really take care of them like I should.  I really like the LED lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as replacing these items, I&#x27;m a bit blown away that the little bottles of polish sell for not much less than the salon sized bottles of other brands.  That being said, this is a great starter kit.  It has everything you need.  However, while this set has created a monster, I will buy Harmony Gelish products.  I have purchased colors of their gel polish and I really love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing my research and reading reviews, I&#x27;ve found that you don&#x27;t necessarily need a &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34;, you can just use rubbing alcohol.  I really do like the lint free wipes and hope I can find some replacement ones when I need them.  I use one wipe for each application, sometimes using it for me and my step-daughter.</li>
            <li> Great light and gel system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing kits like these for the last year or so and have been intrigued, but have held off due to the price and thinking that I&#x27;d do a bad job of applying it and end up with messy looking nail polish.  I finally bit the bullet and purchased this set since it was on sale at a local retailer for less than the cost of one gel manicure.  I figured if even if I only used it once I&#x27;d have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!  I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long.  The polish was easy to apply and came out looking great.  No big messes, smooth glossy coats, and it lasted about a week and a half.  If you&#x27;ve been afraid of giving yourself a gel manicure (even if you&#x27;re not that great at giving yourself a regular manicure) give this a try!</li>
            <li> After spending $40 on a gel manicure at the salon, I decided to buy this set. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and I am moderately impressed. I followed the instructions provided and my gel nails cured perfectly! I love the lamp - it is a high quality lamp. The lamp lights up for 60 seconds and beeps at 30 seconds as some layers only need 30 seconds curing. My nails were totally dry and not tacky when I was done. It was hard to keep the gel polish off the cuticle though, especially when doing my left hand. I did put gel polish on the tip of the nail to seal it properly although I did not do a great job with it. It&#x27;s much harder to do my own nails than if I had a friend helping me. I was not too impressed with the quality of the solid polish. It went on uneven and even after a second coat, it still looks a bit uneven in the light. By day 2, my thumb nail began chipping and polish peeled right off on my upper part of the nail. All my other nails seem OK and it is now Day 4, although I can see that the tips are beginning to wear (this could be my own fault though for not sealing the tip properly). With more practice I am sure I will get better at it. I will also be trying this lamp with other gel polishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. The color is spotty and looks strange but I still used the top coat and primer.</li>
            <li> I did not buy my Sensationail kit from this supplier but buying one was te best beauty investment I&#x27;ve made all year. I get so many compliments on my nails now. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;As long as you follow the steps included your results will be great. I think it&#x27;s easier then sitting around and waiting for nail polish to dry. The results last 2 weeks and they don&#x27;t chip. My nails grow out by that point so I just pick it off starting at the base of my nail. I own the nail wraps but I&#x27;ve never had to use them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product now for 4 months and I would highly recommend it! I&#x27;m done with boring old nail polish!</li>
            <li> the nail polish sizes were a little small, but you can always buy refills. adore the lamp :)</li>
            <li> Gel polish worked great! It wasn&#x27;t difficult or too time consuming once you get into the rhythm of it! My first application lasted a little over a week (and survived a long weekend in Vegas). I have found that the polish will last much longer if you really pay attention to capping the nail with the polish and top coat. It is a must to keep it from chipping before the 2 week mark.</li>
            <li> I love this kit of sensationail gel polish. It is very easy to use and my nails look great after 18 days today.</li>
            <li> At first, I was thrilled with the results of this gel polish.  I was able to achieve professional looking results that lasted for two weeks without a chip, dent, or scratch. They truly seemed indestructible!  The problem is, they destroyed my nails.  Shortly after removing the gel polish (no easy task!), I developed very strange bumps and ridges on four of my fingernails.  I had healthy nails my entire life until I used this product.  It has been about four months since I used this product, and my nails are still a mess.  I pray they will begin to grow out normally again.  My doctor says that this is not a fungal infection. I feel it is a reaction to the harsh chemicals.  This product may seem fun and safe, but it can ruin your natural nails.  I recommend using regular polish instead.</li>
            <li> Just like salon quality gel nails at home for a fraction of the price. Product is very easy to use if you have experience painting and shaping your nails. Time consuming to remove gel polish but manageable and to be expected with gel. I have used this kit with several other brands of base coat, top coat, and color and all have worked perfectly. Very important things to remember for the best results: 1)Make sure you remove any gel polish you get on your skin before using the LED lamp! It is very hard to remove once cured. 2)Always wipe nails with gel cleanser/ alcohol after you apply and cure the final top coat. There is a sticky film/ residue that needs to be wiped off. One thing to keep in mind is the lamp will only allow you to cure 4 fingers at a time and your thumbs will have to be done separately. This is common among most home gel kit lamps in this price range though and I wouldn&#x27;t let it deter you from this kit as the lamp is really nice. I would recommend buying the &amp;#34;scrapper&amp;#34; tool that sensationail sells for polish removal as It makes the process easier.</li>
            <li> Very upset with this I was so excited when I got ....it very disappointment peel  off the next day can&#x27;t believe that this product did not work when I got the product the base coat was open and spilled all over had to run to the store and get a new one because I got this item because I had to go to  a wedding I would not recommend this product to anyone would love my money back for it this product did not do what it said it would anyone who wants to try this just letting you know that it peel off the next day does not last for 14 day</li>
            <li> Great product for those of us that would like to find a cheaper way to still have a professional look. True this starter kit offers quite small bottles, I still feel like you get a lot of bang for your buck. &amp; it gives you a chance to see if you like the quality of the product and a DIY product. (I know a lot of people like to be pampered and go to the spa as they do not have time to DIY- which is also fine) For me the polish lasted 2 weeks. My mother&#x27;s nails grow slower and it lasted for about a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit includes: (Amazon/Walmart offers a better price @ 36.00 than the company website @ 59.99)&lt;br /&gt;.125 fl oz of raspberry wine LED gel nail polish,&lt;br /&gt;.125 fl oz clear transparent LED gel top/base coat,&lt;br /&gt;.12 fl oz gel primer,&lt;br /&gt;.494 fl oz gel cleanser,&lt;br /&gt;lint free wipes,&lt;br /&gt;double sided nail buffer,&lt;br /&gt;manicure stick,&lt;br /&gt;&amp; a Pro 3060 LED lamp.&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with an application/removal instruction sheet.&lt;br /&gt;(Note:when you buy Sensational nail polish it comes in a .25 fl oz bottle @ 11.99/each) still pretty small to a comparable average size of nail polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED lamp is big enough to fit your whole hand but I do my thumbs separately for better light curing coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used the kit for the first time I noticed a little bit of shrinkage from the edges of my nails after curing them in the LED light (as I was trying to avoid my skin per the instructions). The second time I did my nails I applied a bit more around the edges and capped them a bit better even if I got polish on my skin. I cleared off as much polish as I could from my skin before I cure them. But its no big deal in a couple of days it peels off the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DIY removal process is a bit tricky and time consuming. The first time I tried wrapping my nails in foil with acetone soaked cotton. Which didn&#x27;t work that well. The second time I tried soaking my nails in 100% acetone and that worked better but still a bit of a hassle. NoteDo Not force the polish off by scrapping at the nail. The acetone will weaken your nails and you might be scrapping layers of your nail instead. If little bit remains after soaking, lightly buff the nail with a file. Next time I will trying the soaking method with a bowl of warm water as I&#x27;ve seen suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive also bought a couple of OPI LED gel polishes (.5 fl oz/each) @ 13.00-15.00 on amazon. &amp; those also work with the LED lamp in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this kit.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t go out of my way to write reviews for products, but I am so impressed with this that I had to! I am in love with this kit. It&#x27;s easy to do and my manicure has been perfect for 10 days! My nails would always chip with normal polish but I have had not one chip since using this. 100% worth trying!</li>
            <li> Ok, I NEVER paint my own nails, just didn&#x27;t do it well. I was getting the shellac for awhile, had to cut back my spending,so I stopped.i bought this kit for myself for Christmas- I had no problems with it. Having got the salon shellac, it was easy. The only thing is it took me over an hour! I was so slow so it could be perfect. The polish doesn&#x27;t really dry, so it makes that part easy. If you&#x27;ve got the time, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie at home manicures and found this pretty straight forward to use. My nails look great and they cured immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This started kit pretty much had everything. First I shaped my nails with the file provided, pushed my cuticles back and lightly buffed my nails. Then I cleaned my nails with the cleaner that came with the kit and then started the process of layering base coat, clear coat, 2 coats of polish and top coat. The led light is good and there is a timer with the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions exactly and my nails came out great with the exception of one nail. When I added the 2nd coat of polish and top coat, some of the polish moved around and let a &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34; on my nail. Not a huge deal, especially since this is my first time but I thought the curing would prevent that. I hope to get more proficient but overall I&#x27;m pleased with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a side note, this price is really expensive compared to Walmart (where I got my kit). The kit only cost me $34.99 there.</li>
            <li> I found this item at walmart and have to rate it.  The kit is basically the price of the purchase of a UV/LED light. IT is so well worth the $$$.  It is very easy to use and it comes with a quick step guide sheet. Gel Manicures in my area range from 30-45 dollars.  I have had my Gel nail polish (I used french tip for an addtional cost of the gel + the brush) for 5 days now and no chips or peels.  The dry time was instant, and I was so amazed!  NO DRY TIME involved. Perfect for the busy working woman! I had originally purchased the Gelish kit by Harmony for over $50.00 but found myself  looking for a LED light as my old 20ish year old UV lamp was only nine watts and the Gels require 36 watts to cure.  I would rate it higher but I did not due to the limited colors that are available from this maker. I am sure that as they get more popular they will add a bigger selection of colors, for now I will just order Pigment Gel and mix my own colors. I definetly recommend this kit as my mani is stil on after pulling weeds w.o using gloves, replanting flowers,as well as hand-washing dishes.  I even used non-acetone polish remover and it did not affect the shine or the polish of my nails. I polished my daugher&#x27;s nails and she said it made her feel \\&quot;pretty\\&quot;.  The polish is a soak-off type of gel and will require the use of Acetone nail polish remover to remove. I am fine with the removal if i can get a two week perfect manicure look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/02/12 update: I have been using my Gel system and have made marvelous discoveries: I simply use the clear gel on my natural clear nails. I clean them well with a $1.07 bottle of  91% alchool and papertowels ( no lint). After I cure the clear Gel I remove the tacky film with the alcohol and apply my favorite REGULAR NAIL polish color! and let it dry..the regular nail polish stays about two weeks and if i need to change the color- I simply use NON ACETONE polish remover and the regular polish comes off without harming the Gel.&lt;br /&gt;Sincemy original purchase of the kit, I have added a bottle of the Naile Base/Top Coat (Nailene Professional UV Gel Kit #71356 $15.75)coat and I am still using the original primer. I don&#x27;t soak, any longer, I simply sand off any/some Gel that has lifted or wants to come off and re-apply more get. Since the Gel is self- leveling, it fills the voids from the previous application. I am excited to try the French Nail Tips kit that were recently launched. we recently had fun with water-marbeling on our nails and he Gel kept the polish on for over a week.</li>
            <li> I really love this!! I have become my family&#x27;s manicurist! This lasts on my nails 2 weeks and my nails are longer because the gel polish is thick enough to protect them. I don&#x27;t use gloves to clean or wash dishes so my nail polish would never last more than 3-4 days without chipping and now they last 2 weeks and they are shinny the entire time!! I started getting manicures because my nails were feeling weak, but the people would buff my nails too much making them weaker and once they didn&#x27;t even put the top coat on right and my nails were matte in certain areas. I noticed that I could do that at home and researched many gel kits and this was the one with the best reviews. Now I do my nails how I want and if I do something wrong I can do it all over again without offending anyone. No more $25 manicures twice a month!! Yes, I spent a little more by buying the kit and nail polishes, but in a month I have already started saving that money and my mom and cousins have also benefited!</li>
            <li> 6-26-15 update - I just did my 2nd manicure with this kit. This time I used the rasberry wine color (very pretty) and I can say I&#x27;m still very pleased with this product. I will say it was harder to get the polish off this time than my previous manicure. soak time was really more like 20-25 minutes before I could get gel off - and it did not slide off... more like a scrape, but it was only 12 days out. I&#x27;ll probably let this one go 3 weeks and see if that helps. Darker color a little harder to work with, but the kit has already paid for itself, and I find the gel polish much easier to work with than regular nail lacquer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6-16-15: I really am pleased with this product. I purchased a lighter color polish with my starter kit in case my home manicure turned out nasty - but it&#x27;s really beautiful. fyi - this kit doe NOT come with the 100% acetone you will need to remove gel manicure..so if you are starting after a pro manicure, you&#x27;ll need to pick that up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel goes on very smoothly and it is easier than regular polish to apply smoothly in thin layer. I did my 1st application a few days ago and my manicure is still completely intact, shiny, and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen other reviewers complain about the size of the LED lamp in this kit. Originally I thought it was rather small, too. So I used that to my advantage - I completely manicured and cured 1 thumb, then the opposite thumb, then 4 fingers on non dominant hand, and finally the 4 fingers on my dominant hand. It fits 4 fingers easily and this method made me go slowly and patiently (I&#x27;m not a patient person by nature, LOL). The results are worth it. The way I figure it, this is a starter kit (operative word starter) - if I stick to these home gel manicures, I may upgrade, but I currently see no need. This works and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review when I see how long this lasts compared to professional manicures - but so far I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with results (this is gelon my natural nails, not acrylic). Love my nails and with 1 more manicure, my starter kit (+1 color) will have paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I have been looking at LED UV lamps and they are so expensive. This kit comes with everything you need to do quite a few manis out of the box plus a LED UV 7 watt lamp. yes, you can only put 4 fingers in the lamp at a time, but big whoop for the price. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. The lamp works well with all the benifits of LED. The lamp beeps at 30 seconds and turns itself off at 1 min. The kit comes with basic instructions on application and everything you need to start as soon as you open the box. I love it. I was looking at buying a cheap lamp with replaceable bulbs until I could afford a LED this kit has fixed my problems with waiting.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and results last! A good investment instead of paying salon prices every 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I have been painting my nails for years. I had a professional apply gel polish to see what it was all about, it lasted 4 weeks. I decided to save money and do it myself. This is amazing, everything you need is included, follow the steps and you will not be disappointed. I painted them one week ago and they are still perfect - shiny - no wear on the tips - i have received many compliments. I will say one thing... i have always kind of slopped polish on knowing the shower would wash away they excess, well that is not the case with gel so take your time, apply it thin, especially when you &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; the ends. I read other reviews that you can use regular polish, i am going to try that next.  To remove... lightly file the surface, apply acetone on a cotton ball, wrap in foil, wait 15-20 minutes, remove and scrape away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oh probably 20-30 times now and it still works as great as it did the first time!</li>
            <li> not satisfied at all, disappointed, not shiny&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
            <li> This is the best thing since sliced bread.  I never bother writing product reviews (this is my first) but this thing is amazing. I absolutely love how forgiving the product is- my right hand looks as amazing as my left... And there is normally a clear difference, since I&#x27;m not ambidextrous!  I had my nails done at a salon a couple weeks ago, and I honestly think I did much better on myself at home with this kit!! Too bad no one will tip me $15 to give myself a mani-pedi.</li>
            <li> I have had salon gel manis in the past, and really loved the shine and longevity.  I love having &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; looking nails, but I am NOT one to baby my nails.  The way that a gel mani cures so quickly, with no drying time after, is really a huge plus!  I tend to do my nails at night, when salons aren&#x27;t open, and I need my nails to be completely dry before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as usage---The instruction card is very clear, and as long as you follow the instructions (DO USE THIN COATS!), the system works great.  You will have shiny, wonderful nails that aren&#x27;t tacky at all.  (Be sure to swipe with the cleanser or rubbing alcohol to remove any residue at the end, or your nails will be sticky and not shiny.)  The only thing I found significantly different than doing a regular mani at home was the texture of the gel polish.  It&#x27;s somewhat slippery and moves around the nail, so be very careful to wipe excess off the brush.....a loaded brush full of product is not your friend with gel polish.  It&#x27;s much easier to use less product and do multiple thin coats than to clean excess polish off skin and cuticles.  If you are not good at painting your nails, I would suggest starting with a lighter color.  I am fairly accomplished at nail polishing and nail art, and I found the gel polish to have a bit of a learning curve.  If you learn with a lighter color, mistakes won&#x27;t be so obvious.  Overall, loved the kit!  It worked exactly as advertised.  I will update on the durability as I put this gel polish through its paces.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, IF YOU FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. For those of you who have chipping issues, you have to read the directions and cap each nail to prevent chipping. For those of you who say it ruins your nails and you prefer acrylics, the result is the same. I have had acrylics many times and my nails are ruined afterwards. The result after using this product could be comparable to getting acrylics but for me not nearly as painful and my nails seem fine. For those of you who complain the product \\&quot;peels right off\\&quot; you have to buff your natural nail before applying to help it adhere. These are all steps that have been skipped. USER ERROR. This product delivers just as it claims.</li>
            <li> I just got mine today and it took about 30 minutes to complete. My nails are very short right now so I had trouble capping the nail. It was also harder to do my left hand, as I am left handed. I did get some on my cuticles, but overall I am very happy and believe I&#x27;ll get better with time. I used to get my nails done regularly, but after becoming unemployed, I stopped. This will give me my manicures without the cost.</li>
            <li> I just did my 4th application using this product and I am loving it more with each application. Yes it is a bit tedious to get off but all gel polish is. I&#x27;m still working on the removal process but the results are worth a bit of a hassle. I tend to be rough on my nail between doing dishes, working in a lab where I&#x27;m constantly putting on and taking off nitrile gloves and just the constant wear of dealing with paperwork and rifling though a bag. This isnt perfect for a full 14 days but pretty close. If i let this go until it looked like my usual breaking point with a regular manicure (which is pretty bad) I could probably leave it on over a month. I&#x27;m still  refining my application technique so it is lasting longer. I just took it off at 2 weeks but I probably could have lasted longer. I recommend watching some videos for some helpful tips. My biggest problem was I kept basically gluing my nails to my finger tips while capping my nails. This excess polish broke free by day two but its annoying. The gel polish does not dry until its cured so I recommend cleaning up behind your nails and around the cuticle. This is mentioned in the instructions but I&#x27;ll admit i ignored this the first three applications. On the fourth try I used the stick to clean it up and about 20 minutes post application all of my nails are free from my finger tips and the edges are cleaned up which is where it tended to be the areas where I would first see the polish breaking away or falling off about 10 days in. Everyone has to learn to follow the directions the correct way for me it was when I tried forcing my nail free of my finger tip and getting a cut below my nail. Practice makes perfect, follow the directions, look for some helpful tips from others and I guarantee you will be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Love this product, my nails are strong and it&#x27;s been 4 days and no chips, still shine like the day I put the polish on. Easy to use</li>
            <li> Great starter kit and so affordable!</li>
            <li> I just recieved it today. I was so excited until I opened it and saw that the primer was COMPLETELY EMPTY. The brush was DRY also. Disappointed because it took so long to get here just for the primer to be empty</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised,  doing the job, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I have been eyeballing this kit for several months but was afraid to spend that kind of money on another useless product.  You see, I have polish challenged nails.  My nails are so thin and brittle that even the priciest of guarantee&#x27;s never lasted more than 24 hours on my nails before they started chipping and/or peeling off.  As with others I have in the past resorted to costly bi-weekly acrylic nails.  Those did work; however, they assisted in the demise of my &#x60;real&#x27; nails and really too expensive and inconvenient to maintain.  Although I didn&#x27;t purchase my kit on Amazon I came across a deal online that was too hard to pass up and I will forever be grateful that for chance meeting.  I&#x27;ll admit despite the care I take it NEVER lasts two full weeks for me.  However, I get FULL 10 days out of the manicure before I start seeing general wear that prompts me to take it off and start over.  Typically, it&#x27;ll start to peel up around my cuticle bed on day 11 and will get caught in my hair as I&#x27;m shampooing or it raises on the tip of my nail just enough for me to notice dirt has gotten in between the nail and the polish which drives me to distraction and causes me to start picking away at it.  I know I should have better restraint, however, I don&#x27;t it&#x27;s a flaw I&#x27;ve learned to live with.  So, I am GREATLY pleased by this product and recommend it to anyone else who is polish challenged.  You will not be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for those who have problems getting the polish off (which was another one of my original reluctance to purchase), it really isn&#x27;t that bad.  Just buy the little tool that scrapes it off.  I&#x27;m not keen on soaking my fingertips in acetone for 15 minutes like some people do, but that&#x27;s just me.  There are multiple videos on Youtube that show you easy ways to remove the polish and I&#x27;ve tried a few but scraping it off works best for me.  I&#x27;m able to scrape off the polish without using any remover and very little effort with that handy little tool and it only takes a matter of minutes.  Probably less time than removing regular polish would take.  When I say &#x60;scrape it off&#x27; it isn&#x27;t as horrible as you think.  I run the tool around the edge of the polish which usually lifts it from my nail so that the remaining polish just peels off in one pass.</li>
            <li> This kit works great! I love to get my nails done but that can get very expensive. This color is great and lasts, highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Gel manicures will not work for me! the polish peeled off the next day and the products weakened and dehydrated my nails so bad!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love it! No more wasting time reapplying nail polish every 3 days... Love love... !!!</li>
            <li> I do not have the money to go to the salon once a month, let alone every two weeks! But item has already paid for itself, as I did my nails and toes! This product is so easy to use, even the right hand looks ok! I did experience some chipping on my nails after a week, but my nails are really short so I couldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; like everyone recommends. Once they grow out a little I think the next application will last even longer.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Fairly simple, long lasting color, love the shine and toughness&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Too many steps in application and REMOVAL is a pain in the A**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this kit and was amazed at how long the color lasted.  I was skeptical about the two week no chip claim,  but it truly does do what they say it does.  The only thing that made me give three stars was there were many steps to application.  Yeah it dries instantly but in the meantime I&#x27;ve put on three or four layers of different stuff and \\&quot;cured\\&quot; it for 15-30 second each time and each hand.  Might be equal or longer than drying time of normal polish.  The WORST part was removal.  OMG it did NOT come off easily.  First of all who has time to soak their hands in acetone for 15 minutes and then hack away fleck by fleck?  (The picture shows it peeling off in one big piece.  FALSE!!)  And it does NOT work well the first time so then you soak some more, hack some more and meanwhile your fingers are wrinkly and smell like acetone not to mention what all this roughness does to the nails.  So if long lasting color is worth the time of application and removal then this is the stuff for you.  It certainly looks nice for a long time but to me, it just wasn&#x27;t worth the time and aggrivation.  UGH!</li>
            <li> Does a nice job. Last around 2 weeks and does not seem that hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  One suggestion:  put the primer coat around the outside of the nail, not the whole nail surface.  It&#x27;s just not needed in the center of the nail.  Polish looks great for at least two weeks.</li>
            <li> My friend and I used this kit to do our nails. Love the light! It has motion sensor so just plug it in before you start and just place your hand in to turn on lights.  Follow the steps outlines in directions and your nails will end up perfect. We did one hand at a time and then cured with the light. You will need to cure thumbs separately due to the space under light.  The light will blink to let you know when 15 or 30 seconds are up for the curing. We did our nails in no time and they turned out great. You will love this light!</li>
            <li> This seemed to be a great deal and I love Sensationail nail colors, so I gave this a try, however I am not happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;1. The primer seems to be a waste of time and has to air dry. (the whole reason I use Gel is No Drying Time)&lt;br /&gt;2. The base/top coat does not work as well as others I have used. This one does not seem to seal the nail like my other brand and it is definitely not as shiny :(  (I prefer Kiss Top and Base Coat)&lt;br /&gt;3. The LED lamp is a FANTASTIC size, however the magnetic bottom falls off and it doesn&#x27;t cure the gel as well as my other lamp.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, not a good product for me. :(&lt;br /&gt;But the Sensationail Nail Colors used with the KISS Top and Base Coats and LED lamp are a PERFECT combination!!!</li>
            <li> This gel nail really lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t chip.  I loved the color and how long it lasted, unfortunately it isn&#x27;t for me. I tried it 3 times and used  different techniques to try to remove the gel nail polish.  Each time I found myself having to scrap off the gel even after waiting 30 minutes with the remover.  The methods I tried was to soak the fingers in warm acetone and another time using the foil wraps.  They were weakening my nails and they were tearing off.  I switched to Red Carpet Manicure and this product is much easier to remove.  They have a good selection of color but not super extensive.  I plan to stick with RCM for now.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit last year at Christmas time from Walmart.  I LOVE it and am still using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a little practice to do and may take a little longer than an normal paint polish but it is well worth it.  The gel polish does last up to two weeks as advertised and continues to look wet and shiny for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take more effort to clean off polish but as you are not having to paint your nails as often, I don&#x27;t find it to be that much of a hardship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Co-workers are always complimenting my nails and can&#x27;t belive I did them myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this again in a minute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting my nails done for years (usually acrylic) but my manicurist turned me onto gel polish and I loved it! Gel polish stays looking newer for a longer period of time because it keeps its shine. My acrylic could last for weeks if not for the surface polish (regular nail polish) that will have chipped or dulled in less than 2 weeks. With the gel polish over acrylic I could go much longer without a fill because my nails still look new and shiny even after 3+ weeks of nail growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I haven&#x27;t gotten acrylic lately I still enjoy polishing my nails at home. Polish usually lasts about 5-7 days for me depending on how much effort I put into prep work and the type of polish I use. I first saw this kit at Walmart and thought it was too expensive to try. Finally saw it at CVS instead with a $10 off coupon next to it recently and bought the kit. It came out to something like $40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening box I was pretty impressed with the UV lamp - it looked high quality. I was less impressed with the other tiny, tiny, bottles of gel cleanser, base/top coat, gel color, and primer. It would have been nice to have larger bottles of product. The instructions were LONG. Not that any of it was complicated, but there were a lot of steps involved. Half of these steps I already do when I put regular polish on anyway. (File, clean, etc.) No big deal really. It&#x27;s helpful that they give you a summarized reference card in addition to detailed instructions so you don&#x27;t have to read the long instructions over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I took my old polish off using regular remover and cotton. This will prove to be a huge no-no later with the lint from cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Using their lint free wipe, clean nails with \\&quot;Gel Cleanser\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Applied \\&quot;Gel Primer\\&quot; to nail in a circle (though I did a box shape) around my nails. Air Dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply thin layer of \\&quot;Base/Top Coat\\&quot;. This is clear so I couldn&#x27;t tell whether I was applying thin or not. At this point I notice little fuzzies  everywhere on my nails from cotton earlier. Doh! Oh well, must keep polishing! Cure for 30 seconds...the lamp beeps after 30 seconds and turns off after 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Apply thin layer of \\&quot;Color Gel Polish\\&quot;. As I am doing this I accidentally swiped my other hand with cured base coat against my sweater sleeve. Not only do instructions not tell you that curing doesn&#x27;t set your base/top coat but your nail surfaces are quite sticky right now and you have to be very careful. Grrr..More fuzzies all over my nails. Must continue color gel polish. Cure for 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Repeat with second coat of \\&quot;Color Gel Polish\\&quot; and cure for 60 seconds. The fuzzies are annoying me but thankfully since my nails are not set I am able to remove some of them as I am applying polish. At this point nails are still super, super tacky. Stay away from dirt, lint, everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Finally, apply one more thin coat of \\&quot;Base/Top Coat\\&quot; and cure for 30 more seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Take the lint free wipe, put some \\&quot;Gel Cleanser\\&quot; on it and wipe it over surface of nails. This takes away that tacky/sticky layer. Viola! Done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Gorgeous, mirror like shine, gel manicure that looks incredibly professional. Shines like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;- No strong odors at all. I was surprised that it barely had any. No odors on nails after either.&lt;br /&gt;- I figured out during process that if lint sticks to polish after curing you can clean it up with the \\&quot;Gel Cleanser\\&quot; and continue on to next step of polishing. It turns out that the polish IS set underneath the sticky layer on top and you can just wipe it away with the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;- Polish color has depth, no streaks at all.&lt;br /&gt;- Read instructions once and just referred to reference card afterwards. Pretty easy.&lt;br /&gt;- Nice UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;- Though it seems like long process, it&#x27;s not. Remember you are not curing each finger, you are curing one hand at a time(minus the thumbs).&lt;br /&gt;- Save money in long run (maybe not time because of removal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Probably should have mentioned in instructions that your nail surfaces will be sticky through entire process until last step.&lt;br /&gt;- Not much product in kit.&lt;br /&gt;- Price is sort of high. Bottles of polish cost around $10. Refill kits I think are slightly higher or around same price.&lt;br /&gt;- Removal time and effort is expected to be high. It&#x27;s a given whether you get acrylic, brush on gel, etc. I have not tried a product that did not require the use of a Dremel, literally, to take the manicure off. If this is a concern of yours, you could still purchase this kit and do a clear gel overlay on your nails instead. Let your nails grow out or do your own fills.&lt;br /&gt;- Not good for people that like to switch colors often.&lt;br /&gt;- And last, the whole UV lamp thing does concern me. Is it dangerous to be using this thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Though I&#x27;m dreading the removal part because I&#x27;ve had to go through similar process with brush on gel before, I am overall very satisfied with the outcome. It&#x27;s my first time using this and my nails came out great despite the couple of snafus. I still have fuzzies in my nails but you can&#x27;t even tell because it&#x27;s so ridiculously shiny. I&#x27;ll upload a picture for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Follow up 7/25/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still a VERY happy user of this gel kit. I just wanted to update on removal methods (and it&#x27;s really not that bad!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure acetone soak:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went and purchased pure acetone from the beauty shop (it comes in plastic bottle in different sizes). Poured some into a glass bowl and soaked for 10 minutes. (This is after I had filed the shiny layer off surface of nails). After 10 minutes I noticed gel had softened on nails. Taking an orange stick I scraped the gel off one finger at a time. It was not difficult whatsoever. Your hands don&#x27;t look pretty during this process. The gel doesn&#x27;t come off in one piece, it sort of shaved off...like if you were to take a chocolate bar and a peeler to get some chocolate shavings lol. Even when I soaked other hand for longer I still had same experience. Some people put the bowl of acetone into another bowl of hot water. I have not tried that method yet. If you try this method make sure you have a good surface to work with and a glass bowl. I originally put it in plastic and it melted the plastic. Also the acetone can eat away at your furniture/laminate. I&#x27;m sure adding heat would have helped but I have a small apartment and not much workable space to do anything. Other reviewers seem to say that is key to easy removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peel off method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, this is not the \\&quot;prescribed\\&quot; method but I just scrape it off my nails without the acetone. I found that this was less messy and since gel wasn&#x27;t soft from acetone soak, came off in bigger chunks. Any remaining gel I just filed away. The traces of gel normally stick to where you had placed your primer. So don&#x27;t go overboard on the primer! I have not used acetone since and I&#x27;ve done my nails several times since then. If your natural nails are pretty strong then you can probably get away with this method as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other peel off method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the fun one. I skipped the primer when I put the gel on. The resulting manicure looked just as good though didn&#x27;t last as long. And when you are tired of your manicure all you do is peel it off each finger in one piece. It reminded me of the polish we used as children that peeled off in what looked like a layer of vinyl. It was fun but don&#x27;t expect it to last weeks or anything. Great for anyone with commitment issues :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final tip:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch out for that primer. The more you put on, the more difficult it is to take off gel. It&#x27;s like super glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/11/12&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick update. (Still loving the system btw!) They have a new tool now that looks like a scraper, costs about $5 and works GREAT in helping remove polish. Looks sort of like a mini curved spatula. I have not gone back to using the acetone at all and continue to just remove polish by scraping it off dry. With this added tool I can remove my polish in less than 10 minutes. Do use care when using the scraper not to dig in and damage natural nail! I use primer sparingly....so if your polish is not coming off easily you will need to soak your nails in pure acetone to soften if you have trouble.ne piece, it sort of shaved off...like if you were to take a chocolate bar and a peeler to get some chocolate shavings lol. Even when I soaked other hand for longer I still had same experience. Some people put the bowl of acetone into another bowl of hot water. I have not tried that method yet. If you try this method make sure you have a good surface to work with and a glass bowl. I originally put it in plastic and it melted the plastic. Also the acetone can eat away at your furniture/laminate. I&#x27;m sure adding heat would have helped but I have a small apartment and not much workable space to do anything. Other reviewers seem to say that is key to easy removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peel off method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, this is not the \\&quot;prescribed\\&quot; method but I just scrape it off my nails without the acetone. I found that this was less messy and since gel wasn&#x27;t soft from acetone soak, came off in bigger chunks. Any remaining gel I just filed away. The traces of gel normally stick to where you had placed your primer. So don&#x27;t go overboard on the primer! I have not used acetone since and I&#x27;ve done my nails several times since then. If your natural nails are pretty strong then you can probably get away with this method as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other peel off method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the fun one. I skipped the primer when I put the gel on. The resulting manicure looked just as good though didn&#x27;t last as long. And when you are tired of your manicure all you do is peel it off each finger in one piece. It reminded me of the polish we used as children that peeled off in what looked like a layer of vinyl. It was fun but don&#x27;t expect it to last weeks or anything. Great for anyone with commitment issues :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final tip:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch out for that primer. The more you put on, the more difficult it is to take off gel. It&#x27;s like super glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/11/12&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick update. (Still loving the system btw!) They have a new tool now that looks like a scraper, costs about $5 and works GREAT in helping remove polish. Looks sort of like a mini curved spatula. I have not gone back to using the acetone at all and continue to just remove polish by scraping it off dry. With this added tool I can remove my polish in less than 10 minutes. Do use care when using the scraper not to dig in and damage natural nail! I use primer sparingly....so if your polish is not coming off easily you will need to soak your nails in pure acetone to soften if you have trouble.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit at my local Target for $50. I was a little skeptical because I only felt comfortable having the nail salon give me a gel mani/pedi... It works great!! Along with the quality being good, you&#x27;ll also save yourself tons of money. Typically every 3 weeks I would get a gel mani for $35; with this you&#x27;ll pay around $50 and you&#x27;ll just have to purchase gel polish (which btw the light works with other brands).</li>
            <li> Mine worked great in the beginning, I agree it is tough to get it off.  After about 6 months and a huge investment in nail polish colors the lamp no longer hardens the polish.  This is when the polish peels off in one big nail shape.  I have tried to reach the company and have left several messages and no one will return my call.</li>
            <li> Works so well!! Lamp only fits 4 fingers but great overall</li>
            <li> Looks like it was professionally done.</li>
            <li> I am a tremendous skeptic but have been very happy with this kit. I bought the starter kit with the LED lamp included. I can get the polish on four fingers cured at one time. This is much better than the tiny one finger lamp some of the starter sets have. The base coat cures in 30 seconds and each coat of polish cures in 60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be very careful not to get this on your cuticles. That is what makes the polish lift. It also looks gunky. I have done three manicures for myself at home. The kit has more than paid for itself. You receive a buffer/filer, cleansing gel and lint free wipes, primer, the base/top coat, and polish plus the lamp. The instructions could not be simpler and there is even an instructional card with pictures of each step. Each time I use this, I get a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, manicures are lasting me about 10 days. In fairness, the polish does not so much lift as I get bored and start chipping it off myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finished manicure is just as glossy and smooth as any professional can achieve. Just be patient and follow the instructions. The reds are stunning, especially the ruby shade. It is deep and red and very sexy. The starter kit says you receive enough product for ten manicures. It seems doubtful that I will get 7 more from that tiny bottle of base/top coat, but we will see. So far it is relatively easy, if a bit time consuming because you must be careful. The polish lasts through a lot of dish washing, house work, laundry and some pretty intense cleaning. I have been very happy with this kit so far.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Very durable nail polish that set hard immediately out of the LED light.  I have had my first application on for two weeks now and besides my outgrowth my nails look perfect still.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!  OMG SO SIMPLE!!!!!!  and lasts n lasts. I&#x27;ve gone 3 weeks between with NO lift.</li>
            <li> Painted my nails after receiving the shipment. Im on my 4th day wearing the polish and still looks beautiful. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this kit! Have had it for 6 months and it&#x27;s well worth it. Don&#x27;t expect perfect results the first couple of times, it takes some practice to get it right. Follow the directions to a tee! When they say use thin coats seriously, use THIN coats! Too thick and it will peel and chip. Also, the polish goes on much nicer if it&#x27;s warm, I roll it between my hands for a minute and it works great. It takes time and patience to get it right. Removing it is the hardest part, I did finally buy the metal scraper tool and it&#x27;s a big help. I work in the food industry and am constantly washing my hands and wearing gloves and I can get a good ten days out of my manicure. Word of caution though... I bought Sally Hanson gel polish because they had some nice colors, however the polish chipped and peeled after 2 days, every time I&#x27;ve used them! Stick to sensationail polish, I would love if they came out with more colors!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic starter kit for those who want to save a little money and do their own Gel Nail Polish at home. I wish the bottles of polish and top and base coats were bigger but it works for now. I also wish they had a better selection of colors to choose from with the kit. Otherwise a great kit.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail products I have ever used. Honestly, when I bought this kit I didn&#x27;t expect the polish to stay on my nails because nothing has in the past for more than a day. This stuff wears and stay on my nails for weeks. I really like that this is my natural nail and doesn&#x27;t look fake. My nails seem and feel stronger with the gel protection on them. Frankly, I am surprised that it came out on the market, it&#x27;s going to give salons a hard time.</li>
            <li> A little backstory, no matter what I do, I cannot get a home-done manicure to last more than 2 days. I&#x27;ve tried numerous top coats and anti chip polishes and nothing worked. One day I went to the salon and had shellac done, it was a little more pricey but they swore that it lasted for 2 weeks without chips or wearing. It totally worked, and from then on I was on a mission to get the same effect at home for way cheaper. I shopped around and came across this SensatioNAIL nail kit and decided to purchase it based on the reviews, although I got mine from Wal-Mart for cheaper. I got the starter kit in Raspberry Wine, and I love the color. I followed the directions on the back, except I let the last coat of polish dry under the light twice to make sure it had set properly. That was almost a week and a half ago and my nails still look pretty good! Normally I would had to have painted them 3 times by now! In 2-3 uses this product will pay for itself, just by not having to go to the salon. This product is also fantastic for mothers of little kids who do not have time to sit and paint their nails. In 10-15 minutes your nails are completely painted, dry and ready for everything!! Have already recommended this product to a few people! A must have!</li>
            <li> I did just what the directions said, the polish didn&#x27;t look nice, it like shrank on my nail.  Probably won&#x27;t mess with it again.</li>
            <li> It stays on great, but only for 5-8 days.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply if you follow the instructions provided. Anyone can do it.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price. I&#x27;ve changed gel polish 4 times already, not because the gel wasn&#x27;t holding, just because I wanted a different color. However it&#x27;s difficult to remove when it&#x27;s on real nails. I wish there was an easier solution.&lt;br /&gt;Soaking in soak-off remove (one that&#x27;s specifically for gel) for 10 minutes didn&#x27;t work. Had to soak for 10 min, scrape some off, soak for 10 min again, scrape some, and then file. Really hurts the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, a better solution would help.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I really do recommend the product. I love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit for my mom after I introduced her to the awesomeness of the gel manicure. The product arrived on time with no problems or defects. She&#x27;s used it three times so far and absolutely loves it. She did mention that it&#x27;s a bit harder to get off than the Gelish brand, but she says it lasts a bit longer without chipping so it&#x27;s worth it. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Ok, so here&#x27;s my thoughts....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The application of the polish was easy and quick. Make sure you push back your cuticles. Try not to get any polish on your skin, and if you do, make sure you wipe it off before curing it. IMPORTANT POINT: YOUR NAILS WILL FEEL TACKY AFTER CURING. At first I panicked &amp; thought the product was an epic fail. Then I used the cloth/gel cleanser and the tackiness immediately went away and my nails were rock hard. So, your nails will be tacky, sticky and seem wet until you use the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I haven&#x27;t gone through the removal process yet, but I anticipate it to be laborous. However, that&#x27;s why I bought the product, so it would stay on my nails for as long as possible. I can&#x27;t bash the product for doing what I want it to do. I feel that if you want an easier removal process, use regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The end result is just what I wanted. My nails are super shiny, and hard. I have some polish on my skin which hasn&#x27;t washed off despite frequently scrubbing my hands, but whatever, I just know to be more careful next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It&#x27;s $40. I would spend that for just my fingers at a salon, and I can do my toes &amp; fingers multiple times. Yes, the polish bottles are small, but the manicure lasts at least a week (I&#x27;ll update after 2 and see where we are at) - so a little goes a long way. The lamp works just fine &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I like that it &amp;#34;beeps&amp;#34; and turns off after the designated time frames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li> I really wished I&#x27;d looked on Amazon before buying this at my local drug store- I would&#x27;ve saved $20! Regardless, I was impressed with this kit. It was easy, the UV lamp was good quality, and my nails came out really nice. I figure it&#x27;s worth the money since I&#x27;d normally pay around $50 per gel manicure at the salon. We&#x27;ll see how long my polish lasts before chipping, but right now I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. At this point I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has some skill doing their own nails and wants to save one money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love to see the seller offer some variety packs of nail polish, rather than buying only one at a time...</li>
            <li> You will love doing your nails gel style! Such a great deal, and so much better then paying $35+ at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at Walmart for $50, it&#x27;s a great deal, especially because it has the LED lamp AND a color.  Buy it from walmart for $50, or CVS for $60, This is a rip off on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, look into the Gelish polishes separatley, much better quality and you get a bigger bottle for the same price.  These ones are too watery and streaky.</li>
            <li> I had gel nails done at a salon and loved it so much that I bought this kit to do it at home.  I was concerned about the removal based on reviews, but I found this produced easier to remove than some regular polishes.  Someone in a review here gave the tip about using 100% acetone and putting the bowl holding the remover in a larger bowl with warm water.  If you read the instructions in this kit, it actually tells you to do the same along with buffing off the shine with the board included.  I lightly buffed off the shine.  I bought professional strength acetone at Walmart (inexpensive) and followed the directions.  My water was actually more on the hot side, but not too hot.  The gel fell off so easily.  I soaked my nails for about 3 minutes, used the stick provided to scrape off gel (per instructions), soaked about another 2 minutes and scraped off the rest.  Easy as that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the polish while wearing, it has been great!  Some reviews mentioned there were too many steps, but considering you apply every 2 weeks instead of every 2 days, I think it&#x27;s worth the time and effort.  The shine is the same as what I had with the salon application.  And I can&#x27;t believe how long my nails are getting since they&#x27;re not breaking off.  My nails have always been weak and break at the slightest activity.  No chips in the polish either.  I had stopped painting my nails because they would usually look bad within hours with chips, smudges, and oftentimes broken nails.  Where have you been all of my adult life gel polish???</li>
            <li> I decided to try this brand specifically because it had the best reviews out of all the other options I had. I am SO glad that I invested in this kit. I did my own gel manicure for the first time yesterday and my nails came out wonderfully. I followed the instructions that were provided with the kit carefully since I&#x27;ve never used gel polish before. The polish cures in 60 seconds as the instructions state and shine beautifully after using the top coat and gel cleanser.  I also bought the french tips and Champagne color gel polish along with this kit and I love them both. It was exactly what I was looking for and this product exceeded my expectations. I will admit, the french tips tear easily but are relatively easy to apply - I blame it on my inexperience. I&#x27;d highly recommend this for any first time user.</li>
            <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;After using the product a second time I noticed burning if the product got on my cuticles at all (before curing). Then after my third time using the product my nail beds just ached even after curing and I had to remove it after a day. This is an allergy to the polish - it seems both the base/topcoat and the nailpolish itself cause me allergies. I have not had allergies with gelish. I know allergies happen but I wanted people to know that if you are allergic to this brand you may not be allergic to all brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my lamp started not producing enough UV to cure the polish after about 1 month. I did end up buying the gelish 18 g and am happy going to all gelish product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;Previous review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited to have found this product. It is an excellent deal to get the whole kit for this price (though generally it is cheaper in stores). I found it very easy to use and my first manicure lasted 9 days without a chip before I decided I wanted to change it and I had a lot of growth. I have subsequently kept nail polish on 2 weeks before I wanted a change. This is revolutionary to me as I can usually not get away with more than 1.5 days of a regular manicure without chipping due to my weak, peeling nails. This meant I would spend lots of time changing my nail polish which in the end was more damaging than the soak off from this product. The product gives a measure of strength to my nails which has allowed me to grow out the split portions and has increased the overall health of my nails. I also use Solar Oil daily and feel that this is also helpful in replenishing any moisture lost from the soak-off. Regarding the soak off process, it is a little annoying but worth it for the amount of wear I get out of the polish. Be sure to buff off all of the shiny top coat before beginning the soak-off. Heat helps speed the process too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to be able to use this product you will have to have a very steady hand and be able to keep the product off of your skin and cuticles as you work. Do not cure the product with it on your cuticles - you will not be able to remove it later. It is also important to not get the product on your skin as some people can become allergic to gel products with repeated exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One further tip I have is that after curing the base coat, wipe off the sticky layer with a dry lint-free pad. This will prevent the colored layers from shrinking up from around the edges of the nail. I think this is more of a problem with darker colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also had success using Gelish nail polish with the lamp which is a bonus. If I get more into gel polish I may get a larger lamp but for now this is great for home use. I would appreciate seeing more of a color selection in the future from Nailene but as I can use Gelish this is not a big detractor for me.</li>
            <li> I used this at home and cured my nails more than suggested since they were not setting.  Hours later, my nails were still not hard, but rather rubbery.  This product does not work, do not buy it.  Its 7 watts vs. other light systems with way more wattage 25, 36 &amp; even 54 watts and they cost the same or less.  Someone&#x27;s making a bundle.</li>
            <li> Over time my nails have become brittle. Instead of being weak and breaking on the edge at the quick, which they used to almost always do, they were now breaking off in a jagged chunk of a piece or section at the tips causing me to continually shorten them to the length of the one that most recently got dinged. Very frustrating. After hearing a lot about gel polish I decided perhaps that would strengthen my nails along with taking Biotin (a B-vitamin supplement). However, the salon cost was too prohibitive for me twice a month. I was happy to see several products become available to the general public for home use, but was skeptical about quality and DIY results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing anything I went to a professional and got a clear gel manicure to test the wear and see how long it would last for me. If it didn&#x27;t do well then I would avoid the expense of a DIY investment. I researched the various products available and weighed the info and concerns related to UV light versus LED during the time the initial gel manicure was growing out. I decided that the feedback from dermatologists was just too iffy for me to risk UV exposure so I went on the search for products cured with LED light. Around that time I discovered SensatioNail on the market in my local drug store. I waited a bit and then read reviews online and couldn&#x27;t find many negatives (mostly the bad reviews seemed to be related to user error/issues) so I started searching for the lowest prices and watching for sales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that the gel manicure held up extremely well with no chips or peeling and I had a measurable way to realize that my nails grow more quickly than I might have guessed. By four days I could detect the re-growth, but it was tolerable; however, by one week I was starting to wonder if it was noticeable to others and by 10 days I had a good 1/8 of an inch re-growth, which to me was quite enough so two weeks wasn&#x27;t going to probably be the case for me (especially with colors). Nice for growing out problem nails, but not so great to have manicures done on a regular basis at a salon because with such fast re-growth a new professional manicure every 10 days would be cost-prohibitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around that time, Walgreen&#x27;s had a sale on Nailene&#x27;s SensatioNail with $10 off the starter kit (bringing it down to $49.99) and $2 off each nail product (manufacturer&#x27;s coupons which were available at the Walgreen&#x27;s beauty counter and also usable WITH the sale price. Each color was $7.99 less $2 and the French kits were marked down too and I was able to use a $2 off manufacturer&#x27;s coupon for them as well). All together I got the starter kit with LED light in Raspberry Wine, a sheer pink French kit, clear French kit, Sugar Plum color and extra French tips, for around $90 including tax. A chunk of change, but reasonable considering the cost of LED lights sold separately online was more than that just for the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing the existing gel was not at all difficult. I chose to try my own method first before utilizing those listed in various reviews online or even in the directions. I used pure acetone I had on hand that was previously purchased at Wal-Mart (least expensive place I had found it locally) with a square of absorbent paper towel. I did the removal while watching TV so I was not taking time away from something else. I held/pressed a small square of moistened paper towel over each nail at a time for approximately two minutes, using the crook of my finger on the other hand to &#x60;warm&#x27; it and keep it from drying out in the air. After a minute or two I rubbed a little of the flaking gel off with the towel square onto another section of paper towel, re-moistened the square and held it again for another minute or two. After that I found I was easily able to use my thumbnail to gently push/scrape the flakes from my entire nail in long steady light pressure motions starting from the cuticle to the tip. It wasn&#x27;t difficult and came offeasily. Before I knew it, all my nails were clean and ready to go to the next step. To me, this was gentler on my hands than soaking my fingers in acetone because the moist paper towel was only on top of my nails and not all over my fingers/skin (except for the crook of alternated fingers on the opposite hand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the gel removal I washed my hands and treated my nails and cuticles with my favorite oil, added my favorite hand lotion to my hands and let my nails breathe overnight. The next morning I began the new manicure, which took approximately 20 minutes start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIY TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time using DIY gel product and I definitely learned several lessons right away with the first application. I chose to try the sheer pink without tips for my first experiment. It seemed to me to probably be the most forgiving if I messed up and I thought it would probably show less if I did a less-than-perfect job (and that turned out to be correct). You could just as easily use clear. I like the sheer pink look anyway and had used that on my nails more than anything else for years so it was a very natural combination and look for me. I recommend this for the novice. It helps you learn what you might need to refine without likely having to re-do the entire manicure right away. PLUS: It&#x27;s light and I have discovered it can easily be covered up successfully with a darker gel color without removing the entire manicure first. A bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First: T-A-K-E  Y-O-U-R  T-I-M-E!  This is particularly important if you are going to use a color, especially a dark or red color. The raspberry wine definitely stains your cuticles and skin (and must be cleaned up with acetone) so it is very important to go slowly and methodically. I recommend using your dominant hand (likely the one you write with) to do your &#x60;other&#x27; hand first. This gives you the best \\&quot;feel\\&quot; for using the product with confidence and you&#x27;ll be able to quickly see some obvious do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts that should help you tackle the opposite (more challenging) hand. The gel polish won&#x27;t dry too quickly like regular polish does, so you have the time to be meticulous and fix issues before you cure it. If you want a good end result, this is imperative! The second you put your hand under the LED light you will be able to clearly see all mistakes and learn what not to do next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second: T-A-K-E  Y-O-U-R  T-I-M-E!  It is critical IMHO to brace or secure EACH hand and some fingers as you apply the gel polish. I use the corner of my bathroom counter or a table and anchor my little finger of the hand holding the brush for steadiness. I also keep the finger I&#x27;m working on flat on the top of the counter or table. This helps tremendously to provide for the best opportunity for a good result. Rotate the flat finger from left to right to be sure you&#x27;re covering close enough to each side edge. If not, just fill in with light even strokes with little polish on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third: H-E-E-D  T-H-E  D-I-R-E-C-T-I-O-N-S: Pay attention to the warnings about using too much gel polish on the brush at once. It&#x27;s easier than you think to get too much. Once it pools in the cuticle area or along the sides, or even gets on your skin, it&#x27;s really challenging to clean up easily without just wiping it all off and starting over, thereby wasting expensive product. The best way to avoid this is to swirl the brush around the inside of the bottle to remove excess polish first. You can always add a little more if needed, but it&#x27;s nearly impossible to remove polish with just the brush if you start with too much. Once you begin polishing, start with a long single stroke down the center of the nail from near the inside of the nail bed area to the end of the nail to see how much gel you really are working with. You can gently and slowly push the brush a little closer toward the cuticle if necessary to get as close as possible WITHOUT touching the edge. Then stroke the sides, being careful to stay away from the skin or leaving too much polish that might run or pool. Gravity is not your friend with gel application! Turn your finger from side to side to be able to see the edges better and know exactly how close you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth: B-E-F-O-R-E  Y-O-U  C-U-R-E  E-A-C-H  L-A-Y-E-R: Hold your fingers up in the light at different angles and move them around so you can see that there are no bubbles or uneven areas and that the gel is evenly distributed as the light shines on various parts of your nails. If you find a bubble, use a mostly dry brush to smooth it till it&#x27;s satisfactory. In some instances you may be able to turn you hand upside down for a couple of seconds and let gravity help redistribute the gel toward the center if too much is close to the side edges. FOR COLORS: Don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t have completely even coverage of the first color coat. You can balance that out with the second coat. It does cover well with two coats. Repeat the same process to avoid bubbles or uneven coverage. I thought perhaps I could avoid using the top coat to keep from having layers that got too thick-feeling, but after removing the tacky moisture layer from one finger after curing the raspberry wine, there was no shine. So, top coat seems necessary with colors (except the clear French kit). When applying top coat, be careful not to get carried away. It doesn&#x27;t need to be thick or it may pool or run if it is applied too liberally; however it does need to cover each side edge properly. It also needs to be checked for bubbles and even coverage before curing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus: I have come up with my own solution to remove missed bubbles (which I somehow have managed to have at least one of on one finger each time). I have a new, clean straight edge and literally VERY CAREFULLY shave the head/top off the bubble. I can&#x27;t see that it removes any of the shine, but it does leave a smooth feel without any detectable bubble (if done properly, you can&#x27;t tell there was a bubble, either by sight or feel; except on VERY close, intense inspection). Be sure to use the blade parallel to your nail and very s-l-o-w-l-y slide it smoothly across till you meet with slight resistance (the bubble). Then gently push it through the gel bubble to top it off. If you don&#x27;t have the blade flat enough you will gouge the layer and that does leave a nick that you can feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally: I was just too curious to wait longer than a week after my initial sheer pink manicure and the re-growth was already showing; so I cleaned my nails with alcohol to remove any lint and added raspberry wine right over the existing pink manicure (two coats of raspberry plus one clear top coat). It worked beautifully. The sheer pink re-growth was completely covered up. There were no lines or indication that there was even anything else under the raspberry wine and my nails are even stronger because of the added gel layers. I think I will always start with a sheer, clear or French manicure and then when it&#x27;s grown out too much to my liking I&#x27;ll add color to get another 1-2 weeks or more before removal and provide the most strength possible as my nails grow out. Since I&#x27;m not one to change colors all the time, but like my nails to look nice, I really appreciate getting more time out of each manicure before removal and I really like the strength of my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE MONTH LATER:&lt;br /&gt;After using the product several times now I can say with certainty that I am most likely going to abandon use of SensatioNail after the current supply from the starter kit is used up. I have not been able to remove it completely yet without some stripping/weakening of my own nails. I like the look and wear, but not what it&#x27;s doing to my nails. I&#x27;d estimate that my nails are about 35-50% weaker and thinner at this point. I particularly like the LED over UV light and will continue using it. I will be switching to CND&#x27;s Shellac and still using the LED light, but for half the curing time. Gel-ish has a free pamphlet in Sally&#x27;s stores that gives curing equivalents for LED lights so I will use that as my guideline (on cursory review it seems to be about half the time). When I initially had the professional do the first gel manicure (Shellac is her product of choice) so I could test gel out before investing in it myself, it came off beautifully and without any trouble or damage to my nails. Someone told me that it is not quite the same as this kind of gel product, but I&#x27;m okay with that. The same person also recommended using a product called \\&quot;Nail Envy\\&quot;, which she says the pros use and is best for strengthening natural nails and preventing damage. I will try that along with Shellac and see how it goes. In the meantime I am using regular polish with one clear gel coat of SensatioNail on top for strength and protection to give better wear. Hopefully that will also make it easier to remove without more damage to my nails till it&#x27;s all used up and I make the switch. I&#x27;ll update again after I&#x27;ve used CND products for at least a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MANY MONTHS LATER:&lt;br /&gt;I have learned that as long as I don&#x27;t use too many layers of the product, it comes off nicely without damage to my nails (particularly when I rough it up with the Emory board they provide). My less-than-happy previous update is now replaced with me being a very happy long-term user that is quite satisfied with the product. I recently purchased my first essentials replacement items. They have lasted far longer than I expected and I am actually still using them. I just had a coupon and it was also on sale so the timing was right for the purchase because of the discounts. I plan to continue using the products long-term. This gets a definite thumbs-up from me and a recommendation to anyone interested in a low-cost DIY home gel kit that doesn&#x27;t give UV exposure.THOUT touching the edge. Then stroke the sides, being careful to stay away from the skin or leaving too much polish that might run or pool. Gravity is not your friend with gel application! Turn your finger from side to side to be able to see the edges better and know exactly how close you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth: B-E-F-O-R-E  Y-O-U  C-U-R-E  E-A-C-H  L-A-Y-E-R: Hold your fingers up in the light at different angles and move them around so you can see that there are no bubbles or uneven areas and that the gel is evenly distributed as the light shines on various parts of your nails. If you find a bubble, use a mostly dry brush to smooth it till it&#x27;s satisfactory. In some instances you may be able to turn you hand upside down for a couple of seconds and let gravity help redistribute the gel toward the center if too much is close to the side edges. FOR COLORS: Don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t have completely even coverage of the first color coat. You can balance that out with the second coat. It does cover well with two coats. Repeat the same process to avoid bubbles or uneven coverage. I thought perhaps I could avoid using the top coat to keep from having layers that got too thick-feeling, but after removing the tacky moisture layer from one finger after curing the raspberry wine, there was no shine. So, top coat seems necessary with colors (except the clear French kit). When applying top coat, be careful not to get carried away. It doesn&#x27;t need to be thick or it may pool or run if it is applied too liberally; however it does need to cover each side edge properly. It also needs to be checked for bubbles and even coverage before curing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus: I have come up with my own solution to remove missed bubbles (which I somehow have managed to have at least one of on one finger each time). I have a new, clean straight edge and literally VERY CAREFULLY shave the head/top off the bubble. I can&#x27;t see that it removes any of the shine, but it does leave a smooth feel without anydetectable bubble (if done properly, you can&#x27;t tell there was a bubble, either by sight or feel; except on VERY close, intense inspection). Be sure to use the blade parallel to your nail and very s-l-o-w-l-y slide it smoothly across till you meet with slight resistance (the bubble). Then gently push it through the gel bubble to top it off. If you don&#x27;t have the blade flat enough you will gouge the layer and that does leave a nick that you can feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally: I was just too curious to wait longer than a week after my initial sheer pink manicure and the re-growth was already showing; so I cleaned my nails with alcohol to remove any lint and added raspberry wine right over the existing pink manicure (two coats of raspberry plus one clear top coat). It worked beautifully. The sheer pink re-growth was completely covered up. There were no lines or indication that there was even anything else under the raspberry wine and my nails are even stronger because of the added gel layers. I think I will always start with a sheer, clear or French manicure and then when it&#x27;s grown out too much to my liking I&#x27;ll add color to get another 1-2 weeks or more before removal and provide the most strength possible as my nails grow out.

            <li> Really stays on for two weeks with out peeling and it&#x27;s really fun. Great alternative to traditional polish and it&#x27;s pretty easy to get the hang of and gratifying it&#x27;s not a $50 trip to the salon. My picture is at 1.5 weeks</li>
            <li> I bought this kit specifically because I&#x27;d used a friend&#x27;s light who had this same one and thought it was the perfect one for my needs. The color was beautiful and I really love it, but the light stopped working almost immediately. Kind of hit and miss product quality in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this Kit! Manicures look great, would probably last 2 weeks but I usually change it by the tenth day  due to nail growth.  Stays shiny the whole time, looks just like a salon manicure. The only thing I find are that the polishes are a little thin and needs 3 coats sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this kit to anyone.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I had one of these before and I really like this one. It is smaller which is good for keeping it in the drawer. However that size can make it difficult to cure the thumbs and fingers at the same time. The kit was convenient but there was only enough polish in mine for one use. Everything else will give several applications. It is better than the gel polish they have switched to at the salon that I go to. They swapped out for one that doesn&#x27;t require a top or base coat. I dont like that because the finishing shine isn&#x27;t as glossy and reducing the finished product by two layers doesn&#x27;t protect the nails from breakage as well.  This is a nice convenient and affordable way to keep your nails looking nice at home.</li>
            <li> I love getting gel polish done at the salon but it is SO expensive. I was hesitant to purchase a gel kit, but after reading a lot of positive reviews (and since it was on sale!) I purchased this kit. I am so glad I did. I am not kind to my nails, and I hate waiting for them to dry, so this is such a great purchase for me. You do have to be very careful when applying, as anything touching your cuticles or skin will ruin the lasting power of the mani, but with practice this is not hard to do. And it really does last a long time. It was more difficult to remove than gel polish from the salon, but by wrapping with aluminum foil and acetone and being patient it isn&#x27;t too hard to remove. The only bad part is that I have to buy a million more colors to go with my hundreds of regular polish at home!</li>
            <li> Very nice kit that I used it right away  It came with all you need for a nice gel manicure</li>
            <li> While the outcome was beautiful it began peeling off the first time I did an easy set of dishes.  Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite easy to use. :-) The 4 layers polish are thin and shine. I tried several brands and this one is really the best.</li>
            <li> I have only had this on for 3 days but I love it!! Normally I can polish my nails with regular polish using a base coat, one or two coats of polish and a top coat and it is chipped with-in 24 hours no matter what brand of polish I use. So therefore I hardly ever polished my nails but like the look of polished nails. We live in the country and have animals and I garden and do not wear gloves. It does not have one single chip on it anywhere and I really have been intentionally not being easy on it. Will post again in a week or two.</li>
            <li> Be carefull if you cancel BEFORE shipping! Product is great. Shipper unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li> Nice color! And cures very well.</li>
            <li> I read all the concerns about removal of SensationNail polish. I too have struggled to get it off. Then I discovered a video on the Internet describing in detail the process. 1.  Use glass bowls only.  2. Get a larger bowl and fill with water, heated. Don&#x27;t let the water boil in the microwave. It should be nearly hot.  If it is too hot, your hands will burn inside the smaller bowl with the acetone.  3.  Put the smaller glass bowl, containing 100% acetone, (a small amount) inside the bowl with the hot water. This facilitates the acetone to remove the polish.  It makes all the difference in the world! In fact, the polish rolled right off, with just using pressure from my thumbnail, in less than 15 minutes. I was glad to discover the  video as I was very worried about the difficulty in removing the polish. I was also worried my nails would get too thin from using the nail file as a scraper.  Once this problem was solved,i I have to say I love this product! I love being able to do my nails at home, and be in charge of when and how I&#x27;ll take care of my nails. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the nail polish gel colour too much but everything else was great</li>
            <li> This is a quality product that does what it says it will do.  I had two problems with this product that led to my four star review.  First, the product beeps to let you know when 30 seconds has passed (the time it take to cure the clear polish) which scared my dog a lot.  A quick google will show that many individuals who own pets have found that the beep is not a great thing.  Second, despite following the directions I have found that sometimes the polish will peel off.  The polish is hard as expected and almost never chips, but I have had a whole nail completely peel off a few times.  Overall I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I love this!!! If you can paint your nails you can successfully create a salon quality gel manicure at home (I am NOT a professional but have always been decent at painting both hands myself). It took me about 40 minutes the first time because I was really careful to follow step by step. The second time I knew what I was doing so it only took about 20 minutes. I prefer doing the manicure at home where I can relax. I&#x27;ve used with Gelish polishes also and they work too (cured for 30 seconds, 2 coats) - this is important because the SensatioNail color palette is somewhat limited (though expanding). I have yet to try a french manicure but that&#x27;s next. The shine and strength is incredible. You can also just use the clear gel polish to create a strong base for nails and paint regular nail polish over that if you like to change the color more frequently (because the gel polish DOES last a solid 8 days minimum - my first attempt lasted 9 before they began to lift anywhere and the second time a solid 14 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that the whole kit costs less than a full set of gels :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Raspberry Wine\\&quot; that came with the kit I ordered is very pretty for winter (a deep maroon with tiny sparkly pigments)&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Coral Sunset\\&quot; is great for summer/spring (it is creamier w/out sparkly pigments)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick tip - if you have chubby hands like me, cure 4 fingers on one hand, then 2 thumbs, and then 4 fingers on other hand so that you do not inadvertently bump nails before they are fully cured**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I am assuming the reader of this review has 10 fingers, please adjust my recommendation accordingly as I mean no discrimination :)</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my sister for Xmas and was surprised at how easy it was!!! It&#x27;s been five days and the manicure still looks amazing! I bought one for myself it loved it so much!! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive and excited to receive this product bc I wasn&#x27;t sure it would meet my expectations. I carefully followed the directions and was pleasantly surprised with the results. I also did the nails of other women and Sensational have new fans. I get to be creative and save money bc the salon charges 25-30 dollars for a gel manicure and this pays for itself.</li>
            <li> A really great kit and very easy to use</li>
            <li> This is my first gel nail system and it&#x27;s working great! I like how EVERYTHING is in the kit but the remover (still trying to figure that tricky process out). I worn the gel polish while doing car mechanics (change oil, brake pads, and rotors) and to the beach and nothing has chipped except when I pick at it from the cuticle and even then the paint isn&#x27;t totally destroyed. The system is very easy--it has a quick step-by-step guide and no timer is needed because there&#x27;s automatic shut-off. Perfect for watching TV. My nails feel really weird and tacky before I use the gel cleanser again as the last step. If I had know this, I would have bought extra with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I immediately bought 3 colors in addition to the kit and have tried 2 (neither of which was the Raspberry Wine) and I&#x27;ve been bummed that the colors are not what I expected at all. The Mis Behave or whatever it&#x27;s called that looks like a dark, blood red is more pink and I would say a darker fuchsia. Coffee Bean or Espresso Bean which looks like a dark brown online is more of a bronze that glimmers with green and yellowish tints and in sunlight looks like a (not dark) brown. Terrified to know what Raspberry Wine looks like since that looks pink online--it will probably be hot pink or something SO not me.</li>
            <li> I just got my kit yesterday, but I am a little disappointed because the lamp had some scratches on it. It made it look like  it was already used which made me more disappointed and mad because I paid for a new product. After that, I decided to give it a try and did one nail. It look so pretty and shiny, but after a couple of hours I washed the dishes and the gel started to fall out. I thought that I was going to save a lot of money and time with this kit by doing my nails at home, but I just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This product was super easy to use! My nails look just like I left the salon. I work in a hospital so well see if it holds up to being constantly washed and hand sanitized.  I didn&#x27;t use the color that came with the kit I used the color. Called after five and I&#x27;m in live with the color. If I can do this anyone can because I&#x27;m far from a girlie girl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I have only done one manicure so far, and thus far I like this product. It may be a little less strong than the gel treatments at the salon but I think it takes a little practice. The colour is slightly thinner than a regular nail polish and with practice I think I&#x27;ll get better at it in time, but it looks good and it&#x27;s going to save me a lot in salon visits!</li>
            <li> This is great -- I never had nice looking nails before, but this polish finally changed that.  It makes my nails feel nice and strong.  The thing I&#x27;m most impressed with is how pretty the polish looks on your nails.  I don&#x27;t think it looks pretty as your putting it on -- I actually thought it looked thin and streaky.  But then after putting the nails under the light they come out looking beautiful.  I&#x27;m not even tempted to pick at them now that the polish makes them feel so strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read the reviews before I bought the kit and I was almost too scared to try it since the removal process sounded so hard.  I finally gave in and tried it, and I&#x27;m soooo glad I did.  I took the good advice of another reviewer who said to put the primer on very sparingly.  The more you use, the harder it will be to remove.  By following that advice I had no problems removing it at all.  I picked most of it off just while taking my dog for a walk, then got the remainder off with the removal tool they sell at Walmart ($4.99).  Worked great.  I didn&#x27;t need any acetone at all.  With this product, I can finally say I love my nails!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  It looks so natural, I use with nail tips.  I have had many compliments on my nails.</li>
            <li> I am the type of person who always likes my nails painted.  I was getting so tired of the constant painting and chipping and hated how when I got gel done at a salon they would insist on filing my nails which after a few times left them paper thin.  This product is fantastic, comes with the light and everything you need to do up to 10 gel manicures yourself.  I totally skip the buffing of the nail because over time it just leaves them thin and weak.  Even not doing that I find if I use three coats of color instead of two I will easily get a full two weeks without a single chip!  If I do get a chip its easy to touch up since I have the light and colors at home.  I have found the easiest way to get it off is to use the foil removers and 99% acetone.  I don&#x27;t buff before hand, wrap the foils on for 10 minutes and it easily scrapes off.  I bought the metal scraper and it works like a charm.  The entire process from removal to end dry product is a couple hours.  Maybe I&#x27;m just slow but I don&#x27;t mind spending the time on a perfect manicure knowing it will last two weeks.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! My nails are normally chipped before walking out the door of the salon, or at least within a day or two, what a waste! But who wants to pay $90 for a gel mani/pedi? This is awesome, for less then one regular mani/pedi lasting about one day you can get ten manis lasting 2 weeks! I&#x27;m very hard on my nails and so far they&#x27;ve held up for...17 days with no chipping (They&#x27;ll grow out before they chip)! One nail did come off after 5 days but it was my first time doing gel nails so lets say user error. The best part is its so easy to put on, i love that UV lamp, no worries about smudging or not being able to use your hands till the nail polish hardens ( always a lost cause, am i right ladies?). I love it so much I immediately bought 6 more colors. I am sold and I&#x27;m usually a tough customer!</li>
            <li> LOVE this!!!! I had the raspberry wine color on for 6 days and then wanted to changes colors so I took it off, but it looked perfect at 6 days. I had the second color on for 8 days, it was starting to peel up next to the cuticle, but I&#x27;m still happy it lasted that long. I&#x27;ve had the current color on for 3 days and it still looks awesome. I think I will add another coat of color to it after a week to fill-in next to my cuticle. My nails are soooo long now because they are amazingly strong with the polish on them. I do not know if a manicure will last 2 weeks, mine need a fill-in after a week so I do not expect that I would ever wait 2 weeks. I am a very satisfied customer since I can paint my nails, have them dry immediately, and then to look perfect for a week.</li>
            <li> Would NOT recommend this product waste of money and time. So I used the starter kit and was disappointed when my nails started chipping/ peeling the next day, so I figured okay, maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong. Watched youtube tutorials describing how to maximize the most wear from this product.( clean and buff nails, apply primer liberally, thin coat of bottom coat/top coat and two thin coats of polish, cap nails). Followed these directions to a T..still chipping and peeling and the MOST I got out of these Sensationail products was three days. AT MOST. Not worth spending almost an hour doing my manicure to get a whopping three days of pretty nails. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money on something that actually lasts.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great so far, I didn&#x27;t order anything additional when I got the starter kit in case I didn&#x27;t end up using it that much, I didn&#x27;t want to purchase additional colors or tools and end up not using it... But I love it! It&#x27;s smaller, so it doesn&#x27;t fit your thumb in with your fingers, so it takes just a bit longer than in the salon, but it was simple enough and worked as I had hoped. I&#x27;ve ordered new colors and am excited to continue using it!</li>
            <li> I received this product for $39.00 - a $20 discount and feel that this was a great price for a high quality product. For those who are insinuating that their gel polish came off in just days due to the product being cheap, ineffective, etc. did NOT follow directions closely. While, with some products, skimming through the directions is acceptable, you must read and follow EVERY step of the process with this product. If the product is coming off in whole pieces, it&#x27;s likely because the gel base or polish was applied to the cuticle where it will not adhere properly and thus cause the entire gel to come off. Make sure that cuticles are pushed back and the product is covering ONLY the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this. I have done both my fingernails and toenails and both have held up sufficiently. I prefer the pink chiffon and raspberry wine shades best and really love the shiny finish that lasts for the duration of my manicure and pedicure. Since gel manicures (without any type of false nail) is typically $30-$40 at local salons, this product is a great deal considering one gets 10 manicures out of the starter kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 4/5 stars because I wish the LED lamp was larger. The process is long enough and having to do thumbs separately is somewhat frustrating. Had the product been a bit larger, all 5 nails could be cured at once.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this kit, I really did. It takes too much time and effort, and when removal time comes, you can&#x27;t get the polish off with a nuclear bomb :(  ... It starts chipping almost immediately with normal wear. Regular polish with a bit of top coat works better. It does shine like crazy however. For the time and cost, it really isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a local store after reading the reviews here on Amazon. This is an AWESOME product! The kit comes with everything you need for a long-lasting gel manicure. I highly recommend this product for your DIY gel manicure needs!</li>
            <li> I have been using the sensationail line for over 6 months and love it.  Saves lots of money considering it is normally about $35-40 in the city for a gel manicure.  Took me a couple times to get the hang of applying but now I&#x27;ve mastered it.  No one believes that I did them myself.  I pleased that they are coming out with more colors as the original ones didn&#x27;t knock me out.  For removal, I bought that kit and the tool.  But I&#x27;ve found that it is much easier to just peal it off.  (Apply pressure at the edges, use removal tool on stubborn nails).</li>
            <li> Easy to use once you get the hang of how to do it</li>
            <li> Very tricky to get right and last 3 weeks. It&#x27;s not the products fault, its my application. I wish the lamp was a little bigger though</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t going to a salon anymore. This kit is amazing. Directions are easy to follow. I&#x27;m thrilled with results!</li>
            <li> Gel are not good but LED Lamp device is very good.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have a professional looking manicure which I can do myself while spending time with family, or watching TV!  I used Sally Hansen before Sensationail, and it was awful.  Would not stay on.  The Sensationail stays on very well, in fact it is a little hard to remove.  Make sure you have the removal tool for easier removal.</li>
            <li> The LED light is great. It&#x27;s small but well made and works nicely. The small gel polishes, alcohol, wipes, and primer are nice additions, however I have to say the quality of the color polish is lacking. I&#x27;ve purchased other gel polishes and SensatioNails is of much poorer quality. It&#x27;s very thin and hard to apply. Definitely not salon quality polish. The base/top coat is ok though since it&#x27;s clear. Would recommend the lamp, but not the polishes.</li>
            <li> Not as good as OPI but a great deal and I&#x27;ve enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been getting Gel manicures for about a year and I love getting them done professionally. The pros always used OPI and when I used a color from a different line it was never as good. Well, to save money I thought I&#x27;d give this a try since it&#x27;s not a huge investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it a lot for what it is. It was pretty easy to apply and not at all difficult to remove. That is my one OPI complaint. When the pros do my nails it takes FORVER (like 25 minutes of soaking) to really loosen it, and then I have to scrape my nails with a metal scraper to get it off to the point where sometimes I&#x27;ve damaged the nail bed. This only took about 5-10 minutes of soaking with foils and then what little was left scraped off with the included wooden stick with no nail damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These colors do not last as long as my OPI manicures - my OPI manicures would last 3 weeks without so much as a chip - the got so grown out that I would &#x27;fill&#x27; them in with regular nail polish and blend it over the top for an ombre effect. With this product I went a week  before one chipped (I was cracking crab legs - it was hard work on my nails, I&#x27;m not surprised, and only one chipped). I think I didn&#x27;t cap the nail perfectly and thats why it lifted, but it didn&#x27;t take me long to re-do it and the other nails looked great. I&#x27;ve even embedded gems in the top coat with no problems. I&#x27;ve heard this light works with OPI so I&#x27;m hoping to try that next. Overall, a good product which I would recommend for someone starting to do their own gels.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions for this product I would not recommend this item to anyone. Once the nail polish was applied it became sticky. Three hours later I petted a neighbors dog and I had dog hair in my nails. And get this they can ship a hazardous item as nail polish but you cannot return it. I would rate this item as a .25.  And it was not stated when you purchase the gel starter kit there is no solution to remove the nail polish that&#x27;s a separate kit. So I am very unhappy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Easy to use</li>
            <li> I had an issue with my order and it was dealt with quickly and politely. The actual nail kit was a gift, but my friend seems to love it!</li>
            <li> works great love it did what it was suppose to do and last!  easy to do looks just as good as salon</li>
            <li> Lasted the full 2 weeks only one small chip love the color</li>
            <li> I love this gel polish kit.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried an at home gel polish.  I was skeptical before using the kit, but now I&#x27;m a believer!  I&#x27;m well over a week into this manicure and the polish is still perfect.  I can&#x27;t wait to get more colors.  I doubt I&#x27;ll ever go back to regular polish again!</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about this product. its very easy to use (however, a lot of steps) and i was more than happy with how my manicure turned out in the end. It is a little difficult for me not to get the polish on my cutical but i think thats my error not anything with the product. The acatone soak is definitely my preferred method, i actually stole some disposable gloves from work and soak a cotton ball with acatone then put the gloves on. The polish removes fairly easily! Very very happy.</li>
            <li> Its rare for me to find a product I like enough to leave a review but this product gets 5 stars from me. While Im sure the manufacturers didn&#x27;t intend for consumers to use the product with regular nail polish, I find it works wonderfully.  I love changing my polish often so I cannot say if regular polish will last for the 2 weeks they claim of the gel polish but I did get 7 days of beautiful nails with NO CHIPS. I suspect I could have gone at least 3-4 more days. I chose to use regular polish because the gel polish colors are limited and I have a nice investment in my regular polish that I didn&#x27;t want to waste. I also find the removal is very easy contrary to what others have said of the gel polish removal.  I wrap acetone soaked pads around my fingers with aluminum foil and wait about 5 minutes and this removes the top layer of gel and the polish and then the bottom layer of gel i gently scrape off with my fingernail...so easy and no damage to my nails.&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell I apply the primer product to the tip or perimeter of my nail only, then apply the gel base coat and cure, then apply regular polish, allow to dry and apply the gel top coat and cure. Then wipe with alcohol. The only downside I have discovered is that if the regular polish is too thick and not quite dry when you apply the gel top coat it can get somewhat of a ripply affect but often times that can be smoothed out by applying pressure to the nail to press it down smooth....sometimes if its not as nice as I would like i quickly redo the nail in question.  Hope this helps...for someone that never got more than a day or two of polished nails before chips appeared..I&#x27;m loving this.</li>
            <li> Great, easy.... And wonderful nails two weeks at least :)</li>
            <li> I love this set, and the convenience of having my nails dry instantly!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time &amp; money buying this product. Bought this kit today &amp; attempted to use it &amp; the LED light appears to be defective would not even turn on. The nail polish that comes with this kit is miniature size. I also purchased a gel nail polish in this same brand for 11.99 thinking it was full size when I opened it realized their gel nail polishes that cost 12 bucks are also miniature size!!! Very disappointed bringing this product back to the store tomorrow!! Complete rip off</li>
            <li> I love this kit! I actually bought it at Walmart and paid $50 because I didn&#x27;t want to wait for shipping, but I paid that much for 1 gel manicure in a salon so I thought it was worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;It is really easy to use and didn&#x27;t take a super long time, however if you have to remove gel polish and prep your nails it does take longer.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am happy with the results, I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if it lasts as long as the salon manicure which only lasted me about 12-14 days, but after 10 days they were growing out and not looking as good.&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the French manicure kit, and I didn&#x27;t have much luck with the adhesive tips, but I will try again. I added some glitter polish to cover up my not so perfect freehand French manicure, and I am very happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li> Worked WONDERFUL.  Easy to do.  Takes about 15-30 minutes to finish (I applied four layers) and saves you SOOOO much money from having to go to the salon.  Also, gel lasts a long time and is great for any one who has to spend a lot of time typing or sorting files/filing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> Looked at several different kits and this one had lots of good reviews.  I purchased this as a gift for my daughter.  She immediately tried it out once opening it.  She loved it.  Not sure how well it is holding since she went to her home which is about 8 hrs away and has had the flu since.  Will try and update in another month.</li>
            <li> Love the end results. I do stress the fact that following the directions word for word is essential. The only thing I did not like was the coupon enclosed with the kit. It was expired😕</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy a &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34; as I am not terribly good at doing my nails to begin with. I read the reviews and decided on this one. I&#x27;m very impressed at the salon quality look this kit gives me. It really does look like I got my nails professionally done, and I&#x27;ve already used the kit to do my friend&#x27;s nails. I&#x27;m on day 7 and still no chips or lifting. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with either not doing my nails at all or wanting them to be perfect if I am going to paint them. Regular polish that last 2-3 days is just not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this kit over the weekend and realized I should have done it a long time ago! A few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Directions are long, but it&#x27;s basically the same process as doing your nails regularly (file, clean, base coat, paint, top coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I made the mistake of applying too-thick layers and getting some on my cuticles/skin. I can see now this will shorten the life of my manicure, but I&#x27;l get better at it next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final result, however, is pretty awesome considering it was my first time doing a gel manicure on my own. Shiny, hard, and glossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to try new colors! Kit pays for itself after about 2 rounds, considering what you&#x27;d pay at a salon.</li>
            <li> I had seen this starter kit and always thought it was too expensive.  Well I received it as a Christmas gift and now wish I had purchased it earlier. Its amazing! I&#x27;ve had several friends ask if I got my nails done professionally. Absolutely love it and can&#x27;t wait to try new colors.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels great. Long process though.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for several decades.  However, this was my first experience with any gel nail product.  I am very pleased.  The instructions are easy to understand and seemingly thorough.  The color was quite close to the one on the box.  I did have to use three coats of color to get a complete cover.  This kit, which included an LED drying lamp was very reasonably priced.  The quality of the color and base coats is good.  The variety of gel colors is more than adequate.  I am so pleased to have a completed manicure in such a short time.  The manicure lasted for two weeks - looking as good as the first day.  The only reason I had to give myself another manicure was because my nails had grown out.  This product and this system (gel) fit my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> Awesome products! I love this nail kit! The polish is great quality and stays on my nails for two weeks or longer.</li>
            <li> Very good deal on the Sensational gel polish starter kit. Price much better than Walmart!</li>
            <li> After 23 years no more visits to the salon to sit for two hours paying oodles of $ for something I really didn&#x27;t enjoy. I bought this on sale, the kit with the light, after soaking off acrylic, polished my nails with this. It lasted a full fourteen days with NO issues and I am ROUGH on my nails (wash my hands a lot, typing daily, messing with the dogs, dishes, etc.) Taking off, I floated a bowl of acetone (regular nail polish remover that I bought for 1.69) in another bowl of heated of water and soaked my fingers for about ten minutes. Gel peeled right off, I bought the \\&quot;spatula\\&quot; for $5 that Sensationail sells, but you could do it with an orange stick too, make sure you lightly buff off the shine before soaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the second application, I used the expresso colored nail polish, application went faster because I knew what to do much better the second time. Suggest that you take your time and READ the directions. This product is well worth the price, if you can paint nails, you can do this. BEFORE you cure it with the light, if you mess up polishing take a foam eye shadow applicator dipped in a tiny bit of nail polish remover and clean up your cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great alternative that is affordable, doable, and worth the time. Bye nasty acrylics.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for myself but ended up giving it to my sister in law. She LOVES it!</li>
            <li> This stuff worked so well I could not get it off.  The tips never chipped after 3 weeks of wear.  When I tried to get it off it took 2 hours of soaking in pure acetone and scraping.  And I still didn&#x27;t get all of it completely off.</li>
            <li> I really love the color! I would definitely buy it again. The bottle lid seems to leak a bit making it difficult to store unless you store yours right side up all the time. Otherwise, a great price and beautiful color.</li>
            <li> I love the look of painted nails, but given the countless dishes and baby bottles I wash I can never get a manicure to last more than a few days without a chip. This product was easy to apply, dries rock hard instantly and lasted for 11 days, even after completely all the everyday chores.  I can now have the best of both worlds, nails that last for two weeks and look good for work, and nails that stand-up to mommy duties around the house.  My only wish is to know how to fill in color, my nails grow quick so after a week you can start to see the color pull away from the cuticle area.</li>
            <li> Good product and delivery!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks great!  I&#x27;m not very nimble and was still able to apply it so my nails looks as if professionally done.  Only took 15 minutes to do both hands.  Light has automatic alarm for 30 seconds and shuts off after 60 seconds, so you don&#x27;t even need to time the curing process.  Recommend without reservation!  Gel polish is a pain to remove no matter what, though.  :-)</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is amazing.  My 14 year old can do her nails herself it is so easy!!  Quick.  Nice coverage.  NO CHIPPING!!! (if you apply properly, CAP EDGE OF NAIL!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMOVAL - Here is the best way to remove and it takes all of about 7 minutes of soak time.&lt;br /&gt;Soak cotton ball in acetone, put on top of nail, cover with aluminum foil (all in kit directions).  PLACE A HEATING PAD ON TOP OF YOUR SOAKING NAILS.  iN ABOUT 5-7 MINUTES TAKE A LOOK.  You should be able to just lift the polish off without having to scrape.  There may be tiny little areas that stay, I just used a light buffing to remove.  My nails were perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do give a day of rest between gel manicures.  Remove polish in evening and then reapply next day.  I use a good hand moisturizer on the night between manicures to replenish the moisture that the acetone takes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> i purchased this at a discount store**** and paid less for it. yes the starter bottles are small, yes it has many steps, for some it is a pain to remove, isn&#x27;t that why WE use it.......because it is a beautiful shiny manicure! once you have the lamp, i don&#x27;t see why you cant buy creative nail designs shellac or whatever brand you like (through amazon) products in largr sizes with the lamp you already have now !&lt;br /&gt;i love these gel polishes because my natural nails are very strong, but the regular polsh NEVER lasts more than a few days..............</li>
            <li> My husband bought this kit for me and I have to say &amp;#34;LOVE IT&amp;#34;.  Wasn&#x27;t sure how well the gel polish would hold up on my nails.  I have my hands in water a lot doing dishes and also do yard work etc....  I&#x27;m not gentle on my nails.  Well let me tell ya it is amazing.  The longest I had it on was almost 4 weeks no joke.  If you follow the directions your polish will stay on like the package reads, even longer in my case.  The key is to not put the polish on thick.  Spread it on lightly.  Yes you may have to apply 3 layers depending on the color but that&#x27;s not a problem for me.  You can also use different brands of gel polish.  You don&#x27;t have to stick to the Sensationail brand.  My only negative thing to say is that it is a pain to remove BUT if that&#x27;s all to complain about this product is great.  It serves its purpose.  Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> a great starter kit for gel polish.  I like the gel polish it lasts longer than regular polish and is so easy and quick to use.  Within 10 minutes you are all done with beautiful looking nails.</li>
            <li> At $49.99 a box at most local retailers, etc., this is the best kit you could ask for if you are a gel nail person.  The first application requires some patience, but I am on my fifth round of DIY nails. I usually finish the entire set in about 40 minutes (with extra 30-secs curing for final top coat).  I purchased several other colors at about 10 bucks each, but I will never have to go to a salon again for nice, just like new, deep, shiny wet-look nails.  The shine is spectacular!  While it is true that the removal is cumbersome, they do pratically peel off, but not in one full swoop.  You will need a nail buffer or small grained emory board to get some of it off, but at the ACTUAL cost of $5 an applicaton vs. $35-40 per application for a salon tech to do them for you, I don&#x27;t see what reason one would have to NOT purchase this product if yoru are cost conscious.  Update 1/22/13:  still using!  In response to a recent inquiry-- you cannot put your whole hand in the uv lamp.  Four fingers in two cycles and then your thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  On 1/31/13, I tried the magnetic color \\&quot;captivate\\&quot;.  It will take some getting used to.  Requires more layers and curing time than regular gel colors.  The result was ok, but not all fingers came out like starburst pattern on box.  Will update again soon.  I still like the product though.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good at home Shellac system. The first time I did it, one nail did chip, but it&#x27;s so easy to fix it.  It takes about 15 minutes to do both hands; 1/3 of the time spent at a salon. And it pays for itself after a few uses. I did also find that if you use regular nail polish, apply the gel coat to it, and let it cure under the light for two minutes (each hand, alternating); you get the same results as using the shellac nail polish.  And you can change colors and often as you want, and it&#x27;s easy to take off!</li>
            <li> I am one of those whose manicure is rarely ever perfect for more then 2 minutes after having it done - can&#x27;t ever seem to make it without getting a nick on my nails, so when the manicurist offered gel with no dry time, it was a no-brainer to try it, despite the extra $15. Wow, did I fall in love with not only the durability but the slick, shiny, and raised look of gel nails! I was spending $23-$35 for gel manis at the salon, so when I saw this kit at a local drug store, I decided to give it a try. Of course, I was skeptical, but once I googled and saw how much people like it, I was overwhelmed with excitement to try for myself. My first application, I did not apply primer, at the suggestion of one blogger, and so far my nails still look beautiful after nearly a week. I will, however, try with primer around the edges next time. The only downside is that gel nails are rather hard to remove, but I believe wrapping acetone-soaked cotton will work, based on many other reviews. Doubt no more, this product is here to stay. I don&#x27;t think I am ever going back to standard manis. Order a kit or two for yourself!</li>
            <li> The lamp alone makes this purchase worthwhile.  A+ on shipping - arrived in just a coupled days.  It comes with the full size LED lamp, with plug, and that alone makes the purchase worthwhile.  The bottles of paint are very small - trial size. But that&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re looking for a lamp and a chance just to try out the gel polish. If you&#x27;re looking for actual polish and have a lamp, this is NOT what you want.</li>
            <li> This works great! Shiny, easy, and fast!</li>
            <li> Great kit, comes with everything you need to start. The bottles that are included are trial size, and will only last about 5 manicures total. The LED cure lamp is very well made, and looks very nice, and big enough for 4 fingers. As for how long it will last, only time will tell (I&#x27;ll up date my review if and when the lamp dies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Great Kit! Perfect for gifts, would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I have been getting a gel manicure for about a year at the nail salon for about $30 every two weeks. It doesn&#x27;t chip or peel as does a regular manicure, but since Walgreens was having a sale on this Sensationail for $39 (plus I had a $2 coupon, so paid only $37 for the kit what a deal!), I thought it would be worth it.  The kit is suppose to provide 10 manicures (we&#x27;ll see).  I agree the instructions are pretty long but worth reading since the outcome looks like my professional gel manicure. I am very pleased with it. Even if it doesn&#x27;t last the 2 weeks, as claimed, I think money wise, it was worth it. I will not be using the removal method as the instructions, but rather the method the salon uses:  soak a small piece of cotton in acetone, place on your nail and wrap with aluminum foil.  Do this on all your nails. Wait between 10-15 mins. Remove one of the aluminum wraps to see if the gel has softened. If not wait another 5 mins. Once gel is soft it can easily be removed with the flat side of the manicure stick included with the Sensational kit. Do not peel off without soaking or using the method I just described.  Peeling off will not only remove the gel but lift up layers of your nail causing them to be frail and weak. Proper removal is worth the time and effort. Btw Walgreens accepts returns on all product within 30 days, even if opened and used. I will be returning if gel doesn&#x27;t not last at least 1 week. I will follow up if I return product!</li>
            <li> This nail kit is great for people who don&#x27;t like waiting for nails to dry... I know I don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s very easy to do by yourself and fun to do with friends:) if you don&#x27;t have acetone to soak your nails in to remove the polish, I just peeled it off it came off so easily when I was ready to switch colors.. You can also buy the sensational nails removal tool :) anyway, great product and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Just removed my first manicure with this kit. 9 full days of wet-glossy, absolutely perfect looking nails, and I am hard on my hands so that is impressive! The application process takes a bit longer than regular polish, but there&#x27;s zero time spent waiting for it to dry (it really IS cured/dry as fast as the kit says, and you can go about your business without worrying you&#x27;ll smudge or scuff your nails)...and you get so much more wear out of this than regular polish, so that&#x27;s a huge amount of time saved that you&#x27;d otherwise spend redoing your manicure/pedicure (if you&#x27;re like me and you have to redo it the minute you get a smudge and they don&#x27;t look perfect anymore). :) Capping the nail is definitely important; I&#x27;d also add that gel polish works better on longer nails. Mine were trimmed fairly short - they did not extend past my fingertips, which made the application challenging because it was really hard to cap each nail without getting the gel on my skin. If your nails are shorter you&#x27;ll need to be careful to use the wooden stick to remove any gel from your skin BEFORE you cure it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve mastered the removal process quite yet; I definitely damaged my nails while using the metal removal tool. I did the foil wrap method and I don&#x27;t think I left the wraps on long enough (I did wait 10-15 mins but it seems like I should have left them on a lot longer.) I think I&#x27;ll try the soaking method next time. The polish definitely did NOT come off like it shows in the photo, where it looks like it practically slides off your nails. (Does it come off like that if you soak longer??) Rather, it kind of \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; off in layers as I used the removal tool. I&#x27;m still giving the product 5 stars because my nails looked amazing for days and days, and my removal troubles were most likely user error.</li>
            <li> It looked great. For about half a day. I was really disappointed that my nails started to chip so quickly. I tried a second time in case I hadn&#x27;t applied the polish correctly but the result was the same.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this product at a local Walgreens.  I have wanted to get Gel nails for quite some time and when I saw this product I thought I would give it a try.  From start to finish the whole process took about 30 minutes.  There are a number of steps, and I followed the suggestion to do my thumbs first followed by the rest of one hand, and then the other.  So I cycled through the steps that way.  Application was very easy.  The curing takes either 30 seconds or 60 seconds depending which step you are on.  The light has a timer and does stay on for the full 60 seconds, but does beep at the 30 second mark so you can remove your hand/nails from it if you are on one of the shorter steps without having to keep a watch nearby. At the end of all the steps my nails were dry and set and super shiny.  I was a little disappointed in the size of bottles that came with the kit, but you only need to use light coats so perhaps it will actually last longer than I think.  I am rough on my hands during the day, so I am hoping that my polish will stand up to the abuse.  No complaints yet here.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product! It is a little pricey for nail polish, but the results are salon worthy. I bought this in raspberry wine from target (because I didn&#x27;t want to wait for the shipping) and immediately I was in love. It is so easy to apply, and dries so much faster than regular polish...no more endless waiting time for wet nails! The only issue I have is the timer on the UV light is only for 30 seconds (so if you have to cure it for longer, you need to press for another cycle), and the beep is unusually loud, but those are both minor and worth it in my opinion. I will definitely be buying more colors for this kit soon! I will never again go back to regular polish!</li>
            <li> Novice at doing my own nails with gel. I used this about 8 days ago.  I was not sure I would follow the directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;  but then, I had to have a first run.  I diligently sat and did follow the directions, did my nails and here I am 8  days later still enjoying the application.  I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the polish [including base/top coat] did not &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; to be as &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; as in the salon where I go regularly, I have to say, this gel polish has withstood:  painting, scrubbing and miscellaneous  household tasks over the course of a weeks  time.  I am pleased and would recommend this to others.  The only real requirements are to read the directions and, to be patient in the application of the gel -- dry/cure well.  I did one hand at a time.  Lovely Nails for one&#x27;s pleasure!</li>
            <li> WOW.  My husband bought this for me, and he gets bonus life points.  This is a great and complete set to get my nails done, quickly, easily and they look GREAT.  I was amazed at how easy the kit was to use, and I am so excited I can do my nails now myself.  I am now shopping for nail art stuff.  The kit is complete, works awesome, and it&#x27;s easy to do.  I&#x27;ve had my nails done for years and years, and now I can do them myself.  I am very, very happy.  GET ONE!  You will be amazed, too.  Color is even better than I expected, too.</li>
            <li> I got the French manicure set at my local Walmart and was very excited about it. My nail polish usually last one day if I&#x27;m lucky with out chipping I do a lot of dishes and cleaning. Anyways when I first used it I loved how it looked n my nails where hard but it chipped within a few hours I was so angry. But it was my fault you have to \\&quot;cap your nail\\&quot; or pass the brush on the tip of your nail across it. I now have my nails done for a week and it still looks as good as the same day I did them.</li>
            <li> i bought this set and it was so bad...it looks used the box was open, the nail polishes were almost empty and the polish clenser was 3/4 &#x27;s. Paid full price.</li>
            <li> I think they have a lot of nerve saying this lasts 14 days. I followed directions to the letter and I&#x27;m repairing a nail everyday. It is expensive and does not last. Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> This product has put holes in my nails and the company refuses to compensate me for the health problems it has caused! If you value healthy nails I suggest you use Gelish or Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sensational nail kit for a little over a month.  The light does a great job curing the gel nail polish.  I find that my nails need redone after wearing the polish for one week.  However, compared to regular polish a week without chips is exceptional.  The LED light also works with other brands of gel polish.  I have tried Gelish and Gelaze.  After a week, my nails look just as shiny as the day I painted them.  I believe part of the reason that the polish is only lasting a week is based on my own faults in application.  If you put the polish on too thick or get any on the cuticle, it will peel once your nail grows out a little.  Every time I have painted my nails, it gets a little better.  I have recommended this product to both of my sisters, my mom, and my sister-in-law already!!!</li>
            <li> The kit had instead of the gel base and top coat, transparent polish (as well as the colour i ordered).&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed as I cannot get hold of the gel base and top coat as its all sold out, waiting for further supplies otherwise will be returning it all as I cannot use it as it is.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and looks great, anyone can do this.&lt;br /&gt;what a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to try another shade.</li>
            <li> Ive had no problems with this, I find it easy to use and as long as you follow the directions polish stays on up to three weeks (toes last longer then finger nails) and is easy enough to remove.</li>
            <li> Love this polish! Also the fact that you can go to Walmart and pick up additional colors for special occasions is a major plus!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I am suprised by the amount of 4 and 5 stars this product got. I purchased it because of that. I received this and it was more like sample sizes. Few issues with this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. The bottles were too tiny to work with. I was applying and messing up because my hands weren&#x27;t able to apply well enough due to the tiny brush.&lt;br /&gt;2. The heater. VERY flimsy. It kept coming apart the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;3. It started chipping before a week. Maybe 4 days tops.&lt;br /&gt;4. Not as shinny as other gel manicures I have done myself, let alone not even comparable to salon quality.&lt;br /&gt;5. Soaked for about 20-30 mins, and it didn&#x27;t remove it. Left the tips of the polish. Nothing I did was able to remove. I had to file and cut my nails.&lt;br /&gt;6. CAN&#x27;T RETURN it!!! It is a fire hazzard thus, you can&#x27;t return. It doesnt even say it on the AD. Big no no.</li>
            <li> I love to paint my nails but have gotten fed up with polish chipping the next day. I use a very good base coat, top coat, and thinner layers and still chips the next day. Because of this I keep my nails very short in order to help with chipping. I had seen a review of this unit and was amazed with the results. After that I spend several hours reading reviews, watching videos, and other researched. I decided it was worth the try. I bought the unit and was not surprised with how small the products were because I had done so much research, but still thought they could have been bigger. I have so far done my fingernails and toenails and WOW this is awesome. I am hooked. So far 3 days on my nails and not a single chip. I love how the polish looks like I just did it. Its super shiny and tough. The first time it took me a long time, but I expected that. When I did my toes it went faster but still took a while. You do have to take your time and get all the excess off your skin before curing. This is a critical step! I think I will buy the gelish products for this unit in the future only because you get a bigger amount for the same price. I already ordered a gelish polish for next time and i was amazed at the size for the same price as a sensationail color. If you love to paint your nails buy this product!</li>
            <li> My husband recently bought this product for me as a late birthday gift, because he knows I love to polish my nails. With regular nail polish I&#x27;ll usually end up chipping it within a few hours of painting my nails. Upon opening this kit I was impressed. The kit includes everything you need for 10 manicures or pedicures. The gel polish took me a little bit of time to conquer because I&#x27;d never used gel polish before. I&#x27;m a stay at home mom so keeping my nails looking good all the time was nearly impossible before. Its been a week since I initially polished my nails and they are still shiny and look freshly polished. Plus my nails are longer! This stuff is legit, it keeps up with a 16 month old, house work, showers and even scrubbing dishes. It was worth $50!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting and a mirror like shine&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with everything you need to get started&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It can get messy (if your not careful)</li>
            <li> This gel polish is nice and shiny. However, it takes FOREVER to soak off. A nail professional warned me of that when I told her what kind of gel polish I had. I thought maybe she was just saying it to make money, NOT SO. It turns out that she was telling the TRUTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update***&lt;br /&gt;I have found an easier way to soak off any gel polish. You will need 100% pure acetone and 2 glass bowls (medium size and small size). Put hot water in the medium sized bowl and pure actone in the small bowl. It works better when you heat the water in the microwave for about 2 minutes. Place the acetone bowl inside of the hot water bowl. Soak for about 15 minutes and you are good. Hope this helps. Since I have found out how to remove it quickly, I am giving more stars.</li>
            <li> The color didn&#x27;t stay on very long, maybe a week or so but the kit itself was nice and it was worth the price. Especially for the lamp. The lamp is wonderful. I really liked this kit. I also really liked the color of the polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little upset that I didn&#x27;t check Amazon before buying this in a store. I paid $13 more. That being said, I have been using this system for about a month and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I had been getting my nails done at the salon. With tip, I was paying $40 each time. I had to buy a bunch of accessories (acetone, nail files, buffer, different colors, etc.) so I spent a little over $80. At home, I&#x27;ve done my nails twice, so this system has already paid for itself. My husband even said that it looks like I went and got my nails done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that this is an LED light and not UV. The polish comes off easier and it&#x27;s better for your hands. My favorite part about gel polish is not having to wait for my nails to dry. It&#x27;s the main reason I use it. They also stay shiny and don&#x27;t chip. I&#x27;m very happy so far.</li>
            <li> Spoilt by the fact that there is tax to be paid on this item before you can get it from the post office/man, more than doubled the price quoted on line.  Seemingly about 3/4 pages in on the T&amp;C a SMALL paragraph does tell u this.  MAKE SURE THAT U READ ALL OF THE SMALL PRINT.  Really only viable for retailers not even sure if it is a viable purchase for retailers.  Stick to buying from UK only from now on.</li>
            <li> Nails still going strong after 12 days, still looking like professional job, but you must follow directions to the T! Can&#x27;t get any on fingers or cuticle, cuz water/dirt will get under base coat and polish will lift.&lt;br /&gt;Cgutierrez</li>
            <li> I waited to write my review until I had gone through a full \\&quot;wear\\&quot; cycle.  Application with the pink chiffon was quite easy.  I followed the directions exactly.  The light has a built in timer which is handy.  It says to do thumbs, then each hand.  I now do one hand and the thumb of the opposite hand. It took me about 40 minutes for the application process (not including filing/cuticle removal).  I found the darker colors are a little harder to apply, when you have to cap the edges (you get excess polish on your finger that you have to wipe off, although I keep my nails rather short).  The polish stayed on for 2 full weeks.  I had a couple areas around the cuticles that were beginning to come up before the two weeks, but did not peel off unless I did it manually.  The tips (with the exception of one small spot on my thumb) did not chip or peel at all!  I am hard on my hands, cook a lot, work with my hands and therefore wash them frequently.  I have no formal training so I figure I should only get better with the application process.  I am very pleased with this product, the light, the polish, the process.  It obviously takes a bit longer than regular polish to apply but not much longer when you consider you have to wait for it to dry.  Also, I can do it whenever I want, relaxing with my family, etc.  and save a lot of money.  Also, it is very shiny and stays that way for the whole two weeks.</li>
            <li> Super quick shipping&#x27; ordered on wed, got Friday! Fairly easy, took about a half hr. Nails are shiney, durable, and the color is pretty. The bottles are small but it is a starter kit!  Would def reccomend and its gonna save mre a lot of money at the salon.</li>
            <li> I love this kit!  I have a two year old, so not having any dry time is a huge bonus. I can do 1 hand while she eats breakfast, play with some blocks, do the other hand while she plays by herself, make lunch, and finish my thumbs during nap time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the directions you end up with a perfect manicure.  I have had a couple manicures peel off, but I realized that was because I didn&#x27;t cap my nails.  When I apply properly, they last and last...even through the endless handwashings I do as a nurse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the colors, especially the magnetic polish. I found the SensatioNail magnet hard to work with, so I just use the magnet from another magnetic polish and it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem I have is that I am terrible at avoiding my cuticles. An old makeup brush dipped in acetone before I cure cleans things right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find removal to take awhile, but the trade off is worth it to me since I only polish every 10 days or so (I get bored of the colors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, I highly recommend this kit. My nails are longer than they have ever been, thanks to the added strength of the gel.</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter. She now can do her nails herself and avoid the salon. The finished results look professional.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was tired of paying $30-$40 for a shellac manicure every 2-3 weeks. This product does take some time to get used to and you need to make sure you follow the directions or it is not going to work properly. If you don&#x27;t follow the directions don&#x27;t get annoyed when it doesn&#x27;t turn out as expected. All in all after using this product for a few months it works great for an at home kit and is definitely better than paying salon prices.</li>
            <li> I just posted a few pictures of my nails on the products page...I&#x27;m a very big fan of this product.  I was previously using a gel strip polish, but they were *very* expensive and, unless you love animal prints and stripes, the color selection is limited.  I decided to give Sensationail a try just after Christmas, so I&#x27;ve been through quite a few manicures since then.  I&#x27;ve used the Raspberry Wine, Sugar Plum, Miss Behave, and French white manicures and I can attest that I will probably never get my nails done in the salon again.  Each polish has a slightly different viscosity and coverage, so if the first one you try isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;opaque&amp;#34; enough, I&#x27;d encourage you to try another color.  My favorite is the French mani, but I don&#x27;t have any pics (yet) to post... I&#x27;ve even gone with just the clear topcoat for a natural look and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED lamp works beautifully and is a very big upgrade from the single-nail lamp I was previously using.  I&#x27;m kind of a nutball when it comes to painting my nails, so I do take my time, but I can complete a new set in about 45 minutes (not including removal time).  Taking this stuff off is kind of a pain because they just don&#x27;t lift very much.  I bought the Sensationail &amp;#34;scraper&amp;#34; (sounds horrific, but it&#x27;s actually really gentle) and I can get back to bare nails in about 20 minutes or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve invested about $75 in polish/lamp/refills so far, and I easily have 10 more manicures left in the various colors I&#x27;ve got.  Compared to the price and hassle of spending my time in my local salon, it&#x27;s definitely been worth it.  I never had such pretty hands until now.  Hope this is helpful...be sure to check out my lovely hands in my pics! (Ha ha!)</li>
            <li> I was looking for an affordable gel kit  after reading reviews on gel nails I have decided to try it since I have my own natural nails that would constantly chip and regular polish would only last a day . I looked up on YouTube as much as I can to make sure I did them correctly it seemed simple enough but to my surprise it wasn&#x27;t guess I was nervous from the warning that said no skin contact or cuticle you just have to get the hang of it today is day 10 and mine have grown out from the cuticle to nail area and that doesn&#x27;t look pretty but the polish was still shiny and new . Overall it&#x27;s a great product however the items are a tad bit tiny it really is a starter kit . I will be buying more soon</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my girlfriend as a gift. When she opened it the packaging was beat up and the presentation was poor. Normally I would blame the shipping company for something like this but the exterior packaging was in perfect condition leading me to believe that the product was in this condition when it left the warehouse... Overall the product had no damage which is why I&#x27;ve decided to give 3/5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love this!! Got the starter kit and three polishes for around $100 (good deal seeing that each shellac manicure is about $30). Easy to do after watching the tutorial on the Nailene Sensationail website. Just a heads up...it is available at Walmart for $49.99. The polishes are $9.99 each as well. The website is not accurate about what is in stock at the local stores. I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local Walmart so I ordered it online with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 10/14/12&lt;br /&gt;I still love the kit!I get tons of compliments whenever I use it on my nails. I wanted to branch out with colors so I bought some from CND (haven&#x27;t tried yet)and OPI for Sephora. I used the color Caffeine Fix (about $15)and got the most amazing deep purplish red color on my nails. The polish is thicker and looks more expensive. I think that you can use this lamp with different brands of shellac without any problems!</li>
            <li> Easy on and looked great—but only for two days. Considering that a regular manicure lasts about 20 minutes on me, it&#x27;s better than nothing. But it did not stand up for anywhere close to two weeks.</li>
            <li> Looks great! Giving it 4 stars because I only just painted them last night so we shall see how long they last.....</li>
            <li> Christmas gifts for both people I bought these for LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, and recipient was very happy with it. She said it did take a few times to get the process down, but once she did, her nails look lovely. She says she gets 2 weeks out of them, which she said between that and the look of the gel, well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I love this! My nails have always broken off but now they are long! The polish is beautiful and stays that way for at least two Weeks. I have done hard yard work and not damaged it. I have also used other gel polishes with this system and it works, gives you more choices of color. I highly recommend it. It&#x27;ll take a couple of times to start getting good at it but it is so worth it. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Works great.  I used this kit multiple time with good results.</li>
            <li> I am such a nail biter and cannot keep nail polish on to save my life! Love this product because it lasts and keeps me from biting my nails.</li>
            <li> Loooooove it!!! Buy it!!!!! Worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> Was given as a gift, when opened found broken bottles. Recipient didn&#x27;t let me know in time to return it. So not pleased</li>
            <li> Easy to use, plenty of product to do many manicures.  Durable and just like a salon manicure.  I am hard on my nails and this was a great investment!  Great price too!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Sensationail Gel Polish! After investing in this starter kit, I have purchased 4 other colors, and I have mastered the process to get my polish to last for a week, which is amazing to me! I never used to paint my nails because they would chip or get ruined the very day I painted them! I&#x27;m also really impatient and I HATE letting the polish dry. The gel process takes about 10 minutes or so, but you&#x27;re not just sitting waiting for them to dry, when you&#x27;re done, you&#x27;re done, no wait!</li>
            <li> First off, if you have NEVER went to a salon and got gelish, CND Shellac or OPI gels nails first, please do so before buying. It will get you acquainted with this process, especially the removal. I&#x27;ve been going to the salon for years and I absolutely love gel nails. I haven&#x27;t gone back to acrylic gels since. Since the salon is pricey, for the past couple of months I decided to save money and paint my nails at home. I paint my nails every week, not because I get bored with colors, but because they chip, even with my pricey polishes. I came across this kit weeks ago and was hesitate to spend $50 but I figured if my salon quality gel nails cost $35- $40, i&#x27;m saving money by purchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought this on Friday and did my nails today (Sunday). It took about 45 minutes. I watched one of my favorite shows while doing this, so I had fun! My advice is to take your time and make sure everything is comfortably near you. The instruction are not bad as some people mentioned (read before doing), hence my advice above (get a professional gel manicure first). The WHOLE point of gel manicures is for the color to last for weeks. If you get bored with polishes after a few days, my next advice is to do a clear gel mani, then paint over that with your regular polish. Of course, the regular polish will have to air dry.  Overall, I found this kit neat, easy to use, and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not foresee myself having issues with removal since I&#x27;m use to gel manicures but if I do, I will update!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S Do your thumbs first, then your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I removed the pink polish yesterday, I was actually able to peel it off with acetone (I know bad, but I have strong nails). I did what nail junkies call a \\&quot;Gelly\\&quot; sandwich. Simply buff, wipe, do based/top coat, cure, wipe, then paint with regular polish. Make sure the regular polish is completely dry, then do a final top coat and cure. I cured for an extra 15-30 secs to be on the \\&quot;safe side\\&quot;. Ilove the results.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this kit after a friend told me about how her and her daughter love this item. I noticed how nice her nails are, they are shiny and look like salon done. I am not fond of putting nail polish because it chips easily and just a waste of time and money. Well, I did my nails last night and it looks wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to read the instructions first before you start working on your nails specially if you haven&#x27;t used this type of contraption before and don&#x27;t allow distraction while you are doing your nails. I washed the dishes after, clean up, and open packages after and I did not find any chip at all. Girls, this is an investment for me! I no longer have to make appointments for my nails to be done and be exposed in a roomful of nail polish fumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got mine for a lot cheaper in drugstore .com so make sure you shop around before purchasing. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Almost 3 weeks and my polish still looks great! No peeling and no chips just like I went to the salon. The color in this kit is really pretty too. I got many compliments....that&#x27;s it -  No more nail salon for me.</li>
            <li> I love getting a nice manicure, but hate paying salon price. This kit allows me to give myself a salon quality manicure without paying every time. I paint my nails 12 days ago and they are still in PERFECT condition. I am so happy with this product- definitely worth the buy! The raspberry wine color is also beautiful, though it doesn&#x27;t seem as dark in person as the box shows, I still love the deep red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this kit to others.</li>
            <li> Bought this from Walgreens and i absolutely love it. It is definitely a more affordable option than the OPI one in Sephora and the color options are just amazing. It really does last 2 weeks when done correctly.  I love it so much i bought one off of groupon for my mother.  i would say its definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to apply and looked great on but only lasted about 3-4 days before it started peeling. Feel like the claims of 2 weeks are misleading. Worst part is I wanted to return it and Amazon won&#x27;t accept it as a return because they claim you can&#x27;t return items that contain hazardous materials. Not sure how they justified shipping it out in the first place.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews of this product I was slightly hesitant to purchase it, however after receiving this and using it, I am very happy that I ordered it! I am by no means good at manicures or painting nails, but I was able to use this kit with no problems. The color is great and very true to what is shown on the box.  As far as wear goes, this is perfect for me.  I play varsity basketball and work in a kitchen where I am constantly required to wear gloves (which usually cause regular nail polish to chip off within 1 hour) and work with my hands.  I painted my nails with this gel kit the day before work, and it lasted through several work shifts and several basketball games.  It also shipped very quickly and was in great condition when I received it. I am extremely happy with this product!</li>
            <li> This definitely does the job! No more spending $25 plus tip (where I go to is cheap) each time I want to do my nails! I just spend $35 and can do my own nails time and time again. I have not one complaint. Works exactly like it does in nail salon.</li>
            <li> So I bought this product from Walmart a week ago and in one shot it came out perfect. My manicure looks PERFECT one week later on the first try. I have 1 extremely tiny air bubble and no chips or lifts and it&#x27;s still very shiny. I will admit it took me longer to do than my regular manicure but with drying time it&#x27;s probably about even. But if it lasts 2 weeks I don&#x27;t mind it taking a bit longer. Plus I imagine as I get used to doing it it will take less time.&lt;br /&gt;Now I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to remove the polish yet. If it&#x27;s as difficult as some people say then I might change my rating. However I didn&#x27;t find the application remotely difficult like some did so we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;You will definitely want to make sure you have all your tools out and ready to use and that you use THIN coats of polish. If you&#x27;re getting pooling, you&#x27;ve got too much on your brush. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I removed the polish today fairly easily. Instead of soaking all my fingers in acetone, I soaked lint free pads in 100% acetone, placed on my nails and wrapped in strips of aluminum foil. I let them sit for 15 mins then used the polish remover tool to scrape it off. For the most part the polish came off in large chunks from my nail. Once I started using the polish tool it took less than a couple minutes to get the polish off.&lt;br /&gt;After14 days this product still looked quite good. I would say 12 days was the limit for the polish. Considering I could never get a mani to last more than 5 days in the past, I welcome 12. Especially since for all 12 days it looked much better than any of the 5 days of a regular mani.&lt;br /&gt;I still highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I just bought this Nailene product yesterday at Wal-Mart. The starter kit is about $49.95 and comes in two shades: a paler pink and a darker raspberry shade; the raspberry is called \\&quot;raspberry wine.\\&quot; I bought the raspberry color. Before starting, I read the instructions from top to bottom twice to make sure I understood them and to make the process easier so I did not have to keep referring to the directions in the middle of painting my nails!  The process went very smoothly.  I have one or two nails with a few little bumps on them. Some of the old gel polish I had on before must have stuck on and I didn&#x27;t see it, and that&#x27;s what it is. However, they are not noticeable so I am just leaving them.  The UV lamp is excellent and very high quality, much better than the battery-operated lamps that some of these kits include.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End result is that you have a great manicure with beautiful shine and the color is wonderful.  This stuff is tough; you can see it forms a real shield on your nails and that really protects them. I should have no trouble getting this to last at least 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison information, I will put down here that I also tried the Red Carpet Manicure kit. I was much more impressed with Nailene than with the RCM. Also, with Nailene, you do not have to use color each time; you can also do a clear manicure, which means you get the protection of gel for your nails but you don&#x27;t have the color.  So you can give your nails a break from the colored polish, which can stain them, while still protecting your nails from peeling and abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish also appears to allow your nails to breathe. I also use Genadur, which is a prescription nail growth product that helps prevent peeling and splitting nails (mine were really bad). I can use Genadur over my Nailene manicure and the nails soak it right up, which means that the Nailene product allows your nails to absorb treatment products even while you are wearing gel polish; it does not prevent your nails from getting enough oxygen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great product and think it should last at least 2 weeks.  I don&#x27;t like the removal process of gel polish either, but I will try the soak-off method with hot water (heated in the microwave) that other posters here recommended when the time comes.</li>
            <li> A great product, and recommend it.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE gel polish.</li>
            <li> This year for Christmas I wanted the SensatioNAIL gel kit, but when we went to 5 different stores it was already sold out. I ended up seeing the Sally Hansen gel nail LED light kit in Walgreens for $69.99 (the SensatioNAIL was $10 cheaper), and I ended up buying the Sally Hansen kit in Target for $64.99. I also bought the Sally Hansen Gel Polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I was certain I was going to get the SensatioNAIL kit, I bought their primer/gel cleanser/top coat/base coat kit, that did NOT contain the LED light. I also hated all of their colors, so I did NOT get any of their gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a test: one hand got the full treatment of SensatioNAIL products, in the correct order, following the directions to the letter. First file, shape and buff. Second, gel cleanser and apply primer. Then top coat, then the SALLY HANSEN GEL POLISH, then the base coat. Always remembering to use the LED light for 30 seconds in between layers. Finally, I finished with the gel cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other hand got all the Sally Hansen products. This kit does NOT contain primer. That is the ONLY difference in the products from the Sally Hansen to the SensatioNAIL kit. The actual LED light differences are that the SensatioNAIL LED light has a 60 second light, and the Sally Hansen has a 30 second light. I can&#x27;t see what the improvement of having a 60 light would give you. Having the 30 second LED from SH is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did my hands turn out? The hand with all the SensatioNAIL products (but using the color and LED light from SH) is PERFECT. I LOVE IT. The hand that I did with all the SH products came out very nicely, however I feel like maybe the primer helps provide better and more full coverage of the polish. I noticed some streaking on the SH side that I did not get on the SensatioNAIL side. But the light and the actual polish from SH are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I suggest? Get either brand. SensatioNAIL primer may be the key to not having streaks, I cannot be certain. I like the colors of SH MUCH BETTER, and the fact that their light is 30 seconds (which is exactly how much time SensatioNAIL says you need to do it... not sure what the convenience factor is of having a 60 sec light), is pretty awesome. BUT, I love the primer/gel cleanser/top and base coat kit from SensatioNAIL. So, ultimately, get whichever kit you want. I imagine both will give you great nails that are pretty durable. It&#x27;s only been 24 hours since I did them, but I have done dishes, cooked, played with kids, vacuumed, cleaned, scraped things with my finger nails, and I STILL have NO CHIPS or ruined nails.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!t be certain.

            <li> Super nice gel nail system. Definitely worth the tiny splurge. Led light works great. Gel polish stays on forever. Easy to remove. Just be patient</li>
            <li> Best price anywhere and it works great.</li>
            <li> I LET A FRIEND DO MY THUMB AT WORK DURING LUNCH.... IT LOOKED GREAT.  WONDERFUL SHINE.. HARD AS A ROCK.  I PURCHASED THE KIT AS SOON AS I GOT OFF WORK... FINISHED MY OTHER 9 NAILS..... WANTED TO CHANGE THE COLOR  2 DAYS LATER AND THE REMOVAL PROCESS IS A PITA! (PAIN IN THE ASS)... THE ACETONE REMOVER AND FOIL REMOVAL METHOD IS TEDIOUS... NOT TO MENTION VERY DAMAGING TO THE NATURAL NAILS... I ENDED UP BREAKING 2 OF MY NAILS DURING REMOVAL AND HAD TO FILE ALL MY NAILS DOWN.... I IMMEDIATELY PACKED IT BACK IN THE BOX AND RETUNED IT TO WALMART.... VERY DISSATISFIED... LONG TERM DAMAGE NOT WORTH IT</li>
            <li> I held off on writing this until I had a chance to use it for awhile.  I have had acrylics for 22 years solid, and thought I would be a slave to the nail salon forever.  After the last time the mancurist sanded my nail to within an inch of it&#x27;s life (it was so pink I thought it was bleeding, and yes I know, just get a different manicurist but I&#x27;ve had it) I was determined to get out of the grasps of the nail salon.  My nails are extremely thin and brittle and I never thought I would be able to do without professional acrylics or shellac.  Lo and behold, this wonderful little system!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently only using the clear so can&#x27;t speak to the application of the color.  That said, the clear stays on easily two weeks. The nasty discolored, bumpy sections of the previously abused nails are still growing out and color just doesn&#x27;t look good on them yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two or three coats of the clear gel, and my nails are nice and firm.  No snaggy edges, and as I said they are still growing out, but they look so much better than I thought they would!  I think I&#x27;m finally free of the sadistic manicurists!  This unit has already paid for itself as by now I would have paid for 3 pink and white fills at $35/pop (stretched it out to three weeks between because I so did not look forward to the pain.)  I did purchase a little dremel to help  rough up the old gel surface before re-applying.  The lint free wipes are re-usable, I got about 8 uses out of one.  Remember though, paper towels are also lint free and seem to work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED curing unit works well, and after the final cure/clean I am good to go...about 2-3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for toenails that you don&#x27;t want to fuss with polishing all the time! It looked flawless on my toes for three weeks, and only then just because my nails were growing lol. Tough to remove but that&#x27;s kind of the point, isn&#x27;t it??</li>
            <li> Excellent product I recommended!!! And the shipping was on time!!!</li>
            <li> Love the product, great colours! fab shine! Really lasts! Tough to remove however, but I have found a great product that ships to many destinations including England and my gel polish is removed in 10mins.  [...]  Buff the shine off, apply to the polish and then 10mins later remover with only a wooden stick. Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I just tried my first home gel manicure, and so far, I&#x27;m pretty pleased. It was really easy to apply. The hardest part was soaking off my professional gel manicure I had on before. It looks really pretty and shiny, and I like the color. I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and a professional gel manicure right now, but I will update after I see how it wears.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a bit of buyers remorse. I never heard of this brand; I thought, maybe I should&#x27;ve bought Sally Hanson...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS BRAND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten my nails done professionally for years,  tons of cash; lots of tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit paid for itself in 2 uses.  It&#x27;s longevity is way better than the salon. My nails have never looked better. I garden with them, clean with them, change my bike inter tube tires multiple times with them; NO CHIPPING - NO PEALING - NO CRACKS! For just over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Because there are so many other reviews I won&#x27;t go into that other than to say it was easy for me and my nails look amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing I found with the kit is inclusion of the LED lamp. This is a 7 Watt lamp which will cost almost as much as the kit itself and can be use with any brand of led gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason I can say this is that I got my kit on sale with an addtional 20% off promtion and free shipping at another website.  I only paid $36 for the whole kit. Hint&#x3D;drugstore com</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no ability with doing my nails but I really wanted to have a pretty manicure.  I had gotten one done at a salon and it had lasted almost 3 weeks but I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep going.  I saw this product at the store and then here on Amazon and read the reviews.  I got one.  Not only did I succeed at doing a manicure, it was so easy and looks so wonderful!  The greatest boon for me is that I don&#x27;t have to wait to dry... I&#x27;m hard hard, hard on my hands and polish chips off immediately.  The little light thingy is awesome and keeps the time for you and truly it was a painless, smellless and quick procedure.  If I can do it, anyone can!!!!</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that this would even compare to a gel manicure from the salon, but it exceeded my expectations by far! The directions are incredibly easy, it takes barely any time at all, and the results are amazing! This is far better than trying to paint my nails and let them dry before my daughter wakes up from a nap. 15 minutes and I&#x27;m good to go! Can&#x27;t beat it! I purchased my kit from Walmart for $50, though... I would definitely see if there are better deals in your area before purchasing from here. I have yet to remove, but the process doesn&#x27;t intimidate me.</li>
            <li> This is WAY overpriced!!!!! You can buy the same exact product/ kit for less than $50 at Walmart. I do like the kit, just can&#x27;t believe how much it is on here.</li>
            <li> I love gel nail polish and how it lasts two weeks until it grows out.  I just could not afford the salon price.....  I tried this kit and was surprised at how easy it was.  The first time I did my nails, I took my time and used the video on the SensatioNail website as a guide. It took me about an hour for the whole process. I did have one nail chip within 3 days.  I chalk this up to it being my first time doing the manicure and not sealing the edges thoroughly.  I soaked off the chipped nail and redid it.  The soak off time did surprise me.  I used the cotton ball soaked in acetone then wrapped in foil, and it took over 20 minutes to be able to get the gel off.  The only draw back with this system is the colors.  Gelish has tons of colors.  I ordered two Gelish colors and am going to try them with this LED light.  I hope I get good results.  I will keep you posted.</li>
            <li> I have been using acrylic products for over 20 years either at the salon or doing them my self at home.  I tried Shellac gel polish in the salon last year and loved it.  The only problem is that the cost is pretty much the same as acrylic tips or silk wraps but doesn&#x27;t last as  long.  I saw this in the Duane Reade and finally bought and it is so worth the price of the kit.  Although in the store it was only 59.99.  So I don&#x27;tknow why Amazon is charging so much.  It is soooo easy to apply and after two uses it pays for itselt.  I dont have to leave my house, wait around in a salon and I don&#x27;t have to tip any one. The kit has easy to follow directions and the application time is quick. It&#x27;s just like painting your nails with regular nail polish. The best part is that as soon as you cure the nails and then wipe them with the alcohol cleanser you&#x27;re done. voila ready to tackle the world with no worries...cuz your nails are totally dry.</li>
            <li> These peeled off my nails in less than two days. Do not waste your money. I have tried to do it twice since then with the same result.</li>
            <li> I had ordwred this after having my gel nails done at a salon for the first time. I figured I could do this myself. Shipping was super fast!  I chose this kit after comparing reviews and the price. I used the same night received! My nails look beautiful and wasn&#x27;t as hard to do as I thought . The bottles of polish were smaller than I was expecting but for the price and knowing I will want a variety of colors I will definitely be looking for more.  They may last longer than I think too. Overall I am very satisfied and would recommend!</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and I used this kit several times before buying other colors and brands of gel polish, rubbing alcohol, wipes and additional tools.  I used the same light and it works well.</li>
            <li> I had better success with this than any product I&#x27;ve used. I am amazed at how easy it is to get a professional-looking manicure at home with SensatioNail Gel Polish. It is unbelievably quick as well--which is good because I have no patience and have always messed up my polish in the past. It dries rock hard. I type all day at work and constantly use my nails as tools at home. My manicure is still gorgeous a week later! Love it! I hardly ever write reviews but felt I must about this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to remove if you add acetone to cotton pad, wrap in foil, put on plastic gloves, and then lightly scrape after 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Just an FYI - this became my holiday/Valentine&#x27;s Day red just because it is more  red in color than the box color indicates.  Not at all a raspberry.  Sadly, their colors are not well represented by the color title either.  The color you get is a crap shoot.  :(</li>
            <li> I have attempted to use this product multiple times.  Each time it peels off within 2 days.  It looks great when I put it on but does not stay.</li>
            <li> I painted my nails a week ago using this kit, and they still have yet to chip! Polish still looks glossy and beautiful. I would definitely recommend this kit, especially for those who are always on the go and don&#x27;t always have a lot of time for manicures at a salon.</li>
            <li> This product was awful.  I was extremely excited to save money by doing my own manicures.  This product is not worth 5$.  In my first try, the gel polish didn&#x27;t harden AT ALL.  It was gooey for the most of a day.  Then SOME of it dried and it was hard to get off, mind you, I spent a good half an hour alternating hands under the lamp to try and dry it.  Second go round, the polish dried, but peeled off within 2 hours!  I am returning this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this from Amazon as a gift for me. I followed the directions carefully, and my nails looked very pretty. But by bedtime the same day, I noticed a bit of peeling at the edge of one nail. After a shower the next morning, more peeling nails. By day 3, my nails looked icky and I removed the polish. I plan to try again, but so far I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to go on evenly.  It also started to peel in less than two weeks.  The light should be a little bigger so that my entire hand can go under the light, the light is so small that my thumb does not fit in.</li>
            <li> I love this color, its not pink pink but its not red either. A slight sparkle gives it a little something extra too. A nice sassy color.</li>
            <li> My mom and I is enjoying this kit. We will buy more gel polish once we run out.</li>
            <li> The polish would not last but a week but the lamp itself was well worth the money.  I like being able to do my own nails and if one messes up I can fix just that nail.</li>
            <li> I got this kit a CVS for $48. They sell it everywhere, walmart, rite aid, wallgreens, CVS, etc. and they ALL have a way better price than amazon. I got the kit for the LED light. LEDs are faster than UV lights and safer as far as skin cancer is concerned. LED lights are also usually very expensive but with this kit you get a nice little LED light and trial sizes of the Sensationail products for a good price. I like the sensationail line but for me it never works as well as the other brands of soak off gel. I use this light with Gelish, Ibd,Sally Hansons soak off gel and bluesky gels they all work great with it. I think the combo base/top coat is what makes the sensationail less durable than the other brands. I use sensationail colors with gelish&#x27;s foundation and their separate top coat and my gels stay on chip free FOREVER basically until I decide to remove them. So if you want to get into doing your own soak off gels this kit is great, I would get this at a local store and then order the gelish starter kit and some colors on amazon.</li>
            <li> Just use the product the color is more of a dark rose pink, but system is very easy to use.  Hope it last for a while</li>
            <li> it was fast and good thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this kit from CVS (with a combination of extrabucks, coupons and employee discount. I ended up paying $30.00). My nails came out so perfect the first time, I had a hard time convincing people I did them myself.  Make sure you follow the instructions carefully and faithfully to succeed. So far, 5 days and counting and my nails are as shiny and perfect as the first day. The whole thing took 30 minuts tops (I was being very carefull). I bought the kit with Raspberry Wine, its a beautiful, deep color with tiny sparkles. If you are interested, Sensationail has coupons to print on their page, a $5 off on the starter kit and a $1 off for the polishes.  Also, Sensationail has the best customer service, quick and reliable. My kit came with coupons for the essentials kit and polish but they were expired, I wrote to them to let them know and within 24 hrs responded giving me new coupons that are good until July and that I can print and use as many times as I want.&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review when the time comes to remove it. I bought also the removing tool at CVS for $5 and I ordered a set of nail soakers from Amazon. Will let you know how this works.</li>
            <li> First, I didn&#x27;t buy this through Amazon, but through my local drugstore. I was very skeptical about it. But, it really does work and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Some recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Patience. Patience. Take your time. Read all the instructions. Set aside at lease an hour, an hour 15 minutes to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) When they say, apply a thin coat, they MEAN apply a thin coat. Otherwise, your finished manicure will be lumpy and bumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I was dreading removal, but really didn&#x27;t have any problems getting it off. I soaked in acetone for 5 minutes, then scraped with a metal cuticle pusher (costs about $5). Well worth the price. I do find my nails a bit dry after removal of polish, so I put a little oil on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t like regular nail polish where I could lounge on the couch and put the polish on. I found I really had to sit at the table, spread everything out in front of me, and work through it methodically. Maybe when I become more familiar with the process, and better at giving myself a manicure, it will be less labor intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely a fan and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> AS SOON AS PRODUCT ARRIVED I HAD TO TRY IT OUT. WORKS BEAUTIFULLY. NO COMPLAINTS SO FAR. I WOULD NOT SUGGEST USING THE &amp;#34;FRENCH&amp;#34; MANICURE KIT WITH WHITE TIP -STICKERS-. THEY PEEL/CHIP VERY EASILY AND YELLOW.</li>
            <li> I was sick of always going to the salon and having to pay to get a nice gel nail manicure so decided to try this based on some other reviews. WOW!!! Can&#x27;t believe how nice they turned out and my manicure lasted about 2 weeks with the shine still there. Couldn&#x27;t believe a home gel manicure could look so nice. The directions were easy to follow and they have a great selection of colors. Very happy :)</li>
            <li> This was my foray into using gel nail polish.  I am hooked.  I will never use regular polish again.  The color is nice and clean.  Thick with No lumps, not sticky, and no strange smell.</li>
            <li> I wore acrylic nails for years, and finally was able to break free from them, saving my nails, and thousands of dollars. I was very skeptical about gel because it took me about 3 years to get my natural nails healthy and didn&#x27;t want to do anything to damage them. After trying the gel I was hooked. Over two weeks without so much as a chip! This was better better than my usual 3 times a week polish change!! But then I realized that I was going right back into the nail financial burden that I was stuck in for so long. I was happy to see this kit on Amazon for $35. I thought for #35 even if it sucks I&#x27;m not out that much money. Well, it doesn&#x27;t suck, it works well, the color looks as advertised, and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. If there was one thing I could change, it would be the size of the light, but even that isn&#x27;t a huge deal to me.</li>
            <li> Work fantastically. It was a little difficult to paint my dominant hand, and that meant I put the polish on a little too thick, so it chipped in about a week on that hand. I figure with some practice, I can get the full 2 weeks out of it that I get when I get a gel manicure at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to just use VERY thin layers.  I did find that I had to leave my nails under the lamp a bit longer for the polish to set than the instructions said, but that is probably due to my too thick polish layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try it again and see if I can get the full 2 weeks out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, it is MUCH cheaper than going to the salon.</li>
            <li> I got my girl this and she loves it she didn&#x27;t realize that its not easy to get off but it keeps her from peeling them.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different gel nail polish kits thanks to friends. Red Carpet and Sally Hansen gel nail kits just do not compare. The key to doing it right is to follow all the directions! Especially when they say cap the nail by running the nail polish along the front of the nail to seal it. This will guarantee that the tip does not chip. I did my first manicure at home and I don&#x27;t think I will be going back to the salon for another manicure or pedicure. Purchasing this kit would cost me that same amount and I can get a lot more use out of it. Great investment! Also gave my mom a Manicure with the Kit and she is a nurse so I am waiting to see how it holds up to and that extra hand washing and the chemicals she is around. It really does last a GOOD 10-14 days. So if you like to switch up colors a lot I don&#x27;t recommend it... But you have got to consider it does look really nice when finished!!</li>
            <li> I received this kit for valentines day.  At first, I was frustrated.  I got polish on my cuticles, peeling edges, etc...  Now that I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few months, I finally feel like I&#x27;ve got the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you buy this kit, you can buy and use any gel polish combination.  Right now, I&#x27;m using the gelish basics kit with my color gels.  I have sensationail, nailuv and fingerpaints gels.  I have not tried any other color brands yet.  Of those three, nailuv is by far my favorite.  It goes on thin and strong, I changed the color after 7 days but had absolutely no chipping, that was using the sensational bonder, base/top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to any of these polishes is to apply a thin, thin later.  Get as close to your cuticle as possible, create a smooth line at the base and CAP YOUR NAIL!  Capping is the most important step and you should do this with each cure.  Lastly, I like to blow on my nails for a minute after I do my final cure, before I wipe with cleanser to remove the tacky layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get frustrated with removal but foil wrapping your nails with a cotton soaked in acetone is best.  Especially for toes.  It is also possible to break the seal of the polish along the edges and peel off to remove without any acetone.  I believe this is similar to popping off acrylic nails.  I did this during grid locked traffic last week and had absolutely no polish on by the time I got home!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this investment is way better than dropping $7 - $9 on regular polish that chips in 1-2 days.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart and paid about $5 more for it. I wanted to buy it locally because I was sure it wouldn&#x27;t work on my nails. I can&#x27;t keep regular polish on them. Usually about 24 hours later my thin nails would bend and crack the polish and then the flaking starts. Going to a nail salon for professional nails is just not in my budget and I just don&#x27;t have time for that nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF WORKS!!!!! My polish stayed on for over two weeks and it was always super shiney like I had just walked out of a nail salon. I even cut the tip of one of my fingernails off with a knife (not the finger tip) and the polish on what was left of my nail still looked great and didn&#x27;t flake off!&lt;br /&gt;I may have found the miracle for my nails.</li>
            <li> It does take a little longer than regular polish to apply BUT THEN YOU&#x27;RE DONE FOR TWO WEEKS!!! Totally done, no worrying about digging in your purse or bumping into something and messing it up. Some of the pale colors don&#x27;t cover so well..probably a 3rd coat of color would fix that. I have a pretty difficult time removing gel polish, this and salon gels nail techs had a hard time removing. I think Sensational says some people&#x27;s nails are harder to remove it from than others. I&#x27;m going to try the heating pad trick next removal. I&#x27;m also going to try the easy off Base. Here&#x27;s a tip I haven&#x27;t seen and wasn&#x27;t told by any of the salons I had gels done at...my sister who is a hairdresser said to apply nail oil regularly to keep your nails in good condition which is a good idea regardless if you&#x27;re doing gel or any other polish.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this set.  I end up doing 3 coats because I wanted it darker.  I also let it cure for 1 minutes instead of 30 seconds.  Color is beautiful and shiny.  I&#x27;m ordering more colors today</li>
            <li> It&#x27;a easy to nake at home.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the color that came with the set -- way to dark and looked almost purple. Everything else was great.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It was easy to apply and the color is great.  I don&#x27;t know how long the manicure will last because I just put it on, but it feels just like the applications I&#x27;ve had at the salon so far.  I would definitely buy this product again.  It is worth every penny and paid for itself in just one use.</li>
            <li> I was paying about $30 every two weeks for a gel manicure at the salon. I decided to buy this kit and try doing it myself. Just did my first DIY Gel mani last night and it was so easy and looks fantastic! The finish is strong and has a beautiful shine. I used the Sensationail color Coral Sunset - it&#x27;s a beautiful soft creamy coral &#x3D; perfect for summer. You don&#x27;t have to use the Sensationail polishes - any LED gel polish will work. I did my daughter&#x27;s nails today using a color by IBD with the Sensationail base/top coat and it worked great. This little kit is going to save me so much money... although I will probably end up spending it on more polish colors!</li>
            <li> I received the delivery and I could smell nail polish.  I opened the box and 1 of the bottles was broke and empty and the other items were sticky.  I contacted Amazon and they immediately shipped out a new kit with 2 day delivery.  The bottles are all small, but it&#x27;s a starter kit so I wasn&#x27;t expecting full size bottles.  It was a good price for what all I received.  I read and followed all the directions and my nails turned out perfect.  It&#x27;s weird to have 4 coats of polish on my nails and have them be instantly dry and usable all due to that little magic light box.  Usually with regular nail polish I end up scuffs 1 or 2 nails before they&#x27;re fully cured from 4 layers of polish. I&#x27;m definitely sold on gel polish now!</li>
            <li> I love this product! LOVE this product! I really enjoy having polished nails, but haven&#x27;t had them in years because I&#x27;m very hard on my hands and conventional polishes just do not last long enough. Plus, they take more drying time than I have to give, and I usually end up with dings or smudges in the polish. Sensationail has changed all that. I&#x27;ve been through a few rounds of polishing with this product and it really does what it says it will. I don&#x27;t get the full 2 weeks with ALL my nails, but I&#x27;d say I get 2 weeks with about 7-8 of them. I always have one or two nails, the same ones, that seem to chip sooner than the others, so I just touch up/redo those couple of nails and I&#x27;m good to go for a few more days. If you are careful, you CAN do reasonably nice touchups. Some things I have found when using this product: You MUST cap the nails as suggested for longest wear. Pay attention to the primer instructions. If you prime the entire nail before polishing, it will be harder to get off. If you go in a circle around the edge as described, the center portion will lift off quite easily and then the edges will come off better once the center part is gone. Also, you have to buff the top layer to roughen it, and then give them the full 15 minutes in the remover.... really, don&#x27;t cheat on this, more time does make it quite a bit easier to get off. I find that the foil wrap method is the best - it keeps acetone off the back of your fingers and is less drying, the polish seems to come off quicker, plus you will have semi-functional mobility with your hands even with the wraps on. Pour yourself a glass of wine and watch a favorite show while you wait for the remover to work. I have also found that Sensationail&#x27;s remover tool is quite handy and seems to make the polish easier to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the time involved in polishing/removing, which others have complained about... dry time is almost instantaneous with this product, so application should take quite a bit LESStime than with conventional polish, and the finish is perfect. As for removal, yes, it is somewhat time consuming, but considering I am only doing it once per two weeks vs. 2-3 times a week with conventional polish, I&#x27;d say the removal time is a wash between the two types. Overall, this product has SAVED me time, with better looking nails as a result.</li>
            <li> My daughter used this product and it&#x27;s lasted four days without chipping at all! I tried the Nutra Nail Gel and it didn&#x27;t even last 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Stays on for 2 weeks and still didn&#x27;t chip. It would probably last 3 weeks but I usually can&#x27;t wait that long to change my nail color.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from a local retailer and it doesn&#x27;t work at all like the salon versions.  I tried it twice and the polish doesn&#x27;t harden and dry like the professional machine and polish.  What a total disappointment!  Would like to have my money back!!</li>
            <li> Anyone having trouble with this system isn&#x27;t very bright and didn&#x27;t read the directions. My favorite is the complaint about the sticky residue. The directions clearly state apply in THIN coats. There&#x27;s a reason for that. Also, you need to wipe the nails with the cleaner provided or alcohol. As far as the light quality goes, I&#x27;ve had mine for 6 months with no issue but lets be honest, this isn&#x27;t commercial/professional grade but it works. Given the cost of professional gel manicures vs this system, If I got 2 uses out of it, it was a wash. Any more and I&#x27;m ahead of the game. I use it fairly regularly every 10-14 days or so.  Some tips I&#x27;ve discovered useful: Definitely lightly buff your nails.  Apply the primer around the outer edges of the nail, avoiding the middle/bed part. It makes removal a little easier. You HAVE to do this step.  Use the base coat provided (although I found a strengthener I like). Apply a thin coat (I do 2 coats total)  When &#x27;capping&#x27; the nails, do it as you&#x27;re polishing instead of the last step. Avoids bumps.  Shake polishes VERY well.  Again...thin coats! Better 2 apply 3 coats as opposed to 1 or 2 thicker ones. This lasts a long time. Take your time and do it right.  Try to avoid touching the polish to your skin. It will cause it to lift/peel easier.  I do 2 fingers at a time. Less chance of the wet polish running. Takes longer but it&#x27;s worth it.   After finishing all coats and topcoat, clean the nail with the cleaner provided or alcohol. This gets rid of the sticky residue.  Do NOT touch nails in between coats. At all. Wait till you&#x27;re done and they&#x27;re cleaned.  You can use the lint free pads they give you but honestly I don&#x27;t find them totally lint free. I use cosmetic rounds with the same result.  The cleaner can be substituted with alcohol.  You can remove them with cotton balls/rounds and tinfoil pieces, but buying the pre-made ones are so much easier. CVS has their own brand, cheaper and a lot of times on sale buy one get one (or get one 50% off).  I also found removal using that wooden stick useless. Buy the metal removal tool..save some aggravation.  FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this kit for about six months and it&#x27;s really fantastic. Follow the (simple) instructions and you will have a beautiful, lasting manicure. I receive many compliments on my nails whenever I use this product, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. The company offers a nice variety of additional colors if you&#x27;re like me and enjoy mixing it up a bit. It was even easy to spice it up by sprinkling on a little glitter before curing the second coat and adding the top coat. I highly recommend the Sensationail gel polish kit if you want to have a gorgeous, affordable manicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very cosmetically savvy. I was a chronic nail biter turned chronic nail polish chipper- I was painting them at least once a day, and chipping them off, and doing it again. It left my nails really thin, the polish would stain my cuticles something fierce and all too often, I&#x27;d smudge them while waiting for them to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without sounding too infomercial-ly, I can tell you that this product really solved all of those problems *IF* you use it properly. The nail polish doesn&#x27;t set until you put it under the LED light- this gives you a lot of opportunity for damage control (using the little wooden cuticle pusher you can easily wipe away excess polish). Once you put it under that light though, consider it a temporarily permanent extension of yourself. As soon as it cures in the light you can go about your day- no fanning your fingers and blowing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I said \\&quot;if you use it properly\\&quot;- I read reviews on every site I could find before buying the starter kit and there are a few resounding complaints:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It peels off right away\\&quot;- you put it on too thick- when the instructions say thin, they mean REALLY thin. I go super light on the first color application (most times I can still see my nail through it) then on the second coat of color I add a little more, but still quite thin by all standards. First time I put it on, I applied it like I applied regular nail polish and also experienced a little peeling. Easily corrected the 2nd time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Nails are super thin now\\&quot; - don&#x27;t use the emery board that comes with it- I think it&#x27;s meant to make your nail coarse so the polish sticks better- I use my own, that is a little bit finer, which might make the next part a non issue for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It won&#x27;t come off\\&quot; - I have not used the recommended removal kit- as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s acetone wraps followed with some scraping. sounds awful. I just chip mine off- it hasn&#x27;t destroyed my nail, and it seems pretty easy to do after two weeks- it&#x27;s grown out enough where you can start to get under the corners of it. If you try this and it doesn&#x27;t work for you, the instructions say to only add the primer layer around the edges of your nail and it&#x27;ll come off much easier. Don&#x27;t waste your money on that gooey removal kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Came out ugly!\\&quot; - make sure you clean your nails beforehand- push up/trim the cuticles, etc- you don&#x27;t mop your floor when it&#x27;s covered in junk, why would you paint your nails if you haven&#x27;t done a little nail-scaping?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few other gems of information - I researched this polish on ewg.org, which rates the danger of cosmetic ingredients, and many of the polishes have a low or moderate ranking (the darker ones seem to hit the moderate category) and do not have a lot of the standard cancer causing agents found in other polishes. This is actually really impressive considering some of the other products out there! The LED light is also much safer than similar UV application systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product- I will gift it to others and swear by it forever. Even my grandma loves it, and she&#x27;s at that age where she a little shaky and her nails still come out great- like I said, very very forgiving.</li>
            <li> I purchased my SensatioNail kit a few wks back &amp; this was the best nail purchase I&#x27;ve made by far. I bought this a couple days before I went &amp; got my first professional Shellac manicure, so I had to wait a couple wks to use it on myself. Although my professional Shellac mani was pretty.... The SensatioNail mani&#x27;s I done on 3 relatives looked just as professional. After two weeks it was time for me to do my own &amp; they turned out BEAUTIFUL! Nailene out done theirself SensatioNail is a Wonderful product.... Def a Must have if you Love your nails flawless!</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first \\&quot;gel\\&quot; kit.  I was getting them done in a salon and wanted a cheaper way to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I didn&#x27;t care for the lack of color options.  Also, the size of the bottles are SMALL.  You are basically buying the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not impressed with the polish itself.  It seemed longer to soak off and didn&#x27;t last all that long.  Gelish are much better with the salon quality colors that are fun and classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say you need the pre bonding/cleansing stuff that sesationail offered.  Nor the final wipe.  Alcohol does the trick. And it&#x27;s what salons use.  Cheap and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is only big enough for 4 fingers at a time and thumbs together, which may be best since if you put your whole hand in leaves your thumb naturally at a side.  Also, it&#x27;s an LED light rather than UV like some.  Which means it cures faster.  Gelish polishes say you only need 30 seconds.  I do a minute, or two anyway as usually when I do them I have time.  But I may play with the 30 second thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I ended up using the light but buying CND base/top coat and Gelish colors.  I will probably try Gelish base/top as the colors last great so the base/top may be better too.  The sensationail scraper is a good product.  But since using Gelish colors and cotton disks rather than cotton balls, I have hardly any sraping after 10 mins in tin foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing what I know today, I would have found a bigger light for the same price, but this product is decent.</li>
            <li> THIS IS GONNA SAVE ME A LOT OF TIME AT THE NAIL SALON AND IT LOOKS AND FEELS THE SAME!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this kit. I thought I&#x27;d share my removal method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up the removal tool at Walgreens for about $5 (made by SensatioNail). Great buy. I buffed the shine off the nails, put pure acetone on cotton, put the cotton on my fingers, wrapped my fingers in foil, put my hands under a heating pad, waited about 10 minutes, scraped off the gel with this tool, buffed my nails with a file, pushed back my cuticles, put on some lotion and put some cuticle oil on my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fingers are ready to go for the next set. I&#x27;m going to give them a days rest. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s necessary but I&#x27;ll do it anyway. Total time it took to remove: 25-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I would give 10 starts if possible! I was very skeptical about this product, but decided to take a chance, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I watched a few YouTube videos, and they are all correct, you must apply this product correctly to ensure you get the results you want! I cap the ends of my nails first, and then paint them to avoid a ridge at the end. Know that there will be shrinkage during the application process, and the shellac may move around while you go from nail to nail. Be sure they look good before you cure!  I also do both thumbs first, start to finish, and then the four fingers on each hand at a time. This allows me to take breaks between since they are complete.  The first application lasted 17 days, and I type all day at work, and hand wash the dishes.  They still actually looked fine when I removed them, but they were lifting in the corners slightly. Very few chips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the removal process, I soaked in acetone-soaked cotton rounds wrapped in tin foil for 20 minutes. I bought the removal tool as well, but they came off cleanly and with NO damage to my natural nails. After removal, I filed my nails down since they had grown so much in the 17 days I had them on. My nails were strong, and I had no evidence of the shellac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I had such a great experience with my starter kit, I&#x27;ve already purchased 2 more colors from this same brand. I&#x27;m on my second application currently, and I think it&#x27;s going great so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to a friend, and have told several coworkers about this kit!</li>
            <li> I am stay at home mom, so for me any nail polish i tried wont last more than 2 days, as i have to be constantly cleaning something and with a 1 year old baby its hard to do your nails or even go to salon! Title claims it lasts up to 2 weeks, i ve been wearing it for a week now and so far it didnt crack or loose its shine! I love that there is no drying time so you dont have to sit and wonder if its dry or not, once you finish drying with the lamp (30 sec base coat, 60 sec each polish coat and 30 sec top coat comes to 3 minutes total) you are free to get back to your activities and you wont mess up your nails! I ve tried other brands and it wasnt even close to shellac in salon but this one really works! Love it! give it a try!</li>
            <li> This product last longer than a salon polish. I have had various gel polishes at various salons and as I am quite a \\&quot;hands on\\&quot; type of girl, it only lasted around 6 days (it then started lifting at the tips. However, the Sensationail polish lasts until I feel it has grown out from looking good or when I get bored and want a change (around 3 weeks) and not once have they lifted/peeled. The polish on my toe nails has been on for 5 weeks now and it looks as good as the day I applied it. Also, its just as easy to apply as normal nail polish. I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> This product will RUIN your nails!  You have to soak your nails in pure acetone for more than 15 min. then SCRAPE and scrape to get it off your nails - and even then it is difficult to get it all off.  I have had naturally strong and long nails my whole life.  After using this twice, they have peeling and broke down to where I do not think it is possible to get any shorter.  I have never had such short nails in my life.  And there is STILL some product remaining from when I did this a month ago.  I refuse to soak and scrape again.  If you care about your nails, do not get this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an affordable gel polish kit for a very long time and I&#x27;m glad i took my chances on this. I recommend this product to everyone! When i first got it i never stopped talking about it! Its very easy to do and very easy to remove off skin BEFORE curing. if you&#x27;re looking for a simple, at home gel polish kit choose this one! P. S. There isn&#x27;t a large variety of colors but I&#x27;m sure more will be coming!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only on my second application, so keep that in mind, but I did wear the first application out till the first chip and went through the removal process, and have much to say about Sensationail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the application is super easy and much faster than regular polishes. All in all, if you follow the directions exactly, I find that it takes me about 45 minutes to do the full application of 2 color coats and the base and top coat. Compare that to the 2+ HOURS it would usually take me to do the same with regular, non-gel polish, and we are talking a serious time-saver application-wise. If you start to think about nail art, the time saved just gets better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I did my first application the night before I left on vacation... and therefore, after the 45 minutes I allowed myself to do my nails, I immediately had to finish packing. Thus, not more than 5 minutes after curing my topcoat, my nails got the full assault. Needless to say, with normal polish, my clothes and luggage would have ended up wearing more polish than my nails... However, by the time I was out the door and rushing to the airport, my nails were completely FLAWLESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear time: my first chip happened on day 12 of wear. Before this, there was some rubbing off of the \\&quot;cap\\&quot; of my nail, but nothing noticeable unless you looked closely. I&#x27;d say, I first noticed the cap wearing off after day 7 or so as well, so still remarkable wear all the way around. To put it in perspective, before this, my regular polish would last a maximum of 3 days before there was significant wear at the tip of my nail which WAS noticeable, that I would feel the need to touch up. Additionally, with regular polish, I would have been preserving my polish with a new top coat daily or at least every other day, but with Sensationail I did nothing and had a beautiful gloss on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal is a pain... but not a deal-breaker. The majority of the timesaved during application is lost during the removal process, but when you think of the quality of the nails during wear, time saved not applying top coats every day, and the fast application, I think Sensationail is still very worthwhile. Really, it&#x27;s much easier to schedule time for removal of still great looking polish, than to fit in time for a polish as well. All but one of my nails left the removal process undamaged, and I&#x27;m confident that what I learned from the first removal will prevent any recurrent scrapes in the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the main reason I&#x27;m so in love with Sensationail right now, is the quality of my nails after wearing the polish for almost two weeks: my nails are STRONGER than they ever have been before, AND for once all my nails are long at the same time! Since before, with regular polish or none, my nails always would break before they reached my desired length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails really do feel nearly invincible while I&#x27;m wearing Sensationail gel polish, and therefore, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to regular polish again.</li>
