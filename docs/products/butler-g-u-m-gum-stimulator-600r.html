            <li>Would think that they could make them stay on better.</li>
            <li>but now I am hooked and do this more than flossing</li>
            <li>I also recommend using the device on the inside of your gums, which takes more dexterity and care but worthwhile.</li>

            <li>Without it you will stand a good chance of getting tooth decay in there, even with proper flossing.</li>
            <li>The gum stimulator works very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This little dental tool has been a great addition to our teeth</li>
            <li>First one so nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li>When it comes to dental care, I am very anal, do everything right, floss, brush, dental cleanings twice a year, yet I have some gum recession.</li>
            <li>shape of the handle is easy to hold and get right to the back teeth!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>The rubber tip lasts for several weeks and is easy to change out.</li>
            <li>use a dedicated one for the clay and another for your teeth, durrrr, haha</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this handy little tool for years, mainly as a cleaner of food, etc.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It works just like it is supposed to, but I thought the tips would be a little more flexible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just curious as to why they don&#x27;t sell them in the big drugstores any more.</li>
            <li>They can really get in between each tooth and last much longer than ever before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>however this tool has fabulous little rubber tips.</li>
            <li>so no waste except the used tips when the time comes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Firm enough to clean your teeth and under edge of gums</li>
            <li>but I feel that the material of the tip could be a little less like plastic/slippery and more rubber-like with a bit of friction.</li>
            <li>You have to keep buying a whole new stimulator because the replacement tips are a WASTE OF MONEY and fall off after a couple of uses.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this handy little tool for years, mainly as a cleaner of food, etc. at the gum line. I use it in conjunction with an anti-plaque mouth wash and find that my professional dental cleanings are finished in half the time now. I&#x27;m just curious as to why they don&#x27;t sell them in the big drugstores any more. The rubber tip lasts for several weeks and is easy to change out. For me, it&#x27;s a really inexpensive way to keep my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> I use this tool daily and it is a must for good dental hygiene.  My husband also uses his.  I&#x27;ve used this for product for decades.</li>
            <li> They are gum stimulators...sadly, I need them.  They work as they always have.  Since probably the 1930â€™s......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;better than toothpicks</li>
            <li> This tool is critical for removing the plaque between the gaps in your inner molars. Without it you will stand a good chance of getting tooth decay in there, even with proper flossing.</li>
            <li> The gum stimulator works very well and is easy to use. It is a great product for gum hygiene. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years but if I could add a star I would! See below&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros...&lt;br /&gt;The rubber tip is harder than it use to be which I like.  They can really get in between each tooth and last much longer than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;They are addictive as well. The minute I begin to crave sugar, I grab this stimulator and start to &amp;#34;play with it&amp;#34;.  That works oddly enough.&lt;br /&gt;I also have gums that bleed easily... this little gadget firms them up nicely!&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the handle is easy to hold and get right to the back teeth!&lt;br /&gt;You can also buy the little rubber heads for them... so no waste except the used tips when the time comes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons... if there are any, I can&#x27;t think of one.</li>
            <li> Could not find this gum stimulator at any local stores so I was pleased to find this. They are very good and I am once again using one for my gums to keep them in better shape in addition to brushing my teeth twice a day.</li>
            <li> Incredible gum stimulation.  Mind blowing gum stimulation.  Don&#x27;t deprive yourself of this experience.</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> You have to keep buying a whole new stimulator because the replacement tips are a WASTE OF MONEY and fall off after a couple of uses. Would think that they could make them stay on better.</li>
            <li> It makes such a difference</li>
            <li> It works just like it is supposed to, but I thought the tips would be a little more flexible. They are rather rigid, but I guess they have to be to do the job and last a while.</li>
            <li> Someone showed me these to clean their gums with after I was complaining about my gums and hating to floss.  You can gently rub it across your gums and it surprisingly removes a lot of stuff off of your gums.  These are a great short term solution to ease into flossing.</li>
            <li> great value and product ,quick ship very happy</li>
            <li> The tip/shape is very effective but I feel that the material of the tip could be a little less like plastic/slippery and more rubber-like with a bit of friction. But still good for stimulation of the gums. I just started using this device and it takes a bit to get the hang of it but now I am hooked and do this more than flossing (I floss daily). I also recommend using the device on the inside of your gums, which takes more dexterity and care but worthwhile. My mom has been using this device for over 30 years and she claims it has played a big role and has helped keep her from losing her teeth. When it comes to dental care, I am very anal, do everything right, floss, brush, dental cleanings twice a year, yet I have some gum recession. Did some research online... just started reading a book called \\&quot;Cure Tooth Decay\\&quot; and its QUITE an eye opener. If you want to learn more about healthy teeth, check out this link on Amazon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Cure-Tooth-Decay-Cavities-Nutrition/product-reviews/1434810607/ref&#x3D;sr_cr_hist_all?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;showViewpoints&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am beginning to realize that one&#x27;s teeth represent the innards of overall health. Turns out my gum recession means something is wrong with my diet, not my oral care...on a mission to fix it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 30yrs. it gets the plaque up from around the gums and back teeth. my dental hygienist always tells me she hardly has to scrape when I come in for my twice yearly cleaning!!</li>
            <li> First one so nothing to compare it to. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do I guess.</li>
            <li> This little dental tool has been a great addition to our teeth cleaning habits.&lt;br /&gt;I used to think I didn&#x27;t care for &amp;#34;tooth pickers&amp;#34; the sort that scrape the teeth, they give me the same feeling that nails on a chalkboard does...however this tool has fabulous little rubber tips. Firm enough to clean your teeth and under edge of gums but since it&#x27;s rubber it doesn&#x27;t make me cringe to use it.&lt;br /&gt;In fact I have become quite fearless poking it about my gum edges where as in the past a metal tooth pick I&#x27;d use agonizingly time wasting slow.&lt;br /&gt;I should point out also that besides being great for the teeth and gums it&#x27;s a wonderful sculpting tool.&lt;br /&gt;OBVIOUSLY use a dedicated one for the clay and another for your teeth, durrrr, haha</li>
            <li> These are durable and flexible after soaking in warm water and a couple uses.  It really gets between the teeth and firm up the gum.  I the beginning I scratched my gum from slipping but it&#x27;s been a few weeks and I am getting use to it, less accidental scratching my gum.  The pockets seems to be firmer, the gum is noticeably healthier.  I do have some very deep pockets, as deep as a 6.  I think in another month my dental visit will have a better results.</li>
            <li> I bought this to detail my car interior.  The perforations in my heated seats collect lint sometimes and just wiping the seat off didn&#x27;t remove it.  This has rubber on the end so I can use it in the perforations without damaging the seats.</li>
