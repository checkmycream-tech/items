            <li>This is a great product that helps moisturize without a greasy look on your face.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product; by far the best creams my wife has ever tried!</li>
            <li>BUT THIS IS SUPERIOR TO ALL THE ONES Y KNOW.</li>
            <li>Good cream ,but not for my skin.</li>
            <li>Been using these products for three years-Very pleased!</li>
            <li>To be honest I already stopped using the gel because i prefer to put the serum on my face instead and</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling very smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Maybe you would like it mo than me:)</li>
            <li>This is what healthy 20 plus skin is supposed to look like.  </li>
            <li>but I rather prefer a cream that provides more of a moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li>I love all the Premier Products</li>
            <li>It is easy to use daily , has nice texture , and leaves my skin feeling great .</li>
            <li>It is very emollient, smells wonderful, and leaves my very sensitive skin hydrated and refreshed.</li>
            <li>and so far so good but need to see if it&#x27;s good enough for winter</li>
            <li>Originally tried it from a Kiosk at the mall, but found if ever so affordable at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to most of the facial moisturizers on the market, but this moisturizer is very natural and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>The nighttime Premier complex is a wonderful component to my skincare regime.  </li>
            <li>When used in conjunction with the facial serum, which I apply a few times per week, it is even more wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts but love this night cream.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin smooth and soft and is great for the aging woman whose skin is drying due to menopause.</li>
            <li>First massaging the gel on the face and after washing this gel off the face you use the cream.</li>
            <li>I used this product previously and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>2 products to apply- too much work for the evening.  </li>
            <li>Hydrates very well and is non-oily.</li>
            <li>It is gentle to my face, and I have had no adverse reactions to it.</li>
            <li>I use the night cream for a month now, you don&#x27;t need to apply much of it</li>
            <li>This is a night cream because it is very heavy but effective.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t so smelly, I&#x27;d love to try it since I do love the other Premier Dead Sea products.</li>
            <li>Premier Dead Sea Night Cream Complex is a Wonderful Product!!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many premier Dead Sea products ;but this one I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the starter kit and now trying out all the other fine items by Premier.  </li>
            <li>Boy, am I glad this was a HARD sell.  </li>
            <li>Feels very nourishing especially during winter.</li>
            <li>Premier Dead Sea Night Cream Complex moisturizes and nourishes my skin very effectively while I sleep.</li>
            <li>so I guess it will last for a pretty long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is oily and the Night Complex Cream leaves my skin light and airy</li>
            <li>Not greasy, not dry.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Premier products for the last 3 years, and this year, even though it has been the most brutal winter I can remember, my face has never been better.</li>
            <li>My pass and present experiences with Premier Dead Sea products have always been positive.</li>

            <li> I use to have dry skin blotch&#x27;s on my face but using the Dead Sea Night Cream Complex  in combination with the Premier Concentrated Facial Serum and the Moisture Complex, my face has never bee better.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards or anything like this</li>
            <li> sum up, people with (very) dry skin should rather take another cream instead of this one.</li>
            <li> No positive effect on my face.</li>
            <li> I like the green gel that is used as a prep for the cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have a really dry skin I am not completely happy with this cream.</li>
            <li> This product was outdated and I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s a bad batch because of how reasonably priced it was.  </li>
            <li> I just am not real impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I live in Minnesota and this year we have a terrible winter - extremely cold and Very Dry.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> It is a moisturizer, but unfortunately, my bottle fell and broke the irst week.</li>
            <li> It is a bit tedious apply.  </li>
            <li> So please don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t mean that the cream itself is bad just that I will look out for a thicker moisturizer cream (like I got once from MAC) in the future.&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say anything bad about the product.</li>
            <li> I used it once and got sick from the fragrance.  </li>

            <li> This is a great product that helps moisturize without a greasy look on your face.  It leaves your skin smooth and soft and is great for the aging woman whose skin is drying due to menopause.</li>
            <li> EXCELENT PRODUCT, I HAVE USED ALLWAYS THE BEST PRODUCTS&lt;br /&gt;FOR MY SKIN BUT THIS IS SUPERIOR TO ALL THE ONES Y KNOW.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a week and so far so good but need to see if it&#x27;s good enough for winter</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years. It is terrific.</li>
            <li> 2 products to apply- too much work for the evening.  should be combined to one cream .which will provide smoothness and moisture.</li>
            <li> It is a moisturizer, but unfortunately, my bottle fell and broke the irst week. It was oco I could retrieve it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts but love this night cream. Feels very nourishing especially during winter. Hydrates very well and is non-oily.</li>
            <li> The nighttime Premier complex is a wonderful component to my skincare regime.  When I wake up in the morning my skin is moist and looks refreshed.  It is obvious when I wash my face in the morning that there is still product working on my skin by the way my skin feels.  I recommend this product line to anyone who is wanting their skin to be well hydrated, moisturized without feeling too greasy/gooey.  I wish the nighttime product had a mineral disc similar to the daytime product vs the \\&quot;gel\\&quot;, otherwise I would give this product a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Premier Dead Sea Night Cream Complex moisturizes and nourishes my skin very effectively while I sleep. When used in conjunction with the facial serum, which I apply a few times per week, it is even more wonderful. It is gentle to my face, and I have had no adverse reactions to it. I am allergic to most of the facial moisturizers on the market, but this moisturizer is very natural and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>

            <li> I live in Minnesota and this year we have a terrible winter - extremely cold and Very Dry. I have been using the Premier products for the last 3 years, and this year, even though it has been the most brutal winter I can remember, my face has never been better. I use to have dry skin blotch&#x27;s on my face but using the Dead Sea Night Cream Complex  in combination with the Premier Concentrated Facial Serum and the Moisture Complex, my face has never bee better.</li>
            <li> This is the best night cream that I have ever used.  It is very emollient, smells wonderful, and leaves my very sensitive skin hydrated and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Good cream ,but not for my skin. No positive effect on my face. Maybe you would like it mo than me:)</li>
            <li> Product was as described. It&#x27;s working wonders on my face. I would recommend this Product to a friend. It took ten years off my face.</li>
            <li> I found this product just so so.  It is a bit tedious apply.  I just am not real impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I started out by getting pulled in to one of those kiosks at the Mall.  I practically pleaded with these folks to let me go and I didn&#x27;t want to spend any money.  Boy, am I glad this was a HARD sell.  I&#x27;ve used the starter kit and now trying out all the other fine items by Premier.  I&#x27;m telling you ladies, 6 months into this and I&#x27;ll never use anything else.  My wrinkles are gone, my face is one color with the addition of a natural pink tint to my cheeks.  (no blush needed)  This is what healthy 20 plus skin is supposed to look like.  Ladies I&#x27;m 50 plus, and my face truly looks like I&#x27;m 30 again.  I wish I could model my face for this product.</li>
            <li> I use the night cream for a month now, you don&#x27;t need to apply much of it so I guess it will last for a pretty long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say anything bad about the product. The only thing that annoys me a bit is the 2-phase thing. First massaging the gel on the face and after washing this gel off the face you use the cream. To be honest I already stopped using the gel because i prefer to put the serum on my face instead and the cream afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have a really dry skin I am not completely happy with this cream. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards or anything like this but I rather prefer a cream that provides more of a moisturizing effect. So please don&#x27;t get me wrong it doesn&#x27;t mean that the cream itself is bad just that I will look out for a thicker moisturizer cream (like I got once from MAC) in the future.&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, people with (very) dry skin should rather take another cream instead of this one.</li>
            <li> Premier Dead Sea Night Cream Complex is a Wonderful Product!! Would highly recommend.  Makes skin feel great!  Not greasy, not dry.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product; by far the best creams my wife has ever tried!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for  a while now, no complaints and the price is wonderful  Try it and maybe it will work for you</li>
