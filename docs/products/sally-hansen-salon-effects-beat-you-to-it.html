    <ol>
            <li>I bought this for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day and it was perfect...</li>
            <li>These look great!</li>
            <li>I love these!!!</li>
            <li>The color is really great</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;They look great on my nails&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>From a dad&#x27;s perspective, they look great on her nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Sally Effects polish strips before and they&#x27;ve been good to me.</li>
            <li>Strips arrived in sealed package and were in good condition.</li>
            <li>but the color looks cute!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I looked all over the box for a expiration date or a date of some kind</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen is, by far, the best brand of polish strips.  </li>
            <li>and I love these nail &amp;#34;stickers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love Sally Hansen Salon Effects and am used to applying them...</li>
            <li>I just wish it had more &amp;#34;sparkle&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love sally Hansen salon effects.  </li>
            <li>i love it emerald is the color of the year</li>
            <li>I love this product-</li>
            <li>Love the color.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply love it.</li>
            <li>I use my hands a lot at work, so mine chipped way too easy - would recommend using a top coat.</li>
            <li>Did apply very good quality topcoat with this design and again, massive chipping, this time within 48 hours.</li>
            <li>These are great when I&#x27;m trying to have nice nails but don&#x27;t have the time to sit and let them dry.  </li>
            <li>I was really bummed because they were very pretty and would look very nice, but were just unusable.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>They stay on for weeks and easily come off.  </li>
            <li>Super cute colors and designs too.</li>
            <li>Very glad I got such a good deal on these strips as they are not even slightly worth the retail price.</li>
            <li>I have shorter nails and get 2 full manicures out of one box.</li>
            <li>Adding top coat and wrapping the tips with it, really helps with the longevity of the manicure.</li>
            <li>They all ask me where I get all of my cool colors and how I can afford them....</li>
            <li>but now I can put them on really quickly</li>
            <li>They last pretty long and my friends are always impressed with the details in them.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these about three weeks ago and went to use them right before St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li>I love the Sally Hansen salon effects, they go on fairly easy and last longer than regualr nail polish, also they don&#x27;t seem to damage my nails as regular polish tends to, I love all the different pattern options available!</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s your first time trying them it might take a while to get it</li>
            <li>Did not use a top coat with first design and nails were chipping literally hours later.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing them through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the sizing and fit; I have a wide nail base and these strips fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to apply and it really can last up to 10 days.</li>
            <li>For removal, I used the tin foil trick (put a bit of cotton soaked in remover on each nail, wrap in foil, let sit for about five minutes, then rub off) which made removal much easier.</li>
            <li>She really likes them.</li>
            <li>&amp; then I put 2 coats of top coat on them to try to \\&quot;glue\\&quot; them down</li>
            <li>final look is better than could be achieved with polish especially for &amp;#34;artwork&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s good since they last a few weeks without peeling off.</li>
            <li>However, if you want more than just a polished look and have a little time-</li>
            <li>The fit is not as complete as the Sally ones are, but no one notices but me, and you can&#x27;t beat staying power like that for such a low price!</li>
            <li>I buy Kiss nail strips at Dollar General for $3.00 and they last around ten days, topcoat free.</li>
            <li>They were all brand new &amp; the package was sealed, but they barely stuck.</li>
            <li>Also, by having short nails I can cut the strips in half and only use one 8-pack at a time and get 2 manicures from each box! :)</li>
            <li>Following the directions exactly makes this manicure simple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very hard on manicures because I use my hands a lot, but I like them to look nice just the same.  </li>
            <li>Her only complaint is when trimming off excess near the cuticle she states it is easy to lift off the sticker.</li>
            <li>It was obvious that there were incredibly old.</li>
            <li>Mine last frequently for 7, but I&#x27;m in the pool a lot.  </li>
            <li>These barely stuck at all.</li>
            <li>just the right shade of glittery kelly green.  </li>
            <li>I did not return them as they only cost a few dollars and wouldn&#x27;t have been worth packing them up and then dropping them off at UPS.</li>
            <li>They are a little different then the other Salon Effects in that you have to smooth them over and over for them to stick.  </li>
            <li>They are tricky to use the first few times and it takes forever to get them on, but once you get the hang of it, they don&#x27;t take any longer than a regular manicure.  </li>
            <li>No dry time last for days !!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these were old, dried out or what</li>
            <li> and they look like professional manicures (I was never good with nail polish).</li>
            <li> Disappointed, i got them, they did not stick, I guess were old, but they are exactly as described in the picture, take the chance?</li>
            <li> Both designs had a glitter base; unsure if that was a factor in the chipping, but I have no desire to spend money on more to find out.</li>
            <li> I am very active and have four kids</li>
            <li> not good for a last minute idea to put them on.</li>
            <li> You will get a solid week applied as directed but use the Sally Hansen UV LED clear Gel as base and over coat to get a solid 2 weeks out of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it to my little sister</li>
            <li> Shimmery and green and glittery goodness.  </li>
            <li> not easy to use, take quit a bit of time.</li>
            <li> I would not describe them as difficult to apply, but definitely time consuming.</li>
            <li> Usually you just peel them off, position them the way you want,  </li>
            <li> cause I had bought these specifically for a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day party &amp; I had no other green polish, but again they were terrible and barely lasted the night, let alone the 10 days or</li>
            <li> I was pressing them so hard to my nails, got them to semi stick</li>
            <li> I have slowly converted into using these all of the time.</li>
            <li> Bummer is they are horribly difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> but sadly even with that they were lifting up.</li>
            <li> but they were awful.</li>

            <li> The color is really great and I love these nail &amp;#34;stickers&amp;#34;. It took a couple times of using them but now I can put them on really quickly and they look like professional manicures (I was never good with nail polish). Also, by having short nails I can cut the strips in half and only use one 8-pack at a time and get 2 manicures from each box! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day and it was perfect... just the right shade of glittery kelly green.  I love Sally Hansen Salon Effects and am used to applying them... if it&#x27;s your first time trying them it might take a while to get it just right.  It gets easier though!  For removal, I used the tin foil trick (put a bit of cotton soaked in remover on each nail, wrap in foil, let sit for about five minutes, then rub off) which made removal much easier.</li>
            <li> You will get a solid week applied as directed but use the Sally Hansen UV LED clear Gel as base and over coat to get a solid 2 weeks out of it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but the color looks cute! I&#x27;ve used the Sally Effects polish strips before and they&#x27;ve been good to me. I just wish it had more &amp;#34;sparkle&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love sally Hansen salon effects.  I use them all the time.  They are tricky to use the first few times and it takes forever to get them on, but once you get the hang of it, they don&#x27;t take any longer than a regular manicure.  And they last a lot longer!</li>
            <li> My daughter asked me to buy these for her. She really likes them. &amp;#34;They look great on my nails&amp;#34;. Her only complaint is when trimming off excess near the cuticle she states it is easy to lift off the sticker. From a dad&#x27;s perspective, they look great on her nails.</li>
            <li> These look great! They are a little different then the other Salon Effects in that you have to smooth them over and over for them to stick.  That said they last for weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased these about three weeks ago and went to use them right before St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. They were totally dried-up and unusable. They weren&#x27;t even sticking to the paper backing that they were supposed to be on. It was obvious that there were incredibly old. I looked all over the box for a expiration date or a date of some kind and there was nothing. I did not return them as they only cost a few dollars and wouldn&#x27;t have been worth packing them up and then dropping them off at UPS. I was really bummed because they were very pretty and would look very nice, but were just unusable.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to apply and it really can last up to 10 days. Mine last frequently for 7, but I&#x27;m in the pool a lot.  I always get compliments about my nails when I use these products. Love it!</li>
            <li> will buy product agian i love it emerald is the color of the year 2013.&lt;br /&gt;so it&#x27;s a must have</li>
            <li> I love these!!! So easy to use. No dry time last for days !! No chipping. Easy to apply love it.</li>
            <li> Following the directions exactly makes this manicure simple. I have shorter nails and get 2 full manicures out of one box. Adding top coat and wrapping the tips with it, really helps with the longevity of the manicure.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, i got them, they did not stick, I guess were old, but they are exactly as described in the picture, take the chance?</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen is, by far, the best brand of polish strips.  They stay on for weeks and easily come off.  You can peel them off, or to keep from harming your nails use nail polish remover to help.</li>
            <li> Very glad I got such a good deal on these strips as they are not even slightly worth the retail price. Strips arrived in sealed package and were in good condition. Ordered two colors from same seller and used this second. I would not describe them as difficult to apply, but definitely time consuming. I love the sizing and fit; I have a wide nail base and these strips fit perfectly. Did not use a top coat with first design and nails were chipping literally hours later. Left them four days with increasing chipping until I finally peeled them off, no polish removed needed. Did apply very good quality topcoat with this design and again, massive chipping, this time within 48 hours. I buy Kiss nail strips at Dollar General for $3.00 and they last around ten days, topcoat free. Super cute colors and designs too. The fit is not as complete as the Sally ones are, but no one notices but me, and you can&#x27;t beat staying power like that for such a low price! Both designs had a glitter base; unsure if that was a factor in the chipping, but I have no desire to spend money on more to find out.</li>
            <li> I love this product- so much more expensive in the beauty stores.  Not for everyone. It does take time and effort to put these on correctly, but once you get the knack takes less time than waiting for multiple layers of polish to dry. I am very active and have four kids so I am constantly cleaning- these last about 4 or 5 days on me (longer on toes). I&#x27;m very hard on manicures because I use my hands a lot, but I like them to look nice just the same.  Also I&#x27;m short on time, and though these take time to properly place and shape- final look is better than could be achieved with polish especially for &amp;#34;artwork&amp;#34;. If your used to polish and go and not into &amp;#34;artsy&amp;#34; nails don&#x27;t bother this product will only frustrate you. However, if you want more than just a polished look and have a little time- this is the product for you.  Side note- comes with two packages, once opened though even unused become unusable- &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34; of product is lost once exposed to air if not used immediately.</li>
            <li> I love the Sally Hansen salon effects, they go on fairly easy and last longer than regualr nail polish, also they don&#x27;t seem to damage my nails as regular polish tends to, I love all the different pattern options available!</li>
            <li> for some reason they didn&#x27;t stick to me finger nails? they work for my toes tho. not easy to use, take quit a bit of time. not good for a last minute idea to put them on.</li>
            <li> These are great when I&#x27;m trying to have nice nails but don&#x27;t have the time to sit and let them dry.  Bummer is they are horribly difficult to remove.  I guess that&#x27;s good since they last a few weeks without peeling off.</li>
            <li> I have used several different kinds of the Sally Hansen Salon Effects...bought them from Ulta, a discount store &amp; also Amazon. This was my first time purchasing them through Amazon. I&#x27;m not sure if these were old, dried out or what but they were awful. Usually you just peel them off, position them the way you want,  they stick to your nail &amp; you&#x27;re done. These barely stuck at all. They were all brand new &amp; the package was sealed, but they barely stuck. I was pressing them so hard to my nails, got them to semi stick &amp; then I put 2 coats of top coat on them to try to \\&quot;glue\\&quot; them down but sadly even with that they were lifting up. I had to try to make them work cause I had bought these specifically for a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day party &amp; I had no other green polish, but again they were terrible and barely lasted the night, let alone the 10 days or whatever they claim on the box. I would never purchase or recommend these to be purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I thought it will look like the picture .. But simply its shiny glitter :/&lt;br /&gt;guess I&#x27;ll give it to my little sister</li>
            <li> Love the color.  Shimmery and green and glittery goodness.  I use my hands a lot at work, so mine chipped way too easy - would recommend using a top coat.</li>
            <li> I have slowly converted into using these all of the time. I tried it once on a trial at CVS and have been hook ever since. They last pretty long and my friends are always impressed with the details in them. They all ask me where I get all of my cool colors and how I can afford them....AMAZON!!</li>
