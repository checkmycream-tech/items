            <li>Dr. said normal eye debris plus now-irritated eyes from allergies and meds, needed to keep eyelash/exterior eyes clean.  </li>
            <li>I felt the difference the first time I used a scrub pad and have been using them since.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery of product!  </li>

            <li> After a few days use, twice a day, my eyelids were reddened and raw.  </li>
            <li> , not this &amp;#34;compliance kit&amp;#34;, which has a small bottle of the foaming cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than the soaked small cloths, but it does the job just as well.  </li>
            <li> Found squares of paper towel (cut to size) and small amount of baby shampoo works was well at fraction of cost.</li>
            <li> and I believe it is less expensive.</li>
            <li> Until the manufacturers improve the softness of their wipes, I think I will not be the only disappointed consumer.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li> Gave this to my wife and she was unhappy with the size of the pads.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My doctor has prescribed cleaning my eyelids with baby shampoo for ocular rosacea, but I have found that Ocusoft is gentler and doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.  I prefer the original formula as opposed to using the extra strength formula.  I have purchased both of them and prefer the moist towelette packets, but you can also buy a foam cleanser with separate towelettes.  More convenient to get the pre-moistened ones.     I have to scrub my eyelids everyday and this product  has worked well for me, and so I highly recommend it to anyone with ocular problems of the eyelid, where lid hygiene is essential to keep the bacteria at bay.</li>
            <li> I bought this by accident, meant to get the individual pads. Great brand, love the lid scrubs. This is too much work though, having to spray on the dry pads. Plus if you fly, the bottle will leak in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> I have used this and like it.  Does anyone know where to buy just the unmoistened pads without the cleanser (which lasts longer)?</li>
            <li> At my eye exam I was told by the optometrist that I should wash my eyelids and surrounding area due to oily skin.  I felt the difference the first time I used a scrub pad and have been using them since.  The foam cleanser is not irritating and both eyes can be cleaned quickly.  My eyes are no longer itchy and irritated.  Great product.</li>
            <li> It was not what I ordered.  It was 3 bottles of s similar product, but not 3 kits with 50 pads each.  I tried to exchange through Amazon.com, but could not and instead was given a link to &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; which basically dumped on a different page where it seemed to ask for me to start over again.  If customer service was available, the web page did not make it convenient to get to. I still do not want the product and want the produce I ordered, but the difficulty of trying to find &#x27;customer service&amp;#34; just adds to my frustration.</li>
            <li> I used to use baby shampoo to clean my eyelids since I have blepheritis, which was pretty inconvenient.  Occusoft is so much easier.  When I forget to use it, it&#x27;s really obvious, so it clearly works the way it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Recently treated for dry eyes.  Dr. said normal eye debris plus now-irritated eyes from allergies and meds, needed to keep eyelash/exterior eyes clean.  Use 2X daily, dry eye minimal and foam is very easy to use.  Also use eye drops 2X daily, OTC wetting drops.  No more red, irritated, or burning eyes.  Will keep Ocusoft Eyelid Scrub on my maintenance list.  Fast delivery of product!  Thanks for being trustworthy.</li>
            <li> I have blepharitis, an inflammation of the eyelids where the oil glands near the eyelids become clogged.  The purpose of the ocusoft cleansing is to open the ducts.  The problem with this package is that the cloth wipes are too rough.  I started using the Ocusoft pre-moistened cloths.  My Optometrist recommended using just the foaming scrub and my fingers because its gentler.  After switching to the foaming scrub and using my fingers i&#x27;m much happier with the result.  It also helps that i use the Thermalon Dry Eye Compress (http://www.amazon.com/Thermalon-24342-Dry-Eye-Compress/dp/B004385RPS/) on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are using this for Blepharitis or something similar, i think you should just purchase the foaming Ocusoft without the pads, ie., not this &amp;#34;compliance kit&amp;#34;, which has a small bottle of the foaming cleanser.  Its cheaper to purchase the independent containers of the foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> This would be great if it wasn&#x27;t such a strong foam.  It just isn&#x27;t easy or practical to use.  I wish it were just a squirt bottle with liquid.  The cloths were nice and lint-free.</li>
            <li> I used the samples from my eye doctor and had no problem.  Those wipes were a different material, pre-soaked with the Occusoft fluid.  However, the kit I received had a different, coarser wipe.  After a few days use, twice a day, my eyelids were reddened and raw.  I had to stop using the product.  I never opened the sent product as I had found the kit at my drugstore, at a lower cost, I might add, just after your product was on it&#x27;s way.  There was no way to stop your shipment, so I am stuck for close to $35.00 for both purchases (one from my local drugstore and one from you).  Live and learn.  Until the manufacturers improve the softness of their wipes, I think I will not be the only disappointed consumer.</li>
            <li> I prefer this product to the individual packets. You can control the amount and I believe it is less expensive.</li>
            <li> keeps my eye lids clean</li>
            <li> Just as described and arrived well ahead of suggested timeframe.  Will order again when supply is needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and I  have found it to help significantly with seasonal allergies</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have sensative skin around my eyes due to allergies and this product is so great that I never have any reactions.  Other make-up remover is too dry or too oily and irritates my eyes, but OcuSoft is mild.  I recommend this product to anyone with sensative eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this item for a few years at the recommendation of my eye doctor&#x27;s nurse.  It&#x27;s cheaper than the soaked small cloths, but it does the job just as well.  I&#x27;ll continue using this and recommend it to anyone who needs an eyelid cleaner.  (After cleaning the eyelids, I use it on my nose and cheeks, and end using it to give the sink a fast wipe.  How&#x27;s that for value.)</li>
            <li> The kit works great.  Just as described.  Came much sooner than expected.  Intend to order more when these are used up.</li>
            <li> They are great for eye scrub for eyes. Thankful I was able to find them on line.</li>
            <li> Yes, for people with blephoritis, this is the very best product and it is hard to find in most pharmacies.</li>
            <li> Was given the kit from my eye specialist and have consistently been using this twice a day as per the doctor.  I believe the product to be excellent - not harsh to the eyes nor does it sting etc. I&#x27;ve had major irritation and something called (improperly spelled no doubt) Blipheritius (like a dandruff of the eye lashes) and major irritation.  It has remedied that and I will actually continue to use the product hereafter.  I would recommend it for anyone with eye irritation.</li>
            <li> The product was recommended to my son by his optometrist. It does help him get his eyes clean.  Better than the baby shampoo that is often recommended which can cause stinging in the eye.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a long time. It was recommended by an opthamologist. Used once per day, it is an excellent in helping to prevent eye irritation due to any hairs or other matter that may accumulate on the eyelids. I find it very convenient to purchase it through Amazon. The vendor, AC Lens, provides fast service at a reasonable shipping charge. Also, the pull date is far into the future compared to some store purchases I have made in the past.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my opthamologist and has stopped all eye problems. I use it every morning after rinsing my eyes with warm water.</li>
            <li> This product cleans my eyelids with little fuss and it is easy to use! I would recommend it highly. Excellent product and service! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Gave this to my wife and she was unhappy with the size of the pads.</li>
            <li> If you need a product like this I guess it is okay.  My optometrist recommended using baby shampoo and that worked okay for me. Nothing wrong with it I just didn&#x27;t see where it worked better than the baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> good price/quality and fast service</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from chronic Blepharitis and dry eyes for years and years. I would also get a Chalazion every year due to build up of oils that could not escape due to blocked ducts. The doctors would always recommend heating packs everyday and cleaning the eyelids with baby shampoo. I had tried that but even baby shampoo used to cause some irritation. At my last visit, however, the doctor gave me a sample of OcuSOFT&#x27;s eyelid cleaner (the prepackaged tissue). I tried that and although it is &#x27;soapy&#x27; it did not cause any irritation. After that I bought a box of the wipes and recently the kit. I now use warm compress to warm the eyelids and then I use the OcuSOFT wipes to thoroughly clean the eyelids. I am doing this at least once every two days, although everyday is better. The results have been great and my eyes feel healthier, cleaner and brighter! I am also taking a mild antibiotic so that may be helping as well, but in general, the everyday discomfort I would feel with dirtier eyelids is now gone. I highly recommend the OcuSOFT eyelid cleaner. You can try the wipes or the kit, and see which may work better for you. The important thing is that the cleaning liquid (which is the same) does not irritate the eyes and it really does promote cleaner and healthier eyes. Good luck!</li>
            <li> For my mother. This was recommended by her eye doctor.  She leaves the solution in the shower, and cleans her lids then.</li>
            <li> Very moist and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like the pre moistened pads better but these work.</li>
            <li> The special cloths that come with this kit really help when your eyelash  area is really dry and needs extra cleaning.  We order this especially in the winter when the blephartis seems to be worse.  Otherwise we order just the lid scrub only.</li>
            <li> Helpful product which I use regularly.</li>
            <li> Cost is less than individual foil packs. Found squares of paper towel (cut to size) and small amount of baby shampoo works was well at fraction of cost.</li>
