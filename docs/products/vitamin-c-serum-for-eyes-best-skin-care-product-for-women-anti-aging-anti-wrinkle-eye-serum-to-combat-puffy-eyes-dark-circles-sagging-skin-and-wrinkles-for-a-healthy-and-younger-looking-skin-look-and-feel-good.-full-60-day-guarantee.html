            <li>I loved the fact that it didn&#x27;t really have any fragrance to it and it seemed to work great on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>But it dries easily and feels moist rather than gooey.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, not sticky feeling &amp;</li>

            <li>It is a great product and it has exactly the same result!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, as you don&#x27;t have to stick your finger in a tub, as with most other eye creams.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for alternative products to the expensive cosmetic ones out there - this product fit the bill perfectly!</li>

            <li>Short and sweet.  </li>

            <li>This vitamin C serum for around the eyes from Elle Avi is non-irritating and is very compatible with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a pale yellow color, a slightly viscous consistency, and a pleasant, slightly sweet</li>
            <li>This serum helped blend those lines in and was very sensitive.  </li>

            <li>I went back to my old product and threw away the Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It should be applied twice a day by gently massaging it into the skin around the eyes after bathing or cleansing the face, but be careful to keep it out of the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I put a little on my ring finger then gently pat it all around my eyes morning and nights.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using long enough for my puffy eyes</li>
            <li> like this serum and hope to be using it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> This goes on with a creamy feel, so it seems that it would stay wet on the skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not the residue one might have expected after application.</li>
            <li> It can also be used at the corners of the mouth;  again, be careful to keep it out of the mouth.  </li>
            <li> I tend to press harder on the cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> When the skin brightens up due to collagen production, it also reduces discoloration.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthier and less saggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> Now to get it going on my dark circles!  </li>
            <li> Unless you are masochistic, it does hurts on some parts of the face as it is hard to maintain always an even stroke.</li>

            <li> It feels so soothing for tired eyes.  </li>

            <li> I have been given a sample of the vitamin C serum and was very impressed with the results. Used it for a couple of days and could see the fine lines around my eyes dissapear. The bags under my eyes also seemed to be not so prominent. It is very easy to use, as you don&#x27;t have to stick your finger in a tub, as with most other eye creams. Definately a product to use</li>
            <li> i love this. i love the feel it gives around my eye area, very good product</li>
            <li> Short and sweet.  I tried this product for a couple of weeks every day.  When a customer at work commented that I looked tired (and I wasn&#x27;t), I decided &amp;#34;that was it&#x27;.  I went back to my old product and threw away the Vitamin C serum.  I haven&#x27;t had any comments like that since then.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for alternative products to the expensive cosmetic ones out there - this product fit the bill perfectly! It is a great product and it has exactly the same result! will buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few vitamin C eye serums and this one works the best for my sensitive skin. It moisturizes and tones fine lines much better than its competitors. A+!</li>
            <li> This goes on with a creamy feel, so it seems that it would stay wet on the skin. But it dries easily and feels moist rather than gooey. There&#x27;s not the residue one might have expected after application. Rather, It&#x27;s a pleasing sensation that neither clogs nor goops up the skin. So. this is a product worth recommending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. My wife tried this out and I report her review on this product I was asked to test.</li>
            <li> I live a high stress lifestyle, and because of that I get fine lines around my eyes from stress.  This serum helped blend those lines in and was very sensitive.  I did notice a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; feeling when I put this on but it was comforting.  Overall, this is a really great product.</li>
            <li> Love it! I love the cool feeling when I use this under my eyes.  It feels so soothing for tired eyes.  I haven&#x27;t been using long enough for my puffy eyes but I swear my eyes don&#x27;t look so baggy.  Now to get it going on my dark circles!  There is no scent to irritate your eyes either.  This bottle will last forever and the cost is so much better than the &amp;#34;magazine -advertised&amp;#34; Vitamin C serum.  Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> i have used this for almost 2 weeks now an i must say it does work.</li>
            <li> not greasy...so far I like it</li>
            <li> I am 40.  Yes, 40.  And my crows feet are prominent now.  Ugh!!  I have tried this serum and it seems to brighten up the skin and have it appear more healthy and vibrant.    [[ASIN:B00DIGE3EW Pure Vitamin C Serum for Eyes, Skin Brightening. Anti-puffiness, Best Anti-aging, Anti-wrinkle, Instant-lift Solution Benefits for Your Skin Care - Protect Your Skin - 30 Day Money Back Guarantee]]    I combined it with this product and wow, it helps with the crows feet and wrinkles and brightness.    It is a great combination that i recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery as ALWAYS. My eyes look refreshed after using the eye serum. I put a little on my ring finger then gently pat it all around my eyes morning and nights. I have hooded Eyes so this helps lift my upper eyelids.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Nice product. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week &amp; it appears to be helping with my puffiness &amp; circles. It is easy to apply, not sticky feeling &amp; I like that it and/or its fragrance doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes at all. I&#x27;ve tried some eye serums that were terrible for that.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum for around the eyes from Elle Avi is non-irritating and is very compatible with sensitive skin.

            <li> This is the first time I tried a topical vitamin C.  I don&#x27;t need any moisturizer on my face so it was relatively easy for me to use.  According to Dr. Oz, a topical vitamin C for use around the eyes should contain 3% to 10% of vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this serum once per day at nighty and applied around the eyes.  I think this is a commonly recommended way to use it.  One of the advantages to this serum is that it stimulates production of collagen.  That makes the skin look more plump and it increases its elasticity.  When the skin brightens up due to collagen production, it also reduces discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this serum and hope to be using it for a long time.  Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> The wife loves it. She&#x27;s got me hooked on to it. She applies it around the eye area and around her lips as a pre-emptive strike agains wrinkles. At night, she follows up with her emu or argon oils to wake up to a fresh skin. This is a quality Eye serum. Vitamin C brightens the skin and works as an antioxidant.</li>
            <li> The product is impressive.  Continuous use does show improvement.</li>
            <li> I have using the derma roller for a month now. In conjunction I am also applying this serum, not only around the eyes but on the cheeks and forehead. Unless you are masochistic, it does hurts on some parts of the face as it is hard to maintain always an even stroke. I tend to press harder on the cheeks and forehead. Applying the serum is an immediate relief. The cold and gel like consistency eases the pain at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination is bringing some noticeable results. I do it around 2 to three times a week. My skin looks healthier and less saggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
            <li> The serum has a very silky feeling when using it. I loved the fact that it didn&#x27;t really have any fragrance to it and it seemed to work great on my sensitive skin! My skin feels and looks smoother around my eyes. Luckily, I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles yet - I&#x27;m hoping to be proactively tackling aging skin by starting early!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received in exchange for honest review*</li>
            <li> I have no wrinkles yet so I am trying to prevent them and this feels so good and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> It caused my eyes to water and get red after applying it. I won&#x27;t buy this again. I better off taking liquid Vitamin C</li>
