            <li>It leaves a great slickness to your skin</li>
            <li>Shaving cream soap is a great descriptor for this product.</li>
            <li>great lubrication and substantial lather that helps keep the whiskers moisturized (to soften them) and helps support the whiskers allowing the razor blade to get at them.    </li>
            <li>LOL, Do you know how to shave?</li>
            <li>Great smelling.</li>
            <li>Lubricates the beard, makes for a great shave, but the smell is addicting.  </li>

            <li>This is great soap.  </li>
            <li>Happy</li>
            <li>He says it gives him a great shave also.</li>
            <li>Smells and feels great until the burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>Cella is a truly great Soap and staple in my shave den.  </li>
            <li>The scent is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many shaving soaps and creams and Cella is the very best you&#x27;ll find.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product that I will gladly buy again.  </li>
            <li>It produces a great lather and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The after shave feeling is also good.    </li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>At around $2 per ounce, it is a good value .</li>
            <li>A good lather that lets the razor glide across the face.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>When lathering, it is recommended that you face lather, but bowl lathering is just as good IMO.  </li>
            <li>but it just isn&#x27;t quite as good (TO ME) as the Cella.</li>
            <li>Got it as a gift for my boyfriend, and it smells soooo good.</li>
            <li>Good smell</li>
            <li>This is a nice mild soap with a very great almond scent.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Top marks!</li>
            <li>Easy to lather with great slickness.  </li>
            <li>Use your favorite aftershave if you want to smell good.</li>
            <li>lmao.</li>
            <li>Smells like almonds, and gives a nice lather.  </li>
            <li>It makes spectacular lather effortlessly and it leaves your face nicely moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Nice cherry/almond scent.</li>
            <li>I liked the slickness and cushion of the lather but the smell was overpowering.</li>
            <li>It is a reasonably priced, excellent shave cream/soap.  </li>
            <li>I use  it often and would recommend it to anyone who want&#x27;s a nice smelling lather to shave with.</li>
            <li>Provides for a nice shave.  </li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic and the shave is also very nice.  </li>
            <li>Great for women looking for a soap for themselves, or for their significant others.</li>
            <li>Some of the best shaving soap i have ever used, decent price too.</li>
            <li>Its excellent, smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a very pleasant almond smell in the tub, but once the lather develops it really strays from the almond scent.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great for a quick touch up between lathers and shaving passes with a DE razor.</li>
            <li>nice texture makes for a smooth shave!</li>
            <li>you will get a close perfect shave with ANY blade, even a 10-day old blade..</li>
            <li>The best shave soap I have used by far.</li>
            <li>The best lather I ever got from a can was Nivea sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It produces a good rich lather.</li>
            <li>Great product and exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>This would be a great soap to start out with because it is inexpensive and of a higher quality.  </li>
            <li>, you need to work your brush very lightly while working up a lather</li>
            <li>If I were you, I would run over to Badger and Blade and look up some very good information on lathering soft soaps like these.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this soap.</li>
            <li>I read your review and it sounded like you just rubbed the soap on your face which is hilarious</li>
            <li>My latest theory is that almost all boutique shaving creams contain lye (potassium or sodium hydroxide), and though the soap and cream manufacturers claim that the lye is removed during the manufacturing process, my face would argue otherwise.</li>
            <li>This is top notch stuff</li>
            <li>I truly love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK....</li>
            <li>Cella has given me nothing, but an enjoyable shave.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of the almond/amaretto and the performance is top notch.  </li>
            <li>This soap has been around for over 100 years and will probably be around for 100 more.  </li>
            <li>Had one of the better shaves using this product.</li>
            <li>and once you work it gets a good lather and offers good protection, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>It should stand up to the most aggressive razor/blade combination.  </li>
            <li>Yes, Cella is, indeed, a marvelous product that puts the merely serviceable Williams and Van der Hagen soaps to shame with its lathering, lubricating, and moisturizing properties, not to mention the delightfully confectionary almond smell that it exudes.</li>
            <li>This turns the act of shaving into a feast for the senses, rather than a humdrum chore, which in turn, causes me to pay closer attention to my shaving technique, and that results in a better shave and healthier skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent, for me, was just ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better soaps.</li>
            <li>It seems that stiffer brushes work better with soaps.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shaving soap.</li>
            <li>This happens more with stiffer brushes.</li>
            <li>Lathers great provides good protection but leaves my skin dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had in a long time and great smell too!</li>
            <li>I lathers up quickly, holds it lather, and does a great job right up until the finish.  </li>
            <li>But with the boarbrush and the Cella soap I am getting an even thicker rich lather!</li>
            <li>and it offers great protection while shaving.    </li>
            <li>The slickness and protection is very adequate and lets you shave without irritation.</li>
            <li>Leathers easily.</li>
            <li>The blade glides easily across my face w/o any razor burn.</li>
            <li>Lathers easily and fully.  </li>
            <li>You probably heard it  has a strong scent of marzipan and also cherry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>This has the best fragrance in a shaving soap hands down.</li>
            <li>The lather is a fine lather that coats well.</li>
            <li>It smells like a cheap hand soap, lethers like hand soap, feels like hand soap.</li>
            <li>I still got that cheap soapy smell in my nose )))  </li>
            <li>and I also had to stop using the Van Der Hagen shaving soap available at the nation&#x27;s premier discount store.</li>
            <li>Cella is a fantastic shaving soap.</li>
            <li>almond scent is a bit light.  </li>
            <li>By the way, I have found Italian shaving soaps to have been of great quality (Razorock, ex.).</li>
            <li>My fave feels smooth and hydrated when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li>The scent is great though, but I&#x27;m going back to creams.</li>
            <li>That soap smelled cheap.  </li>
            <li>I was hopeful with this one, as it was recommended by a friend and it had such great reviews online.</li>
            <li>The lather is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Also a smaller container making it great for travel.</li>
            <li>It is a good product and I would place it in my next to the top tier.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is very good shaving soap.</li>
            <li>but I noticed this had a strong sweet almond scent to it.</li>
            <li>Decent shaving cream with a nice cherry almond scent.</li>
            <li>For a close shave I also like the &#x27;Original Proraso&#x27;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s because of the almond oil.</li>
            <li>It provides a good lather and the hard plastic is good for travelling.</li>
            <li>Lubricates well and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>When the blade meets the face it provided good lubrication and glide and left my face smooth and not irritated.</li>
            <li>I like how long it&#x27;s lasted and how easy it is to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>Looking for a gift for that special someone?</li>
            <li>It is so superior to any shaving cream, lotion, or soap, that I can&#x27;t bear to go back to Prorasso</li>
            <li>However, while I will admit it is a bit sweet, I do not find it at all overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To Sweet</li>
            <li>Smells sweet</li>
            <li>I had very watery lather the first time and the shave was still pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The subtle, delightful almond fragrance is a plus.  </li>
            <li>For this price I will most likely be buying cases upon cases of this stuff. :)</li>
            <li>I have been using the super badger for some time and like it with the soap, but I decide to pick up a quality boar hair out of curiosity.</li>
            <li>than the Nivea or the Cella with the super badger.  </li>
            <li>Mild aroma that doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li>My first soap was a cheap Walmart soap.  </li>
            <li>Cella would also make a good long term soap.  </li>
            <li>fast and easy foam lather</li>
            <li>The soap lathers easily, but I found that it dries my skin too much to really be usable.</li>
            <li>A large (1000g) block is available for refills</li>
            <li>Easy to lather, very slick, great fragrance and no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>But it is absolutely buttery smooth.</li>
            <li>Why pay a fortune for some ingredients that are, at best, unnecessary ?</li>
            <li>This could be a Best badger or a well broken in boar brush.  </li>
            <li>So far I really love it.</li>
            <li>It effectively buffers my skin as the Voskhod blade&#x27;s unyielding Russian steel cleaves through my stubble.</li>
            <li>Good container that can be reused for other soaps.</li>
            <li>Just like other shaving soaps, you should use a good brush to develop a lather.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is heavenly, the rich amaretto fragrance is really a pleasure to use, I would have to equate to a marzipan or cherry like.  </li>
            <li>I feel right now</li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>Amazing, great subtle cherry almond sent, this is your special occasion soap right here, will definitely order again</li>
            <li>Lathers very easy and lasts for multiple passes.</li>
            <li>I have a super badger brush and my brother has a pure badger.  </li>
            <li>A boar hair, pure badger, or super badger brushes are probably better than a silver tip badger, but a lot of people really prefer the soft silver tip brush and you can mix up lather with them.  </li>
            <li>I know that part of the problem is that I don&#x27;t have soft water, but I have had great success with other soaps and creams, but this one doesn&#x27;t work quite as well.</li>
            <li>I really like Cella for a comfortable shave with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oct 1---A lot of folk really like to use a badger shave brush, and I will admit that the softer bristles are nice, but as I mention above a stiffer brush can work well with soaps.  </li>
            <li>I also like that the container screws shut tightly, which is good for travel.</li>
            <li>The lubricity is good...just be sure to use enough water.</li>
            <li>The was the first time</li>
            <li>, it costs way more than the generic bar soaps like Van Der Hagen or Williams, but this 5.3 oz.</li>
            <li>The packing says almond, but it&#x27;s more like cherry mixed with almonds to me.</li>
            <li>Buy it and enjoy a nice and slick lather.</li>
            <li>Firstly, ignore the 1-star review on this product.  </li>
            <li>I would have given it a higher rating.</li>
            <li>First, I love the fragrance somewhat reminiscent of marzipan.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay, but not very manly, as my girlfriend quickly pointed out.  </li>
            <li>it is the same, make sure to really load the brush and make sure you are using enough water.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve got to get the right soap to water ratio and mix it with a decent brush.  </li>
            <li>Note that like most shaving soaps the scent is not meant to, and indeed does not, linger for long after the shave.</li>
            <li>First, I would like to say that I really like the scent of almonds in my soaps and shaving creams.  </li>
            <li>It has a great smell due to the sweet almond oil in it and lubricates well due to the tallow and coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Classic tallow-based, lathers easily on your face, is buttery smooth and washes off easily, does not leave any perfume behind.</li>
            <li>It is a rather soft soap, thus a little tricky to find the good water-soap ratio.  </li>
            <li>It is not as hard as most soaps and not as soft as most creams.</li>
            <li>It does not take much to really foam up and lather you face.</li>
            <li>Product was shipped fast as always.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I had High Hopes For this Soap!</li>
            <li>soap produces a beard lifting and drying quality that gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>soap is very almond-y scented when you take a whiff from the jar.  </li>
            <li>it really was like using hand soap.  </li>
            <li>the I feel the lubrication is minimal because I got way more nicks and cuts with it than any shaving soap/cream I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Think about what you&#x27;ve been putting on your face, and then pay the money for real ingredients.</li>
            <li>having some difficulties getting it to lather really well, but I suppose that will take practice.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying this product.</li>
            <li>You could take it out of the container and move it to something else easy enough as the consistency is like a soft soap(playdoh).</li>
            <li>having it&#x27;s own container, but the tub is too small</li>
            <li>I also find that I need to add a little more water to my scuttle to see the lather really explode.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different types of shave creams and this is one of the better one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have been soap and brush shaving for years and have tried numerous products, mostly what I could find locally.  </li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s what I have, got it from The ItalianBarber, super-fresh product), since some say that the formulation is slightly different (better) that the one in the red tub..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying out shaving soaps and this lathers up just as well, maybe better, than a number of the more expensive soaps.  </li>
            <li>The silver tip is the softest and the super is a middle soft/stiff badger brush.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>IMHO I would have to say it is a little over rated across the Amazon reviews, as well as many shave forums.</li>
            <li>Very easy to create a nice thick slick lather.</li>
            <li>A great shave does not have to be expensive.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and works very well to help the blade slide across your face.</li>
            <li>Last weekend I tried some old Barbasol I had in my medicine cabinet and the Barbasol actually did a better job.</li>
            <li>I mean really amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll lather up the right side of my face with one product, clean the brush and lather up the other side with my current champion.</li>
            <li>Shave with this Soap Was a Complete Disaster!</li>
            <li>I am currently testing another product but until the results are final there are only 3 products in the top tier for me.</li>
            <li>This product is 150g in a very useful and tightly sealed container.</li>
            <li>last, I understand why shave soap manufacturers and wet shaving enthusiasts tend to put so much emphasis on appealingly scented soaps; what I had previously deemed effete is, in fact, a very pragmatic consideration.</li>
            <li>It was very disappointing, since I really like the scent and heard much about what a great soap it was.  </li>
            <li>Although it is called a cream it is more like a hard putty.</li>
            <li>Your up front costs may be higher, but in the long run you will save money over your old cartridge razor and I have never had closer shaves.</li>
            <li>but I am liking it so far.  </li>
            <li>Soapy almond smell, almost reminds me of the old school bathroom soap as a kid.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin too, and this didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>Not too soft or creamy in texture.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin give it a shot.</li>
            <li>Plus the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>I have noticed with soft soap as this is</li>
            <li>Beware if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do this for a week which will include day old stubble to sometimes 3 day old growth.</li>
            <li>I found it difficult to get a good lather and, even when I did, the protection I need wasn&#x27;t there.  </li>
            <li>So if you are having any difficulty with the lather, try using a little more product and dripping in some extra water, you will know when you have it right when the later suddenly takes off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lather is so easy to build and the shaves are slick.  </li>
            <li>This did not perform according to that high standard, rather the lather was fluffy and light.  </li>
            <li>Provided a nice rich and thick lather that was very slick.</li>
            <li>The next day I&#x27;ll switch sides and do the champion first and the challenger second, to even things out.</li>
            <li>Classic italian shave soap.  </li>
            <li>The biggest issue was that I have sensitive skin and after my first shave with this, my face was on fire for 2 hours, something that hadn&#x27;t happened with any other soap.</li>
            <li>Soap lathers well, and I don&#x27;t need to start with much soap on my brush to allow for a third or even a fourth application.</li>
            <li>[Note #2:  The Cella shaving cream is considerably cheaper than the Taylor of Old Bond Street soap, but I like to alternate between the two.]</li>
            <li>Scent was a little confusing at first because it says almond scent on the packaging, but it smelled to me more like cherry.  </li>
            <li>They are better than any other soaps I have used,not by a little bit rather a country mile.</li>
            <li>I thought it a little strange at first -- it&#x27;s really soft for a soap and really heavy and tacky for a cream, but it loaded and lathered really easily.</li>
            <li>Somehow it didn&#x27;t clear the stubble as effectively as the other three and therefore required additional strokes, never a good thing.</li>
            <li>this is a soft soap not a traditional cream</li>
            <li>I could barely smell the almond scent.</li>
            <li>I tried cella, and I like it a lot so much that I went ahead and ordered 1kg brick that will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li>Lathers quickly and provides a slick protective coating for wet-shavers.</li>
            <li>A wet brush will load very quickly as this is not truly a soap but a a soft soap or a hard cream (AKA croap).    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the smell other than pleasant but not strong.</li>
            <li>loading the brush with lather is kinda of small making it not as much fun.</li>
            <li>Nice thick slick lather for close shave.</li>
            <li>Cleans off easy without any residue being left behind.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My boar hair is incredible with this Cella soap.  </li>
            <li> Great marzipan scent and lathers wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> It is nonetheless a very pleasant smell and has a great feel to it.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a great slickness to your skin</li>
            <li> Shaving cream soap is a great descriptor for this product.</li>
            <li> great lubrication and substantial lather that helps keep the whiskers moisturized (to soften them) and helps support the whiskers allowing the razor blade to get at them.    </li>
            <li> LOL, Do you know how to shave?</li>
            <li> Great smelling.</li>
            <li> Lubricates the beard, makes for a great shave, but the smell is addicting.  </li>
            <li> : smells great 2:</li>
            <li> Bellezz does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great lather and scent.</li>

            <li> GREAT.  </li>
            <li> Those guys give great advice, some of which I just shared with</li>
            <li> Great stuff, buy it.</li>
            <li> Lathers and shaves great.</li>
            <li> This is great soap.  </li>
            <li> Happy</li>
            <li> He says it gives him a great shave also.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great until the burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> Cella is a truly great Soap and staple in my shave den.  </li>
            <li> The scent is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many shaving soaps and creams and Cella is the very best you&#x27;ll find.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good product that I will gladly buy again.  </li>
            <li> It produces a great lather and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> The after shave feeling is also good.    </li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> At around $2 per ounce, it is a good value .</li>
            <li> A good lather that lets the razor glide across the face.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> When lathering, it is recommended that you face lather, but bowl lathering is just as good IMO.  </li>
            <li> but it just isn&#x27;t quite as good (TO ME) as the Cella.</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for my boyfriend, and it smells soooo good.</li>
            <li> Good smell</li>
            <li> This is a nice mild soap with a very great almond scent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Top marks!</li>
            <li> Easy to lather with great slickness.  </li>
            <li> Use your favorite aftershave if you want to smell good.</li>
            <li> lmao.</li>
            <li> Smells like almonds, and gives a nice lather.  </li>
            <li> It makes spectacular lather effortlessly and it leaves your face nicely moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Nice cherry/almond scent.</li>
            <li> I liked the slickness and cushion of the lather but the smell was overpowering.</li>
            <li> It is a reasonably priced, excellent shave cream/soap.  </li>
            <li> I use  it often and would recommend it to anyone who want&#x27;s a nice smelling lather to shave with.</li>
            <li> Provides for a nice shave.  </li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic and the shave is also very nice.  </li>
            <li> Great for women looking for a soap for themselves, or for their significant others.</li>
            <li> Some of the best shaving soap i have ever used, decent price too.</li>
            <li> Its excellent, smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a very pleasant almond smell in the tub, but once the lather develops it really strays from the almond scent.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great for a quick touch up between lathers and shaving passes with a DE razor.</li>
            <li> nice texture makes for a smooth shave!</li>
            <li> you will get a close perfect shave with ANY blade, even a 10-day old blade..</li>
            <li> The best shave soap I have used by far.</li>
            <li> The best lather I ever got from a can was Nivea sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It produces a good rich lather.</li>
            <li> Great product and exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> This would be a great soap to start out with because it is inexpensive and of a higher quality.  </li>
            <li> , you need to work your brush very lightly while working up a lather</li>
            <li> If I were you, I would run over to Badger and Blade and look up some very good information on lathering soft soaps like these.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap.</li>
            <li> I read your review and it sounded like you just rubbed the soap on your face which is hilarious</li>
            <li> My latest theory is that almost all boutique shaving creams contain lye (potassium or sodium hydroxide), and though the soap and cream manufacturers claim that the lye is removed during the manufacturing process, my face would argue otherwise.</li>
            <li> This is top notch stuff</li>
            <li> I truly love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK....</li>
            <li> Cella has given me nothing, but an enjoyable shave.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the almond/amaretto and the performance is top notch.  </li>
            <li> This soap has been around for over 100 years and will probably be around for 100 more.  </li>
            <li> Had one of the better shaves using this product.</li>
            <li> and once you work it gets a good lather and offers good protection, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> It should stand up to the most aggressive razor/blade combination.  </li>
            <li> Yes, Cella is, indeed, a marvelous product that puts the merely serviceable Williams and Van der Hagen soaps to shame with its lathering, lubricating, and moisturizing properties, not to mention the delightfully confectionary almond smell that it exudes.</li>
            <li> This turns the act of shaving into a feast for the senses, rather than a humdrum chore, which in turn, causes me to pay closer attention to my shaving technique, and that results in a better shave and healthier skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent, for me, was just ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better soaps.</li>
            <li> It seems that stiffer brushes work better with soaps.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shaving soap.</li>
            <li> This happens more with stiffer brushes.</li>
            <li> Lathers great provides good protection but leaves my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had in a long time and great smell too!</li>
            <li> I lathers up quickly, holds it lather, and does a great job right up until the finish.  </li>
            <li> But with the boarbrush and the Cella soap I am getting an even thicker rich lather!</li>
            <li> and it offers great protection while shaving.    </li>
            <li> The slickness and protection is very adequate and lets you shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> Leathers easily.</li>
            <li> The blade glides easily across my face w/o any razor burn.</li>
            <li> Lathers easily and fully.  </li>
            <li> You probably heard it  has a strong scent of marzipan and also cherry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> This has the best fragrance in a shaving soap hands down.</li>
            <li> The lather is a fine lather that coats well.</li>
            <li> It smells like a cheap hand soap, lethers like hand soap, feels like hand soap.</li>
            <li> I still got that cheap soapy smell in my nose )))  </li>
            <li> and I also had to stop using the Van Der Hagen shaving soap available at the nation&#x27;s premier discount store.</li>
            <li> Cella is a fantastic shaving soap.</li>
            <li> almond scent is a bit light.  </li>
            <li> By the way, I have found Italian shaving soaps to have been of great quality (Razorock, ex.).</li>
            <li> My fave feels smooth and hydrated when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> The scent is great though, but I&#x27;m going back to creams.</li>
            <li> That soap smelled cheap.  </li>
            <li> I was hopeful with this one, as it was recommended by a friend and it had such great reviews online.</li>
            <li> The lather is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Also a smaller container making it great for travel.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and I would place it in my next to the top tier.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is very good shaving soap.</li>
            <li> but I noticed this had a strong sweet almond scent to it.</li>
            <li> Decent shaving cream with a nice cherry almond scent.</li>
            <li> For a close shave I also like the &#x27;Original Proraso&#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s because of the almond oil.</li>
            <li> It provides a good lather and the hard plastic is good for travelling.</li>
            <li> Lubricates well and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> When the blade meets the face it provided good lubrication and glide and left my face smooth and not irritated.</li>
            <li> I like how long it&#x27;s lasted and how easy it is to get a good lather.</li>
            <li> Looking for a gift for that special someone?</li>
            <li> It is so superior to any shaving cream, lotion, or soap, that I can&#x27;t bear to go back to Prorasso</li>
            <li> However, while I will admit it is a bit sweet, I do not find it at all overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To Sweet</li>
            <li> Smells sweet</li>
            <li> I had very watery lather the first time and the shave was still pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The subtle, delightful almond fragrance is a plus.  </li>
            <li> For this price I will most likely be buying cases upon cases of this stuff. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using the super badger for some time and like it with the soap, but I decide to pick up a quality boar hair out of curiosity.</li>
            <li> than the Nivea or the Cella with the super badger.  </li>
            <li> Mild aroma that doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li> My first soap was a cheap Walmart soap.  </li>
            <li> Cella would also make a good long term soap.  </li>
            <li> fast and easy foam lather</li>
            <li> The soap lathers easily, but I found that it dries my skin too much to really be usable.</li>
            <li> A large (1000g) block is available for refills</li>
            <li> Easy to lather, very slick, great fragrance and no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> But it is absolutely buttery smooth.</li>
            <li> Why pay a fortune for some ingredients that are, at best, unnecessary ?</li>
            <li> This could be a Best badger or a well broken in boar brush.  </li>
            <li> So far I really love it.</li>
            <li> It effectively buffers my skin as the Voskhod blade&#x27;s unyielding Russian steel cleaves through my stubble.</li>
            <li> Good container that can be reused for other soaps.</li>
            <li> Just like other shaving soaps, you should use a good brush to develop a lather.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is heavenly, the rich amaretto fragrance is really a pleasure to use, I would have to equate to a marzipan or cherry like.  </li>
            <li> I feel right now</li>
            <li> Priced right.</li>
            <li> Amazing, great subtle cherry almond sent, this is your special occasion soap right here, will definitely order again</li>
            <li> Lathers very easy and lasts for multiple passes.</li>
            <li> I have a super badger brush and my brother has a pure badger.  </li>
            <li> A boar hair, pure badger, or super badger brushes are probably better than a silver tip badger, but a lot of people really prefer the soft silver tip brush and you can mix up lather with them.  </li>
            <li> I know that part of the problem is that I don&#x27;t have soft water, but I have had great success with other soaps and creams, but this one doesn&#x27;t work quite as well.</li>
            <li> I really like Cella for a comfortable shave with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oct 1---A lot of folk really like to use a badger shave brush, and I will admit that the softer bristles are nice, but as I mention above a stiffer brush can work well with soaps.  </li>
            <li> I also like that the container screws shut tightly, which is good for travel.</li>
            <li> The lubricity is good...just be sure to use enough water.</li>
            <li> The was the first time</li>
            <li> , it costs way more than the generic bar soaps like Van Der Hagen or Williams, but this 5.3 oz.</li>
            <li> The packing says almond, but it&#x27;s more like cherry mixed with almonds to me.</li>
            <li> Buy it and enjoy a nice and slick lather.</li>
            <li> Firstly, ignore the 1-star review on this product.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> First, I love the fragrance somewhat reminiscent of marzipan.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay, but not very manly, as my girlfriend quickly pointed out.  </li>
            <li> it is the same, make sure to really load the brush and make sure you are using enough water.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got to get the right soap to water ratio and mix it with a decent brush.  </li>
            <li> Note that like most shaving soaps the scent is not meant to, and indeed does not, linger for long after the shave.</li>
            <li> First, I would like to say that I really like the scent of almonds in my soaps and shaving creams.  </li>
            <li> It has a great smell due to the sweet almond oil in it and lubricates well due to the tallow and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Classic tallow-based, lathers easily on your face, is buttery smooth and washes off easily, does not leave any perfume behind.</li>
            <li> It is a rather soft soap, thus a little tricky to find the good water-soap ratio.  </li>
            <li> It is not as hard as most soaps and not as soft as most creams.</li>
            <li> It does not take much to really foam up and lather you face.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped fast as always.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I had High Hopes For this Soap!</li>
            <li> soap produces a beard lifting and drying quality that gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> soap is very almond-y scented when you take a whiff from the jar.  </li>
            <li> it really was like using hand soap.  </li>
            <li> the I feel the lubrication is minimal because I got way more nicks and cuts with it than any shaving soap/cream I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Think about what you&#x27;ve been putting on your face, and then pay the money for real ingredients.</li>
            <li> having some difficulties getting it to lather really well, but I suppose that will take practice.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for carrying this product.</li>
            <li> You could take it out of the container and move it to something else easy enough as the consistency is like a soft soap(playdoh).</li>
            <li> having it&#x27;s own container, but the tub is too small</li>
            <li> I also find that I need to add a little more water to my scuttle to see the lather really explode.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different types of shave creams and this is one of the better one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have been soap and brush shaving for years and have tried numerous products, mostly what I could find locally.  </li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s what I have, got it from The ItalianBarber, super-fresh product), since some say that the formulation is slightly different (better) that the one in the red tub..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out shaving soaps and this lathers up just as well, maybe better, than a number of the more expensive soaps.  </li>
            <li> The silver tip is the softest and the super is a middle soft/stiff badger brush.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> IMHO I would have to say it is a little over rated across the Amazon reviews, as well as many shave forums.</li>
            <li> Very easy to create a nice thick slick lather.</li>
            <li> A great shave does not have to be expensive.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft and works very well to help the blade slide across your face.</li>
            <li> Last weekend I tried some old Barbasol I had in my medicine cabinet and the Barbasol actually did a better job.</li>
            <li> I mean really amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll lather up the right side of my face with one product, clean the brush and lather up the other side with my current champion.</li>
            <li> Shave with this Soap Was a Complete Disaster!</li>
            <li> I am currently testing another product but until the results are final there are only 3 products in the top tier for me.</li>
            <li> This product is 150g in a very useful and tightly sealed container.</li>
            <li> last, I understand why shave soap manufacturers and wet shaving enthusiasts tend to put so much emphasis on appealingly scented soaps; what I had previously deemed effete is, in fact, a very pragmatic consideration.</li>
            <li> It was very disappointing, since I really like the scent and heard much about what a great soap it was.  </li>
            <li> Although it is called a cream it is more like a hard putty.</li>
            <li> Your up front costs may be higher, but in the long run you will save money over your old cartridge razor and I have never had closer shaves.</li>
            <li> but I am liking it so far.  </li>
            <li> Soapy almond smell, almost reminds me of the old school bathroom soap as a kid.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin too, and this didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> Not too soft or creamy in texture.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Plus the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> I have noticed with soft soap as this is</li>
            <li> Beware if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do this for a week which will include day old stubble to sometimes 3 day old growth.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to get a good lather and, even when I did, the protection I need wasn&#x27;t there.  </li>
            <li> So if you are having any difficulty with the lather, try using a little more product and dripping in some extra water, you will know when you have it right when the later suddenly takes off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lather is so easy to build and the shaves are slick.  </li>
            <li> This did not perform according to that high standard, rather the lather was fluffy and light.  </li>
            <li> Provided a nice rich and thick lather that was very slick.</li>
            <li> The next day I&#x27;ll switch sides and do the champion first and the challenger second, to even things out.</li>
            <li> Classic italian shave soap.  </li>
            <li> The biggest issue was that I have sensitive skin and after my first shave with this, my face was on fire for 2 hours, something that hadn&#x27;t happened with any other soap.</li>
            <li> Soap lathers well, and I don&#x27;t need to start with much soap on my brush to allow for a third or even a fourth application.</li>
            <li> [Note #2:  The Cella shaving cream is considerably cheaper than the Taylor of Old Bond Street soap, but I like to alternate between the two.]</li>
            <li> Scent was a little confusing at first because it says almond scent on the packaging, but it smelled to me more like cherry.  </li>
            <li> They are better than any other soaps I have used,not by a little bit rather a country mile.</li>
            <li> I thought it a little strange at first -- it&#x27;s really soft for a soap and really heavy and tacky for a cream, but it loaded and lathered really easily.</li>
            <li> Somehow it didn&#x27;t clear the stubble as effectively as the other three and therefore required additional strokes, never a good thing.</li>
            <li> this is a soft soap not a traditional cream</li>
            <li> I could barely smell the almond scent.</li>
            <li> I tried cella, and I like it a lot so much that I went ahead and ordered 1kg brick that will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> Lathers quickly and provides a slick protective coating for wet-shavers.</li>
            <li> A wet brush will load very quickly as this is not truly a soap but a a soft soap or a hard cream (AKA croap).    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the smell other than pleasant but not strong.</li>
            <li> loading the brush with lather is kinda of small making it not as much fun.</li>
            <li> Nice thick slick lather for close shave.</li>
            <li> Cleans off easy without any residue being left behind.</li>
            <li> #34;It is not suitable for sensitive skin&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I may be somewhat the exception since virtually every high-end shaving cream or soap burns my facial skin.(Cella is particularly offensive).</li>
            <li> [Note: The other is by Taylor of Old Bond Street.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li> Cella has a fresh almond scent, which is not overwhelming and dissipates so that it does not conflict with other aftershaves or colognes.  </li>
            <li> This left the blade to drag across my face without proper lubricating properties.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a difficult review to write as Cella has a huge following in the wet shaving</li>
            <li> I will use this shaving cream as long as I can get it.....</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long before I realized I needed to stop using my synthetic bristle brush (I replaced it with a badger brush)</li>
            <li> I can also reuse the empty container for a different shaving soap while travelling.</li>
            <li> and it will be in my cabinet for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li> It does lather a bit differently than other soft soaps, so take the time with your brush and load a little longer than you may otherwise.  </li>
            <li> Proraso for me was little too strong/too mentholy, almost to make me not want to use it everyday, but cella has more subtle scent to it.  </li>
            <li> I was told on B&amp;B that the soap is easier to lather if you use a brush that is stiff, but with soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> , I prefer something that is a little bigger to hold when I am creating my lather or trying to get enough soap on my brush.</li>
            <li> but I think the soap has a shelf-life and it will take one person a very long time to get through 1000g of the soap.</li>
            <li> The 150g package lasts a very long time in itself.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that the red tub has a narrow opening so</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product and the lather is thick.</li>
            <li> It lathers a little different than the razor rock that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> I still give it two stars because it isn&#x27;t terrible, but it certainly could be a lot better.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten an old product, the cream was hard.  </li>
            <li> Smell will not linger, because shaving cream scents are not really meant to linger after you wash them off.</li>
            <li> I absolutely can&#x27;t not stand the smell of marzipan.</li>
            <li> Not much room to swirl your brush in.</li>
            <li> Add a few drops of water whisk the soap and continue to steadily add water little by little while whisking till the lather is to your liking.</li>
            <li> whips into fluff faster than any other soap I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> If only they made a version with a different smell or at least used less of the almond smell</li>
            <li> I had used a shaving mug and brush for forty years, but only in the past six months did I switch from a cartridge razor to an Edwin Jagger safety razor.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is how small the container is.  </li>
            <li> not Lather as well as Other Soaps</li>
            <li> the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my belief that the lather for a premium shaving soap/cream should be thick and dense; very similar in consistency to yogurt or extra thick whipped cream.  </li>
            <li> When I shave, I shave 4 times (down, up, left-right and right-left).  </li>
            <li> But other than that, knock yourself out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean imply it is only for beginners</li>
            <li> I should have listened to one of the previous reviewers who stated that &amp;</li>
            <li> The lather this one makes is less than desirable.</li>
            <li> The problem that I had was is that the lather was not very dense and offered very little cushion during the shave.  </li>
            <li> Little Protection&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> or else you will scoop up little globs of soap with your lather .</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> (Oddly enough the common commercial foams and gels don&#x27;t burn, but the shaves are still irritating due to poor protection).</li>
            <li> Tried proraso green before cella and thought it wasn&#x27;t as slick as it should be.  </li>
            <li> The tub itself has a very small mouth, which can make it difficult to load your brush directly from the</li>
            <li> Both are buttery slick.</li>
            <li> Where prosasso leaves a slick residue for touch up.</li>
            <li> It is subtle, and slightly almondish.</li>
            <li> However, it did not best the current champion, or rather co-champions.</li>
            <li> The lather is whipped up thick, creamy and slick.  </li>
            <li> It is sort of a hard cream in a tub</li>
            <li> Premium quality, lather is thick and and helps eliminate razor burn.</li>
            <li> Very slick.</li>
            <li> you are serious about using a safety razor, don&#x27;t skimp on any of the essentials: razor and blades, brush, and soap.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad by any means, but I personally did not feel that it lived up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Maybe I will get bored of it?</li>
            <li> It just stinks, literally.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to give these boar hair brushes a try.  </li>
            <li> I sadly have been disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> Please, before you post a bad review, search for help or even ask on B&amp;B.  </li>
            <li> Not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> It taught me how bad a soap can be and</li>
            <li> and I doubt anybody can be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and as I was shaving it was cutting off the Tops of the Bumps!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Tried proraso green before cella and thought it wasn&#x27;t as slick as it should be.  I tried cella, and I like it a lot so much that I went ahead and ordered 1kg brick that will last me a very long time. ( I already cut some chunk to give to my dad).  The slickness and protection is very adequate and lets you shave without irritation. Scent was a little confusing at first because it says almond scent on the packaging, but it smelled to me more like cherry.  I heard/read from somewhere that almond extracts smell like cherry, which could explain that.  It is nonetheless a very pleasant smell and has a great feel to it.  Proraso for me was little too strong/too mentholy, almost to make me not want to use it everyday, but cella has more subtle scent to it.  Maybe I will get bored of it? but I am liking it so far.  Smell will not linger, because shaving cream scents are not really meant to linger after you wash them off. Use your favorite aftershave if you want to smell good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a difficult review to write as Cella has a huge following in the wet shaving world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one word describes my dislike of this product  - marzipan. I absolutely can&#x27;t not stand the smell of marzipan. I won&#x27;t even dare shaving with it. It just stinks, literally.</li>
            <li> Soapy almond smell, almost reminds me of the old school bathroom soap as a kid. Nice thick slick lather for close shave. Cleans off easy without any residue being left behind. Good container that can be reused for other soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use this for travel when I go out of state. haven&#x27;t used this yet but I noticed this had a strong sweet almond scent to it. this is a soft soap not a traditional cream</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap. It produces a great lather and smells amazing. It leaves a great slickness to your skin so it&#x27;s great for a quick touch up between lathers and shaving passes with a DE razor. I will definitely be buying this soap again.</li>
            <li> Shaving cream soap is a great descriptor for this product. It is not as hard as most soaps and not as soft as most creams. It provides a good lather and the hard plastic is good for travelling.</li>
            <li> Just received this soap, and shaved with it. The soap performes literally like a regular  hand soap. It smells like a cheap hand soap, lethers like hand soap, feels like hand soap. It doesn&#x27;t protect your skin like (for instance)  a glycerin soap.  My face is burning . I didn&#x27;t feel any moisturizers in this soap. I still got that cheap soapy smell in my nose )))  I feel right now like I threw my money in a window... It smells like washing powder not even hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: the soap got molded and rotted.</li>
            <li> Cella contain both coconut oil and tallow, two of the best lathering ingredients, and that is what makes it work so well: great lubrication and substantial lather that helps keep the whiskers moisturized (to soften them) and helps support the whiskers allowing the razor blade to get at them.    Cella&#x27;s description in Italian (\\&quot;crema da barba all&#x27;olio di mandorla\\&quot;) means \\&quot;shaving cream with almond oil\\&quot;. Although it is called a cream it is more like a hard putty. Cella has a very pleasant almond scent. Note that like most shaving soaps the scent is not meant to, and indeed does not, linger for long after the shave. It does make the shaving experience pleasant!    This product is 150g in a very useful and tightly sealed container. This keeps it from drying out and makes it convenient for traveling. A large (1000g) block is available for refills but I think the soap has a shelf-life and it will take one person a very long time to get through 1000g of the soap. The 150g package lasts a very long time in itself.</li>
            <li> LOL, Do you know how to shave? You need a proper brush to use this soap correctly. Add a few drops of water whisk the soap and continue to steadily add water little by little while whisking till the lather is to your liking. I read your review and it sounded like you just rubbed the soap on your face which is hilarious lmao. Some of the best shaving soap i have ever used, decent price too.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to one of the previous reviewers who stated that &amp;#34;It is not suitable for sensitive skin&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I may be somewhat the exception since virtually every high-end shaving cream or soap burns my facial skin.(Cella is particularly offensive). (Oddly enough the common commercial foams and gels don&#x27;t burn, but the shaves are still irritating due to poor protection). My latest theory is that almost all boutique shaving creams contain lye (potassium or sodium hydroxide), and though the soap and cream manufacturers claim that the lye is removed during the manufacturing process, my face would argue otherwise.</li>
            <li> Easy to lather, very slick, great fragrance and no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap.  You probably heard it  has a strong scent of marzipan and also cherry so keep it away from children.  A wet brush will load very quickly as this is not truly a soap but a a soft soap or a hard cream (AKA croap).    The lather very good and it offers great protection while shaving.    The after shave feeling is also good.    This is top notch stuff and I doubt anybody can be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different types of shave creams and this is one of the better one&#x27;s. I like how long it&#x27;s lasted and how easy it is to get a good lather. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the smell other than pleasant but not strong.</li>
            <li> Stop reading the reviews, and just buy it!</li>
            <li> Great smelling. Lathers well.</li>
            <li> I will use this shaving cream as long as I can get it.....nice texture makes for a smooth shave!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Excellent shaves without irritation.</li>
            <li> I truly love this stuff.  Lubricates the beard, makes for a great shave, but the smell is addicting.  I look forward to morning since I&#x27;ve started using this.  It is so superior to any shaving cream, lotion, or soap, that I can&#x27;t bear to go back to Prorasso</li>
            <li> The kilo block of Cella is in my rotation of 5 soaps/creams, so this sturdy pot is like being home from home. Well constructed, and containing a product that has stood the test of time. Why pay a fortune for some ingredients that are, at best, unnecessary ?</li>
            <li> Works up a great lather and smells great too!  The smell is a cross between hazelnut and cherry.  You won&#x27;t be dissappointed.</li>
            <li> It does not take much to really foam up and lather you face. Has an almond scent to it or palmetto fragrance. Very good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK....IMHO I would have to say it is a little over rated across the Amazon reviews, as well as many shave forums. The tub itself has a very small mouth, which can make it difficult to load your brush directly from the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a very pleasant almond smell in the tub, but once the lather develops it really strays from the almond scent. The lubricity is good...just be sure to use enough water.</li>
            <li> I have been soap and brush shaving for years and have tried numerous products, mostly what I could find locally.  Cella has given me nothing, but an enjoyable shave.  I lathers up quickly, holds it lather, and does a great job right up until the finish.  The was the first time had ordered a shaving soap online, and I am very happy with the results of the expierence.</li>
            <li> I had used a shaving mug and brush for forty years, but only in the past six months did I switch from a cartridge razor to an Edwin Jagger safety razor. It didn&#x27;t take long before I realized I needed to stop using my synthetic bristle brush (I replaced it with a badger brush) and I also had to stop using the Van Der Hagen shaving soap available at the nation&#x27;s premier discount store. After some online research and reading reviews posted on Amazon, I found two excellent shaving creams. One of them is Cella Shaving Cream. [Note: The other is by Taylor of Old Bond Street.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it costs way more than the generic bar soaps like Van Der Hagen or Williams, but this 5.3 oz. bowl will last me about a year--that&#x27;s only about five cents a shave! Soap lathers well, and I don&#x27;t need to start with much soap on my brush to allow for a third or even a fourth application. Some customers have stated a dislike of the almond scent. However, while I will admit it is a bit sweet, I do not find it at all overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are serious about using a safety razor, don&#x27;t skimp on any of the essentials: razor and blades, brush, and soap. [Note #2:  The Cella shaving cream is considerably cheaper than the Taylor of Old Bond Street soap, but I like to alternate between the two.] Your up front costs may be higher, but in the long run you will save money over your old cartridge razor and I have never had closer shaves. I am extremely pleased with this product. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it. 1: smells great 2: fast and easy foam lather</li>
            <li> I thought it a little strange at first -- it&#x27;s really soft for a soap and really heavy and tacky for a cream, but it loaded and lathered really easily. It has a great smell due to the sweet almond oil in it and lubricates well due to the tallow and coconut oil. I have somewhat sensitive skin too, and this didn&#x27;t cause any irritation. I also like that the container screws shut tightly, which is good for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years. Its excellent, smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells like almonds, and gives a nice lather.  Just like other shaving soaps, you should use a good brush to develop a lather.  But other than that, knock yourself out!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the almond/amaretto and the performance is top notch.  This soap has been around for over 100 years and will probably be around for 100 more.  The lather is so easy to build and the shaves are slick.  My only gripe is how small the container is.  Not much room to swirl your brush in.</li>
            <li> Provided a nice rich and thick lather that was very slick. I could barely smell the almond scent. Had one of the better shaves using this product. A very good product that I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped fast as always.Bellezz does a great job.Cella is a fantastic shaving soap.Creamy,smooth,and it does a superb job of moisturizing the skin,long after the shave.This and Mitchells  Wool Fat soap will be the only soaps I will shave with.Both are buttery slick.They are better than any other soaps I have used,not by a little bit rather a country mile. Thanks Bellezz ,Richard from Apex</li>
            <li> I had High Hopes For this Soap! Its Tallow Based Which I Prefer Over Glycerin Based! My 1st Shave with this Soap Was a Complete Disaster! Just as I was Finishing my Second Pass My Wife Walked in and Said &amp;#34;GOOD LORD! What The Hell Have You done to Yourself?&amp;#34; I had 40 blood weeps on my neck and face! I had a Reaction to the soap that caused my skin to be covered in tiny bumps! and as I was shaving it was cutting off the Tops of the Bumps!

But I Would Not Recommend This Product To Anyone!</li>
            <li> almond scent is a bit light.  soap produces a beard lifting and drying quality that gives a very close shave.  Does require reapplication for second pass.  Where prosasso leaves a slick residue for touch up.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used to date. Best quality, and value too. For this price I will most likely be buying cases upon cases of this stuff. :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It makes spectacular lather effortlessly and it leaves your face nicely moisturized.  The subtle, delightful almond fragrance is a plus.  It&#x27;s the only shaving soap I use.  Try it, you &#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> This IS the best shaving soap there is, nothing beats it. Classic tallow-based, lathers easily on your face, is buttery smooth and washes off easily, does not leave any perfume behind. you will get a close perfect shave with ANY blade, even a 10-day old blade.. This is a notch above Pro-Raso ones, which I also have but now cannot go back. Best value: get the 1 kilo brick that sells for ~$35 (that&#x27;s what I have, got it from The ItalianBarber, super-fresh product), since some say that the formulation is slightly different (better) that the one in the red tub.. If you buy super-expensive English ones, you&#x27;re throwing money out the window. This IS the one.</li>
            <li> Nice cherry/almond scent. Leathers easily. At around $2 per ounce, it is a good value .</li>
            <li> I must have gotten an old product, the cream was hard.  Smells sweet and once you work it gets a good lather and offers good protection, but if its an almond scent you wish for, if you like the confectioners sugar coated almond scent then this is for you (assuming you get a newer product), else try TOBS almond!</li>
            <li> whips into fluff faster than any other soap I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I saw this shaving soap advertised for quite a while and finally decided to try it out.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  The aroma of cherry/almond is very pleasant and not overpowering.  I have no problem lathering up this soap in my mug.  This is a high quality product and the lather is thick. When I shave, I shave 4 times (down, up, left-right and right-left).  There are no lubrication problems even shaving 4 times in a row.  The blade glides easily across my face w/o any razor burn. I can also reuse the empty container for a different shaving soap while travelling. This is a very good product that I will gladly buy again.  By the way, I have found Italian shaving soaps to have been of great quality (Razorock, ex.).</li>
            <li> As described by seller. Great lather and scent. Made for a great shave.</li>
            <li> First, I would like to say that I really like the scent of almonds in my soaps and shaving creams.  The scent of this soft-soap is great, and I found that it lasted all through my shave.  GREAT.  The problem that I had was is that the lather was not very dense and offered very little cushion during the shave.  I attempted to lather several times - and the results were always the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my belief that the lather for a premium shaving soap/cream should be thick and dense; very similar in consistency to yogurt or extra thick whipped cream.  This did not perform according to that high standard, rather the lather was fluffy and light.  This left the blade to drag across my face without proper lubricating properties.  It was very disappointing, since I really like the scent and heard much about what a great soap it was.  I think I&#x27;ve wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> Great product and exactly as advertised.  I really like Cella for a comfortable shave with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers easily, but I found that it dries my skin too much to really be usable. Might be perfect for someone else.</li>
            <li> Very easy to create a nice thick slick lather. I love the smell. The packing says almond, but it&#x27;s more like cherry mixed with almonds to me. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that the red tub has a narrow opening so loading the brush with lather is kinda of small making it not as much fun. You could take it out of the container and move it to something else easy enough as the consistency is like a soft soap(playdoh).</li>
            <li> A good lather that lets the razor glide across the face. I like the container for the soap. Has a sort of cherry/almond scent. Feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Cocos Nucifere Oil, Tallow, Stearic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxide, Aqua, Potassium Carbonate, Parfum.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Smells like cherry.  Buy it and enjoy a nice and slick lather.</li>
            <li> Firstly, ignore the 1-star review on this product.  Read the discussion on that comment and you&#x27;ll see why...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this soap is very good.  It is a rather soft soap, thus a little tricky to find the good water-soap ratio.  If I were you, I would run over to Badger and Blade and look up some very good information on lathering soft soaps like these.  I was told on B&amp;B that the soap is easier to lather if you use a brush that is stiff, but with soft bristles.  This could be a Best badger or a well broken in boar brush.  Please, before you post a bad review, search for help or even ask on B&amp;B.  Those guys give great advice, some of which I just shared with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is very almond-y scented when you take a whiff from the jar.  When lathering, it is recommended that you face lather, but bowl lathering is just as good IMO.  The scent is fantastic and the shave is also very nice.  I had very watery lather the first time and the shave was still pretty good.  5-stars without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Smells like marzipan.  Easy to lather with great slickness.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I liked the slickness and cushion of the lather but the smell was overpowering. If only they made a version with a different smell or at least used less of the almond smell I would have given it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> There is not a lot I can say about Cella that hasn&#x27;t already been said.  It is a reasonably priced, excellent shave cream/soap.  Lathers quickly and provides a slick protective coating for wet-shavers. It should stand up to the most aggressive razor/blade combination.  I would compare the slickness and protection to the lather I get from my Tabac soap.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream/soap I have ever used.  Recommend highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to get a lather.  Not too soft or creamy in texture.  Lubricates well and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> The best shave soap I have used by far. The smell is a mixture of almond and almost has a hint of cherry.  I would rate this over protagonist. Lathers very easy and lasts for multiple passes.</li>
            <li> So far I really love it. It lathers a little different than the razor rock that I&#x27;m used to. But it is absolutely buttery smooth. I feel like I put crisco on my face. Not in a bad way. My fave feels smooth and hydrated when I&#x27;m done and I use the muehl r41 which is quite aggressive. You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> The people on the /r/wicked_edge subreddit heaped praise upon this inexpensive Italian shave cream, which enticed me to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve been using this for a week, this is my analysis. For starters, I practically have to work at it to cut myself using this stuff. Very slick. It effectively buffers my skin as the Voskhod blade&#x27;s unyielding Russian steel cleaves through my stubble. Yes, Cella is, indeed, a marvelous product that puts the merely serviceable Williams and Van der Hagen soaps to shame with its lathering, lubricating, and moisturizing properties, not to mention the delightfully confectionary almond smell that it exudes. This turns the act of shaving into a feast for the senses, rather than a humdrum chore, which in turn, causes me to pay closer attention to my shaving technique, and that results in a better shave and healthier skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last, I understand why shave soap manufacturers and wet shaving enthusiasts tend to put so much emphasis on appealingly scented soaps; what I had previously deemed effete is, in fact, a very pragmatic consideration. Great stuff, buy it.</li>
            <li> This is excellent shave soap. If I had to pick only one soap, this would be it!</li>
            <li> This is a nice mild soap with a very great almond scent. The lather is a fine lather that coats well. The scent lingers for a while. Top marks!</li>
            <li> Amazing, great subtle cherry almond sent, this is your special occasion soap right here, will definitely order again</li>
            <li> I have tried many shaving soaps and creams and Cella is the very best you&#x27;ll find.  For a close shave I also like the &#x27;Original Proraso&#x27; but it&#x27;s been discontinued. I like Tabac but it just isn&#x27;t quite as good (TO ME) as the Cella. Out of five stars, if Cella made a cream in a tube, it would get 100 stars (so?....I meant to do that).</li>
            <li> Lathers and shaves great. The scent, for me, was just ok. The biggest issue was that I have sensitive skin and after my first shave with this, my face was on fire for 2 hours, something that hadn&#x27;t happened with any other soap. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better soaps. It doesn&#x27;t lather that well. The scent is great though, but I&#x27;m going back to creams.</li>
            <li> This is great soap.  I&#x27;ve been trying out shaving soaps and this lathers up just as well, maybe better, than a number of the more expensive soaps.  Using saving soap is a bit of an art.  You&#x27;ve got to get the right soap to water ratio and mix it with a decent brush.  It seems that stiffer brushes work better with soaps.  A boar hair, pure badger, or super badger brushes are probably better than a silver tip badger, but a lot of people really prefer the soft silver tip brush and you can mix up lather with them.  Practice and experimenting will pay-off.  This would be a great soap to start out with because it is inexpensive and of a higher quality.  My first soap was a cheap Walmart soap.  It taught me how bad a soap can be and it really was like using hand soap.  That soap smelled cheap.  Cella has a fresh almond scent, which is not overwhelming and dissipates so that it does not conflict with other aftershaves or colognes.  Cella would also make a good long term soap.  I don&#x27;t mean imply it is only for beginners and it will be in my cabinet for a long time to come.  Happy shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oct 1---A lot of folk really like to use a badger shave brush, and I will admit that the softer bristles are nice, but as I mention above a stiffer brush can work well with soaps.  I have a super badger brush and my brother has a pure badger.  The silver tip is the softest and the super is a middle soft/stiff badger brush.  I have been using the super badger for some time and like it with the soap, but I decide to pick up a quality boar hair out of curiosity. (Vulfix makes several and you can find them here on Amazon).  Don&#x27;t be afraid to give these boar hair brushes a try.  They are of a lower price but not of a lower quality.  My boar hair is incredible with this Cella soap.  I mean really amazing.  I am getting my best lather yet!  The best lather I ever got from a can was Nivea sensitive skin (I still like that stuff.  If you got to get a can, get Nivea).  But with the boarbrush and the Cella soap I am getting an even thicker rich lather! than the Nivea or the Cella with the super badger.  Give the boar hair a try.  A great shave does not have to be expensive.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful with this one, as it was recommended by a friend and it had such great reviews online. I sadly have been disappointed with the results. The lather this one makes is less than desirable. I know that part of the problem is that I don&#x27;t have soft water, but I have had great success with other soaps and creams, but this one doesn&#x27;t work quite as well. I was also looking forward to it having it&#x27;s own container, but the tub is too small, I prefer something that is a little bigger to hold when I am creating my lather or trying to get enough soap on my brush. I still give it two stars because it isn&#x27;t terrible, but it certainly could be a lot better.</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for my boyfriend, and it smells soooo good. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s because of the almond oil. He says it gives him a great shave also.</li>
            <li> I tried this soap for 3 months using a Merkur Futur with Feather blades and got passable results. Last weekend I tried some old Barbasol I had in my medicine cabinet and the Barbasol actually did a better job. The Cella has almost no scent and the I feel the lubrication is minimal because I got way more nicks and cuts with it than any shaving soap/cream I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not reccomended.</li>
            <li> Looking for a gift for that special someone? Look no further. This has the best fragrance in a shaving soap hands down. It is subtle, and slightly almondish. The lather is fantastic. Plus the ingredients are natural. Think about what you&#x27;ve been putting on your face, and then pay the money for real ingredients. Great for women looking for a soap for themselves, or for their significant others. It&#x27;s a scent you won&#x27;t forget. Made in Italy.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to get a good lather and, even when I did, the protection I need wasn&#x27;t there.  The smell is okay, but not very manly, as my girlfriend quickly pointed out.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad by any means, but I personally did not feel that it lived up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m having some difficulties getting it to lather really well, but I suppose that will take practice.  It works very well.  The scent is amazing!  It leaves your skin feeling soft and works very well to help the blade slide across your face.</li>
            <li> Premium quality, lather is thick and and helps eliminate razor burn. After trying this cream, I will never be without it. I don&#x27;t dread shaving every morning anymore, Cella Shave Cream is one of the simple pleasures that anyone can afford.</li>
            <li> Decent shaving cream with a nice cherry almond scent. Lathers great provides good protection but leaves my skin dry. I use liquid aftershave so I can&#x27;t combat the dryness unless I use additional products which I don&#x27;t want to. It&#x27;s not bad but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shaving soap. I have noticed with soft soap as this is , you need to work your brush very lightly while working up a lather or else you will scoop up little globs of soap with your lather . This happens more with stiffer brushes. Other than that it is very good shaving soap. I use  it often and would recommend it to anyone who want&#x27;s a nice smelling lather to shave with. Thanks for carrying this product.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great until the burning sensation.  If it hadn&#x27;t started to burn my skin I probably would of given this 5 stars.  Beware if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Been using proraso for some time now and just thought I&#x27;d try a cream.  Excellent...best shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time and great smell too!</li>
            <li> I must have tried close to 50 shaving soaps, creams, sticks and oils. I do face-offs. I&#x27;ll lather up the right side of my face with one product, clean the brush and lather up the other side with my current champion. The next day I&#x27;ll switch sides and do the champion first and the challenger second, to even things out. I do this for a week which will include day old stubble to sometimes 3 day old growth. First, I love the fragrance somewhat reminiscent of marzipan. It is sort of a hard cream in a tub so it takes a bit to lather up in my bowl. It produces a good rich lather. When the blade meets the face it provided good lubrication and glide and left my face smooth and not irritated. However, it did not best the current champion, or rather co-champions. Somehow it didn&#x27;t clear the stubble as effectively as the other three and therefore required additional strokes, never a good thing. It is a good product and I would place it in my next to the top tier. I am currently testing another product but until the results are final there are only 3 products in the top tier for me.</li>
            <li> Mild aroma that doesn&#x27;t linger.  Lathers easily and fully.  Provides for a nice shave.  Last just about forever.  Priced right.</li>
            <li> Classic italian shave soap.  Great marzipan scent and lathers wonderfully.  Also a smaller container making it great for travel.</li>
            <li> Very good lather. Good smell</li>
            <li> Cella is a truly great Soap and staple in my shave den.  The fragrance is heavenly, the rich amaretto fragrance is really a pleasure to use, I would have to equate to a marzipan or cherry like.  The lather is whipped up thick, creamy and slick.  It does lather a bit differently than other soft soaps, so take the time with your brush and load a little longer than you may otherwise.  I also find that I need to add a little more water to my scuttle to see the lather really explode.  So if you are having any difficulty with the lather, try using a little more product and dripping in some extra water, you will know when you have it right when the later suddenly takes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do bowl/scuttle lather, but I have heard for face latherers it is the same, make sure to really load the brush and make sure you are using enough water.</li>
