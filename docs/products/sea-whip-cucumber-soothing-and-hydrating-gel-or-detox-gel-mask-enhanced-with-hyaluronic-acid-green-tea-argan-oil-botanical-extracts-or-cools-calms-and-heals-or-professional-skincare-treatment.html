            <li>received this product for free to test and review, all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li>(:skin types!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free to test and review, all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li>The slimy texture was actually a good thing because it was easy to tell when I had washed it all of, I was worried about not knowing when it was off because it&#x27;s clear.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li>used the VIA gel to cool and hydrate my skin after a day out in the sun, what a nice sensation!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to put on make up now!</li>
            <li>Product arrived very quickly and I love the product itself!</li>
            <li>It was pleasant and cool and the texture was enjoyable</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks smoother and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked and can&#x27;t wait to try more of the Via product line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this product, &amp; will probably try others from this company.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t leave it on for more than 5-7 minutes because it makes my skin breakout since almost everything makes my skin break out.  </li>
            <li>This mask was so soothing and felt cooling and refreshing on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>really enjoyed using this gel mask.</li>
            <li>which is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>I was really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Following my shower, I apply this to my face and it becomes re-hydrated and healthy once again; for best results, I like to leave it on overnight!  </li>
            <li>Well this magical gel has tightened those pores some.  </li>
            <li>I check all the ingredients being used, and I feel safe to use it for my teenager.  </li>
            <li>It has cooling effect and really feel great to apply after getting tons of sun during summer.  </li>
            <li>I am going to need one more for the summer.  </li>
            <li>It was quickly shipped and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Very clean, spa-like.</li>
            <li>When I go to use it, it&#x27;s a nice cool soothing gel on my face.  </li>
            <li>Idon&#x27;t think it will disappoint you if you what you are looking for is something to help you have clean, balanced, soothed skin!</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this product and look forward to trying there other products as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on and wash off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and effectively &amp;#34;resets&amp;#34; my skin each time I use it.</li>
            <li>Plus, overall, my skin is more smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about the Gel was the Amazing smell</li>
            <li>It feels tingly, refreshing and cool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 90 degrees here, so placing this cool mask on my face was like enjoying the AC</li>
            <li>It isnâ€™t super sticky which I am used to with many gel like masks.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin so this product is perfect at moisturizing the drier areas on my face and not leaving an oily mess afterwards.</li>
            <li>really looking forward to using the  Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel Mask more!</li>
            <li>and my face always feels smooth and refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>its texture is so light I can sleep with it on.</li>
            <li>, you are going to have to pry it from my hands because i refuse to give it up a light scent with it and smoothing results</li>
            <li>#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product 100% free to review this also means no shipping payments).</li>
            <li>Overall I am so happy with this and will continue to use it weekly.</li>
            <li>Not only does it feel great</li>
            <li>The light cucumber scent is relaxing and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I did receive this product for free to review</li>
            <li>received this product for free for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li>It almost has a light &#x27;cucumber melon&#x27; smell it to it</li>
            <li>Such a great product.</li>
            <li>I received this free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I liked the VIA mud mask so much that I decided to try their Cucumber Gel.  </li>
            <li>My skin has been really smooth and no irritation whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I love using right after the UltraMUD mask.</li>
            <li>Cucumber is a rich source of antioxidants and helps sooth, hydrating and firming the skin.</li>
            <li>It smells fairly neutral and left my skin feeling less inflamed, moisturized and much more balanced and happy than before.</li>
            <li>was so excited to receive it that I ran to the bathroom, washed my face and put the mask on right away!</li>
            <li>I used this to help cool my skin after using the Via Cosmedics Exfoliating and Clarifying Ultra Mud mask.</li>
            <li>so when the a/c kicks on, it keeps the gel really cool.  </li>
            <li>After each use I rinse my skin with cool water.</li>
            <li>This hydrating gel mask contains natural extracts of cucumber, chamomile, sugar cane, oatmeal, rose flower, marigold, and comfrey.</li>
            <li>It was so cool and so soothing</li>
            <li>I leave it overnight after using the mask and just use a mild cleanser in the morning before I do my makeup routine.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle and cooling on my skin, moisturizing and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Many of the other ingredients such as cucumber, oatmeal &amp; calendula are ones that I&#x27;m familiar with as being very effective in supporting skin that both looks &amp; feels healthy.</li>
            <li>First I want to say that the smell of this product is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>Very soothing but not too strong that gives you a headache.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glycerin is a natural super moisturizer, helps the skin maintain a healthy balance of moisture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I have a very light and sensitive skin, and almost no hair to protect my</li>
            <li>Easy to clean off, actually just water was needed and it came off easily.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think I could comfortably leave it on overnight for a &amp;#34;more intense treatment&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>i thought there mid mask was amazing until i got to try this after hinting they got the idea and let me try it</li>
            <li>and it left an amazing coolness on my skin.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion.</li>
            <li>It also comes in a nice jar that I can totally see myself putting to use once I use up all the gel.</li>
            <li>The mask was so refreshing, and my skin felt so soft without being oily.</li>
            <li>After rinsing it off with cool water it felt nice and smooth, even slightly toned.</li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes are gone, my blemishes and redness are gone, my skin is noticeably smoother and even, it&#x27;s less oily, my blackheads have diminished by 80%, and my pores are greatly minimized so my skin looks and feels extra smooth each day.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and was worried that this might have too strong of a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin nice and smooth and takes away the slightly dark areas under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>and my face was super smooth and soft for days.</li>
            <li>It has a slight cooling effect after using the mud mask and I just loved that feeling.</li>
            <li>and once I started applying it, quickly realized I got way to much..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this gel twice daily for a little more than a week and can honestly say that I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>After this experience I look forward to trying more VIA products in the future!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so much!</li>
            <li>I will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling ultra soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I apply it before going to bed and after each time I use the Via Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud: very luscious!</li>
            <li>I also think it is important to stick with natural products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smooth, and almost clear, despite its color.</li>
            <li>This product left my skin feeling moisturized without leaving it greasy like most products.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Via Cosmetics Products</li>
            <li>I noticed a improvement after my first use</li>
            <li>and  my skin definitely felt more hydrated.</li>
            <li>The Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel was the first product I tried from VIA Cosmedics at the recommendation from my son.  </li>
            <li>The first time I wore it, I saw you could leave it on overnight</li>
            <li>The consistency is a little strange at first, but it smells great and is easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with VIA Cosmedics, &amp; it&#x27;s given me a positive impression of their brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super excited that I found a facial mask that takes care of all of my skin problems in one!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and really did a good job to ease redness and burning after using a harsh treatment on the face.</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin and after the first couple uses I felt my skin be smoother and more moisturized.</li>
            <li>I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>My skin felt refreshed after just one use and the redness was pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li>The mask is easy to put on and wash off and really seems to have made a big difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>twice a week i so want to use it every single night because when i do my dry patches on my skin disappear completely and it smells so good!</li>
            <li>and once I put it on it seemed to cool very fast on face and left my face energized.</li>
            <li>It is very sticky</li>
            <li>I really like this soothing gel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My skin is softer &amp; smoother after using this product, &amp; I think it would also provide real relief to inflamed skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture &amp; the smell.  </li>
            <li>After a day or 2 is when I really notice the difference on my face.  </li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really</li>
            <li>I actually really like that it isnâ€™t.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and this is not irritating at all.</li>
            <li>, I really didn&#x27;t want to take it off.</li>
            <li>Used with lotion my skin dries out much slower than just with lotion itself.</li>
            <li>But it left no redness and left my skin with a nice glow.</li>
            <li>This is better than a lot of other after sun gel</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a LONG way with this, which is great</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first gel mask, so I was obviously a bit leery smearing my face in a bright green gel.</li>
            <li>My face tends to get red and dry in the colder months and this gel felt amazing and really helped alleviate those problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve finally found a go to product that leaves my face clear and less</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s acne prone, oily, but also gets dry easily, so</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, that gets red and irritated easily</li>
            <li>I left it on for the full 20 minutes</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all mind, so here is how i did my facial with it, i washed my face as i normally do and didn&#x27;t use my toner, i added a bit to my clean finger tips and rubbed upwards in a circle motion until my face was covered in it</li>
            <li>I love how it calms down any skin irritation and windburn.</li>
            <li>It gives the word soothing, a whole new meaning.</li>
            <li>The dry spots on my cheeks were smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>In the morning, it gets washed off when I shower and my skin is left soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I received my Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel Mask very promptly, and was pleasantly surprised at the amount of product!</li>
            <li>The botanicals that it claims to have in it are high on the list and in the product in measurable amounts.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel Mask to all skin</li>
            <li>I adore this mask and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t clear whether the fragrance is from a natural source, &amp; I do find it a bit strong when I open the jar, but not so noticeable after applying the gel.</li>
            <li>I was really pleasently surprised after using this mask though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Those ingredients not only help calm but also rehydrate and detoxify the skin.</li>
            <li>I find it gentle enough to be used on a daily basis, but also giving good results if applied less</li>
            <li>Not sure what I expected since everything I try sounds good in theory, but doesn&#x27;t really work that well.  </li>
            <li>ingredients are high quality and almost all natural.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin ( grew up with eczema)</li>
            <li>The Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel is the first VIA product that I have tried, but it will not be the last!</li>
            <li>My skin generally gets really oily in the summer months</li>
            <li>I left it on for about 25 minutes the first time, removed it and then moisturized</li>
            <li>Being an avid gardener, I will be outside for hours at a time.</li>
            <li>have combination skin, with dry patches on my cheek and super sensitive skin that is acne prone.</li>
            <li>I use it in 1-2 hours treatments but it is definitely gentle enough to leave on overnight and even with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear mask, so you can put this on and leave it on and still answer the door without freaking people out which is an added bonus for me.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how quickly it dried and how comfortable</li>
            <li>Even twice daily, I haven&#x27;t really dented the surface of the jar.</li>
            <li>so i can use it before bed, completely in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use a facial moisturizer as much.</li>
            <li>frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big pluses for me are that VIA Cosmedics products are cruelty-free, &amp; that the gel contains a number of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I store my jar under a dresser near a floor vent</li>
            <li>Since using the product, my skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am a 43 year old man that has never used something like this.  </li>
            <li>Young and dumb...didn&#x27;t need sun screen, or maybe it hadn&#x27;t been invented?  </li>
            <li>I think it has helped, but this is far from an area in which I am an expert.  </li>
            <li>After the first initial use, I usually only leave it on about 10-15 minutes now.</li>
            <li>Especially in the winter when I&#x27;m used to having to cake it on to look decent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Argan oil provides moisturizing, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidants, and anti-aging benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Allatonin helps soften keratin, and dissolves dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;Oatmeal has properties to help calm, soothe, and protect skin in providing moisture retention, and keep skin firm.&lt;br /&gt;Marigold extract helps rejuvenate damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;Sea</li>
            <li>I normally struggle with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed an improvement after the first few uses.</li>
            <li>and I have found it has helped clear up my dry spots.</li>
            <li>It doesnâ€™t get super tight like other masks do.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> suspect that this would be a great product to use after sun exposure for soothing relief.</li>
            <li> but it smells great too.</li>
            <li> whip is a great healing property, that subdues enzymes that can cause irritation and redness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably feels great in the summer.</li>
            <li> This gel is amazing!</li>
            <li> the mask was off, my skin looked and felt amazing!</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> The gel has a pleasant scent to it, kind of minty and floral.</li>
            <li> My skin is much more even, so smooth, and looks great!  </li>
            <li> This is the first VIA product that I have used and I must say that I am impressed.</li>

            <li> Plus, I love the gorgeous color of it.</li>
            <li> Each time I use it, I feel better and better and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample to facilitate this review, however all opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>

            <li> (:skin types!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free to test and review, all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> The slimy texture was actually a good thing because it was easy to tell when I had washed it all of, I was worried about not knowing when it was off because it&#x27;s clear.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li> used the VIA gel to cool and hydrate my skin after a day out in the sun, what a nice sensation!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to put on make up now!</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly and I love the product itself!</li>
            <li> It was pleasant and cool and the texture was enjoyable</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks smoother and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked and can&#x27;t wait to try more of the Via product line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this product, &amp; will probably try others from this company.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t leave it on for more than 5-7 minutes because it makes my skin breakout since almost everything makes my skin break out.  </li>
            <li> This mask was so soothing and felt cooling and refreshing on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> really enjoyed using this gel mask.</li>
            <li> which is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Following my shower, I apply this to my face and it becomes re-hydrated and healthy once again; for best results, I like to leave it on overnight!  </li>
            <li> Well this magical gel has tightened those pores some.  </li>
            <li> I check all the ingredients being used, and I feel safe to use it for my teenager.  </li>
            <li> It has cooling effect and really feel great to apply after getting tons of sun during summer.  </li>
            <li> I am going to need one more for the summer.  </li>
            <li> It was quickly shipped and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Very clean, spa-like.</li>
            <li> When I go to use it, it&#x27;s a nice cool soothing gel on my face.  </li>
            <li> Idon&#x27;t think it will disappoint you if you what you are looking for is something to help you have clean, balanced, soothed skin!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product and look forward to trying there other products as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on and wash off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and effectively &amp;#34;resets&amp;#34; my skin each time I use it.</li>
            <li> Plus, overall, my skin is more smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about the Gel was the Amazing smell</li>
            <li> It feels tingly, refreshing and cool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 90 degrees here, so placing this cool mask on my face was like enjoying the AC</li>
            <li> It isnâ€™t super sticky which I am used to with many gel like masks.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin so this product is perfect at moisturizing the drier areas on my face and not leaving an oily mess afterwards.</li>
            <li> really looking forward to using the  Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel Mask more!</li>
            <li> and my face always feels smooth and refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li> its texture is so light I can sleep with it on.</li>
            <li> , you are going to have to pry it from my hands because i refuse to give it up a light scent with it and smoothing results</li>
            <li> #34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product 100% free to review this also means no shipping payments).</li>
            <li> Overall I am so happy with this and will continue to use it weekly.</li>
            <li> Not only does it feel great</li>
            <li> The light cucumber scent is relaxing and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I did receive this product for free to review</li>
            <li> received this product for free for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> It almost has a light &#x27;cucumber melon&#x27; smell it to it</li>
            <li> Such a great product.</li>
            <li> I received this free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I liked the VIA mud mask so much that I decided to try their Cucumber Gel.  </li>
            <li> My skin has been really smooth and no irritation whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I love using right after the UltraMUD mask.</li>
            <li> Cucumber is a rich source of antioxidants and helps sooth, hydrating and firming the skin.</li>
            <li> It smells fairly neutral and left my skin feeling less inflamed, moisturized and much more balanced and happy than before.</li>
            <li> was so excited to receive it that I ran to the bathroom, washed my face and put the mask on right away!</li>
            <li> I used this to help cool my skin after using the Via Cosmedics Exfoliating and Clarifying Ultra Mud mask.</li>
            <li> so when the a/c kicks on, it keeps the gel really cool.  </li>
            <li> After each use I rinse my skin with cool water.</li>
            <li> This hydrating gel mask contains natural extracts of cucumber, chamomile, sugar cane, oatmeal, rose flower, marigold, and comfrey.</li>
            <li> It was so cool and so soothing</li>
            <li> I leave it overnight after using the mask and just use a mild cleanser in the morning before I do my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle and cooling on my skin, moisturizing and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Many of the other ingredients such as cucumber, oatmeal &amp; calendula are ones that I&#x27;m familiar with as being very effective in supporting skin that both looks &amp; feels healthy.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that the smell of this product is just fantastic.</li>
            <li> Very soothing but not too strong that gives you a headache.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glycerin is a natural super moisturizer, helps the skin maintain a healthy balance of moisture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I have a very light and sensitive skin, and almost no hair to protect my</li>
            <li> Easy to clean off, actually just water was needed and it came off easily.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think I could comfortably leave it on overnight for a &amp;#34;more intense treatment&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> i thought there mid mask was amazing until i got to try this after hinting they got the idea and let me try it</li>
            <li> and it left an amazing coolness on my skin.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion.</li>
            <li> It also comes in a nice jar that I can totally see myself putting to use once I use up all the gel.</li>
            <li> The mask was so refreshing, and my skin felt so soft without being oily.</li>
            <li> After rinsing it off with cool water it felt nice and smooth, even slightly toned.</li>
            <li> The fine lines around my eyes are gone, my blemishes and redness are gone, my skin is noticeably smoother and even, it&#x27;s less oily, my blackheads have diminished by 80%, and my pores are greatly minimized so my skin looks and feels extra smooth each day.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and was worried that this might have too strong of a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin nice and smooth and takes away the slightly dark areas under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and my face was super smooth and soft for days.</li>
            <li> It has a slight cooling effect after using the mud mask and I just loved that feeling.</li>
            <li> and once I started applying it, quickly realized I got way to much..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this gel twice daily for a little more than a week and can honestly say that I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> After this experience I look forward to trying more VIA products in the future!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much!</li>
            <li> I will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling ultra soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I apply it before going to bed and after each time I use the Via Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud: very luscious!</li>
            <li> I also think it is important to stick with natural products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on smooth, and almost clear, despite its color.</li>
            <li> This product left my skin feeling moisturized without leaving it greasy like most products.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Via Cosmetics Products</li>
            <li> I noticed a improvement after my first use</li>
            <li> and  my skin definitely felt more hydrated.</li>
            <li> The Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel was the first product I tried from VIA Cosmedics at the recommendation from my son.  </li>
            <li> The first time I wore it, I saw you could leave it on overnight</li>
            <li> The consistency is a little strange at first, but it smells great and is easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with VIA Cosmedics, &amp; it&#x27;s given me a positive impression of their brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super excited that I found a facial mask that takes care of all of my skin problems in one!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and really did a good job to ease redness and burning after using a harsh treatment on the face.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and after the first couple uses I felt my skin be smoother and more moisturized.</li>
            <li> I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> My skin felt refreshed after just one use and the redness was pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li> The mask is easy to put on and wash off and really seems to have made a big difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> twice a week i so want to use it every single night because when i do my dry patches on my skin disappear completely and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> and once I put it on it seemed to cool very fast on face and left my face energized.</li>
            <li> It is very sticky</li>
            <li> I really like this soothing gel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My skin is softer &amp; smoother after using this product, &amp; I think it would also provide real relief to inflamed skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture &amp; the smell.  </li>
            <li> After a day or 2 is when I really notice the difference on my face.  </li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really</li>
            <li> I actually really like that it isnâ€™t.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and this is not irritating at all.</li>
            <li> , I really didn&#x27;t want to take it off.</li>
            <li> Used with lotion my skin dries out much slower than just with lotion itself.</li>
            <li> But it left no redness and left my skin with a nice glow.</li>
            <li> This is better than a lot of other after sun gel</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LONG way with this, which is great</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first gel mask, so I was obviously a bit leery smearing my face in a bright green gel.</li>
            <li> My face tends to get red and dry in the colder months and this gel felt amazing and really helped alleviate those problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve finally found a go to product that leaves my face clear and less</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s acne prone, oily, but also gets dry easily, so</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, that gets red and irritated easily</li>
            <li> I left it on for the full 20 minutes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all mind, so here is how i did my facial with it, i washed my face as i normally do and didn&#x27;t use my toner, i added a bit to my clean finger tips and rubbed upwards in a circle motion until my face was covered in it</li>
            <li> I love how it calms down any skin irritation and windburn.</li>
            <li> It gives the word soothing, a whole new meaning.</li>
            <li> The dry spots on my cheeks were smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> In the morning, it gets washed off when I shower and my skin is left soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I received my Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel Mask very promptly, and was pleasantly surprised at the amount of product!</li>
            <li> The botanicals that it claims to have in it are high on the list and in the product in measurable amounts.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel Mask to all skin</li>
            <li> I adore this mask and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t clear whether the fragrance is from a natural source, &amp; I do find it a bit strong when I open the jar, but not so noticeable after applying the gel.</li>
            <li> I was really pleasently surprised after using this mask though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Those ingredients not only help calm but also rehydrate and detoxify the skin.</li>
            <li> I find it gentle enough to be used on a daily basis, but also giving good results if applied less</li>
            <li> Not sure what I expected since everything I try sounds good in theory, but doesn&#x27;t really work that well.  </li>
            <li> ingredients are high quality and almost all natural.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin ( grew up with eczema)</li>
            <li> The Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel is the first VIA product that I have tried, but it will not be the last!</li>
            <li> My skin generally gets really oily in the summer months</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 25 minutes the first time, removed it and then moisturized</li>
            <li> Being an avid gardener, I will be outside for hours at a time.</li>
            <li> have combination skin, with dry patches on my cheek and super sensitive skin that is acne prone.</li>
            <li> I use it in 1-2 hours treatments but it is definitely gentle enough to leave on overnight and even with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear mask, so you can put this on and leave it on and still answer the door without freaking people out which is an added bonus for me.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how quickly it dried and how comfortable</li>
            <li> Even twice daily, I haven&#x27;t really dented the surface of the jar.</li>
            <li> so i can use it before bed, completely in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use a facial moisturizer as much.</li>
            <li> frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big pluses for me are that VIA Cosmedics products are cruelty-free, &amp; that the gel contains a number of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I store my jar under a dresser near a floor vent</li>
            <li> Since using the product, my skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old man that has never used something like this.  </li>
            <li> Young and dumb...didn&#x27;t need sun screen, or maybe it hadn&#x27;t been invented?  </li>
            <li> I think it has helped, but this is far from an area in which I am an expert.  </li>
            <li> After the first initial use, I usually only leave it on about 10-15 minutes now.</li>
            <li> Especially in the winter when I&#x27;m used to having to cake it on to look decent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Argan oil provides moisturizing, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidants, and anti-aging benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Allatonin helps soften keratin, and dissolves dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;Oatmeal has properties to help calm, soothe, and protect skin in providing moisture retention, and keep skin firm.&lt;br /&gt;Marigold extract helps rejuvenate damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;Sea</li>
            <li> I normally struggle with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement after the first few uses.</li>
            <li> and I have found it has helped clear up my dry spots.</li>
            <li> It doesnâ€™t get super tight like other masks do.</li>
            <li> I have some large pores due to being sun burnt for two years down in Argentina.  </li>
            <li> It gently soothed my face erasing the small lines around my forehead and eyes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard for me to find facial products that really work for me.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have been looking for something to help - especially with the dry patches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the VIA Cosmedics Sea Whip Cucumber Gel for over a month now and have noticed a big improvement to the dry patches on my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin becomes overly dry and sunburned in spite of the regular sunscreen applications.</li>
            <li> You can halfway rub it in and it&#x27;ll dry in a matter of a couple minutes, and you won&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s on all night, until you rinse it off in the morning and are left with the softest, firmest skin you&#x27;ve had in ages!  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Because my skin is dry in these winter months, I apply the gel after the mask and leave on overnight.</li>
            <li> The dry and over sunned skin on my face was hydrated and soothed without leaving the rest of my face greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> The way I use it, to achieve those results, is to spread a thin layer on my whole face, or just the parts I want extra firming/clarifying, and leave it on overnight.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be doing overnight treatments, as well as using for sunburns and other skin issues!</li>
            <li> you can spread it as thick or thin as you need and it dried a flexible clear gloss that was comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that tends to get very dry in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I realize that has nothing to do with it actually working, but the green is pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is tight and dry after washing my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product over the past several weeks</li>
            <li> The product dries after a few minutes so you can leave it on for as long as you want.</li>
            <li> I have used it for several weeks now, usually about once a week or so.  </li>
            <li> I had a little dry skin that was also gone after the treatment.</li>
            <li> , hence I am very careful choosing any skin product.  </li>
            <li> It helped my inflamed pimples go way down and got rid of the redness on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Just my preference...takes up less space than storing in a frig.</li>
            <li> I have made this a part of my beauty routine and typically use it once a week.</li>
            <li> The redness in my face was reduced slightly but nothing to brag about&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the first VIA product that I have used and I must say that I am impressed. I&#x27;ve used this product over the past several weeks and I have found it has helped clear up my dry spots. Like others have said 10 - 20 minutes seems to be the perfect amount of time and my face always feels smooth and refreshed after using it. After this experience I look forward to trying more VIA products in the future!</li>
            <li> The Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel is the first VIA product that I have tried, but it will not be the last! I love this product. My face tends to get red and dry in the colder months and this gel felt amazing and really helped alleviate those problems. My skin felt refreshed after just one use and the redness was pretty much gone.  It is very sticky so I don&#x27;t think I could comfortably leave it on overnight for a &amp;#34;more intense treatment&amp;#34; but I found that leaving it on for 20 minutes worked great.  As I mentioned, it is sticky but it feels so soothing once it&#x27;s on.  A great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this gel twice daily for a little more than a week and can honestly say that I enjoy it. My skin feels and looks smoother and more hydrated. The gel has a pleasant scent to it, kind of minty and floral. Very clean, spa-like. Even twice daily, I haven&#x27;t really dented the surface of the jar. There&#x27;s so much! I will most likely repurchase. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love this! I have super sensitive skin and was worried that this might have too strong of a tingling sensation. But it left no redness and left my skin with a nice glow. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this soothing gel. I use it overnight and it leaves my skin feeling moisturized in the morning. I have sensitive skin, that gets red and irritated easily and this gel helps sooth the redness.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that the smell of this product is just fantastic. Very soothing but not too strong that gives you a headache.&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I used this product for few days and we both like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;She used it on her face, leaving it overnight and she said that she can see and feel a difference in her skin and I can confirm. Her skin was glowing.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I have a very light and sensitive skin, and almost no hair to protect my head!&lt;br /&gt;I used the VIA gel to cool and hydrate my skin after a day out in the sun, what a nice sensation! In the morning, the redness was gone. This is better than a lot of other after sun gel I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Next, I want to try to refrigerate it for an extra cooling affect!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have been looking for something to help - especially with the dry patches. I noticed an improvement after the first few uses. It&#x27;s wonderful. My skin is much more even, so smooth, and looks great!  I&#x27;ll definitely get this again.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this product after using the MegaMud.  It&#x27;s a great compliment to the anti-aging mask.  Leaves my skin feeling ultra soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This gel is amazing! I bought the gel after using the VIA mud mask. Because my skin is dry in these winter months, I apply the gel after the mask and leave on overnight. I wake up in the morning, rinse off, and my skin is glowing and so moisturized! This stuff works and I will continue to buy! Thank you VIA!</li>
            <li> I love it! its texture is so light I can sleep with it on. I have combination skin that is tight and dry after washing my face. I use this as a moisturizer a couple times a week in the evenings and the next morning my skin is silky and hydrated. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This soothing gel is VERY hydrating and feels wonderful on my dry/sensitive skin!  I apply it before going to bed and after each time I use the Via Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud: very luscious! I&#x27;m hooked and can&#x27;t wait to try more of the Via product line.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now twice a week i so want to use it every single night because when i do my dry patches on my skin disappear completely and it smells so good! i thought there mid mask was amazing until i got to try this after hinting they got the idea and let me try it and i thought there mud mask was great until i got this, you are going to have to pry it from my hands because i refuse to give it up a light scent with it and smoothing results it&#x27;s all mind, so here is how i did my facial with it, i washed my face as i normally do and didn&#x27;t use my toner, i added a bit to my clean finger tips and rubbed upwards in a circle motion until my face was covered in it and it soaked in then i went to bed, the next day i almost forgot i had it on! thankfully i didn&#x27;t and washed it off but no reaction to it at all! not even redness! now it sits in my bathroom on my shelf next to my nightly routine so i can use it before bed, completely in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: &amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product 100% free to review this also means no shipping payments). I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li> As a woman with difficult skin I am always on the lookout for new product to try. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial serums and masks and ultimately have been pretty disappointed by most of them. Either they are overpriced, hard to use, smell bad, or contain too many nasty chemicals. I was really pleasently surprised after using this mask though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, with dry patches on my cheek and super sensitive skin that is acne prone. EVERYTHING makes me break out. I also think it is important to stick with natural products. This mask definitely fits the bill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t make me break out at all and almost everything makes me break out. you can spread it as thick or thin as you need and it dried a flexible clear gloss that was comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The mask is easy to put on and wash off and really seems to have made a big difference in my skin! It helped my inflamed pimples go way down and got rid of the redness on my cheeks. The dry spots on my cheeks were smooth and moisturized. It was pleasant and cool and the texture was enjoyable ( I can&#x27;t stand masks that dry hard and are hard to remove). It smells fairly neutral and left my skin feeling less inflamed, moisturized and much more balanced and happy than before. I use it in 1-2 hours treatments but it is definitely gentle enough to leave on overnight and even with my sensitive skin I plan on doing so soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are high quality and almost all natural. The botanicals that it claims to have in it are high on the list and in the product in measurable amounts. Overall I am so happy with this and will continue to use it weekly. I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble in the past finding a mask that wasn&#x27;t overpriced without nasty chemicals and didn&#x27;t make me break out. I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve finally found a go to product that leaves my face clear and less inflamed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully my review helps you make the decision to go ahead and give this product a try! Idon&#x27;t think it will disappoint you if you what you are looking for is something to help you have clean, balanced, soothed skin!</li>
            <li> I used this to help cool my skin after using the Via Cosmedics Exfoliating and Clarifying Ultra Mud mask. It has aloe, chamomile, etc and really did a good job to ease redness and burning after using a harsh treatment on the face. The product dries after a few minutes so you can leave it on for as long as you want. I leave it overnight after using the mask and just use a mild cleanser in the morning before I do my makeup routine. My skin generally gets really oily in the summer months so I don&#x27;t use a facial moisturizer as much. This gel makes up for the moisture lost. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sea Whip Cucumber Gel for several weeks. This is my first experience with VIA Cosmedics, &amp; it&#x27;s given me a positive impression of their brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel contains a lot of moisture while feeling lightweight on my face. My skin is softer &amp; smoother after using this product, &amp; I think it would also provide real relief to inflamed skin. I find it gentle enough to be used on a daily basis, but also giving good results if applied less frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big pluses for me are that VIA Cosmedics products are cruelty-free, &amp; that the gel contains a number of natural ingredients. It isn&#x27;t clear whether the fragrance is from a natural source, &amp; I do find it a bit strong when I open the jar, but not so noticeable after applying the gel. Many of the other ingredients such as cucumber, oatmeal &amp; calendula are ones that I&#x27;m familiar with as being very effective in supporting skin that both looks &amp; feels healthy. I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this product, &amp; will probably try others from this company.</li>
            <li> I used this product after using the MegaMud clay mask and it was the perfect finish to the mask. I actually left this product on overnight and washed off in the morning and my skin felt the softest it has ever felt! It has a slight cooling effect after using the mud mask and I just loved that feeling. It was quickly shipped and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I expected since everything I try sounds good in theory, but doesn&#x27;t really work that well.  This gel is absolutely great!  I have used it for several weeks now, usually about once a week or so.  I can&#x27;t leave it on for more than 5-7 minutes because it makes my skin breakout since almost everything makes my skin break out.  I really like the texture &amp; the smell.  It&#x27;s easy to put on and wash off.  It makes my skin nice and smooth and takes away the slightly dark areas under my eyes.  It&#x27;s supposed to plump your skin and it seems to do that with mine.  After a day or 2 is when I really notice the difference on my face.  It lasts a long time.  I store my jar under a dresser near a floor vent so when the a/c kicks on, it keeps the gel really cool.  When I go to use it, it&#x27;s a nice cool soothing gel on my face.  Just my preference...takes up less space than storing in a frig.</li>
            <li> Fast service. Quick delivery.  This stuff is amazing. A friend hooked me up once and once I put it on it seemed to cool very fast on face and left my face energized. Hydrated. Wonderful item.</li>
            <li> Cucumber is a rich source of antioxidants and helps sooth, hydrating and firming the skin. It feels so cooling when I use it on my face. Glycerin is a natural super moisturizer, helps the skin maintain a healthy balance of moisture. I have oily skin and this does not make my face oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been patting it on my face letting it dry for at least 20 minutes. I have even did what the company suggested for a cooler feel was to refrigerate the gel and it left an amazing coolness on my skin. After each use I rinse my skin with cool water. I have been using this mask twice a week. It makes my skin feel really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is made in the US and does not contain parabens, sulfates, or harmful ingredients and no cruelty to animals. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and words are my own.</li>
            <li> I cannot get over how great the Sea Whip Cucumber Soothing &amp; Hydrating Gel makes my skin feel. It gives the word soothing, a whole new meaning. It feels tingly, refreshing and cool. It isnâ€™t super sticky which I am used to with many gel like masks. I actually really like that it isnâ€™t. Plus, I love the gorgeous color of it. I realize that has nothing to do with it actually working, but the green is pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth, and almost clear, despite its color. It doesnâ€™t get super tight like other masks do. I left it on for about 25 minutes the first time, removed it and then moisturized and my face was super smooth and soft for days. Each time I use it, I feel better and better and my skin looks great. After the first initial use, I usually only leave it on about 10-15 minutes now. I tried it in the refrigerator once just to see what it would feel like chilled and it was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that this would be a great product to use after sun exposure for soothing relief. Not only does it feel great but it smells great too. Easy to clean off, actually just water was needed and it came off easily. I have made this a part of my beauty routine and typically use it once a week. My skin has never felt so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample to facilitate this review, however all opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>
            <li> This product left my skin feeling moisturized without leaving it greasy like most products. It gently soothed my face erasing the small lines around my forehead and eyes. The light cucumber scent is relaxing and not overpowering. I have combination skin so this product is perfect at moisturizing the drier areas on my face and not leaving an oily mess afterwards.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. This mask was so soothing and felt cooling and refreshing on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;2. It left my skin hydrated and I did not need to put on my daily facial moisturizer after using the product&lt;br /&gt;3. The redness in my face was reduced slightly but nothing to brag about&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. I did not realize any difference in the puffiness or firmness of my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would give this product 4 out of 5 stars and I plan to include it 1 a week into my facial care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I did receive this product for free to review</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly and I love the product itself! It&#x27;s very gentle and effectively &amp;#34;resets&amp;#34; my skin each time I use it.</li>
            <li> Once in a while I like to apply a facial mask to re-hydrate/moisturize as well as tone my face. It&#x27;s like a mini spa at home! This hydrating gel mask contains natural extracts of cucumber, chamomile, sugar cane, oatmeal, rose flower, marigold, and comfrey. Those ingredients not only help calm but also rehydrate and detoxify the skin. In this formula there you will also find aloe, and when all these ingredients are combined it provides an ample source of vitamins. The key ingredients in in this mask are hyaluronic acid, oatmeal, sea whip, argan oil, cucumber, allatonin, chamomile, and sugar cane extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid boosts the absorption and preserves water within the extracellular matrix which promotes not only hydration but volume, and density.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil provides moisturizing, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidants, and anti-aging benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Allatonin helps soften keratin, and dissolves dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;Oatmeal has properties to help calm, soothe, and protect skin in providing moisture retention, and keep skin firm.&lt;br /&gt;Marigold extract helps rejuvenate damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;Sea whip is a great healing property, that subdues enzymes that can cause irritation and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed using this gel mask. I liked the smell and how it felt when applied. You can keep it on for 10-20 minutes or you can leave it on for several hours, even overnight. After rinsing it off with cool water it felt nice and smooth, even slightly toned. This can be applied 2-3 times per week or, if you&#x27;re going for an intensive treatment, you can do it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free for reviewing purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> It calms my skin and seems to help heal acne-even under the surface inflamation.</li>
            <li> I am sooo pleased with this product! I have somewhat odd skin..it&#x27;s acne prone, oily, but also gets dry easily, so it&#x27;s hard for me to find facial products that really work for me. I received my Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel Mask very promptly, and was pleasantly surprised at the amount of product! It also comes in a nice jar that I can totally see myself putting to use once I use up all the gel. (:&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to receive it that I ran to the bathroom, washed my face and put the mask on right away! I dipped my finger in the jar and once I started applying it, quickly realized I got way to much..oops! A little bit goes a LONG way with this, which is great, that means even more use&#x27;s! The mask smells great! It almost has a light &#x27;cucumber melon&#x27; smell it to it (obviously the cucumber..but also a little fruity) which is one of my favorite scents. It&#x27;s a clear mask, so you can put this on and leave it on and still answer the door without freaking people out which is an added bonus for me. (;&lt;br /&gt;I waited ten minutes before washing it off (you can leave it on longer, even all night, I just didn&#x27;t have time!) and it almost felt slimy, which wasn&#x27;t a bad thing, I just wasn&#x27;t expecting that texture! The slimy texture was actually a good thing because it was easy to tell when I had washed it all of, I was worried about not knowing when it was off because it&#x27;s clear.&lt;br /&gt;Once the mask was off, my skin looked and felt amazing! The mask was so refreshing, and my skin felt so soft without being oily. I had a little dry skin that was also gone after the treatment. Plus, almost a week later and NO ACNE!! I&#x27;m super excited that I found a facial mask that takes care of all of my skin problems in one!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really looking forward to using the  Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel Mask more! I will definitely be doing overnight treatments, as well as using for sunburns and other skin issues! I highly recommend the Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel Mask to all skin types!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free to test and review, all opinions are my own! (:skin types!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free to test and review, all opinions are my own! (:</li>
            <li> awesome product.  I use it as a pain relief for my shoulder and it is working well. Thank you</li>
            <li> I normally struggle with dry skin. Since using the product, my skin feels soft and hydrated. I apply each night after I wash my face and sleep with it on. I wash it off when I wake up and my skin doesn&#x27;t even feel like it needs moisturizer. Such a great product. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the VIA Cosmedics Sea Whip Cucumber Gel for over a month now and have noticed a big improvement to the dry patches on my skin. Plus, overall, my skin is more smooth and looks great. I use it at night; after it dries I don&#x27;t even remember it&#x27;s still on my face. In the morning, it gets washed off when I shower and my skin is left soft and smooth. I look forward to seeing how it works after a day at the beach this summer.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and cooling on my skin, moisturizing and comfortable. I have somewhat sensitive skin and this is not irritating at all. I love using right after the UltraMUD mask.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Via Cosmetics Products I have combination skin that tends to get very dry in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the Gel was the Amazing smell and it actually feels like it starts soothing my skin as soon as I started applying it.The instructions say leave it on for 10-20 minutes I left it on for the full 20 minutes I noticed a improvement after my first use and  my skin definitely felt more hydrated.I am very impressed with this product and look forward to trying there other products as well.</li>
            <li> I received this free for testing purposes. All opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first gel mask, so I was obviously a bit leery smearing my face in a bright green gel. But once I got over my trepidation I was really pleased with this product. It&#x27;s been 90 degrees here, so placing this cool mask on my face was like enjoying the AC I don&#x27;t have. It was so cool and so soothing, I really didn&#x27;t want to take it off. The dry and over sunned skin on my face was hydrated and soothed without leaving the rest of my face greasy feeling. I adore this mask and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel was the first product I tried from VIA Cosmedics at the recommendation from my son.  I could not believe how refreshing and moisturizing it was!  Being an avid gardener, I will be outside for hours at a time. My skin becomes overly dry and sunburned in spite of the regular sunscreen applications. Following my shower, I apply this to my face and it becomes re-hydrated and healthy once again; for best results, I like to leave it on overnight!  I love how it calms down any skin irritation and windburn.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money</li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old man that has never used something like this.  I have some large pores due to being sun burnt for two years down in Argentina.  Young and dumb...didn&#x27;t need sun screen, or maybe it hadn&#x27;t been invented?  Well this magical gel has tightened those pores some.  It smells great and is nice and cool going on.  I have used it five days and wear it during the night.  I think it has helped, but this is far from an area in which I am an expert.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. The first time I wore it, I saw you could leave it on overnight and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I was surprised by how quickly it dried and how comfortable it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up the next morning, my skin was softer than it ever has been. The consistency is a little strange at first, but it smells great and is easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the difference instantly. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I liked the VIA mud mask so much that I decided to try their Cucumber Gel.  What a difference it has made on my skin! The fine lines around my eyes are gone, my blemishes and redness are gone, my skin is noticeably smoother and even, it&#x27;s less oily, my blackheads have diminished by 80%, and my pores are greatly minimized so my skin looks and feels extra smooth each day. It&#x27;s so easy to put on make up now! Especially in the winter when I&#x27;m used to having to cake it on to look decent.  The way I use it, to achieve those results, is to spread a thin layer on my whole face, or just the parts I want extra firming/clarifying, and leave it on overnight. You can halfway rub it in and it&#x27;ll dry in a matter of a couple minutes, and you won&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s on all night, until you rinse it off in the morning and are left with the softest, firmest skin you&#x27;ve had in ages!  It only takes a tiny bit each night, and I noticed the improvement immediately.  It says you can refrigerate it for extra &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effect but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  Probably feels great in the summer.</li>
            <li> This is my second jar!  I have been using it at night and wash it off in the morning. My skin has been really smooth and no irritation whatsoever.  I have very sensitive skin ( grew up with eczema), hence I am very careful choosing any skin product.  I check all the ingredients being used, and I feel safe to use it for my teenager.  It has cooling effect and really feel great to apply after getting tons of sun during summer.  I am going to need one more for the summer.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and after the first couple uses I felt my skin be smoother and more moisturized. Used with lotion my skin dries out much slower than just with lotion itself. It smells pretty good too! Just put it on for about 10 minutes and rinse off.</li>
