            <li>and he was thrilled with it!</li>
            <li>so I figured they might make just as good of shears</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what good scissors were like.</li>
            <li>This is a good option .</li>
            <li>seller was good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very  pleased with this scissors.  </li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and needed an inexpensive but good quality pair of shears.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I made the purchase!</li>
            <li>This product is ideal for quick trims.  </li>
            <li>I trim my own hair after each hair cut.  </li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and this pair of scissors</li>
            <li>For the price of a couple of trims, I can trim my own hair.</li>
            <li>No too much more to say about Scissors just that were good.</li>
            <li>I bought these scissors to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also comfortable, and of a very nice size.  </li>
            <li>Now if get many years out of them, I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li>The best compliment I can give them is that my hairstylist commended me on the job I did maintaining my bangs between trims, whereas she was not too thrilled with the job I did with my old scissors.  </li>
            <li>I was on the fence about spending more money on something I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use, but know that all Tweezerman products I have owned have been good.</li>
            <li>are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I purchased these shears so I could safely and efficiently manage my own split ends between haircuts</li>
            <li>With that said, if you are on a budget - they are the absolute best I&#x27;ve tried in this price range for a full haircut!</li>
            <li>I would suggest not using these if you actually cut/style your own hair, these are perfect for in between visits to your stylist.</li>
            <li>Seems very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>No signs of dulling after many many haircuts.</li>
            <li>I love these scissors.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>What more could you want???</li>
            <li>I love the lifetime sharpening aspects through Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li>In fact I wasn&#x27;t sure they even made them still.  </li>
            <li>I love these shears and the brand.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman products are top of the line.</li>
            <li>The six-inch length is mostly in the handles.  </li>
            <li>These are even better, with a micro-serration along the blade edge that locks hairs into place as the blades close.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for something to trim beard hair, bangs or even give whole haircuts at home, these should make you happy.  </li>
            <li>love them..</li>
            <li>pleased with these.</li>
            <li>The money I save more than paid for these scissors</li>
            <li>Great value for the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>shears are much better.</li>
            <li>These arrived in fine condition, but they are more like household shears rather than haircutting shears.  </li>
            <li>The difference between these and cheaper sheers is the precision feel and satisfying sound of how they cut.</li>
            <li>I also liked the fact they were made in Germany, and the price was right.</li>
            <li>I do my own hair - these are reasonably priced and work just fine!</li>
            <li>They are lightweight and easy to move around.</li>
            <li>The quality of the scissors make them easy to handle.</li>
            <li>These are also great for the occasional self trim - which my hairdresser should be somewhat glad of.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>They cut hair fine.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle, lightweight and precise.....</li>
            <li>Would have been happy at $5 but definitely not $16.35.  </li>
            <li>They fit my fingers comfortably.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they are not up to par for someone who would use them more frequently, but for more infrequent use, these are fantastic and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>They give a precision cut and are comfortable to hold; time will tell about their durability, but they&#x27;re made  in Germany</li>
            <li>These fit the bill and then some.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades are perfectly angled against one another, and they stay that way for the whole length of the cut, so no matter what part of the blades you&#x27;re using---near the tip or the pivot---they cut equally well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the measurements in the product description are as straightforward as they could be; the blade measures 2\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I have been resorting to using a cheap pair of regular scissors that seemed to work fairly well.</li>
            <li>So beware, they will snip right through skin!  </li>
            <li>These scissors were perfect for my large hands and very sharp..</li>
            <li>Look much better in photo, than in real life.  </li>
            <li>The full length from the end of the handle to the tip of the blade is about 5\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>They cut easily and crisply.</li>
            <li>Great for trimming bangs and other grooming for hair removal.  </li>
            <li>As it turns out, they work great and are sharp.  </li>
            <li>They fit in the hand so  comfortably, and produce a very clean-cut.</li>
            <li>The size allows for a tremendous amount of control and precision.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman always delivers the goods- high quality, light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are great little scissors.  </li>
            <li>I do not feel they are worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny and you get to save some money when you retouch your kids bangs with it.</li>
            <li>worth what i paid</li>
            <li>a guest trimming her own bangs accidentally snipped her finger open with these, so be careful!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice little scissors.  </li>
            <li>They stay sharp and fit nicely in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I decided to upgrade a notch when I replaced them, and this pair is just right.  </li>
            <li>but, they still arn&#x27;t right ..</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I bought one long time ago and liked it a lot</li>
            <li>shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>i like them very much.  </li>
            <li>This was for the first one purchased 2 years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure enough they do!!!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>They seem like it, but I still end up with split ends pretty soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are better than using regular scissors though.</li>
            <li>Had to buy another one, and you know what, the first one I bought was $40</li>
            <li>MEET THE NEEDS OF PRECISION,QUALITY,EASE OF USE AND POSITIVE RESULTS.BUY W/ CONFIDENCE .</li>
            <li>The product came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp, but you can be comfortable using with children because they cut so easily.  </li>
            <li>I save money by getting less haircuts, and I know I&#x27;m not cutting off more than I need to.</li>
            <li>While these aren&#x27;t the most expensive they are much better than what you buy at Walmart!</li>
            <li>They work great for cutting my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Best hair cutting shears I have owned.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>B000WI0640 Tweezerman  Stainless 2000 Styling Shears]], with the exception of the plastic-covered, rather than stainless steel handles, for about $2 less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shears perform better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Quality production and fast shipment--</li>
            <li>If you are looking more for the professional shears you might see someone use at a salon, these are definitely not it!</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and also very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Also bought the thinning sheers and for 53 cents less they are much heavier and feel like a better product.</li>
            <li>had a previous pair of Tweezermans that I loved, but they finally wore out, so I ordered these.  </li>
            <li>Spend the money for decent size.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp, light weight, soft feel to it, i gave it 4 stars just because its a bit small and doesn&#x27;t come with a case or something to put it in, other than that it&#x27;s an excellent product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>These shears have the look and feel of a high quality product (and they are of course).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Nice weight, extra sharp.</li>
            <li>They are quite sharp and cut easily.  </li>
            <li>Cut my hair easily because these are sharp and made for hair..  </li>
            <li>I ordered these because of all the great reviews, but was disappointed when I got them, they don&#x27;t close smooth</li>
            <li>Pro stylists probably need much fancier and more expensive shears, and if I were a pro, I probably would too---but for the rest of us, these are fantastic for home trimming.</li>
            <li>they are good but not great..  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s a sign of quality that I can cut as well with them in my left hand as in my right</li>
            <li>The new one has one edge serrated.  </li>
            <li>I was in search of a new pair and chose the Tweezerman Spirit 2000 because they look identical.   </li>
            <li>They are not too small for my hands and are very maneuverable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp, and very fine for reaching small places.</li>
            <li>like I said a tadd  small and lightweight but do the job for sure..  </li>
            <li>Very sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li>These shears are very sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li>These scissors are super sharp.</li>
            <li>really  helps especially with my bangs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tweezerman offers lifetime sharpening on its scissors.  </li>
            <li>My wife used it to cut my 7 months old hair without any issues.</li>
            <li>I bought these to cut for 4 year old son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>but I had hoped they would do a good job and chose to buy this expensive item.  </li>
            <li>They are perfect for that but are kinda on the small side for cutting a whole head of hair</li>
            <li>I guess they would be Ok if you were a very small person.</li>
            <li>The upper loop is a bit tight if I try to put my larger fingers in it, but I think it is designed to put your 4th finger in, and your pinkie on the little &amp;#34;saddle&amp;#34; at the end, which works great for control.</li>
            <li>Kinda small and light feel to em, not heavy duty.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and the haircuts go much quicker with these than other cheap ones that I have used.  </li>
            <li>Sharp enough, but not dangerously so for a wriggly 2 yr old.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the same name, but this is more thick.</li>
            <li>his first home cut the other day</li>
            <li>not the usual quality of tweezerman but for $23 I shouldn&#x27;t expected more.</li>
            <li>This does not work as good for hair cutting.</li>
            <li>I wonder if they would even be good for cutting nomal hair.</li>
            <li>These are superior quality hair cutting shears.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if these shears are sharp/professional grade enough to get a totally clean cut.</li>
            <li>Incidentally, it was my first attempt at cutting her hair as her hair growth definitely took a backseat in her development:).</li>
            <li>Just be careful as they are super sharp..</li>
            <li>Not NEAR as precise as my past shears.  </li>
            <li>Makes cutting my kids&#x27; hair much faster and better.</li>
            <li>Holy cow, my whole life</li>
            <li>Totally worth a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the high prices on some of the other styling shears.</li>
            <li>They are extremely sharp and get the job done quickly (leaving me with less scratches).</li>
            <li>Easy to cut my daughter&#x27;s toddler/baby hair which is currently still thin &amp; wavy.  </li>
            <li>They are dull and do not cut his hair worth a darn.  </li>

            <li> Easy to handle, lightweight and precise.....</li>
            <li> Would have been happy at $5 but definitely not $16.35.  </li>
            <li> They fit my fingers comfortably.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they are not up to par for someone who would use them more frequently, but for more infrequent use, these are fantastic and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> They give a precision cut and are comfortable to hold; time will tell about their durability, but they&#x27;re made  in Germany</li>
            <li> These fit the bill and then some.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades are perfectly angled against one another, and they stay that way for the whole length of the cut, so no matter what part of the blades you&#x27;re using---near the tip or the pivot---they cut equally well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the measurements in the product description are as straightforward as they could be; the blade measures 2\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have been resorting to using a cheap pair of regular scissors that seemed to work fairly well.</li>
            <li> So beware, they will snip right through skin!  </li>
            <li> These scissors were perfect for my large hands and very sharp..</li>
            <li> Look much better in photo, than in real life.  </li>
            <li> The full length from the end of the handle to the tip of the blade is about 5\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> They cut easily and crisply.</li>
            <li> Great for trimming bangs and other grooming for hair removal.  </li>
            <li> As it turns out, they work great and are sharp.  </li>
            <li> They fit in the hand so  comfortably, and produce a very clean-cut.</li>
            <li> The size allows for a tremendous amount of control and precision.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman always delivers the goods- high quality, light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are great little scissors.  </li>
            <li> I do not feel they are worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny and you get to save some money when you retouch your kids bangs with it.</li>
            <li> worth what i paid</li>
            <li> a guest trimming her own bangs accidentally snipped her finger open with these, so be careful!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very nice little scissors.  </li>
            <li> They stay sharp and fit nicely in your hand.  </li>
            <li> I decided to upgrade a notch when I replaced them, and this pair is just right.  </li>
            <li> but, they still arn&#x27;t right ..</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I bought one long time ago and liked it a lot</li>
            <li> shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> i like them very much.  </li>
            <li> This was for the first one purchased 2 years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure enough they do!!!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> They seem like it, but I still end up with split ends pretty soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are better than using regular scissors though.</li>
            <li> Had to buy another one, and you know what, the first one I bought was $40</li>
            <li> MEET THE NEEDS OF PRECISION,QUALITY,EASE OF USE AND POSITIVE RESULTS.BUY W/ CONFIDENCE .</li>
            <li> The product came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, but you can be comfortable using with children because they cut so easily.  </li>
            <li> I save money by getting less haircuts, and I know I&#x27;m not cutting off more than I need to.</li>
            <li> While these aren&#x27;t the most expensive they are much better than what you buy at Walmart!</li>
            <li> They work great for cutting my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Best hair cutting shears I have owned.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> B000WI0640 Tweezerman  Stainless 2000 Styling Shears]], with the exception of the plastic-covered, rather than stainless steel handles, for about $2 less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shears perform better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Quality production and fast shipment--</li>
            <li> If you are looking more for the professional shears you might see someone use at a salon, these are definitely not it!</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and also very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Also bought the thinning sheers and for 53 cents less they are much heavier and feel like a better product.</li>
            <li> had a previous pair of Tweezermans that I loved, but they finally wore out, so I ordered these.  </li>
            <li> Spend the money for decent size.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, light weight, soft feel to it, i gave it 4 stars just because its a bit small and doesn&#x27;t come with a case or something to put it in, other than that it&#x27;s an excellent product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> These shears have the look and feel of a high quality product (and they are of course).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Nice weight, extra sharp.</li>
            <li> They are quite sharp and cut easily.  </li>
            <li> Cut my hair easily because these are sharp and made for hair..  </li>
            <li> I ordered these because of all the great reviews, but was disappointed when I got them, they don&#x27;t close smooth</li>
            <li> Pro stylists probably need much fancier and more expensive shears, and if I were a pro, I probably would too---but for the rest of us, these are fantastic for home trimming.</li>
            <li> they are good but not great..  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s a sign of quality that I can cut as well with them in my left hand as in my right</li>
            <li> The new one has one edge serrated.  </li>
            <li> I was in search of a new pair and chose the Tweezerman Spirit 2000 because they look identical.   </li>
            <li> They are not too small for my hands and are very maneuverable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp, and very fine for reaching small places.</li>
            <li> like I said a tadd  small and lightweight but do the job for sure..  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li> These shears are very sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li> These scissors are super sharp.</li>
            <li> really  helps especially with my bangs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tweezerman offers lifetime sharpening on its scissors.  </li>
            <li> My wife used it to cut my 7 months old hair without any issues.</li>
            <li> I bought these to cut for 4 year old son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> but I had hoped they would do a good job and chose to buy this expensive item.  </li>
            <li> They are perfect for that but are kinda on the small side for cutting a whole head of hair</li>
            <li> I guess they would be Ok if you were a very small person.</li>
            <li> The upper loop is a bit tight if I try to put my larger fingers in it, but I think it is designed to put your 4th finger in, and your pinkie on the little &amp;#34;saddle&amp;#34; at the end, which works great for control.</li>
            <li> Kinda small and light feel to em, not heavy duty.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and the haircuts go much quicker with these than other cheap ones that I have used.  </li>
            <li> Sharp enough, but not dangerously so for a wriggly 2 yr old.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the same name, but this is more thick.</li>
            <li> his first home cut the other day</li>
            <li> not the usual quality of tweezerman but for $23 I shouldn&#x27;t expected more.</li>
            <li> This does not work as good for hair cutting.</li>
            <li> I wonder if they would even be good for cutting nomal hair.</li>
            <li> These are superior quality hair cutting shears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these shears are sharp/professional grade enough to get a totally clean cut.</li>
            <li> Incidentally, it was my first attempt at cutting her hair as her hair growth definitely took a backseat in her development:).</li>
            <li> Just be careful as they are super sharp..</li>
            <li> Not NEAR as precise as my past shears.  </li>
            <li> Makes cutting my kids&#x27; hair much faster and better.</li>
            <li> Holy cow, my whole life</li>
            <li> Totally worth a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the high prices on some of the other styling shears.</li>
            <li> They are extremely sharp and get the job done quickly (leaving me with less scratches).</li>
            <li> Easy to cut my daughter&#x27;s toddler/baby hair which is currently still thin &amp; wavy.  </li>
            <li> They are dull and do not cut his hair worth a darn.  </li>
            <li> If you need a small, high quality shear at a great price you will not be disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> - I found that out when I cut my right thumb badly and had to use my left hand to clip first aid tape - with my old scissors</li>
            <li> Not a sharp as expected for the price</li>
            <li> The constructions seems like it will last a long time, unlike cheaper shears.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend - other reviews for this product</li>
            <li> When shears aren&#x27;t sharp enough, they \\&quot;push\\&quot; the hair away rather than cut it.  </li>
            <li> They pull his hair and do not come close to any of the other reviews I read that rated above a 3.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found these to be a bit stiff (which I could live with) and not sharp enough (which I can&#x27;t live with).  </li>
            <li> I had purchased another brand at the same price point that had great reviews but were the worst pair of scissors I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely sharper than your average pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> they do cut hair a little at a time, i do not think they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not even comparable with the ones you find at the drugstores, which is what I have been using before.</li>
            <li> Too much trouble to send them back, so will keep them.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> The steel feels very hard, probably a high carbon steel.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to improve the health of my long, thick hair, and sometimes even when being very careful, split ends are inevitable.</li>
            <li> They are sharp though and do cut hair.</li>
            <li> They are quite sharp however.</li>
            <li> The tip of the scissors is too sharp.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely sharp and made of Solingen steel from Germany.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These sheers have a high-quality feel, both in your hand and as they cut (must be tremendously sharp).</li>
            <li> I bought them and they seem to be quite sharp and they cuts through hair like a breeze.</li>
            <li> These are extremely sharp.  </li>
            <li> THEY WERE REPLACED DUE TO LOSS</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp and won&#x27;t drag on your hair.</li>
            <li> they are sharp  but, just hard to cut hair when they don&#x27;t open and close</li>
            <li> i bought these scissors for clipping ends bangs they are very sharp like the scissors in a hair salon not like the $3  dollar ones from discount stores sharp scissors</li>
            <li> Very sharp, be careful around fingers!</li>
            <li> So sharp, that I accidentally cut into my finger!</li>
            <li> (They&#x27;re also very sharp:  </li>
            <li> Very sharp scissors and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Even a slight touch on your head will hurt.</li>
            <li> As a result, these cut hair at the exact angle and length you intended, instead of shoving hair along the blade before cutting it.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp enough  but the cutting blades are inconveniently short.  </li>
            <li> And cost too little to return.  </li>
            <li> I somehow misplaced it and ordered a replacement.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.  </li>
            <li> This is a waste.</li>
            <li> My husband used my hair-trimming scissors to pry something open, which resulted in broken scissors.  </li>
            <li> a little too small but very sharp, not sure if I would pay the price for these scissors again..  </li>
            <li> As someone who uses buzzer shears to cut my hair short, the Tweezerman is utterly useless for my needs.  </li>
            <li> Way too small.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please keep in mind that the blade is quite small.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy them at beauty supply stores, but I decided to order some online this time.  </li>
            <li> I like the small size of these shears.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the small side with regards to the finger openings.  </li>
            <li> 20 years old and the plastic finger loops were broken and it made using them difficult.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much worthless.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelmingly good quality anyway.</li>
            <li> For the price they have let me down in that the quality cannot manage cutting nose hairs without damaging the nose tissue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for over 37 years now, so I&#x27;ve purchased quite a few hair cutting shears.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought these for cutting split hairs.</li>
            <li> I have cut my husband&#x27;s hair for over 40 years but never had &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; hair cutting scissors..</li>
            <li> and there can always be a bad apple among the bunch.  </li>
            <li> i was carrying it in my carry-on :(  </li>
            <li> Hate it.</li>
            <li> As my son just said, &amp;#34;I hate this scissors.&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> Best hair cutting shears I have owned. Very sharp and precise.  I trim my own hair after each hair cut.  This was for the first one purchased 2 years ago.&lt;br /&gt; I somehow misplaced it and ordered a replacement.  The new one has one edge serrated.  This does not work as good for hair cutting.</li>
            <li> Great price, great quality and great all around. No signs of dulling after many many haircuts. I love these scissors.</li>
            <li> Just received the scissors today.  Paid $16.35.  Product price is now $10.99.  I do not feel they are worth the money.  Seems very cheaply made.  Looks and feels like scissors that you would buy in a $ store.  They are sharp though and do cut hair. They weigh only .6 oz.  Would have been happy at $5 but definitely not $16.35.  Also bought the thinning sheers and for 53 cents less they are much heavier and feel like a better product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m male,6 foot and 200 pounds and I couldn&#x27;t get my fingers in those tiny openings if my life depended on it. What were they thinking ? I guess they would be Ok if you were a very small person.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of Hoffritz shears that were appx. 20 years old and the plastic finger loops were broken and it made using them difficult.  I had used them often to clip nose and ear hairs with great ease and comfort.  I was in search of a new pair and chose the Tweezerman Spirit 2000 because they look identical.   I know they are not made for clipping nose hair but I had hoped they would do a good job and chose to buy this expensive item.  For the price they have let me down in that the quality cannot manage cutting nose hairs without damaging the nose tissue. As someone who uses buzzer shears to cut my hair short, the Tweezerman is utterly useless for my needs.  I wonder if they would even be good for cutting nomal hair.</li>
            <li> These shears are very sharp and precise.  Great for trimming bangs and other grooming for hair removal.  Very pleased with this item!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to improve the health of my long, thick hair, and sometimes even when being very careful, split ends are inevitable. I purchased these shears so I could safely and efficiently manage my own split ends between haircuts and it does the job!</li>
            <li> Way too small.  Pretty much worthless. And cost too little to return.  Look much better in photo, than in real life.  A waste of money.  Spend the money for decent size.  This is a waste.</li>
            <li> What a great pair of styling shears. I gave my husband his first home cut the other day and he was thrilled with it! I owe this to the shears, they are perfect. They cut easily and crisply. They fit my fingers comfortably. They are lightweight and easy to move around. I am so pleased with this purchase. They also come in a great see through container. What more could you want???</li>
            <li> Not NEAR as precise as my past shears.  Hate it.</li>
            <li> I am a stay at home mom who cuts hair for two kids and a husband, plus my own trims and these are the best scissors I have used.  They are not too small for my hands and are very maneuverable and easy to use.  I love the lifetime sharpening aspects through Tweezerman.  They are very sharp and the haircuts go much quicker with these than other cheap ones that I have used.  I&#x27;m sure they are not up to par for someone who would use them more frequently, but for more infrequent use, these are fantastic and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> My husband used my hair-trimming scissors to pry something open, which resulted in broken scissors.  I decided to upgrade a notch when I replaced them, and this pair is just right.  They give a precision cut and are comfortable to hold; time will tell about their durability, but they&#x27;re made  in Germany so I&#x27;m optimistic.</li>
            <li> Precision made, cuts well. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have a pair of these that I have used or about 10 years and they still have not needed sharpening.  In fact I wasn&#x27;t sure they even made them still.  Wanted to get another pair if they did and sure enough they do!!!  The only difference in mine is they don&#x27;t have the added piece on the finger hole part to rest your ring finger on.  Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> These are great little scissors.  I cut my own hair and needed an inexpensive but good quality pair of shears.  These fit the bill and then some.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The product came pretty fast. I really like it. it It does its job for my split ends. I can only recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love these shears and the brand. I use tweezerman for my ungodly eyebrows so I figured they might make just as good of shears and they do! For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I do wish they were a tad bit longer but I realize the length prior to purchasing them which is why I didn&#x27;t take off any points for that.. I would suggest not using these if you actually cut/style your own hair, these are perfect for in between visits to your stylist. With that said, if you are on a budget - they are the absolute best I&#x27;ve tried in this price range for a full haircut!</li>
            <li> They cut hair fine.  My thumb gets stuck in the handle - I need to try on the next shears I purchase!</li>
            <li> These shears have the look and feel of a high quality product (and they are of course). They fit in the hand so  comfortably, and produce a very clean-cut. Make&#x27;s you feel like a Pro the minute you pick them up! If you need a small, high quality shear at a great price you will not be disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> i bought these scissors for clipping ends bangs they are very sharp like the scissors in a hair salon not like the $3  dollar ones from discount stores sharp scissors help your ends not to split when cut</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely sharper than your average pair of scissors. Though I find that these feel quite dinky. Kinda small and light feel to em, not heavy duty. They are quite sharp however.</li>
            <li> Easy to cut my daughter&#x27;s toddler/baby hair which is currently still thin &amp; wavy.  Incidentally, it was my first attempt at cutting her hair as her hair growth definitely took a backseat in her development:). Sharp enough, but not dangerously so for a wriggly 2 yr old.  Definitely recommend - other reviews for this product helped me make the decision to purchase.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, light weight, soft feel to it, i gave it 4 stars just because its a bit small and doesn&#x27;t come with a case or something to put it in, other than that it&#x27;s an excellent product</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and this pair of scissors really  helps especially with my bangs. It&#x27;s really not even comparable with the ones you find at the drugstores, which is what I have been using before. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman products are top of the line. For the price of a couple of trims, I can trim my own hair. The quality of the scissors make them easy to handle.</li>
            <li> The tip of the scissors is too sharp.  Even a slight touch on your head will hurt. This is not for a haircut.</li>
            <li> I bought these for trimming my bangs.  They are quite sharp and cut easily.  The best compliment I can give them is that my hairstylist commended me on the job I did maintaining my bangs between trims, whereas she was not too thrilled with the job I did with my old scissors.  (I believe they were Revlon, purchased from the drugstore.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep in mind that the blade is quite small.  I don&#x27;t think the measurements in the product description are as straightforward as they could be; the blade measures 2\\&quot;.  The full length from the end of the handle to the tip of the blade is about 5\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve added a photo to show the scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These scissors are identical to [[ASIN:B000WI0640 Tweezerman  Stainless 2000 Styling Shears]], with the exception of the plastic-covered, rather than stainless steel handles, for about $2 less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezerman offers lifetime sharpening on its scissors.  Details can be found on the Tweezerman website.</li>
            <li> The shears perform better than I expected.  My wife used it to cut my 7 months old hair without any issues. They are very sharp, but you can be comfortable using with children because they cut so easily.  The constructions seems like it will last a long time, unlike cheaper shears.</li>
            <li> These scissors are super sharp. I brought them to trim split ends and bangs. They are perfect for that but are kinda on the small side for cutting a whole head of hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for over 37 years now, so I&#x27;ve purchased quite a few hair cutting shears.  I usually buy them at beauty supply stores, but I decided to order some online this time.  Unfortunately I found these to be a bit stiff (which I could live with) and not sharp enough (which I can&#x27;t live with).  When shears aren&#x27;t sharp enough, they \\&quot;push\\&quot; the hair away rather than cut it.  I suppose sharpening shears is a science and there can always be a bad apple among the bunch.  I decided to return these.</li>
            <li> Holy cow, my whole life I didn&#x27;t know what good scissors were like. These are GOOD scissors! Makes cutting my kids&#x27; hair much faster and better. Totally worth a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> These scissors were perfect for my large hands and very sharp.. Exactly what I was looking for. I use them to trim my hair in between visits to the salon and they work great. Just be careful as they are super sharp..</li>
            <li> not the usual quality of tweezerman but for $23 I shouldn&#x27;t expected more. they do cut hair a little at a time, i do not think they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought these shears to replace a pair of Tweezerman shears I lost.  I cut all my families hair and these work great.  They stay sharp and fit nicely in your hand.  I went to buy these at my beauty supply and after looking at the price.... I bought from Amazon instead!</li>
            <li> Quality production and fast shipment-- Cut my hair easily because these are sharp and made for hair..  This is a good option .</li>
            <li> Very nice! Worked perfect and now I had the job done! No too much more to say about Scissors just that were good.</li>
            <li> This is the best scissors to cut your own hair. It&#x27;s worth every penny and you get to save some money when you retouch your kids bangs with it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the high prices on some of the other styling shears. I do my own hair - these are reasonably priced and work just fine!</li>
            <li> Easy to handle, lightweight and precise.....everything you look for in styling shears</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very  pleased with this scissors.  I use it for trimming my mustache and beard.  It is extremely sharp and made of Solingen steel from Germany.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I bought these for cutting split hairs. It does the job well. I like the small size of these shears.</li>
            <li> I have cut my husband&#x27;s hair for over 40 years but never had &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; hair cutting scissors..yes, they do make a difference! While these aren&#x27;t the most expensive they are much better than what you buy at Walmart!</li>
            <li> Super sharp, and very fine for reaching small places. The steel feels very hard, probably a high carbon steel. worth what i paid</li>
            <li> I bought these to cut for 4 year old son&#x27;s hair.  They are dull and do not cut his hair worth a darn.  They pull his hair and do not come close to any of the other reviews I read that rated above a 3.  As my son just said, &amp;#34;I hate this scissors.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product is ideal for quick trims.  It&#x27;s on the small side with regards to the finger openings.  All in all it does what I need it to do for the price.</li>
            <li> These are superior quality hair cutting shears. The size allows for a tremendous amount of control and precision. Nice weight, extra sharp. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I bought these to trim my cat&#x27;s butt hair.  They are extremely sharp and get the job done quickly (leaving me with less scratches).</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp enough  but the cutting blades are inconveniently short.  The six-inch length is mostly in the handles.  Not overwhelmingly good quality anyway.</li>
            <li> These shears are quite excellent:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a previous pair of Tweezermans that I loved, but they finally wore out, so I ordered these.  These are even better, with a micro-serration along the blade edge that locks hairs into place as the blades close.  As a result, these cut hair at the exact angle and length you intended, instead of shoving hair along the blade before cutting it.  It&#x27;s quite effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are perfectly angled against one another, and they stay that way for the whole length of the cut, so no matter what part of the blades you&#x27;re using---near the tip or the pivot---they cut equally well.  They&#x27;re also comfortable, and of a very nice size.  (They&#x27;re also very sharp:  a guest trimming her own bangs accidentally snipped her finger open with these, so be careful!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to trim beard hair, bangs or even give whole haircuts at home, these should make you happy.  Pro stylists probably need much fancier and more expensive shears, and if I were a pro, I probably would too---but for the rest of us, these are fantastic for home trimming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these shears are sharp/professional grade enough to get a totally clean cut. They seem like it, but I still end up with split ends pretty soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are better than using regular scissors though.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago and it has been perfect for my obsessive need to snip off my split ends. I save money by getting less haircuts, and I know I&#x27;m not cutting off more than I need to. Very sharp, be careful around fingers! I gave myself a deep cut one time when I was stressed out and started twiddling with them. I&#x27;m here buying a second pair to keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> Not a sharp as expected for the price</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to cut my own hair. Really great quality! love them.. They are very sharp and also very comfortable.</li>
            <li> These sheers have a high-quality feel, both in your hand and as they cut (must be tremendously sharp). The difference between these and cheaper sheers is the precision feel and satisfying sound of how they cut.</li>
            <li> I bought them and they seem to be quite sharp and they cuts through hair like a breeze. Now if get many years out of them, I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very nice little scissors.  I thinkit&#x27;s a sign of quality that I can cut as well with them in my left hand as in my right - I found that out when I cut my right thumb badly and had to use my left hand to clip first aid tape - with my old scissors I could never make them work in my left hand.  These are also great for the occasional self trim - which my hairdresser should be somewhat glad of.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with these.</li>
            <li> These are extremely sharp.  I accidentally snipped part of my hand when I was holding my bangs out to cut them.  Novice hair cutter mistake.  So beware, they will snip right through skin!  They work great for cutting my fine hair.</li>
            <li> The very best trimmers for nose and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> a little too small but very sharp, not sure if I would pay the price for these scissors again..  I justify the price because my wife cuts my hair now and The money I save more than paid for these scissors my wife seems happy with them  they are good but not great..  like I said a tadd  small and lightweight but do the job for sure..  seller was good no problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  patrick</li>
            <li> I had scissors and I wanted to give to my son the same one. I ordered the same name, but this is more thick.</li>
            <li> These arrived in fine condition, but they are more like household shears rather than haircutting shears.  I have thicker hair, and the blade seemed to slip a bit as I was trying to cut it.  If you are looking more for the professional shears you might see someone use at a salon, these are definitely not it!</li>
            <li> I bought these to cut my 3 year-old&#x27;s hair as he won&#x27;t sit still in a salon. I had purchased another brand at the same price point that had great reviews but were the worst pair of scissors I have ever owned. I have been resorting to using a cheap pair of regular scissors that seemed to work fairly well. I was on the fence about spending more money on something I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use, but know that all Tweezerman products I have owned have been good. I also liked the fact they were made in Germany, and the price was right. As it turns out, they work great and are sharp.  So sharp, that I accidentally cut into my finger!</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD MY HAIR CUT W/ TYPE/BRAND OF SCISSORS FOR 25+ YEARS . THEY WERE REPLACED DUE TO LOSS&lt;br /&gt;NOT WEAR . MY EVAL IS ALL ACES . MEET THE NEEDS OF PRECISION,QUALITY,EASE OF USE AND POSITIVE RESULTS.BUY W/ CONFIDENCE .</li>
            <li> Tweezerman always delivers the goods- high quality, light and easy to use. Great value for the reasonable price. I&#x27;m a perfectionist when it comes to the best &#x27;tools&#x27; for whatever purpose.</li>
            <li> Very sharp scissors and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> i like them very much.  They are  very handy to trime my husband&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;They are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> These work great. The upper loop is a bit tight if I try to put my larger fingers in it, but I think it is designed to put your 4th finger in, and your pinkie on the little &amp;#34;saddle&amp;#34; at the end, which works great for control.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp and won&#x27;t drag on your hair. I bought one long time ago and liked it a lot but it got tossed in airport coz i was carrying it in my carry-on :(  Had to buy another one, and you know what, the first one I bought was $40+ and this time it only costed me $20+.</li>
            <li> They arrived quicker than I anticipated and are very good quality scissors.  I am glad I made the purchase!</li>
            <li> I ordered these because of all the great reviews, but was disappointed when I got them, they don&#x27;t close smooth I tried to adjust them but, they still arn&#x27;t right ..they are sharp  but, just hard to cut hair when they don&#x27;t open and close right..like the blades are rubbing together..Too much trouble to send them back, so will keep them.&lt;br /&gt;Other shears are much better.I would never order these again.</li>
