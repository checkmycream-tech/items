            <li>So bonus points for good packaging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To give the product a fair chance, you will have to use it for a minimum of 4 weeks</li>
            <li>- this allows you to fairly assess how it is working</li>
            <li>GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li>It does a very good job on fine and medium depth wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I was very glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>It is about 1/10th of the cost and works SO MUCH BETTER!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen amazing results with this moisturizer</li>
            <li>This rich lotion glides on, feels great, covers well.  </li>
            <li>This is a good lotion; light and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>There is NO fragrance, and the lotion is very light.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite face lotion.</li>
            <li>My skin that is prone to acne has got better since I started using it.</li>
            <li>There are some L&#x27;Oreal face products where I can&#x27;t stand the scent; this one is okay</li>
            <li>your skin will LOVE this.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!  </li>
            <li>For me, a squirt or two is all I need, so it dispenses perfectly and one bottle lasts a long time for me.</li>
            <li>This is a very light smooth textured lotion.</li>
            <li>warning I have to give is that the packaging makes some very bold claims about the efficacy of the product, but they&#x27;re based on a 50 person focus group.</li>
            <li>taking away the bright, light, healthy, natural glow that should radiate as skin care and makeup is supposed to enhance your skin&#x27;s appearamce.  </li>

            <li>I initally bought this Filler months ago after Target and drug store was out of my Loreal Revitalift Day lotion with spf which had worked fine for me.  </li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly.  </li>

            <li>It makes my face and neck feel so smooth after I put it on.  </li>
            <li>there were other moisturizers that would do just as great or better..</li>
            <li>Strong smell of alcohol, and made my neck super itchy.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this moisturizer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very well pleased and will buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li>Women who are pregnant should not use octinoxate because it produces estrogen-like effects.</li>
            <li>It is also a fairly economical choice.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>This lotion is easily absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels so soft after applying the lotion.</li>
            <li>- I promise this will be well worth the time and</li>
            <li>which proves not to be the case!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also known to damage the immune system in rare cases, impairing a person&#x27;s ability to fight disease and repair tissue damage.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t find it right for me..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice anything special in the youthful glow department, but I like the way this lotion goes on and feels.</li>
            <li>AND I RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li>It did exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li>My acne has CEASED, my skin looks more youthful...much smoother and brighter, under eye area is brighter, and my makeup looks even BETTER than it ever did in the past.  </li>
            <li>Remember, i am still on the first bottle I bought.  </li>
            <li>I can confidently go without makeup if necessary.  </li>
            <li>but I would read about it first before you do..</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast, leaving your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I had just bought mine and choose to throw it away because it just wasn&#x27;t worth it and new</li>
            <li>I am 48 years old and have mild acne outbreaks and combination skin.  </li>
            <li>Did not see much results.</li>
            <li>I really like the size of the bottle and the fact that it has never, ever spilled or blown up in my makeup bag during travel.</li>
            <li>I wondered if this would really work well.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to like this product.</li>
            <li>This product is especially good for me when I use it in the winter cold months</li>
            <li>although I just purchased this new bottly from Amazon...!  </li>
            <li>I have tried other lotions and this is the only one that is the perfect consistency for me - not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>It is sheer doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and makes you skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li>My skin looks much smoother and supple and it is soft.  </li>
            <li>am happy to  report i no longer use either of those expensive skin care products...</li>
            <li>look much smoother and barely noticeable after using this product.  </li>
            <li>Well, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>but I have complete confidence in the product.  </li>
            <li>atleast once every few months to remove dead skin layers...especially good for aging skin.  </li>
            <li>the past, I believed the expensive skin care and makeup products werebetter (if you are paying more, you are getting better quality...)</li>
            <li>My skin does not dry out before nighttime either.      </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My skin does not dry out before nighttime either.      </li>
            <li> I now use this collagen filler and when I apply foundation, I use vitamin rich Bobbi Brown face base for smooth coverage of makeup...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a believer in any &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34; for aging, but if I&#x27;m going to moisturize I want something light that has the potential to nourish my skin and provide a bit something extra instead of my usual harsh creams.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re probably not going to get anything like the results described but you will get a decent moisturizer for beneath make up, or just for day wear, and it has an SPF 15+ rating that gives you a little protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> Because I used this when I ran out of the other day lotion, I forced myself to try it because the collagen filler sounded like it was worth trying...</li>
            <li> It lasts all day, and a bottle goes a long way when using it for your face.</li>
            <li> I spent over $100 on a similar product at the spa and after 4 weeks of use, I saw no results.  </li>
            <li> I only need a little to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> Goes well with the other set of this brand.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that about any other lotion I have ever tried to take on a trip.</li>
            <li> you want to see aged skin improve, try this!</li>
            <li> After applying the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Moisture Filler Day Lotion I let it dry for a few minutes and then apply my makeup.  </li>
            <li> those items clogged my pores, weighed my skin down...</li>
            <li> I could have but always sought and used other products to &#x27;settle&#x27; for...don&#x27;t do it anymore ladies!  </li>
            <li> (there is a slight odor of alcohol).</li>
            <li> and I guess the slight smell is from the SPF.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be too oily and heavy</li>
            <li> atleast a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> This lotion absorbs into the skin quickly - a little dab will do you!  </li>
            <li> It has the same consistency (and, unfortunately, smell) as sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30s, so</li>
            <li> For years I used both smash box face base and Lancome eye concealer for my skin to look halfway decent...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, but I do have some small, thin wrinkles by my eyes and forehead</li>
            <li> I consider myself hard to impress and I&#x27;ve tried all of the expensive spa creams.  </li>
            <li> It was as if I hid behind my makeup and it masked the way my complexion should be - rather than allowing my skin to breathe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday with or with out my base makeup.  </li>
            <li> but I found out that the highest SPF ingredient is SO harmful to you and can cause horrible things in your body.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the product. After application the skin becomes silky. Do not like the smell (there is a slight odor of alcohol). When to apply the lotion to the area closer to the eye, the eyes begin to turn red with tears flowing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face lotion. It will not make your face greasy, it WILL feel great to put on after washing your face. It lasts all day, and a bottle goes a long way when using it for your face.</li>
            <li> I saw the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Moisture Filler Day Lotion advertised and decided to give it a try.  I was very glad that I did.  It glides on smoothly.  It moisturizes my skin without making it oily.  My skin does not dry out before nighttime either.      The L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Moisture Filler Day Lotion moisturizes without being oily or greasy which is important for my skin.      After applying the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Moisture Filler Day Lotion I let it dry for a few minutes and then apply my makeup.  My makeup glides on smoothly over the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Moisture Filler Day Lotion.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen amazing results with this moisturizer but my skin does definitely feel softer after using it. It has the same consistency (and, unfortunately, smell) as sunscreen. Your skin doesn&#x27;t look shiny or feel oily after using it. It is also a fairly economical choice.&lt;br /&gt;One warning I have to give is that the packaging makes some very bold claims about the efficacy of the product, but they&#x27;re based on a 50 person focus group. You&#x27;re probably not going to get anything like the results described but you will get a decent moisturizer for beneath make up, or just for day wear, and it has an SPF 15+ rating that gives you a little protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it broke my face out after a couple of uses. It may be fine for others though. I just didn&#x27;t find it right for me..</li>
            <li> I think this is a great facial cream for all types of skin. It absorbs fast, leaving your skin smooth and soft. It mosturizes  well without making it oily. My skin that is prone to acne has got better since I started using it. I&#x27;m very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> This is a very light smooth textured lotion. Goes well with the other set of this brand. I thought it would be too oily and heavy but, it is just the oposite. The amount is not enough.I wish there were larger bottles.</li>
            <li> Did not see much results.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and lives up to it guarantee !! Makes skin look moist and younger all day.  After using for bout 3 months a lot of the fine wrinkles are gone!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried other lotions and this is the only one that is the perfect consistency for me - not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice anything special in the youthful glow department, but I like the way this lotion goes on and feels. For me, a squirt or two is all I need, so it dispenses perfectly and one bottle lasts a long time for me. I really like the size of the bottle and the fact that it has never, ever spilled or blown up in my makeup bag during travel. I cannot say that about any other lotion I have ever tried to take on a trip. So bonus points for good packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just start to use this product, so I don&#x27;t know how is it going to effect  for my face...</li>
            <li> I consider myself hard to impress and I&#x27;ve tried all of the expensive spa creams.  I spent over $100 on a similar product at the spa and after 4 weeks of use, I saw no results.  I tried this product on a whim.  It is about 1/10th of the cost and works SO MUCH BETTER!  It is a great moisturizer and my after about 5-7 days of use you see noticeable improvement!  My skin looks much smoother and supple and it is soft.  I am in my late 30s, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, but I do have some small, thin wrinkles by my eyes and forehead look much smoother and barely noticeable after using this product.  I love this product!  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This lotion is easily absorbed into my skin.I love how my skin feels so soft after applying the lotion. There are some L&#x27;Oreal face products where I can&#x27;t stand the scent; this one is okay and I guess the slight smell is from the SPF. I only need a little to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> I wondered if this would really work well. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. It did exactly what it said it would. The price was great and so are the results. I&#x27;m very well pleased and will buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I like this face cream a lot because it has sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t make me break out like some of them do.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday with or with out my base makeup.  It is sheer doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and makes you skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Strong smell of alcohol, and made my neck super itchy. It&#x27;s a bummer. I was really hoping to like this product.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  I&#x27;ve been ordering the day lotion for four years now.  It makes my face and neck feel so smooth after I put it on.  This product is especially good for me when I use it in the winter cold months</li>
            <li> I initally bought this Filler months ago after Target and drug store was out of my Loreal Revitalift Day lotion with spf which had worked fine for me.  I am 48 years old and have mild acne outbreaks and combination skin.  Because I used this when I ran out of the other day lotion, I forced myself to try it because the collagen filler sounded like it was worth trying...atleast a few weeks.  Well, I have been using it for over a month (day and evening) and still using it - although I just purchased this new bottly from Amazon...!  What a great price too!  I hope this line is not discontinued but the Revitalift line I used the day lotion, evening lotion and the concentrate you can apply prior to makeup...I now use this collagen filler and when I apply foundation, I use vitamin rich Bobbi Brown face base for smooth coverage of makeup...&lt;br /&gt;This collagen filler has given me GREAT results.  My acne has CEASED, my skin looks more youthful...much smoother and brighter, under eye area is brighter, and my makeup looks even BETTER than it ever did in the past.  For years I used both smash box face base and Lancome eye concealer for my skin to look halfway decent...but I looked ashy/dull.  It was as if I hid behind my makeup and it masked the way my complexion should be - rather than allowing my skin to breathe.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to  report i no longer use either of those expensive skin care products...those items clogged my pores, weighed my skin down...taking away the bright, light, healthy, natural glow that should radiate as skin care and makeup is supposed to enhance your skin&#x27;s appearamce.  This collagen filler  WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;To give the product a fair chance, you will have to use it for a minimum of 4 weeks - this allows you to fairly assess how it is working / how your skin responds to it.  Trial and error - I promise this will be well worth the time and effort - aging skin will appreciate this!&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I believed the expensive skin care and makeup products werebetter (if you are paying more, you are getting better quality...) which proves not to be the case!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you want to see aged skin improve, try this! I also suggest microdermabrasion skin treatments atleast once every few months to remove dead skin layers...especially good for aging skin.  MOISTURING is key to skin&#x27;s improved appearance. You deserve to be pampered your skin will LOVE this.  Loreal has a winner here.  I do not miss the revitalift line...the collagen line shows better improvement in months compared to the Revitalift line I had been using for over 3 years!!  This lotion absorbs into the skin quickly - a little dab will do you!  Remember, i am still on the first bottle I bought.  There is NO fragrance, and the lotion is very light.  When I wear no makeup, I used only this lotion as sun screen. Enjoy!  You will have no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;It has taken me 48 years to find a skin care combo of products that provide the effect I didn&#x27;t know I could have but always sought and used other products to &#x27;settle&#x27; for...don&#x27;t do it anymore ladies!  you don&#x27;t have to look wore out, washed out and drab....</li>
            <li> I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS STUFF, REACH BEFORE I WAS EXPECTING, GOOD PRICE AND I RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> This rich lotion glides on, feels great, covers well.  After cleansing my face, I can&#x27;t wait to put this on.  Instantly, it livens my skin and brings forth my color.  I can confidently go without makeup if necessary.  This lotion plumps the skin to &#x27;lift&#x27; wrinkles.  It does a very good job on fine and medium depth wrinkles.  It&#x27;s still working to relieve a couple of deeper wrinkles around my mouth but I have complete confidence in the product.  Definitely makes my skin look younger!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this moisturizer but I found out that the highest SPF ingredient is SO harmful to you and can cause horrible things in your body. Here is a paragraph copied from ehow.com-&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;through skin absorption, octinoxate can lead to reproductive as well as developmental toxicity. It is also known to damage the immune system in rare cases, impairing a person&#x27;s ability to fight disease and repair tissue damage. Women who are pregnant should not use octinoxate because it produces estrogen-like effects. Use of octinoxate can cause endocrine disruptions. It can also interfere with signaling between cells resulting in mutations or even the death of cells.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy and I heard it was great but I would read about it first before you do.. I had just bought mine and choose to throw it away because it just wasn&#x27;t worth it and new there were other moisturizers that would do just as great or better..</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion; light and non-greasy.  I&#x27;m not a believer in any &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34; for aging, but if I&#x27;m going to moisturize I want something light that has the potential to nourish my skin and provide a bit something extra instead of my usual harsh creams.</li>
