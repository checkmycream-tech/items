            <li>/&gt;This is additional supplies of what you need:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is a 2-step process, it&#x27;s best if you can have 2 plastic bags for the head.  </li>

            <li>The two step combination is the best henna method I have used.</li>
            <li>It covers my greys perfectly, but it has taken some time getting used to.</li>

            <li>Colour is great.</li>
            <li>I wait 4 weeks and make sure I condition VERY good.</li>
            <li>HAIR AND SCALP WAS BRIGHT ORANGE.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve still got good coverage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS - I am delighted to hear that Indigo is included.  </li>
            <li>I have been using henna on my hair for over 30 years and have loved it.  </li>
            <li>I also add an egg, 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, and a teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg spice to the Step 2 mix, which helps to moisturize my hair and make it smell good.</li>
            <li>I felt that this product did a good job of covering the gray and the color hung in there for about 3 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good luck.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I did read from someone else that it&#x27;s best to put this on your right after mixing, so I started doing that.  </li>

            <li>huge difference!!  </li>
            <li>That seems like magic to me!  </li>
            <li>It sure did, I was pleasantly</li>
            <li>/&gt;I also have learned that its helpful to have 2-3 bath towels that are okay to get stained, baby wipes, a good quality shower cap, and a salon cape (beauty supply store).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely finish - just a bit of a nuisance until you figure out a good routine for you.  </li>
            <li>and I follow my own steps each time.  </li>

            <li>On the positive side, the color comes out beautifully and your hair feels so incredibly good.</li>
            <li>: BEAUTIFUL color worth all the time and effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light Mountain is great and it&#x27;s healthy for your hair.</li>

            <li>This is the best natural hair color product that I have found.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and product is excellent to cover gray hair using natural henna.</li>
            <li>Great color with some reddish highlights where the gray was that looks so gorgeous and natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh a very important thing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh a very important thing.  </li>
            <li>The henna mud stuck to my head and was nice and moist, not watery, and it was relatively easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I love that smell.</li>
            <li>but it made it shiny and looked healthy.  </li>
            <li>I now go to a salon and have a permanent ammonia free color done - it does a better job of covering the gray longer but the color is not as nice as when I used the Henna.  </li>
            <li>And now I spend a lot more money to get it done.</li>
            <li>Love the color</li>
            <li>until men thought chemicals would be better, henna has been used for centuries.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure this differs person to person.  </li>
            <li>Most of the henna was out.  </li>
            <li>Get more gloves that just the ones they provided.  </li>
            <li>Get more gloves that just the ones they provided.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;After a lil bit of trial &amp; error, I have grown to love this product.</li>
            <li>After a lil bit of trial &amp; error, I have grown to love this product.</li>
            <li>In summary, I love the color it gives me</li>
            <li>I let the product sit after mixing for 3 hours since the instructions indicated that this would make the results better.  </li>
            <li>I read the many Amazon reviews that detail the process</li>
            <li>I do love this product for the job it does.  </li>
            <li>I also love how it leaves my hair...</li>
            <li>The condition of my hair is better after coloring with this henna.</li>
            <li>This method of coloring is definitely much more affordable than a salon too:)</li>
            <li>But if you do it more than once you&#x27;ll develop systems for making it go</li>
            <li>more smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have quite a bit of gray hair at the top of my head</li>
            <li>With more and more use, my hair gets stronger, healthier and well conditioned.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>She loves having the opportunity to make money, and I love that she is helping me do my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will want to make sure that you thoroughly go over your bathroom floor and sink area to get everything cleaned up.</li>
            <li>You will want to make sure that you thoroughly go over your bathroom floor and sink area to get everything cleaned up.</li>
            <li>Much better than toxic chemical-laden hair dyes.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my hair like so healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pain to use, but I love the results.</li>
            <li>I like knowing I am using a safe product</li>
            <li>and I get many compliments on the shine and color.</li>
            <li>I love the effect.</li>
            <li>This is a 2 step process so it is even a bit more time consuming than a one step</li>
            <li>/&gt;Go be fabulous!</li>
            <li>If I have to color every 4 weeks, it&#x27;s okay because I am not pouring toxic chemicals on my head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>I followed many of the added suggestions from others (wool cap instead of heat, covered my bathroom in plastic trash bags, vaseline around hairline, 30 min Step 1 and 1 1/2 for Step 2).</li>
            <li>Omg love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moral:  you can follow two steps process if you want to, but if you have better things to do you can save a lot of time by turning it into a one step.  </li>
            <li>Who has time for that?&lt;br /&gt;Naturtint and Vegetal are much better options than this.</li>
            <li>I have been using Light Mountain Color the Gray, light brown henna for about 7 years and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Then whenever I wash my hair for months afterwards, instead of the herbal funky henna smell, my hair smells fresh and great with the mild scent of cloves</li>
            <li>Light Mountain Natural is the best hair dye product, and it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li>I am pregnant and going gray (nice combination).</li>
            <li>If you are looking to save a bundle on hair coloring and want a safe and natural way to cover the gray, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>It looks fantastic when first done, loved the color, and it was shiny, healthy.  </li>
            <li>Very good on white hair!.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I have the satisfaction of knowing I didn&#x27;t use toxic chemicals on my scalp.</li>
            <li>There is a better way to understand and apply henna, here&#x27;s a free e-book that helps a LOT!&lt;br /&gt;[...</li>
            <li>I think you have to ask your self what is more important, ease of process or results in a non-toxic hair color?</li>
            <li>Four stars for great results and no harsh chemicals, but not hassle free.</li>
            <li>, I feel very lucky to have found this hair color.</li>
            <li>, I feel very lucky to have found this hair color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mixture was also easy to work with for pack 2.  </li>
            <li>Loved the idea of a natural and cruelty-free product, and the price was more than reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ran a hot hair dryer over my head to keep my hair warm.</li>
            <li>and it did a fine job on the gray.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair feels so silky and smooth after a henna treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Until then, I&#x27;ll stick with Light Mountain.  </li>
            <li>The BIGGEST perk to light mountains product is its a USDA organic</li>
            <li>of which was the \\&quot;Light Mountain Color</li>
            <li>..see ibid info at light mountain products FAQ &amp; Helpful hints).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just read &amp; research all the available information, give consideration to your preference, health, and end results.&lt;br</li>

            <li>The spork works great for short hair.</li>
            <li>The spork works great for short hair.</li>
            <li>So in desperation, I began my research and soon found Light Mountain Natural-Color the Gray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s time consuming, but so is going to the hairdresser to get your hair dyed, and with Light Mountain</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s been 6 weeks after I dyed it, and my hair still looks great, the grays are starting to peak out a bit.</li>
            <li>Thank you Light Mountain Color</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my hair after using Light Mountain Cover the Gray.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Rinse off step two using a ton of cheap conditioner.</li>
            <li>(reusable)&lt;br /&gt;Pack of cheap disposable shower caps</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far superior to any 1 step henna process.</li>
            <li>good product harmless and gives natural color</li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t want to spend that kind of time on that particular</li>
            <li>I would get many compliments when it was first done.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled that I don&#x27;t have to just \\&quot;live with the gray\\&quot; anymore.</li>
            <li>I had used Light Mountain&#x27;s regular henna before and loved it.  </li>
            <li>so I found using a plastic spork, (don&#x27;t laugh), with upward strokes, makes application really easy for me as I do it myself.</li>
            <li>I use the bath towels for after rinsing and for drying my feet on, baby wipes for clean up, the shower cap for sleeping in, and the salon cape to protect my clothes and skin from getting stained.</li>
            <li>2 plastic bags on the bathroom floor - that way drips can just be thrown away - cuts clean up dramatically.&lt;br</li>
            <li>2 plastic bags on the bathroom floor - that way drips can just be thrown away - cuts clean up dramatically.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had had many adverse reactions to the PPD in hair dye and much to my delight, Light Mountain has worked without any problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apply step one to clean damp hair.</li>
            <li>Cover head with plastic bag and clean up bathroom from step one</li>
            <li>clean</li>
            <li>but it is worth every single minute because she has beautiful hair now.</li>
            <li>The two step process was a LOT of work especially to end up with bright orange roots.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I know there are more modern hair color alternatives that are also cruelty-free, and when I get around to it</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthier and thicker than ever, and it is a beautiful shade of dark brown.</li>
            <li>, I cut a slice in it to be able to tie it securely on my head, and I cut a tiny hole in the top of it to allow heat to escape.  </li>
            <li>cover vanity with paper towels, keep paper towel handy to wipe off any drips, wear old crappy clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I, luckily, did not.</li>
            <li>If you like quick and convenient</li>
            <li>and it was much coarser and worked very well with amazing results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as easy to use as the other stuff, but it sure beats the alternative to me and looks healthy and natural.y it to your hair.</li>
            <li>When I rinse the henna off my head at this point, my grey roots are bright orange.</li>
            <li>It may take more time to apply than other products but if you follow the directions carefully, you will get great results!  </li>
            <li>you know that the product is nontoxic, which is great, plus it costs so much less than what you would pay at a salon.</li>
            <li>I usually never drop a spec any more.</li>
            <li>I read on a henna website one time that color would be more vivid if it was on your hair while the processing was taking place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>) Time- for results: the light mountain product does not provide fast results like \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; (boxed/salon) hair dyes.</li>
            <li>However, it is far safer and cheaper than most home hair coloring products.</li>
            <li>The women would get together to help apply the henna then sit around doing spa type of things while the henna was absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Henna doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;wash out\\&quot; because it&#x27;s absorbed into the hair shaft</li>
            <li>This product is SO worth it.</li>
            <li>Also my hair feels so soft and healthy</li>
            <li>really useful</li>
            <li>It requieres time but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>brown.&lt;br /&gt;**Use organic ground ginger (spice) instead of fresh ginger</li>
            <li>There are also some highlights, I presume from the henna coming through the indigo, so the color looks more natural and prettier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have followed the directions, tried adding day old coffee, seems like most of the color comes off (on my pillow)</li>
            <li>It could even be a lot of fun to do it with a friend and a bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve researched over and over and tried mixing my own henna/indigo ingredients with different things added to it to try to get the right color and nothing worked, period.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very shiny, soft and full, more so the normal.&lt;br /&gt;After just two hours</li>
            <li>Well she was right,</li>
            <li>Right before you rinse off package 1, make the mixture for package 2.</li>
            <li>After step one is done, right before you wash it out, make the stuff for step 2.  </li>
            <li>After step one is done, right before you wash it out, make the stuff for step 2.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews I purchased the Light Mountain Cover the Grey Chestnut and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>But the color is great, lasts me a long time (8 weeks or so), and is all natural...</li>
            <li>I love that it looks so pretty when it grows out, and that it just fades naturally.</li>
            <li>Be ready to clean your bathroom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as easy to use as the other stuff, but it sure beats the alternative to me and looks healthy and natural.</li>
            <li>It is very natural looking, and it fades so much more gently than salon or boxed color.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>I ended up leaving Step 1 on for around 45 minutes which turned my grey hair and scalp a nice orange.  </li>
            <li>Then I mix step 2 with the coffee to get a good dark brown color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as easy as going to the salon, but it is much cheaper, much safer and my hair turned out really shiny!</li>
            <li>in all, I love the results and deal with the lengthy/messy application, super long prep/curing time as well as the processing time on my head, not to mention the lengthy time it takes to remove the product from my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I was at my wits&#x27; end trying to keep my hair looking good and healthy (and without a silver streak down the middle!).  </li>
            <li>Mrssy but works very well!</li>
            <li>but I got the hang of it and did very well doing it on my own without much issue after the third time or so.  </li>
            <li>A few grey strands look like shimmery highlights, otherwise the coverage is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I used hot tap water rather than distilled boiled water per the instructions.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend helped me this first time with cleaning up henna from the floors and sink while I was applying it</li>
            <li>This is the first time using the Cover the Gray variety.  </li>
            <li>about 6 hrs my first time.  </li>
            <li>Very!</li>
            <li>Be sure to use yogurt mixed with this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be patient--the first time you do it, you&#x27;re going to be like:</li>
            <li>pretty simple to do, just make sure to follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to take that risk for the time it saves me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The red highlights in my hair show more as it grows out too, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t shampoo (only rinse with baking soda) for 24 hours after coloring.</li>
            <li>I read that sometimes you get the red hot spots on top of the crown from the hotter area of the head there, so the hole helps regulate the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Especially for me, as the first time had to cover more of the gray.  </li>
            <li>This helps the color set in before you have your first shampoo.</li>
            <li>also tried the step 2 a bit differently, which I like better.  </li>

            <li>Also, use conditioner to help rinse the stuff out of your hair, but don&#x27;t shampoo for 48 hours, it helps keep the color brown as opposed to reddish brown.ittle more red than what I want as it gets more and more faded, but it is a small thing</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first use of henna</li>
            <li>After applying the first mixture her hair turned bright red, but as soon as she applied the second one, her hair started to turn darker right in front of her eyes.</li>
            <li>I was worried it would make my hair super red or turn it green, but so many people liked it</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I get home, open the box, and find:  a plastic bag full of a dirt-like powder and instructions that seem to indicate it would take the better part of an afternoon to complete the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a great job of coloring greys turning them into subtle highlights in your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will come back and try and condense this review into easy to follow steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>noticed that pack 1 left my hair a vibrant bright orange, which did not happen when I colored three months earlier.  </li>
            <li>Certainly results trumps process for me.</li>
            <li>After searching for a pure henna product that give my hair the color</li>
            <li>I made my New Years resolution to leave a healthier &amp; green wise life..</li>
            <li>Why I&#x27;m happy that Indigo is included is because it&#x27;s very very hard to find.</li>
            <li>It does smell really gross (but perhaps that is amplified by being pregnant!)</li>
            <li>Gave it 2 stars because unfortunately this time the quality was not as good as before, it was made of large grains or particles, that made it so much harder to apply and the result was not as good as before.</li>
            <li>Also, I have called Light Mountain customer service several times to ask questions about the application of the product and they have been very helpful.</li>
            <li>After much research and reading numerous reviews, I decided to use The Light Mountain product.</li>
            <li>But I really like the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read reviews (in light brown) where others leave the product on for a very short time</li>
            <li>I expected that, and was OK with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s harder to use but the more times you use it, the easier it becomes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so much effort</li>
            <li>Thanks, Nancy</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery of product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m not waiting for so much gray to accumulate before recoloring, so</li>
            <li>My hair is so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>Got it within time in fact very early&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>the real test is when I use the product</li>
            <li>~THANKS</li>
            <li>result is the same - very shiny natural looking healthy</li>
            <li>My greys have faded to a light red</li>
            <li>(you have to mix the powder with water and it can be kind of messy in the shower when applying and rinsing off).  </li>
            <li>After getting the majority of the color out I use cream rinse and the rest just rinses right out leaving my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>If not for Light Mountain, I&#x27;d be gray headed right now because I&#x27;m extremely allergic to hair color now after using it for years.</li>

            <li>did I realize your dark brown product was bright orange red.  </li>
            <li>I have long fine medium chestnut hair with maybe 70% grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see much fading in the rest of my hair, but my natural color is pretty close to the product color.</li>
            <li>It leaves beautiful, dark, reddish brown highlights throughout my hair and a slightly brighter, reddish highlight on the gray.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets a little more red than what I want as it gets more and more faded, but it is a small thing</li>
            <li>Therefore my long hair ends up being a bright orange color due to the step 1 process.</li>
            <li>and I get consistent results time after time, and my hair does look natural, and it&#x27;s so thick and healthy looking!</li>
            <li>I used it exclusively when pregnant and later nursing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super low maintenance and didn&#x27;t want to dye my hair</li>
            <li>I was worried that I would miss a vibrant orange strand coloring</li>
            <li>so I knew I was in for much more of a production than what I would have with boxed color, but I felt it was worth it to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li>While the henna and indigo was on my hair, I covered my head with the plastic hat provided and a shower cap with elastic (highly recommend this).</li>
            <li>I placed it all in a very warm place (a larger pot with slow boiling water) and let it sit for 3 hours.  </li>
            <li>Takes a little more time and maybe a second coloring, but worth it because my hair looks more natural in it&#x27;s color and my grey hairs have a pretty red highlight in the sunshine.  </li>
            <li>The one positive is that the henna did leave my hair really soft, but that&#x27;s not enough to make it worth going through the ordeal of using this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like the beg better because it&#x27;s a little lighter and easier to work with</li>
            <li>I like the beg better because it&#x27;s a little lighter and easier to work with</li>
            <li>That worked, but what an ordeal - it took me two days to get to something that looked like a natural color even though it was still much darker than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>However, it is a natural conditioner and makes your hair so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>I really like henna because it&#x27;s natural, and does not contain chemicals that damage hair.  </li>
            <li>Works very well over gray (cover gray product) and is all natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to do so, but next application will add day old coffee to add more deep brown hues (as per options listed on the instructions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are a few places where the chestnut didn&#x27;t dye 100%, but it looks OK</li>
            <li>This is normal so on to step two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve colored my hair to cover grey (mostly around my hairline) for about ten years always using chemical OTC coloring products and every once in awhile splurging on a salon color.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal color.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and usually takes</li>
            <li>But even though that was a slight nuisance, it was far better than working with the consistency of</li>
            <li>But even though that was a slight nuisance, it was far better than working with the consistency of</li>
            <li>biggest hint is to mix the henna the day before using lemon juice not water (and never ever ever use coffee), the indigo is mixed up right  </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m new at henna-indigoing</li>
            <li>It looks very natural, as if she did not even dye her hair.</li>
            <li>I tried this because I was having a reaction to regular dye and because I&#x27;ve read so many places how dark chemical dyes have a high cancer risk</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see much fading in the rest of my hair, but my natural color is pretty close to the product color.ch new grey growth.  </li>
            <li>After mixing and applying the first batch, it turned my hair very red.  </li>
            <li>While it may not be suited for everyone, I recommend it to those who don&#x27;t mind taking a lil bit extra time to ensure they can be healthy and take the lil extra effort to be informed prior to the use of any product.</li>

            <li>I find it so much easier with bare hands.</li>
            <li>The results were that my bangs had some orange remain in them and the color ended up being light to dark medium</li>

            <li>(since I usually do this in the afternoon, it is gone by morning latest).  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I left the indigo on for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have used this product 2 times now and the 2nd time I followed other reviews and ended up with better results</li>
            <li>the first week, leaving the what was gray, now red tinted hair.</li>
            <li>, it is messy, and you definitely have to work at figuring out the right water to powder ratio, because it makes a huge difference in how easy it is to apply and how messy it is.  </li>
            <li>wine!&lt;br /&gt;It was a messy process, but cleaned up easily and didn&#x27;t stain anything like chemical color does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The real secret is learning the right consistency and finding a quick easy way to apply it to your hair.</li>
            <li>What I do is cut a 2 inch slit in the front of it and use those 2 ends to tie into a know - this makes the bag fit tight, avoid leaks and not slip around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I did not leave the second batch in as long as I had originally planned.  </li>
            <li>They turned a little bit orange which I guess helped them blend a bit, but the color didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>To me it looks rich dark brown, not black at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically if your gray is driving you crazy and you are motivated to do something about it, then this is a great product for you.</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t wash my hair first (since I never did when I used henna before the grey came in)</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cover my gray completely, but,</li>
            <li>100% all natural product.</li>
            <li>I guess its something i have to take in order to use natural product.</li>
            <li>I tried this to cover my gray since it is all natural.</li>
            <li>My teen daughter helps me apply it, which makes it much easier, and I pay her for it.</li>
            <li>key is getting it applied well, and by blending, it is very creamy while applying.  </li>
            <li>But it was quicker than the first time, and probably if you don&#x27;t wait so long between times it might be easier.  </li>

            <li>AND I use an all natural product</li>
            <li>It is soft as silk.  </li>
            <li>shimmery and natural</li>
            <li>It still covered my greys and my hair is closer to my natural medium brown color.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and just went to a salon who uses organic or natural hair color.</li>
            <li>First off, set aside a few hours to use the product the first time out.</li>
            <li>I started to get nervous when I started to clean up after applying the second batch to my hair to see that every where that the second batch had dripped had turned BLUE!  </li>
            <li>Yet, \\&quot;Color the gray\\&quot;, does have a aroma simular to &#x27;fresh cut grass&#x27; or other earthy-green leaf aroma.</li>
            <li>I was nervous about it, but I figured it would neutralized the deep red from the first batch.</li>
            <li>First, there should be packages that offer smaller amounts for people with short hair.  </li>
            <li>Remaining ingredients included: a piece of fresh ginger about 2&amp;#34; long, 3 tablespoons honey and 3 drops of extra virgin olive oil.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s suppose to, in this case, Dark Brown, I&#x27;ve finally found a brand (Light Mountain)  that does it.  </li>
            <li>So today is Saturday, I&#x27;ll condition on Sunday and Monday, and shampoo and condition on Wednesday - back to normal</li>

            <li>Arrived timely and exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>A few months ago I experienced the worse reaction ever which resulted in severely damaged hair to the point where I dreadlocks literally washed from my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown, almost black, hair and told my husband he was just going to have to love me with salt and pepper hair.</li>
            <li>My local natural foods market (Sunflower Farmer&#x27;s Market) carries this brand.  </li>
            <li>my hair is left feeling soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>My hair does also have a natural tendency to go red</li>
            <li>the color was lighter than my natural color so the roots looked a different shade of brown.  </li>
            <li>I suggest putting it on in or near the bathtub if possible.</li>
            <li>Reasons I went the henna route:&lt;br /&gt;1.I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to smells and regular box dyes would leave me with a migraine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is messy but well worth it</li>
            <li>Now that I have it down, I prepare the mixtures the night before and start applying it first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>story short, this product works, just be ready to spend some time and deal with the mess.ry short, this product works, just be ready to spend some time and deal with the mess.</li>
            <li>and I have about 3/4 of inch new grey growth.  </li>
            <li>Yes it does take a lot longer if you have to do the 2 step process, and yes it is messy till you figure out the right consistency, but it works.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it is totally worth the extra time and mess and effort.  </li>
            <li>I actually checked this product out about a decade ago and it seemed like too much effort at the time, but fast forward to this past summer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the process of going grey young, and this helps quite a lot!  </li>
            <li>it covered my gray hair pretty good, i just hate the process, especially the indigo.  </li>
            <li>This product has a lot of INDIGO in it which is a BLUE dye - natural, yes, but BLUE.  </li>
            <li>, I made it with this:  2 cups total liquid as:  1 cup distilled water, 3/4 cup of Folgers Black Silk Coffee (made fresh an hour earlier with distilled water) and 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li>I am African American and over 50 years old</li>
            <li>She was a little scared at first with all the instructions and the gloves included with the kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beware-it does bleed a little for the first week.</li>
            <li>The grey in my hair turns a pretty red color while the rest of my hair goes to my natural hair color of dark brown.  </li>
            <li>However prep time can be cut in half by mixing both packets with hot water at the same time, just keep the mixtures separate.</li>
            <li>: very soft natural dark blond with perhaps 20% or so gray.  </li>
            <li>It was messy to apply at first</li>
            <li>the gray can be a lil messy at first if you are accustomed to \\&quot;gel like chemical</li>
            <li>If it runs down your forehead and neck after wrapping, you added too much water.</li>
            <li>This product is highly rated by Environmental Working Group and appears to be the safest for your health than other hair color products.  </li>
            <li>But I am too young to go grey, and I wasn&#x27;t going back to chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The process is long as well as messy, but soooooo worth it</li>
            <li>I started really reformulating my process, and finally I have it down to a science.  </li>
            <li>Other reviews said was a very messy product, but I did not have that problem at all, they must have used to much water, but it is a long process, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I had dark brown hair when I was younger with golden-red highlights,(now 50% gray); every time I mixed art quality henna and indigo it always came out really reddish, bluish, or somewhere in between.</li>
            <li>product using applicator bottle starting in center at hair line and drawing thick lines straight back on scalp working my way left and right til I reached ears.  </li>
            <li>Next, if you should change your mind about removing the Color the Gray (henna) product from your hair within as soon as possible or within the first 24 hours, you will find it easier since it is a (quasi) semi permanent product with a few home-pantry products (brunettes; use molasses &amp; baking soda equal parts; for blondes, use a differing mixture to remove it(</li>
            <li>I am allergic to all other hair products but am not quite ready for my grey to be revealed.  </li>

            <li> huge difference!!  </li>
            <li> That seems like magic to me!  </li>
            <li> It sure did, I was pleasantly</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also have learned that its helpful to have 2-3 bath towels that are okay to get stained, baby wipes, a good quality shower cap, and a salon cape (beauty supply store).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely finish - just a bit of a nuisance until you figure out a good routine for you.  </li>

            <li> This is the best natural hair color product that I have found.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and product is excellent to cover gray hair using natural henna.</li>
            <li> Great color with some reddish highlights where the gray was that looks so gorgeous and natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh a very important thing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh a very important thing.  </li>
            <li> The henna mud stuck to my head and was nice and moist, not watery, and it was relatively easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I love that smell.</li>
            <li> but it made it shiny and looked healthy.  </li>
            <li> I now go to a salon and have a permanent ammonia free color done - it does a better job of covering the gray longer but the color is not as nice as when I used the Henna.  </li>
            <li> And now I spend a lot more money to get it done.</li>
            <li> Love the color</li>
            <li> until men thought chemicals would be better, henna has been used for centuries.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure this differs person to person.  </li>
            <li> Most of the henna was out.  </li>
            <li> Get more gloves that just the ones they provided.  </li>

            <li> In summary, I love the color it gives me</li>
            <li> I let the product sit after mixing for 3 hours since the instructions indicated that this would make the results better.  </li>
            <li> I read the many Amazon reviews that detail the process</li>
            <li> I do love this product for the job it does.  </li>
            <li> I also love how it leaves my hair...</li>
            <li> The condition of my hair is better after coloring with this henna.</li>
            <li> This method of coloring is definitely much more affordable than a salon too:)</li>
            <li> But if you do it more than once you&#x27;ll develop systems for making it go</li>
            <li> more smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have quite a bit of gray hair at the top of my head</li>
            <li> With more and more use, my hair gets stronger, healthier and well conditioned.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> She loves having the opportunity to make money, and I love that she is helping me do my hair.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Much better than toxic chemical-laden hair dyes.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my hair like so healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pain to use, but I love the results.</li>
            <li> I like knowing I am using a safe product</li>
            <li> and I get many compliments on the shine and color.</li>
            <li> I love the effect.</li>
            <li> This is a 2 step process so it is even a bit more time consuming than a one step</li>
            <li> /&gt;Go be fabulous!</li>
            <li> If I have to color every 4 weeks, it&#x27;s okay because I am not pouring toxic chemicals on my head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> I followed many of the added suggestions from others (wool cap instead of heat, covered my bathroom in plastic trash bags, vaseline around hairline, 30 min Step 1 and 1 1/2 for Step 2).</li>
            <li> Omg love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moral:  you can follow two steps process if you want to, but if you have better things to do you can save a lot of time by turning it into a one step.  </li>
            <li> Who has time for that?&lt;br /&gt;Naturtint and Vegetal are much better options than this.</li>
            <li> I have been using Light Mountain Color the Gray, light brown henna for about 7 years and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Then whenever I wash my hair for months afterwards, instead of the herbal funky henna smell, my hair smells fresh and great with the mild scent of cloves</li>
            <li> Light Mountain Natural is the best hair dye product, and it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li> I am pregnant and going gray (nice combination).</li>
            <li> If you are looking to save a bundle on hair coloring and want a safe and natural way to cover the gray, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> It looks fantastic when first done, loved the color, and it was shiny, healthy.  </li>
            <li> Very good on white hair!.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, I have the satisfaction of knowing I didn&#x27;t use toxic chemicals on my scalp.</li>
            <li> There is a better way to understand and apply henna, here&#x27;s a free e-book that helps a LOT!&lt;br /&gt;[...</li>
            <li> I think you have to ask your self what is more important, ease of process or results in a non-toxic hair color?</li>
            <li> Four stars for great results and no harsh chemicals, but not hassle free.</li>
            <li> , I feel very lucky to have found this hair color.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The mixture was also easy to work with for pack 2.  </li>
            <li> Loved the idea of a natural and cruelty-free product, and the price was more than reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ran a hot hair dryer over my head to keep my hair warm.</li>
            <li> and it did a fine job on the gray.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair feels so silky and smooth after a henna treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Until then, I&#x27;ll stick with Light Mountain.  </li>
            <li> The BIGGEST perk to light mountains product is its a USDA organic</li>
            <li> of which was the \\&quot;Light Mountain Color</li>

            <li> The spork works great for short hair.</li>
            <li> So in desperation, I began my research and soon found Light Mountain Natural-Color the Gray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time consuming, but so is going to the hairdresser to get your hair dyed, and with Light Mountain</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s been 6 weeks after I dyed it, and my hair still looks great, the grays are starting to peak out a bit.</li>
            <li> Thank you Light Mountain Color</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my hair after using Light Mountain Cover the Gray.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Rinse off step two using a ton of cheap conditioner.</li>
            <li> (reusable)&lt;br /&gt;Pack of cheap disposable shower caps</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far superior to any 1 step henna process.</li>
            <li> good product harmless and gives natural color</li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t want to spend that kind of time on that particular</li>
            <li> I would get many compliments when it was first done.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled that I don&#x27;t have to just \\&quot;live with the gray\\&quot; anymore.</li>
            <li> I had used Light Mountain&#x27;s regular henna before and loved it.  </li>
            <li> so I found using a plastic spork, (don&#x27;t laugh), with upward strokes, makes application really easy for me as I do it myself.</li>
            <li> I use the bath towels for after rinsing and for drying my feet on, baby wipes for clean up, the shower cap for sleeping in, and the salon cape to protect my clothes and skin from getting stained.</li>
            <li> 2 plastic bags on the bathroom floor - that way drips can just be thrown away - cuts clean up dramatically.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 2 plastic bags on the bathroom floor - that way drips can just be thrown away - cuts clean up dramatically.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had had many adverse reactions to the PPD in hair dye and much to my delight, Light Mountain has worked without any problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apply step one to clean damp hair.</li>
            <li> Cover head with plastic bag and clean up bathroom from step one</li>
            <li> clean</li>
            <li> but it is worth every single minute because she has beautiful hair now.</li>
            <li> The two step process was a LOT of work especially to end up with bright orange roots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I know there are more modern hair color alternatives that are also cruelty-free, and when I get around to it</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthier and thicker than ever, and it is a beautiful shade of dark brown.</li>
            <li> , I cut a slice in it to be able to tie it securely on my head, and I cut a tiny hole in the top of it to allow heat to escape.  </li>
            <li> cover vanity with paper towels, keep paper towel handy to wipe off any drips, wear old crappy clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I, luckily, did not.</li>
            <li> If you like quick and convenient</li>
            <li> and it was much coarser and worked very well with amazing results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as easy to use as the other stuff, but it sure beats the alternative to me and looks healthy and natural.y it to your hair.</li>
            <li> When I rinse the henna off my head at this point, my grey roots are bright orange.</li>
            <li> It may take more time to apply than other products but if you follow the directions carefully, you will get great results!  </li>
            <li> you know that the product is nontoxic, which is great, plus it costs so much less than what you would pay at a salon.</li>
            <li> I usually never drop a spec any more.</li>
            <li> I read on a henna website one time that color would be more vivid if it was on your hair while the processing was taking place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ) Time- for results: the light mountain product does not provide fast results like \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; (boxed/salon) hair dyes.</li>
            <li> However, it is far safer and cheaper than most home hair coloring products.</li>
            <li> The women would get together to help apply the henna then sit around doing spa type of things while the henna was absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Henna doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;wash out\\&quot; because it&#x27;s absorbed into the hair shaft</li>
            <li> This product is SO worth it.</li>
            <li> Also my hair feels so soft and healthy</li>
            <li> really useful</li>
            <li> It requieres time but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> brown.&lt;br /&gt;**Use organic ground ginger (spice) instead of fresh ginger</li>
            <li> There are also some highlights, I presume from the henna coming through the indigo, so the color looks more natural and prettier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have followed the directions, tried adding day old coffee, seems like most of the color comes off (on my pillow)</li>
            <li> It could even be a lot of fun to do it with a friend and a bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve researched over and over and tried mixing my own henna/indigo ingredients with different things added to it to try to get the right color and nothing worked, period.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very shiny, soft and full, more so the normal.&lt;br /&gt;After just two hours</li>
            <li> Well she was right,</li>
            <li> Right before you rinse off package 1, make the mixture for package 2.</li>
            <li> After step one is done, right before you wash it out, make the stuff for step 2.  </li>
            <li> After step one is done, right before you wash it out, make the stuff for step 2.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I purchased the Light Mountain Cover the Grey Chestnut and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> But the color is great, lasts me a long time (8 weeks or so), and is all natural...</li>
            <li> I love that it looks so pretty when it grows out, and that it just fades naturally.</li>
            <li> Be ready to clean your bathroom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as easy to use as the other stuff, but it sure beats the alternative to me and looks healthy and natural.</li>
            <li> It is very natural looking, and it fades so much more gently than salon or boxed color.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> I ended up leaving Step 1 on for around 45 minutes which turned my grey hair and scalp a nice orange.  </li>
            <li> Then I mix step 2 with the coffee to get a good dark brown color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as easy as going to the salon, but it is much cheaper, much safer and my hair turned out really shiny!</li>
            <li> in all, I love the results and deal with the lengthy/messy application, super long prep/curing time as well as the processing time on my head, not to mention the lengthy time it takes to remove the product from my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I was at my wits&#x27; end trying to keep my hair looking good and healthy (and without a silver streak down the middle!).  </li>
            <li> Mrssy but works very well!</li>
            <li> but I got the hang of it and did very well doing it on my own without much issue after the third time or so.  </li>
            <li> A few grey strands look like shimmery highlights, otherwise the coverage is excellent.  </li>
            <li> I used hot tap water rather than distilled boiled water per the instructions.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend helped me this first time with cleaning up henna from the floors and sink while I was applying it</li>
            <li> This is the first time using the Cover the Gray variety.  </li>
            <li> about 6 hrs my first time.  </li>
            <li> Very!</li>
            <li> Be sure to use yogurt mixed with this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be patient--the first time you do it, you&#x27;re going to be like:</li>
            <li> pretty simple to do, just make sure to follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to take that risk for the time it saves me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The red highlights in my hair show more as it grows out too, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t shampoo (only rinse with baking soda) for 24 hours after coloring.</li>
            <li> I read that sometimes you get the red hot spots on top of the crown from the hotter area of the head there, so the hole helps regulate the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Especially for me, as the first time had to cover more of the gray.  </li>
            <li> This helps the color set in before you have your first shampoo.</li>
            <li> also tried the step 2 a bit differently, which I like better.  </li>

            <li> also tried the step 2 a bit differently, which I like better.  </li>
            <li> Also, use conditioner to help rinse the stuff out of your hair, but don&#x27;t shampoo for 48 hours, it helps keep the color brown as opposed to reddish brown.ittle more red than what I want as it gets more and more faded, but it is a small thing</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first use of henna</li>
            <li> After applying the first mixture her hair turned bright red, but as soon as she applied the second one, her hair started to turn darker right in front of her eyes.</li>
            <li> I was worried it would make my hair super red or turn it green, but so many people liked it</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I get home, open the box, and find:  a plastic bag full of a dirt-like powder and instructions that seem to indicate it would take the better part of an afternoon to complete the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a great job of coloring greys turning them into subtle highlights in your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will come back and try and condense this review into easy to follow steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> noticed that pack 1 left my hair a vibrant bright orange, which did not happen when I colored three months earlier.  </li>
            <li> Certainly results trumps process for me.</li>
            <li> After searching for a pure henna product that give my hair the color</li>
            <li> I made my New Years resolution to leave a healthier &amp; green wise life..</li>
            <li> Why I&#x27;m happy that Indigo is included is because it&#x27;s very very hard to find.</li>
            <li> It does smell really gross (but perhaps that is amplified by being pregnant!)</li>
            <li> Gave it 2 stars because unfortunately this time the quality was not as good as before, it was made of large grains or particles, that made it so much harder to apply and the result was not as good as before.</li>
            <li> Also, I have called Light Mountain customer service several times to ask questions about the application of the product and they have been very helpful.</li>
            <li> After much research and reading numerous reviews, I decided to use The Light Mountain product.</li>
            <li> But I really like the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews (in light brown) where others leave the product on for a very short time</li>
            <li> I expected that, and was OK with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to use but the more times you use it, the easier it becomes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so much effort</li>
            <li> Thanks, Nancy</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery of product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not waiting for so much gray to accumulate before recoloring, so</li>
            <li> My hair is so much healthier.  </li>
            <li> Got it within time in fact very early&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> the real test is when I use the product</li>
            <li> ~THANKS</li>
            <li> result is the same - very shiny natural looking healthy</li>
            <li> My greys have faded to a light red</li>
            <li> (you have to mix the powder with water and it can be kind of messy in the shower when applying and rinsing off).  </li>
            <li> After getting the majority of the color out I use cream rinse and the rest just rinses right out leaving my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> If not for Light Mountain, I&#x27;d be gray headed right now because I&#x27;m extremely allergic to hair color now after using it for years.</li>

            <li> did I realize your dark brown product was bright orange red.  </li>
            <li> I have long fine medium chestnut hair with maybe 70% grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much fading in the rest of my hair, but my natural color is pretty close to the product color.</li>
            <li> It leaves beautiful, dark, reddish brown highlights throughout my hair and a slightly brighter, reddish highlight on the gray.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets a little more red than what I want as it gets more and more faded, but it is a small thing</li>
            <li> Therefore my long hair ends up being a bright orange color due to the step 1 process.</li>
            <li> and I get consistent results time after time, and my hair does look natural, and it&#x27;s so thick and healthy looking!</li>
            <li> I used it exclusively when pregnant and later nursing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super low maintenance and didn&#x27;t want to dye my hair</li>
            <li> I was worried that I would miss a vibrant orange strand coloring</li>
            <li> so I knew I was in for much more of a production than what I would have with boxed color, but I felt it was worth it to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> While the henna and indigo was on my hair, I covered my head with the plastic hat provided and a shower cap with elastic (highly recommend this).</li>
            <li> I placed it all in a very warm place (a larger pot with slow boiling water) and let it sit for 3 hours.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little more time and maybe a second coloring, but worth it because my hair looks more natural in it&#x27;s color and my grey hairs have a pretty red highlight in the sunshine.  </li>
            <li> The one positive is that the henna did leave my hair really soft, but that&#x27;s not enough to make it worth going through the ordeal of using this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like the beg better because it&#x27;s a little lighter and easier to work with</li>
            <li> I like the beg better because it&#x27;s a little lighter and easier to work with</li>
            <li> That worked, but what an ordeal - it took me two days to get to something that looked like a natural color even though it was still much darker than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> However, it is a natural conditioner and makes your hair so much healthier.  </li>
            <li> I really like henna because it&#x27;s natural, and does not contain chemicals that damage hair.  </li>
            <li> Works very well over gray (cover gray product) and is all natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to do so, but next application will add day old coffee to add more deep brown hues (as per options listed on the instructions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are a few places where the chestnut didn&#x27;t dye 100%, but it looks OK</li>
            <li> This is normal so on to step two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve colored my hair to cover grey (mostly around my hairline) for about ten years always using chemical OTC coloring products and every once in awhile splurging on a salon color.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal color.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and usually takes</li>
            <li> But even though that was a slight nuisance, it was far better than working with the consistency of</li>
            <li> But even though that was a slight nuisance, it was far better than working with the consistency of</li>
            <li> biggest hint is to mix the henna the day before using lemon juice not water (and never ever ever use coffee), the indigo is mixed up right  </li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m new at henna-indigoing</li>
            <li> It looks very natural, as if she did not even dye her hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I was having a reaction to regular dye and because I&#x27;ve read so many places how dark chemical dyes have a high cancer risk</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much fading in the rest of my hair, but my natural color is pretty close to the product color.ch new grey growth.  </li>
            <li> After mixing and applying the first batch, it turned my hair very red.  </li>
            <li> While it may not be suited for everyone, I recommend it to those who don&#x27;t mind taking a lil bit extra time to ensure they can be healthy and take the lil extra effort to be informed prior to the use of any product.</li>

            <li> The results were that my bangs had some orange remain in them and the color ended up being light to dark medium</li>

            <li> (since I usually do this in the afternoon, it is gone by morning latest).  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I left the indigo on for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product 2 times now and the 2nd time I followed other reviews and ended up with better results</li>
            <li> the first week, leaving the what was gray, now red tinted hair.</li>
            <li> , it is messy, and you definitely have to work at figuring out the right water to powder ratio, because it makes a huge difference in how easy it is to apply and how messy it is.  </li>
            <li> wine!&lt;br /&gt;It was a messy process, but cleaned up easily and didn&#x27;t stain anything like chemical color does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The real secret is learning the right consistency and finding a quick easy way to apply it to your hair.</li>
            <li> What I do is cut a 2 inch slit in the front of it and use those 2 ends to tie into a know - this makes the bag fit tight, avoid leaks and not slip around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I did not leave the second batch in as long as I had originally planned.  </li>
            <li> They turned a little bit orange which I guess helped them blend a bit, but the color didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> To me it looks rich dark brown, not black at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically if your gray is driving you crazy and you are motivated to do something about it, then this is a great product for you.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t wash my hair first (since I never did when I used henna before the grey came in)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cover my gray completely, but,</li>
            <li> 100% all natural product.</li>
            <li> I guess its something i have to take in order to use natural product.</li>
            <li> I tried this to cover my gray since it is all natural.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter helps me apply it, which makes it much easier, and I pay her for it.</li>
            <li> key is getting it applied well, and by blending, it is very creamy while applying.  </li>
            <li> But it was quicker than the first time, and probably if you don&#x27;t wait so long between times it might be easier.  </li>
            <li> But it was quicker than the first time, and probably if you don&#x27;t wait so long between times it might be easier.  </li>
            <li> AND I use an all natural product</li>
            <li> It is soft as silk.  </li>
            <li> shimmery and natural</li>
            <li> It still covered my greys and my hair is closer to my natural medium brown color.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and just went to a salon who uses organic or natural hair color.</li>
            <li> First off, set aside a few hours to use the product the first time out.</li>
            <li> I started to get nervous when I started to clean up after applying the second batch to my hair to see that every where that the second batch had dripped had turned BLUE!  </li>
            <li> Yet, \\&quot;Color the gray\\&quot;, does have a aroma simular to &#x27;fresh cut grass&#x27; or other earthy-green leaf aroma.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about it, but I figured it would neutralized the deep red from the first batch.</li>
            <li> First, there should be packages that offer smaller amounts for people with short hair.  </li>
            <li> Remaining ingredients included: a piece of fresh ginger about 2&amp;#34; long, 3 tablespoons honey and 3 drops of extra virgin olive oil.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s suppose to, in this case, Dark Brown, I&#x27;ve finally found a brand (Light Mountain)  that does it.  </li>
            <li> So today is Saturday, I&#x27;ll condition on Sunday and Monday, and shampoo and condition on Wednesday - back to normal</li>
            <li> So today is Saturday, I&#x27;ll condition on Sunday and Monday, and shampoo and condition on Wednesday - back to normal</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> A few months ago I experienced the worse reaction ever which resulted in severely damaged hair to the point where I dreadlocks literally washed from my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown, almost black, hair and told my husband he was just going to have to love me with salt and pepper hair.</li>
            <li> My local natural foods market (Sunflower Farmer&#x27;s Market) carries this brand.  </li>
            <li> my hair is left feeling soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> My hair does also have a natural tendency to go red</li>
            <li> the color was lighter than my natural color so the roots looked a different shade of brown.  </li>
            <li> I suggest putting it on in or near the bathtub if possible.</li>
            <li> Reasons I went the henna route:&lt;br /&gt;1.I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to smells and regular box dyes would leave me with a migraine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is messy but well worth it</li>
            <li> Now that I have it down, I prepare the mixtures the night before and start applying it first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> story short, this product works, just be ready to spend some time and deal with the mess.ry short, this product works, just be ready to spend some time and deal with the mess.</li>
            <li> and I have about 3/4 of inch new grey growth.  </li>
            <li> Yes it does take a lot longer if you have to do the 2 step process, and yes it is messy till you figure out the right consistency, but it works.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it is totally worth the extra time and mess and effort.  </li>
            <li> I actually checked this product out about a decade ago and it seemed like too much effort at the time, but fast forward to this past summer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of going grey young, and this helps quite a lot!  </li>
            <li> it covered my gray hair pretty good, i just hate the process, especially the indigo.  </li>
            <li> This product has a lot of INDIGO in it which is a BLUE dye - natural, yes, but BLUE.  </li>
            <li> , I made it with this:  2 cups total liquid as:  1 cup distilled water, 3/4 cup of Folgers Black Silk Coffee (made fresh an hour earlier with distilled water) and 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> I am African American and over 50 years old</li>
            <li> She was a little scared at first with all the instructions and the gloves included with the kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beware-it does bleed a little for the first week.</li>
            <li> The grey in my hair turns a pretty red color while the rest of my hair goes to my natural hair color of dark brown.  </li>
            <li> However prep time can be cut in half by mixing both packets with hot water at the same time, just keep the mixtures separate.</li>
            <li> : very soft natural dark blond with perhaps 20% or so gray.  </li>
            <li> It was messy to apply at first</li>
            <li> the gray can be a lil messy at first if you are accustomed to \\&quot;gel like chemical</li>
            <li> If it runs down your forehead and neck after wrapping, you added too much water.</li>
            <li> This product is highly rated by Environmental Working Group and appears to be the safest for your health than other hair color products.  </li>
            <li> But I am too young to go grey, and I wasn&#x27;t going back to chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The process is long as well as messy, but soooooo worth it</li>
            <li> I started really reformulating my process, and finally I have it down to a science.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews said was a very messy product, but I did not have that problem at all, they must have used to much water, but it is a long process, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I had dark brown hair when I was younger with golden-red highlights,(now 50% gray); every time I mixed art quality henna and indigo it always came out really reddish, bluish, or somewhere in between.</li>
            <li> product using applicator bottle starting in center at hair line and drawing thick lines straight back on scalp working my way left and right til I reached ears.  </li>
            <li> Next, if you should change your mind about removing the Color the Gray (henna) product from your hair within as soon as possible or within the first 24 hours, you will find it easier since it is a (quasi) semi permanent product with a few home-pantry products (brunettes; use molasses &amp; baking soda equal parts; for blondes, use a differing mixture to remove it(</li>
            <li> I am allergic to all other hair products but am not quite ready for my grey to be revealed.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this hair color for several years and though it is somewhat messy to put on, the time spent is worth it.</li>
            <li> , I know I could have done some research before the purchase, but I don&#x27;t normally research five dollar purchases in depth before I buy, for the same reason I don&#x27;t want to spend half a day changing my hair color</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and less frizzy than normal.</li>
            <li> My hair looks very natural (I got dark brown).  </li>
            <li> I used to wait months and endure long gray roots before I eventually succumbed to the inevitable, smelly, and toxic commercial hair dyes.</li>
            <li> The result was CHARCOAL GREY with shades of BLUE!  </li>
            <li> and maybe I didn&#x27;t leave the product on long enough.</li>
            <li> Long lasting color over the gray and no chemical smell.</li>
            <li> It does take a long time to do the coloring, six hours total.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, about 5 inches below bra strap on back ((hair is now to waist, and 1 box covers it</li>
            <li> I use to apply traditional Heena for long time.</li>
            <li> It was gritty, but it didn&#x27;t take all that long to rinse out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had mixed both packets at the same time to save some time, and when I looked at the second batch, it looked awfully dark - with a deep blue/green tint to it.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long, but I plan to try it again.</li>
            <li> Just a very flat, blah color.</li>
            <li> Well, after trying Light Mountain, I told her she should offer it to her customers as a natural alternative to the dangerous chemical dyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first step the gray is a ridiculous orange color.</li>
            <li> With ginger root there is very little hay smell, maybe only like 5% the first few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With ginger root there is very little hay smell, maybe only like 5% the first few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started going gray in my twenties and now at 42 I am at least 50% gray, and my hair grows fast, so I was having to color every 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I found 1/2 a package of my old henna (Hennalucent Sunset Glo - which I can no longer find), mixed it up and put it in my hair to at least try to neutralize the BLUE.  </li>
            <li> I want my money back or another batch of this in actual dark brown color sent to me ASAP.</li>
            <li> gray turned dark, but not as dark as the rest of the hair, but that seems to be par for the course for henna, and actually looks natural, rather than a sea of black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it takes a long time.</li>
            <li> used to henna from a long time ago, so the process wasn&#x27;t intimidating for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to henna from a long time ago, so the process wasn&#x27;t intimidating for me.  </li>
            <li> : so far I have not had any reactions to this product, as compared to \\&quot;chemical hair dyes\\&quot; IE burning itching, reddness, allergic reactions, harsh chemical odors, etc.</li>
            <li> I purchased one box, with a warning that it was a long process from the sales lady.  </li>
            <li> It does take a long time to prepare, but it does cover the grays, and there are no smells...</li>
            <li> The dark green turned to dark brown about a day later after a shampoo (don&#x27;t shampoo in the first 24 hours).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence and you have been coloring for a long time, I encourage you to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> But it did do it&#x27;s job by covering the greys without even a hint of grey showing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did take a LONG time, but I knew this going in and didn&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to update with how long it lasts if I remember.  </li>
            <li> I am almost 7 months pregnant and needless to say, the gray was really starting to bother me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even worry about getting it on my skin around my hair line because it just leaves an ever so slight tint around the edge that&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have less than 10% gray, and it barely touched it.  </li>
            <li> I tried the suggestions of other reviewers such as using an application bottle but just using my hands is what worked for me, but I would put Vaseline on the edges of my face, ears, neck, etc.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser said Henna would dry out my hair</li>
            <li> but no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my hair dry overnight</li>
            <li> then let it dry fully before Step 2 just to test my hypothesis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then let it dry fully before Step 2 just to test my hypothesis.    </li>
            <li> The product is a powder vs coarser dry dirt-like now so that may have something to do with it.  </li>
            <li> get me wrong - those of you who choose to spend the time and take the trouble to use this product, I&#x27;m glad it works for you.  </li>
            <li> And in the meantime, I&#x27;d rather have drab hair and a few grays than spend several hours feeling like an extra in \\&quot;Quest for Fire\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> extra messy two step process just took up my entire morning.  </li>
            <li> Wow, is this messy!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is no longer true.</li>
            <li> My husband said my hair had a subtle natural tint of red and looked healthier.</li>
            <li> I think the second time I use this product it will be easier and a little quicker as I know how long to keep the product on my hair.</li>
            <li> The gray areas are starting to to have a slight red tinge but are still dark brown.</li>
            <li> This is what gives you brown instead of the typical henna red.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 mixed up well with black coffee that I heated in a ceramic cup in the microwave.  </li>
            <li> Because henna has seemed to dry out my hair, I added about 1 tbsp avocado oil and a few drops of rosemary essential oil</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m real careful not to add any other red enhancers listed as options in the instructions.  </li>
            <li> A little extra time, and effort, that&#x27;s why 4 stars and not 5.</li>
            <li> It was so easyto put on, that it was actually dripping a little.  </li>

            <li> I really wanted this product to work, but I was pretty disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I brew dark coffee with distilled water and use that for mixing the dark brown powder to help reduce the red.  </li>

            <li> It does take an hour or three, then over the next few days you&#x27;ll see the color deepen.  </li>
            <li> I add a few drops of essential oils (like lavender) which my husband loves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been using it now for a couple of years), as opposed to dried out and fragile the way it gets from the chemicals at a salon.</li>
            <li> I have coarse curly hair, I didn&#x27;t want harsh chemicals making my curls brittle and dry&lt;</li>
            <li> After the second step the orange was replaced by a really strange dark green color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Transferred Step two to now empty and rinsed out applicator bottle using plastic baggie method.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I rolled some tissues into a long chain a stuck  around hairline to keep from dripping down my face.</li>
            <li> hair color turned out a very deep dark color -- not quite black, but darker than chocolate brown.  </li>
            <li> The color was DARK, my grey was covered!  </li>
            <li> But this colour is little mess but just takes less than hour to complete.</li>
            <li> and today my dry hair is still dark.  </li>
            <li> Picked up a box of this on impulse at Whole Foods - my dark brown hair has been looking a little drab lately, and the pesky grays seem to be increasing in number.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping using this product will improve the overall health of my hair from the damage I&#x27;ve caused from so many bad hair dyes/products in the past.</li>
            <li> After blowing drying, my hair is dark brown and the grey a slightly lighter redder brown.  </li>
            <li> The dye job was a long and tedious procedure which took me a few hours from start to finish (cleaning is half the battle), but, it seems to be worth it.</li>
            <li> The down sides: the henna smells a little funky/earthy, though I find that if I run conditioner through my hair with a comb in the shower when I finish rinsing out the second part, that cuts down on the smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Peroxide and the other chemicals used in \\&quot;modern\\&quot; destroys hair in order to work.  </li>
            <li> 2 was applied on damp hair due to Step 1.  </li>
            <li> Because I found other reviews tips so helpful, I&#x27;ll explain what I did...</li>
            <li> The instructions have changed drastically making the process extremely time consuming.</li>
            <li> I tend to work at my computer, but you could also watch tv or do other things.</li>
            <li> not sure that it&#x27;s necessary to use distilled water.</li>
            <li> not sure that it&#x27;s necessary to use distilled water.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to try it because the reviews said it would take a long time and that it was messy.</li>
            <li> It took me a few times of using it to get a benchmark of how long each solution needs to stay in my hair to get the color I want.</li>
            <li> I will not use any other brands of hair dyes.  </li>
            <li> It seems to have sprouted in a Cruella de Vil-like stripe in the front over the past year and when I would wear my hair back in a headband, I felt like a skunk.</li>
            <li> above is what I usually do with henna from other companies.  </li>
            <li> I made a lot of \\&quot;plops\\&quot; with Step 1 but realized by Step 2 that it was probably TOO thick and completed Step 2 with barely a drop.</li>
            <li> I mixed it up with black coffee and plain water</li>
            <li> I returned all the rest of the packages I bought, and the company did not even have the common sense enough to refund for their defective product, only refunded (less 20% restocking fee to add insult to injury!)</li>
            <li> the cons side, the process of coloring is very messy, and it takes several shampoos to get the henna out of my hair after coloring.</li>
            <li> baggie&lt;br /&gt;Plastic very wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> She describes the color is dark chocolate, but I do not agree with her.</li>
            <li> the Gray\\&quot; Henna Product (Dark Brown-</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown and</li>
            <li> and this time will leave the dark brown on longer, for richer color.</li>
            <li> Dark brown seems to get darker after each application.</li>
            <li> My only objection is that with plenty of room on the package to give some abbreviated version of the instructions, or at least to indicate the time that might be involved, the manufacturer didn&#x27;t do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once everything turned dark brown</li>
            <li> I started with hair that was dark brunette and a bit of gray - perhaps 15%.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s the color of dark chocolate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After chemical coloring my scalp would be dark brown for 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely an organic odor that lingers on my thick, medium length hair for about a week.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very messy, long process.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m down to about 4-5 hrs from start to finish.</li>
            <li> There was a lot of product that I ended up flushing down the drain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to cut down on chemical usage.  </li>
            <li> the unopened packages they could sell to some other unsuspecting person!</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect other than it would be time consuming and messy.</li>
            <li> After all of the grit is gone from my hair (typically about two shampoos or about 4 days for me)</li>
            <li> I truly didn&#x27;t believe this would work on gray hair based on previous henna experiences.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t handle seeing my black hair laced with these silver stands.</li>
            <li> I still have all my gray including bits of black  particlars in my hair that have not come out even though I washed my hair forever.</li>
            <li> almost black.  </li>
            <li> I am 33 and have not been able to use traditional hair dye for over 8 years after the worst allergic reaction that I still tremble to think about.</li>
            <li> I cut the tip slightly till I had about a 1/4 inch opening.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic applicator brush.</li>
            <li> help with the mess</li>
            <li> Also, the process is messy, but I just wipe down the bathtub after I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> I wrap my head tight with saran wrap all over, cut slits for my ears to poke through, and then put a plastic cap on over that and wait about 45 minutes and rinse.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a little smelly.</li>
            <li> You can also cheat and use conditioner or a little shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what caused it, the wet hair or the olive oil, but the henna mud fell off my head and just got EVERYWHERE!  </li>
            <li> You have to get a thick consistency or it will plop all over the place making a real mess, especially the indigo.</li>
            <li> Armed with the little info</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other henna hair color in the past and thought I would give this one a try.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is thin, I only need to use half of each bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whenever I have complained about this, friends and husband have a hard time seeing what I am seeing, so it isn&#x27;t a big deal.  </li>

            <li> Seriously, this has shaved off at least 30 minutes of application time.</li>
            <li> It has a shine and highlights like you see in the hair of very small children...</li>
            <li> so I applied Step 1 to dirty dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Instead of dealing with having to apply heat over a period of 30 minutes with blow dryer (which feels so tiresome and boring) just put a wool stocking cap over the bathing cap and your body&#x27;s natural heat will be enough.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Mrssy but works very well!</li>
            <li> First off, set aside a few hours to use the product the first time out. You definitely need to do the color swatch and check to see if you might have an allergic reaction to this product. This is a plant product and may cause dermatitis. I, luckily, did not. Secondly, it&#x27;s messy and time consuming. On the positive side, the color comes out beautifully and your hair feels so incredibly good. Also it smells like henna. I love that smell. I bought the double pack and it&#x27;s been almost 4 weeks and I&#x27;ve still got good coverage. I&#x27;m definitely going to do my hair again. If you like quick and convenient this product is not for you, that is why I gave it four stars.  However, it is far safer and cheaper than most home hair coloring products. If you are looking to save a bundle on hair coloring and want a safe and natural way to cover the gray, this is a great product. I think the second time I use this product it will be easier and a little quicker as I know how long to keep the product on my hair.</li>
            <li> It was a longggggg difficult process. The consistency of very thick heavy grainy mudd that drips and stains. After all the hours of patience and messiness I rinsed my hair and looked at it and it didn&#x27;t work. There is no color difference and the directions said to leave it in atleast 45 min so I left it in for 1 1/2 hours as someone on the reviews suggested.</li>
            <li> I loved this product!  It covered the gray hair very good!  It looks fantastic when first done, loved the color, and it was shiny, healthy.  I would get many compliments when it was first done.  My hairdresser said Henna would dry out my hair but it made it shiny and looked healthy.  It would need to be done again in 4 weeks as the gray would start to show, especially around my face.  It was messy to apply at first but I got the hang of it and did very well doing it on my own without much issue after the third time or so.  I tried the suggestions of other reviewers such as using an application bottle but just using my hands is what worked for me, but I would put Vaseline on the edges of my face, ears, neck, etc.  Someone said they do it in the bathtub, but that didn&#x27;t work for me either.  This product is highly rated by Environmental Working Group and appears to be the safest for your health than other hair color products.  Unfortunately, I started to develop an allergy and started itching so had to discontinue after about 5 months or so.  I now go to a salon and have a permanent ammonia free color done - it does a better job of covering the gray longer but the color is not as nice as when I used the Henna.  And now I spend a lot more money to get it done.</li>
            <li> Wow, is this messy! And it&#x27;s a little smelly. And it takes a long time. But I really like the way my hair looks and feels. Love the color and it did a fine job on the gray. Most importantly, I have the satisfaction of knowing I didn&#x27;t use toxic chemicals on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I got it for my mom... She was a little scared at first with all the instructions and the gloves included with the kit. She spent about four hours to complete the process. After applying the first mixture her hair turned bright red, but as soon as she applied the second one, her hair started to turn darker right in front of her eyes. She told me it was a messy and lengthy process but it is worth every single minute because she has beautiful hair now. She describes the color is dark chocolate, but I do not agree with her. To me it looks rich dark brown, not black at all. It looks very natural, as if she did not even dye her hair. It has been one month, and the color has not faded yet.&lt;br /&gt;If you have the time and care about your color, and vary about all those chemicals that can cause cancer - this is the way to go! Great product!</li>
            <li> There is a better way to understand and apply henna, here&#x27;s a free e-book that helps a LOT!&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest hint is to mix the henna the day before using lemon juice not water (and never ever ever use coffee), the indigo is mixed up right  before you start then stirred into the henna.  This is what gives you brown instead of the typical henna red.  No need to apply them separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until men thought chemicals would be better, henna has been used for centuries. The women would get together to help apply the henna then sit around doing spa type of things while the henna was absorbed.  It does take an hour or three, then over the next few days you&#x27;ll see the color deepen.  That&#x27;s because the henna oxidizes.  Henna doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;wash out\\&quot; because it&#x27;s absorbed into the hair shaft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peroxide and the other chemicals used in \\&quot;modern\\&quot; destroys hair in order to work.  Henna conditions.... huge difference!!  My hair feels so silky and smooth after a henna treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - I am delighted to hear that Indigo is included.  My local natural foods market (Sunflower Farmer&#x27;s Market) carries this brand.  Thus I can save the shipping. Why I&#x27;m happy that Indigo is included is because it&#x27;s very very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the negative reviews and I think neither one of the reviewers actually applied the mixture to their hair. The truth is this product does indeed work to cover gray, and it is non-toxic. In fact it is the least toxic hair color for gray out there according to [...]. I used it exclusively when pregnant and later nursing. But it is time consuming and messy and it is difficult to apply, especially if too wet. However prep time can be cut in half by mixing both packets with hot water at the same time, just keep the mixtures separate. It will not affect the results. To rinse out the gritty remnants baking soda helps. You can also cheat and use conditioner or a little shampoo. As suggested in the directions you can experiment with adding coffee or teas for different colors. I think you have to ask your self what is more important, ease of process or results in a non-toxic hair color? Certainly results trumps process for me.</li>
            <li> Messy application, though this does improve with practice.  Definitely an organic odor that lingers on my thick, medium length hair for about a week.  Does cover my gray quite well, though I&#x27;ve learned to leave the product in my hair for the maximum suggested time.  I&#x27;ve read reviews (in light brown) where others leave the product on for a very short time, I&#x27;m sure this differs person to person.  This is a two step process, step one turns your gray a pinky/orange hue preping them for step two.  For my hair, processing for step one is approximately 20 minutes while prep time/curing is about an hour.  Step two is your color, for me processing time is 3 hours and prior to that an additional 3 hours to cure.  Directions do warn against using any metal and recommend distilled water only.  Since product is going on my hair, I&#x27;ve never gone against these warnings for fear of the possible consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love the results and deal with the lengthy/messy application, super long prep/curing time as well as the processing time on my head, not to mention the lengthy time it takes to remove the product from my hair.  After all of the grit is gone from my hair (typically about two shampoos or about 4 days for me) my hair is left feeling soft and shiny.  My hair does also have a natural tendency to go red so I&#x27;m real careful not to add any other red enhancers listed as options in the instructions.  I&#x27;ve yet to do so, but next application will add day old coffee to add more deep brown hues (as per options listed on the instructions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there were another product out there offering the same results without the hassle, I would be all for it.  Until then, I&#x27;ll stick with Light Mountain.  Four stars for great results and no harsh chemicals, but not hassle free.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to all other hair products but am not quite ready for my grey to be revealed.  After reading many reviews I purchased the Light Mountain Cover the Grey Chestnut and gave it a try.  I did a sensitivity test behind each ear and am not allergic (hurrah!)  I also did a strand test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 mixed up well with black coffee that I heated in a ceramic cup in the microwave.  I ended up leaving Step 1 on for around 45 minutes which turned my grey hair and scalp a nice orange.  I did not apply heat.  I didn&#x27;t wash my hair first (since I never did when I used henna before the grey came in) so I applied Step 1 to dirty dry hair.  The henna mud stuck to my head and was nice and moist, not watery, and it was relatively easy to apply.  Each strand that had henna on it would stick to my head, as was my experience with henna in the past.  It rinsed out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 was applied on damp hair due to Step 1.  The chestnut packet must have indigo in it and MAN, does indigo stain!!  I mixed it up with black coffee and plain water and I added some olive oil.  I&#x27;m not sure what caused it, the wet hair or the olive oil, but the henna mud fell off my head and just got EVERYWHERE!  My covered strands did not stick to my head, so the Step 2 was very difficult to apply.  I left the color on for 45 minutes and didn&#x27;t apply heat.  The henna took alot of rinsing:  I did one rinse session in the bathtub, towel dried and combed it out but there was still alot of henna in the hair.  The color was DARK, my grey was covered!  But I decided to do another rinse in the shower and I used conditioner.  Most of the henna was out.  The water had a blue color to it, so I was afraid that the conditioner rinsed out a bunch of color...but no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my hair dry overnight and today my dry hair is still dark.  A few grey strands look like shimmery highlights, otherwise the coverage is excellent.  There are a few places where the chestnut didn&#x27;t dye 100%, but it looks OK and it&#x27;s reddish.  My scalp is orange-y in a couple of places but that&#x27;ll go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I run my hands through my hair (as a girl does!) my fingers are getting stained blue, and I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;ll go away when I wash my hair tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to henna from a long time ago, so the process wasn&#x27;t intimidating for me.  However, the chestnut color caused some swearing that I wouldn&#x27;t use the product again...however, the color and the coverage are so excellent that I&#x27;ll use it again.  Next time I might just use Step 1 on my roots then let it dry fully before Step 2 just to test my hypothesis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use lots of newspaper on your work area and floor.  Get more gloves that just the ones they provided.  I used 3 pairs:  one pair each for Step 1, Step 2 and rinsing out Step 2.  Get 2 shower caps or plastic shopping bags with handles (I tie the handles in the front.)alp is orange-y in a couple of places but that&#x27;ll go away.    When I run my hands through my hair (as a girl does!) my fingers are getting stained blue, and I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;ll go away when I wash my hair tomorrow.    I&#x27;m used to henna from a long time ago, so the process wasn&#x27;t intimidating for me.  However, the chestnut color caused some swearing that I wouldn&#x27;t use the product again...however, the color and the coverage are so excellent that I&#x27;ll use it again.

            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s messy, and the smell will be in your hair for a few days (even after shampooing).  But the color is great, lasts me a long time (8 weeks or so), and is all natural...</li>
            <li> I tried this along with the gray treatment prior to coloring and after hours of goop and following the steps I ended up with orange where the gray hair was and almost blue everywhere else.  The best part?  My hair still smells like spinach and weed had a baby and it pooped on my hair.</li>
            <li> I truly didn&#x27;t believe this would work on gray hair based on previous henna experiences. I have 40% gray on the crown of my head...after 2 weeks of shampooing my hair looks better than it ever did when I used chemical dye. I&#x27;m a convert to the henna/indigo combo. I tried this because I was having a reaction to regular dye and because I&#x27;ve read so many places how dark chemical dyes have a high cancer risk; now I&#x27;ll never go back to chemical dye. Because I found other reviews tips so helpful, I&#x27;ll explain what I did... I did the allergy test but did not do the strand test. I used hot tap water rather than distilled boiled water per the instructions. I let both the henna and indigo mixtures sit for two hours. I left the henna on for 20 minutes and rinsed (my gray hair looked magenta). Then I left the indigo on for 1 hour 20 minutes and rinsed. While the henna and indigo was on my hair, I covered my head with the plastic hat provided and a shower cap with elastic (highly recommend this). Every 5-10 minutes I ran a hot hair dryer over my head to keep my hair warm. I only used conditioner during the final rinse. I waited 36 hours before using shampoo. My hair is shiny and less frizzy than normal. The gray areas are starting to to have a slight red tinge but are still dark brown. It is REALLY messy. My boyfriend helped me this first time with cleaning up henna from the floors and sink while I was applying it (what a sweetie!). Next time I will take a reviewers advice and spread newspaper everywhere. (Also, I waited 5 weeks after using chemical dye to try this product.)</li>
            <li> I have been using henna on my hair for over 30 years and have loved it.  Used a variety of different brands. I had used Light Mountain&#x27;s regular henna before and loved it.  This is the first time using the Cover the Gray variety.  After mixing and applying the first batch, it turned my hair very red.  I expected that, and was OK with it.  I had mixed both packets at the same time to save some time, and when I looked at the second batch, it looked awfully dark - with a deep blue/green tint to it.  I was nervous about it, but I figured it would neutralized the deep red from the first batch. I put it on.  I started to get nervous when I started to clean up after applying the second batch to my hair to see that every where that the second batch had dripped had turned BLUE!  I did not leave the second batch in as long as I had originally planned.  After washing it out I was AGHAST!!!  My hair was dark black with shades of GREEN!!!!  I made three attempts to wash it out using the \\&quot;instructions for removing henna\\&quot; in the instructions.  The result was CHARCOAL GREY with shades of BLUE!  Just as bad.  I found 1/2 a package of my old henna (Hennalucent Sunset Glo - which I can no longer find), mixed it up and put it in my hair to at least try to neutralize the BLUE.  That worked, but what an ordeal - it took me two days to get to something that looked like a natural color even though it was still much darker than I was expecting.  Granted, I did not do a strand test which I should have.  This product has a lot of INDIGO in it which is a BLUE dye - natural, yes, but BLUE.  If you do not want BLUE hair, I would not recommend this product.  I returned all the rest of the packages I bought, and the company did not even have the common sense enough to refund for their defective product, only refunded (less 20% restocking fee to add insult to injury!) the unopened packages they could sell to some other unsuspecting person!</li>
            <li> The dye job was a long and tedious procedure which took me a few hours from start to finish (cleaning is half the battle), but, it seems to be worth it. It didn&#x27;t cover my gray completely, but, I think that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m new at henna-indigoing and maybe I didn&#x27;t leave the product on long enough. I&#x27;ve read alot of posts of people just sleeping all night with the product in their hair for deeper color, strength and shine. I&#x27;m thinking about mixing the step 1 (henna) and step 2 (indigo) together and just sleeping on it next time. However, I read websites stating indigo gets darker over the course of 2-4 days after dying, so we&#x27;ll see. My husband said my hair had a subtle natural tint of red and looked healthier. So I&#x27;ll take that as a good sign! The BIGGEST perk to light mountains product is its a USDA organic 100% all natural product. It&#x27;s just henna and indigo! Both which are known to be great for the hair and scalp. I couldn&#x27;t keep ignoring the fact I was dying my hair with cancer inducing chemicals that was also damaging my hair. I&#x27;m hoping using this product will improve the overall health of my hair from the damage I&#x27;ve caused from so many bad hair dyes/products in the past. I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
            <li> I have been using Light Mountain Color the Gray, light brown henna for about 7 years and was very pleased with the results. It was a great product and worked great on my hair. Unfortunately this is no longer true. The last 3 boxes that I have used have been a big disappointment. The henna used to be a coarsely ground product but now it is a powder. The instructions have changed drastically making the process extremely time consuming. And worst of all, step 2 which used to impart a nice brown color doesn&#x27;t work at all. Therefore my long hair ends up being a bright orange color due to the step 1 process. I am extremely disappointed in the changes that have been made to this henna. I did call the company and they were going to check into the problem and call me back the following day. That was 6 weeks ago and I am still waiting for their call.</li>
            <li> it covered my gray hair pretty good, i just hate the process, especially the indigo.  I guess its something i have to take in order to use natural product.</li>
            <li> Takes time but the result is so good!&lt;br /&gt;Love it and will be using it for good!</li>
            <li> For years I used prof. salon(s) &amp; OTC/boxed home chemical hair dye kits. Until, I found out the harmful \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; aka &#x27;toxic 12&#x27; items used in beauty/make up/hygiene items at \\&quot;cosmetic safety database\\&quot; @&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I made my New Years resolution to leave a healthier &amp; green wise life.. I gathered up all my health/beauty/hygiene products &amp; searched thru the database, In short, disgusted...I purged my home of all the toxic grooming items, and replaced them with healthier &amp; safer products.&lt;br /&gt;One of which was the \\&quot;Light Mountain Color the Gray\\&quot; Henna Product (Dark Brown-for my hair type) read more about their products, FAQ, Helpful Hints, etc here:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, since I was experience with &#x27;boxed chemical hair dye kits&#x27;, there was a few adjustments in expectations:&lt;br /&gt;1) Time- for results: the light mountain product does not provide fast results like \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; (boxed/salon) hair dyes. In example chemical dyes products take 20-45 minutes versus Color the gray takes 2-4 hours depending on your preferences.&lt;br /&gt;2) Healthier: so far I have not had any reactions to this product, as compared to \\&quot;chemical hair dyes\\&quot; IE burning itching, reddness, allergic reactions, harsh chemical odors, etc. Yet, \\&quot;Color the gray\\&quot;, does have a aroma simular to &#x27;fresh cut grass&#x27; or other earthy-green leaf aroma. I add a few drops of essential oils (like lavender) which my husband loves.&lt;br /&gt;3) Color the gray can be a lil messy at first if you are accustomed to \\&quot;gel like chemical dyes\\&quot;, but I find using the bath tub helps, while it does not stain like &#x27;boxed chemical hair dyes&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;4) Next, if you should change your mind about removing the Color the Gray (henna) product from your hair within as soon as possible or within the first 24 hours, you will find it easier since it is a (quasi) semi permanent product with a few home-pantry products (brunettes; use molasses &amp; baking soda equal parts; for blondes, use a differing mixture to remove it(..see ibid info at light mountain products FAQ &amp; Helpful hints).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lil bit of trial &amp; error, I have grown to love this product. While it may not be suited for everyone, I recommend it to those who don&#x27;t mind taking a lil bit extra time to ensure they can be healthy and take the lil extra effort to be informed prior to the use of any product. Just read &amp; research all the available information, give consideration to your preference, health, and end results.&lt;br /&gt;Me? I am happier &amp; healthier for it, and it looks &amp; smells great!.    After a lil bit of trial &amp; error, I have grown to love this product.

            <li> Long lasting color over the gray and no chemical smell. It does take a long time to do the coloring, six hours total.</li>
            <li> A little extra time, and effort, that&#x27;s why 4 stars and not 5. I&#x27;ve researched over and over and tried mixing my own henna/indigo ingredients with different things added to it to try to get the right color and nothing worked, period. I had dark brown hair when I was younger with golden-red highlights,(now 50% gray); every time I mixed art quality henna and indigo it always came out really reddish, bluish, or somewhere in between. After about a year of experimenting I gave up and thought I&#x27;ll try this stuff just to see how it turns out, (after all it couldn&#x27;t be any worse than the results I was getting). This stuff works, PERIOD!, or at least the dark brown does for me. Yes it does take a lot longer if you have to do the 2 step process, and yes it is messy till you figure out the right consistency, but it works. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and I get consistent results time after time, and my hair does look natural, and it&#x27;s so thick and healthy looking! I have short hair so I found using a plastic spork, (don&#x27;t laugh), with upward strokes, makes application really easy for me as I do it myself. You have to get a thick consistency or it will plop all over the place making a real mess, especially the indigo. If it runs down your forehead and neck after wrapping, you added too much water. I usually never drop a spec any more. Once done with step 2 color I wrap my head tight with saran wrap all over, cut slits for my ears to poke through, and then put a plastic cap on over that and wait about 45 minutes and rinse. After getting the majority of the color out I use cream rinse and the rest just rinses right out leaving my hair soft and shiny. I don&#x27;t even worry about getting it on my skin around my hair line because it just leaves an ever so slight tint around the edge that&#x27;s barely noticeable. By the next day, (I always color at night before bed), after shampooing it&#x27;s gone. The real secret is learning the right consistency and finding a quick easy way to apply it to your hair. The spork works great for short hair. Light Mountain is great and it&#x27;s healthy for your hair. If not for Light Mountain, I&#x27;d be gray headed right now because I&#x27;m extremely allergic to hair color now after using it for years. It&#x27;s not as easy to use as the other stuff, but it sure beats the alternative to me and looks healthy and natural.y it to your hair. The spork works great for short hair.

            <li> this is a totally great product. It&#x27;s harder to use but the more times you use it, the easier it becomes.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have said they don&#x27;t like the smell but I think it&#x27;s fine. It makes your hair glossy. I always make some&lt;br /&gt;coffee from the darkest beans I can buy and after it&#x27;s brewed leave it in the freezer for a few days. Then I mix step 2 with the coffee to get a good dark brown color. It&#x27;s far superior to any 1 step henna process.</li>
            <li> After years of using over the counter chemical colors to cover my gray, I suddenly  had a bad allergic reaction and never went back.  I couldn&#x27;t handle seeing my black hair laced with these silver stands. So in desperation, I began my research and soon found Light Mountain Natural-Color the Gray. I was concerned with how it would work on relaxed African-American hair types, but found very little written on it.  Armed with the little info I did have I decided to give it a try. I purchased one box, with a warning that it was a long process from the sales lady.  Well she was right, about 6 hrs my first time.  Now that I have it down, I prepare the mixtures the night before and start applying it first thing in the morning. Now I&#x27;m down to about 4-5 hrs from start to finish. I just block off that day and make it my spa day.  In summary, I love the color it gives me and I&#x27;ve gotten numerous compliments. It leaves beautiful, dark, reddish brown highlights throughout my hair and a slightly brighter, reddish highlight on the gray.  Over time, the color even starts to change as the reds darken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: BEAUTIFUL color worth all the time and effort.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very! Very! Messy (during the warmer months I wash my hair outside)&lt;br /&gt;Time consuming (turn it into a Spa day or get some computer work done while you wait for the color to set)&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 is very hard to wash out.  Imagine rinsing mud from your hair.  All that sand and tiny particles are difficult to remove. Several rinses and then I often have to wait until it drys and then the rest comes out.&lt;br /&gt;Permed/Relaxed hair needs to wait 4-6 weeks, by that time I&#x27;m in need of another relaxer. I wait 4 weeks and make sure I condition VERY good. I even add olive or argan oil to the mixtures.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product some years back and it was much coarser and worked very well with amazing results. Always got compliments!  The product is a powder vs coarser dry dirt-like now so that may have something to do with it.  The point is that it simply does not work the way it used.  My greys get darker after application yet the uniform color I used to get all over is no longer there.  This is my 3rd time trying it again with same disapointing results.  I&#x27;m looking elsewhere for solutions.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews.  First, there should be packages that offer smaller amounts for people with short hair.  There was a lot of product that I ended up flushing down the drain.  I knew from the reviews that this would be a messy process.  It was and I wouldn&#x27;t have minded if the results were great.  I let the product sit after mixing for 3 hours since the instructions indicated that this would make the results better.  I kept the product on my hair for over an hour.  I ordered dark brown and the color was lighter than my natural color so the roots looked a different shade of brown.  Also, the color started to fade in about 1 1/2 to 2 weeks.  To go thru this process and not have the color last is really disappointing.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for the quick delivery. Gave it 2 stars because unfortunately this time the quality was not as good as before, it was made of large grains or particles, that made it so much harder to apply and the result was not as good as before.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and going gray (nice combination). I tried this to cover my gray since it is all natural. I read the many Amazon reviews that detail the process so I fully anticipated a nightmare application. It wasn&#x27;t so bad! It is thick and a messy, but if you take precautions you won&#x27;t make a mess. I suggest putting it on in or near the bathtub if possible. Rinsing in the bath is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought my second box and this time will leave the dark brown on longer, for richer color. I did 50 minutes or so, but will try 1.5 hours or even 2.  It&#x27;s not as easy as going to the salon, but it is much cheaper, much safer and my hair turned out really shiny!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!! A long tedious &amp; very messy process taking ten times longer than my usual hair coloring products and IT DID NOT WORK! I still have all my gray including bits of black  particlars in my hair that have not come out even though I washed my hair forever.</li>
            <li> I do love this product for the job it does.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so much effort (you have to mix the powder with water and it can be kind of messy in the shower when applying and rinsing off).  I&#x27;m allergic to some salon hair dyes, so I switched to henna.  I have no reactions to the henna.  I also love how it leaves my hair...it&#x27;s like it conditions it.  The condition of my hair is better after coloring with this henna. This method of coloring is definitely much more affordable than a salon too:)</li>
            <li> Be sure to use yogurt mixed with this or else you will not be happy with the smell.  Dark brown seems to get darker after each application.</li>
            <li> Picked up a box of this on impulse at Whole Foods - my dark brown hair has been looking a little drab lately, and the pesky grays seem to be increasing in number.  Loved the idea of a natural and cruelty-free product, and the price was more than reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I get home, open the box, and find:  a plastic bag full of a dirt-like powder and instructions that seem to indicate it would take the better part of an afternoon to complete the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are we, cavewomen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong - those of you who choose to spend the time and take the trouble to use this product, I&#x27;m glad it works for you.  My only objection is that with plenty of room on the package to give some abbreviated version of the instructions, or at least to indicate the time that might be involved, the manufacturer didn&#x27;t do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I know I could have done some research before the purchase, but I don&#x27;t normally research five dollar purchases in depth before I buy, for the same reason I don&#x27;t want to spend half a day changing my hair color - I don&#x27;t want to spend that kind of time on that particular activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I know there are more modern hair color alternatives that are also cruelty-free, and when I get around to it I will research those and buy one.  And in the meantime, I&#x27;d rather have drab hair and a few grays than spend several hours feeling like an extra in \\&quot;Quest for Fire\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> This product is SO worth it. It&#x27;s time consuming, but so is going to the hairdresser to get your hair dyed, and with Light Mountain you know that the product is nontoxic, which is great, plus it costs so much less than what you would pay at a salon. In addition, because you do it at home, you can use the waiting time to do things around the house. And the color looks great, and lasts well. Also my hair feels so soft and healthy (I&#x27;ve been using it now for a couple of years), as opposed to dried out and fragile the way it gets from the chemicals at a salon. The down sides: the henna smells a little funky/earthy, though I find that if I run conditioner through my hair with a comb in the shower when I finish rinsing out the second part, that cuts down on the smell. Also, the process is messy, but I just wipe down the bathtub after I&#x27;m done and I&#x27;ve never had stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be patient--the first time you do it, you&#x27;re going to be like: Oh my god, this is so complicated and it takes forever. But if you do it more than once you&#x27;ll develop systems for making it go more smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My few tips:&lt;br /&gt;*Read the instructions and gather all your materials before getting started--glass or plastic bowls, plastic or wood stirrers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;*I save disposable unused chopsticks from Chinese restaurants and use them for stirrers. I use Pyrex glass storage containers/bowls to mix the henna.&lt;br /&gt;*Do put vaseline on your face around your hairline (as suggested) before you use it to keep the henna off your skin&lt;br /&gt;*Something really useful I learned from another poster here: Instead of dealing with having to apply heat over a period of 30 minutes with blow dryer (which feels so tiresome and boring) just put a wool stocking cap over the bathing cap and your body&#x27;s natural heat will be enough. That way you are not chained to the bathroom during the time the henna needs to set. I tend to work at my computer, but you could also watch tv or do other things. To minimize dripping you can fold a towel over the stocking cap.&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s necessary to use distilled water. I&#x27;ve done it a couple of times when all I had was tap water, and it worked just fine&lt;br /&gt;*I have trouble putting the henna on my hair when wearing plastic gloves. I find it so much easier with bare hands. I do end up with dye on my hands for a day or two afterward, which is not ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically if your gray is driving you crazy and you are motivated to do something about it, then this is a great product for you. If you just have a few gray hairs, you may feel like it&#x27;s too much bother.g you can fold a towel over the stocking cap.&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s necessary to use distilled water.

            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have quite a bit of gray hair at the top of my head and I cannot believe how well it covers the gray.  The longer you leave it on the darker it gets... almost black.  With more and more use, my hair gets stronger, healthier and well conditioned.</li>
            <li> Reasons I went the henna route:&lt;br /&gt;1.I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to smells and regular box dyes would leave me with a migraine.&lt;br /&gt;2.I didn&#x27;t want to start dying my hair now, and in a few years question what my real hair color is.&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;m super low maintenance and didn&#x27;t want to dye my hair every 4-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;4. I have coarse curly hair, I didn&#x27;t want harsh chemicals making my curls brittle and dry&lt;br /&gt;I added eggs, yogurt and spices to mask the smell and help with the texture, I need to try ginger next time.&lt;br /&gt;As everyone says- it&#x27;s very messy, long process. However, it&#x27;s been 6 weeks after I dyed it, and my hair still looks great, the grays are starting to peak out a bit. I probably won&#x27;t have to dye my hair for another 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  My hair looks very natural (I got dark brown).  Other reviews said was a very messy product, but I did not have that problem at all, they must have used to much water, but it is a long process, but well worth it.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I started using this after realizing the so-called &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair color I was using had a bunch of cancer causing chemicals in it. I was nervous to try it because the reviews said it would take a long time and that it was messy. But I am too young to go grey, and I wasn&#x27;t going back to chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 6-8 months now and I love it. My teen daughter helps me apply it, which makes it much easier, and I pay her for it. She loves having the opportunity to make money, and I love that she is helping me do my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty simple to do, just make sure to follow the instructions. I also add an egg, 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, and a teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg spice to the Step 2 mix, which helps to moisturize my hair and make it smell good. It took me a few times of using it to get a benchmark of how long each solution needs to stay in my hair to get the color I want. I also don&#x27;t do the strand test because I have found my hair always turns out the same each time. I&#x27;m willing to take that risk for the time it saves me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes me about four hours each time. I use the waiting time to read magazines and relax. I love that it looks so pretty when it grows out, and that it just fades naturally. The red highlights in my hair show more as it grows out too, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware-it does bleed a little for the first week. My pillow case got stained, so I learned to cover it after coloring with this hair color. Make sure you don&#x27;t shampoo (only rinse with baking soda) for 24 hours after coloring. I learned this the hard way, and had to re-do everything because shampooing faded the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have learned that its helpful to have 2-3 bath towels that are okay to get stained, baby wipes, a good quality shower cap, and a salon cape (beauty supply store). I use the bath towels for after rinsing and for drying my feet on, baby wipes for clean up, the shower cap for sleeping in, and the salon cape to protect my clothes and skin from getting stained. You will want to make sure that you thoroughly go over your bathroom floor and sink area to get everything cleaned up. You don&#x27;t want to stain your carpets with this because its probably impossible to get out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the amount of time and money it takes to go to a salon, and the fact that its so hard to find truly natural hair color, I feel very lucky to have found this hair color. Its a great price too and has saved me a lot of money!the salon cape to protect my clothes and skin from getting stained.

            <li> Very good on white hair!. It requieres time but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this several times - it definitely colors the gray - I look like I have highlights from the color it turns the gray - turns the gray reddish (tint of Henna).  The process is long as well as messy, but soooooo worth it - i&#x27;ve never dyed my hair before because i do not use unnatural chemicals. It even strengthens your hair.  Thank you Light Mountain Color The Gray!  I will be using this for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> It does take a long time to prepare, but it does cover the grays, and there are no smells...</li>
            <li> I cured Step 1 and Step 2 at the same time in separate glass bowls, then let them sit for a couple of hours.  Then, I followed the instructions to apply them to my hair.  I left Step 2 in my hair for about 3 hours after wrapping my head in saran wrap &amp; wearing a wool knit hat.  I did not use a hair dryer to apply heat, and it turned out well for me.  I rinsed my hair in the shower and did not shampoo until 24 hours later.  After I shampooed my hair, it felt silky and looked shiny.  Much better than toxic chemical-laden hair dyes.  I will not use any other brands of hair dyes.  Light Mountain Natural is the best hair dye product, and it&#x27;s cheap.  Thank goodness this product exists!</li>
            <li> Not until I had this stuff on my hair, washed it out and looked in the mirror did I realize your dark brown product was bright orange red.  I want my money back or another batch of this in actual dark brown color sent to me ASAP. Thanks, Nancy</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. This product makes my hair like so healthy. It&#x27;s a pain to use, but I love the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair color for several years and though it is somewhat messy to put on, the time spent is worth it. I like knowing I am using a safe product and I get many compliments on the shine and color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of going grey young, and this helps quite a lot!  The grey in my hair turns a pretty red color while the rest of my hair goes to my natural hair color of dark brown.  I love the effect.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery of product. Didn&#x27;t last very long, but I plan to try it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other henna hair color in the past and thought I would give this one a try. I have approximately 50% gray and 50% dark brown (the color I was born with) and I&#x27;m not ready to go natural at age 39. I felt that this product did a good job of covering the gray and the color hung in there for about 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coloring with henna is a tedious and incredibly messy process, this product is no different in that regard. This is a 2 step process so it is even a bit more time consuming than a one step process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first step the gray is a ridiculous orange color. After the second step the orange was replaced by a really strange dark green color. The dark green turned to dark brown about a day later after a shampoo (don&#x27;t shampoo in the first 24 hours). Once everything turned dark brown I got a few compliments on the color.</li>
            <li> Takes a little more time and maybe a second coloring, but worth it because my hair looks more natural in it&#x27;s color and my grey hairs have a pretty red highlight in the sunshine.  I get compliments all the time on my hair color.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a hair stylist and continually warned me about Henna products stating that my hair would turn orange and might even fall out! Well, after trying Light Mountain, I told her she should offer it to her customers as a natural alternative to the dangerous chemical dyes. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my hair after using Light Mountain Cover the Gray. I used to wait months and endure long gray roots before I eventually succumbed to the inevitable, smelly, and toxic commercial hair dyes. No more! My hair feels healthier and thicker than ever, and it is a beautiful shade of dark brown. I will never go back to the carcinogenic hair dyes!</li>
            <li> I started using this product over 4 years ago and have used it and only it routinely.  I started with hair that was dark brunette and a bit of gray - perhaps 15%.  The results were that my bangs had some orange remain in them and the color ended up being light to dark medium brown.&lt;br /&gt;**Use organic ground ginger (spice) instead of fresh ginger to shorten steps.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I started really reformulating my process, and finally I have it down to a science.  I&#x27;m posting an update here to say, that I believe the color is darker and holds longer if you put in on your head with a shortened cure process, not letting it sit  to cure for several hours beforehand.  Right before you rinse off package 1, make the mixture for package 2. Then by the time you are done rinsing out package one, you can put package 2 mixture on.  I think the window is maybe to try and get it on within 15-30 minutes of it after mixing it.  I read on a henna website one time that color would be more vivid if it was on your hair while the processing was taking place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is getting it applied well, and by blending, it is very creamy while applying.  In fact, now I just dip my hands in the bowl and spread it on like I am applying shampoo.  I don&#x27;t even use the hair color brush.  I just smear it in and through the hair because it is so creamy. Seriously, this has shaved off at least 30 minutes of application time. My hair is long, about 5 inches below bra strap on back ((hair is now to waist, and 1 box covers it all.))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will come back and try and condense this review into easy to follow steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the 2nd time I used this product and how I prepared it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let both the pack 1 and the pack 2 cure for 3 hours each before starting.  I made them both at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For pack 2, I made it with this:  2 cups total liquid as:  1 cup distilled water, 3/4 cup of Folgers Black Silk Coffee (made fresh an hour earlier with distilled water) and 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar.  Remaining ingredients included: a piece of fresh ginger about 2&amp;#34; long, 3 tablespoons honey and 3 drops of extra virgin olive oil.  To start, I chopped the ginger and put in the blender and blended with 1 cup of distilled water.  Then I moved it into a glass bowl, poured in the coffee, the distilled water, and the evoo.  After it cured for 3 hours, I then added in the honey.  I blended again with the hand held blender stick and let sit.  While sitting the bowls were covered in saran wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the color from pack on 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that pack 1 left my hair a vibrant bright orange, which did not happen when I colored three months earlier.  I think leaving this pack on 45 minutes was key. I was worried that I would miss a vibrant orange strand coloring but I got them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair color turned out a very deep dark color -- not quite black, but darker than chocolate brown.  In fact, it&#x27;s the color of dark chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;The gray turned dark, but not as dark as the rest of the hair, but that seems to be par for the course for henna, and actually looks natural, rather than a sea of black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help with the mess, I bought a pack of 10 towels for only $6.49 (total for the pack) at a beauty supply store.  I also wore a cape that I got there.  The plastic cap that was included with the color, I cut a slice in it to be able to tie it securely on my head, and I cut a tiny hole in the top of it to allow heat to escape.  I read that sometimes you get the red hot spots on top of the crown from the hotter area of the head there, so the hole helps regulate the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the apple cider vinegar (acv) this time because after researching how to apply henna, I came across several posts of how the acv helps unlock the color.  It sure did, I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mixture was also easy to work with for pack 2.  I believe the evoo and the honey did this.  It was so easyto put on, that it was actually dripping a little.  But even though that was a slight nuisance, it was far better than working with the consistency of mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this stuff is a pain to work with, and took 8 hours, and that was with my husband helping. But it was quicker than the first time, and probably if you don&#x27;t wait so long between times it might be easier.  Especially for me, as the first time had to cover more of the gray.  This time only had to cover what had grown out over three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh a very important thing.  This time there was no foul smell.  I believe adding the ginger must have done that, and I&#x27;m so thankful.  Last time I smelled like a hay stack for a week later.  Even at the gym, I would start sweating and smell like hay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, no after smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE Jan 25, 2014 --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here I go again! This will be my 4th time using the product.  I&#x27;m not waiting for so much gray to accumulate before recoloring, so maybe that will help the time.  I usually have to spend half a day running around to get supplies.  I&#x27;m trying to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is additional supplies of what you need:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is a 2-step process, it&#x27;s best if you can have 2 plastic bags for the head.  What I do is cut a 2 inch slit in the front of it and use those 2 ends to tie into a know - this makes the bag fit tight, avoid leaks and not slip around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of using the official coloring cape from the beauty store, I now use a 13 gallon size garbage bag.  I cut a hole on each side for my arms.  I like the beg better because it&#x27;s a little lighter and easier to work with and I can alter the size very easily by folding it up to look like a mini shawl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put 2 plastic bags on the bathroom floor - that way drips can just be thrown away - cuts clean up dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ginger root is definitely what is make the smell non-existent.  With ginger root there is very little hay smell, maybe only like 5% the first few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you are all done, the next day when you take a shower - don&#x27;t shampoo yet.  Use only conditioner.  And the day after that, don&#x27;t shampoo, only conditioner.  This helps the color set in before you have your first shampoo. So today is Saturday, I&#x27;ll condition on Sunday and Monday, and shampoo and condition on Wednesday - back to normal routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the step 2 a bit differently, which I like better.  After step one is done, right before you wash it out, make the stuff for step 2.  Then about 15 minutes later when step 1 is all rinsed out go ahead and put step 2 on.  I did read from someone else that it&#x27;s best to put this on your right after mixing, so I started doing that.  It makes sense - let it start developing on you for a deeper longer lasting color.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing again today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok ladies - good luck!  It&#x27;s a lovely finish - just a bit of a nuisance until you figure out a good routine for you.  I always have to reprint my review here to see what I did and I follow my own steps each time.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go be fabulous!to put on, that it was actually dripping a little.

            <li> The two step combination is the best henna method I have used. It does a great job of coloring greys turning them into subtle highlights in your hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work, but I was pretty disappointed.  I left it on for hours but it didn&#x27;t cover my grays.  They turned a little bit orange which I guess helped them blend a bit, but the color didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of weeks.  The one positive is that the henna did leave my hair really soft, but that&#x27;s not enough to make it worth going through the ordeal of using this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great bang for the buck AND I use an all natural product</li>
            <li> I had had many adverse reactions to the PPD in hair dye and much to my delight, Light Mountain has worked without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;It is messy but well worth it and I WILL be purchasing this again!!</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I colored my hair at salons and with boxed color for over 10 years and it was wrecking my hair.  I started going gray in my twenties and now at 42 I am at least 50% gray, and my hair grows fast, so I was having to color every 4 weeks.  My hair was brittle and lifeless from all the coloring, despite conditioning treatments a couple times a week.  I actually checked this product out about a decade ago and it seemed like too much effort at the time, but fast forward to this past summer and I was at my wits&#x27; end trying to keep my hair looking good and healthy (and without a silver streak down the middle!).  I read the reviews so I knew I was in for much more of a production than what I would have with boxed color, but I felt it was worth it to at least give it a try. I was worried it would make my hair super red or turn it green, but so many people liked it, I thought it might be okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all is said and done, the bottom line is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  My hair is so much healthier.  It is soft as silk.  My husband raves about it, he is an unabashed fan of henna hair color.&lt;br /&gt;2.  My hair has started to regrow and it is thicker than it was.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It is very natural looking, and it fades so much more gently than salon or boxed color.&lt;br /&gt;4.  It doesn&#x27;t make me smell like a chemical factory (another fact my husband loves).&lt;br /&gt;5.  It has a shine and highlights like you see in the hair of very small children...shimmery and natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;6.  If I have to color every 4 weeks, it&#x27;s okay because I am not pouring toxic chemicals on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is messy, and you definitely have to work at figuring out the right water to powder ratio, because it makes a huge difference in how easy it is to apply and how messy it is.  Yes, it takes longer than the boxed colors.  No way around this.  However, it is a natural conditioner and makes your hair so much healthier.  In my opinion, it is totally worth the extra time and mess and effort.  My hair gets a little more red than what I want as it gets more and more faded, but it is a small thing and I know my hair is healthier now than it was 10+ years ago when I started coloring.  If you&#x27;re on the fence and you have been coloring for a long time, I encourage you to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special notes:  I use un-petroleum jelly all around the edges of my face and on my neck and ears to help prevent staining.  I brew dark coffee with distilled water and use that for mixing the dark brown powder to help reduce the red.  Immediately after rinsing, my hair is usually dark brown with a very slight metallic green tinge, but as the indigo oxidizes that goes away, usually within about 4-12 hours.  (since I usually do this in the afternoon, it is gone by morning latest).  Whenever I have complained about this, friends and husband have a hard time seeing what I am seeing, so it isn&#x27;t a big deal.  Just FYI.  Also, use conditioner to help rinse the stuff out of your hair, but don&#x27;t shampoo for 48 hours, it helps keep the color brown as opposed to reddish brown.ittle more red than what I want as it gets more and more faded, but it is a small thing and I know my hair is healthier now than it was 10+ years ago when I started coloring.

            <li> To much trouble to apply.</li>
            <li> I really like henna because it&#x27;s natural, and does not contain chemicals that damage hair.  For me, it lasts until the gray roots start to show, about 6 weeks. My hair is 10-20% gray, and I use different color henna to make it look like highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the cons side, the process of coloring is very messy, and it takes several shampoos to get the henna out of my hair after coloring. My hair also smells like henna for about a week after coloring.</li>
            <li> Got it within time in fact very early&lt;br /&gt;Good experience&lt;br /&gt;Now the real test is when I use the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product three times. It covers my greys perfectly, but it has taken some time getting used to. I have long fine medium chestnut hair with maybe 70% grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first use of henna so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect other than it would be time consuming and messy. This has become my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Mix both steps at the same time and wait about an hour before starting. Because my hair is thin, I only need to use half of each bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cover bathroom floor with plastic garbage bags, cover vanity with paper towels, keep paper towel handy to wipe off any drips, wear old crappy clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Apply step one to clean damp hair. Because henna has seemed to dry out my hair, I added about 1 tbsp avocado oil and a few drops of rosemary essential oil this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cover head with plastic bag and clean up bathroom from step one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Wait one hour. When I rinse the henna off my head at this point, my grey roots are bright orange. This is normal so on to step two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Apply step two. I added an egg to the indigo to help condition my hair and to keep the mixture from being too runny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Another plastic bag back on head, clean bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Rinse off step two using a ton of cheap conditioner. Rinse really well and go heavy on the conditioner, which will help remove the indigo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of time you leave step two on your head is crucial to the color you&#x27;ll come out with. The first time I used this product, I left the indigo on for 45 minutes. It made my hair very dark brown and looked horrible. Just a very flat, blah color. But it did do it&#x27;s job by covering the greys without even a hint of grey showing. Today I left the indigo on for twenty minutes. It still covered my greys and my hair is closer to my natural medium brown color. There are also some highlights, I presume from the henna coming through the indigo, so the color looks more natural and prettier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this product works, just be ready to spend some time and deal with the mess.ry short, this product works, just be ready to spend some time and deal with the mess.</li>
            <li> This is not for me I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I always add powdered cloves spice into my henna powder, about 1 teaspoon... Then whenever I wash my hair for months afterwards, instead of the herbal funky henna smell, my hair smells fresh and great with the mild scent of cloves</li>
            <li> After searching for a pure henna product that give my hair the color it&#x27;s suppose to, in this case, Dark Brown, I&#x27;ve finally found a brand (Light Mountain)  that does it.  I am extremely happy.  I just used this product about 4 days ago.  If it continues to look like it does now, I&#x27;m VERY happy.</li>
            <li> Works very well over gray (cover gray product) and is all natural. I am African American and over 50 years old</li>
            <li> Love the color. Ease of use....well it is messy but I will continue to use this until I can&#x27;t no more. I have used this product 2 times now and the 2nd time I followed other reviews and ended up with better results~THANKS</li>
            <li> I just got the final rinse of this product out of my hair and had to hustle over here and write a review. I have NO MORE GRAY! I am 33 and have not been able to use traditional hair dye for over 8 years after the worst allergic reaction that I still tremble to think about. I have dark brown, almost black, hair and told my husband he was just going to have to love me with salt and pepper hair. I am almost 7 months pregnant and needless to say, the gray was really starting to bother me. It seems to have sprouted in a Cruella de Vil-like stripe in the front over the past year and when I would wear my hair back in a headband, I felt like a skunk. After reading every Amazon review on this product, I decided to give it a shot. No reaction from the allergy test and I was too eager so I skipped the strand test. I followed many of the added suggestions from others (wool cap instead of heat, covered my bathroom in plastic trash bags, vaseline around hairline, 30 min Step 1 and 1 1/2 for Step 2). Yes, it was about a 4 hour total process. I made a lot of \\&quot;plops\\&quot; with Step 1 but realized by Step 2 that it was probably TOO thick and completed Step 2 with barely a drop. It does smell really gross (but perhaps that is amplified by being pregnant!) and I am so so so so happy with the outcome! Great color with some reddish highlights where the gray was that looks so gorgeous and natural. I am thrilled that I don&#x27;t have to just \\&quot;live with the gray\\&quot; anymore.</li>
            <li> good product harmless and gives natural color</li>
            <li> 4 hour application time. My wife refused to deal.</li>
            <li> Omg love this product.  You do need the entire day... but it works. It covers your gray and leaves the hair shine. Be ready to clean your bathroom. .. very messy. Just relax and have several glasses of wine.</li>
            <li> I use to apply traditional Heena for long time. It takes me almost all day to finish the procedure. But this colour is little mess but just takes less than hour to complete. Colour is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Have followed the directions, tried adding day old coffee, seems like most of the color comes off (on my pillow) the first week, leaving the what was gray, now red tinted hair.</li>
            <li> In order to use this product you have to be patient because it requires 2 hours in order for the product to color your hair. I stopped using it and just went to a salon who uses organic or natural hair color.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural hair color product that I have found.  It may take more time to apply than other products but if you follow the directions carefully, you will get great results!  Also, I have called Light Mountain customer service several times to ask questions about the application of the product and they have been very helpful.</li>
            <li> I had a slow week - no important events.  So I decided I could afford an experiment with my hair.  Instead of following the instructions I found with the box, I just combined the content of the BOTH bags and added some water and apple vinegar.  I placed it all in a very warm place (a larger pot with slow boiling water) and let it sit for 3 hours.  Then I added couple eggs, yogurt and some red tea.&lt;br /&gt;The above is what I usually do with henna from other companies.  So I treated this package as a regular henna divided in two packages.&lt;br /&gt;The result is the same - very shiny natural looking healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral:  you can follow two steps process if you want to, but if you have better things to do you can save a lot of time by turning it into a one step.  Worked perfectly fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair: very soft natural dark blond with perhaps 20% or so gray.  Maybe darker thicker hair require two steps?</li>
            <li> Although I am allergic to hair color I continued to use it because I absolutely hate gray hair. A few months ago I experienced the worse reaction ever which resulted in severely damaged hair to the point where I dreadlocks literally washed from my scalp. While visiting a relative in the hospital henna was recommended by a RN. After much research and reading numerous reviews, I decided to use The Light Mountain product. Excellent results. Immediate improvement in the condition of my hair. I will never use chemical hair color again.</li>
            <li> I have less than 10% gray, and it barely touched it.  My hair is very fine and usually takes color easily.&lt;br /&gt;The extra messy two step process just took up my entire morning.  Who has time for that?&lt;br /&gt;Naturtint and Vegetal are much better options than this.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and product is excellent to cover gray hair using natural henna.</li>
            <li> Background:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product, after reading everything I could find about it online, for two reasons.  One: I&#x27;m trying to cut down on chemical usage.  Two: I don&#x27;t have a ton of hair and I read that this product actually makes your hair healthier instead of drying it out and causing breakage like chemical colorants.  I&#x27;ve colored my hair to cover grey (mostly around my hairline) for about ten years always using chemical OTC coloring products and every once in awhile splurging on a salon color.  It&#x27;s been about 8 weeks since my last chemical color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Materials:&lt;br /&gt;I collected these things from around my house to use:&lt;br /&gt;Two glass bowls&lt;br /&gt;Two plastic spoons&lt;br /&gt;One glass pot to boil water in&lt;br /&gt;Plastic baggie&lt;br /&gt;Plastic very wide tooth comb&lt;br /&gt;Wool Cap&lt;br /&gt;Old wash cloth&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer (to use instead of Vaseline around hairline)&lt;br /&gt;Dark colored towel&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these things from a beauty supply store to make my life easier:&lt;br /&gt;Plastic applicator bottle. (reusable) I cut the tip slightly till I had about a 1/4 inch opening.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic applicator brush. (reusable)&lt;br /&gt;Pack of cheap disposable shower caps&lt;br /&gt;Jug of distilled water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Process:&lt;br /&gt;Mixed Step one as instructed using 10oz boiling water.&lt;br /&gt;Waited 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;Mixed Step two using 16oz boiling coffee.&lt;br /&gt;Transferred Step one into a plastic ziplock baggie, cut off corner, and squeezed into applicator bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Washed hair thoroughly using only shampoo no conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Towel dried and combed hair.&lt;br /&gt;Applied generous amount of moisturizer around hair line and on ears.&lt;br /&gt;Applied product using applicator bottle starting in center at hair line and drawing thick lines straight back on scalp working my way left and right til I reached ears.  Applied remainder of product by just plopping on head and and working it in with gloved hands.&lt;br /&gt;Put on shower cap and wool cap.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaned up after Step one.&lt;br /&gt;Transferred Step two to now empty and rinsed out applicator bottle using plastic baggie method.&lt;br /&gt;Waited 20-min.&lt;br /&gt;Rinsed out Step one.  (No shampoo or conditioner.)&lt;br /&gt;Towel dried and gently combed out hair.&lt;br /&gt;GREY HAIR AND SCALP WAS BRIGHT ORANGE.  Not concerned.&lt;br /&gt;Applied generous amount of moisturizer around hair line and on ears.&lt;br /&gt;Applied Step 2 using same method as Step 1.&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 seemed a bit drippier than step one so I rolled some tissues into a long chain a stuck  around hairline to keep from dripping down my face. (Like they do at the salon with cotton strips)&lt;br /&gt;Put on shower cap and wool cap.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaned up after Step 2.&lt;br /&gt;Waited 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Rinsed out Step 2. (Used baking soda and then conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impressions:&lt;br /&gt;It did take a LONG time, but I knew this going in and didn&#x27;t care.  I gave myself and mani/pedi and a facial while I waited.  It could even be a lot of fun to do it with a friend and a bottle wine!&lt;br /&gt;It was a messy process, but cleaned up easily and didn&#x27;t stain anything like chemical color does.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have an issue with rinse out as some reviewers did.  It was gritty, but it didn&#x27;t take all that long to rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is like cooked spinach.  It does linger even after a final rinse with baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;It worked as it said it would.  After blowing drying, my hair is dark brown and the grey a slightly lighter redder brown.  It&#x27;s very shiny, soft and full, more so the normal.&lt;br /&gt;After just two hours my scalp was back to it&#x27;s normal color.  That seems like magic to me!  After chemical coloring my scalp would be dark brown for 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to update with how long it lasts if I remember.  Good luck.  I definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_____________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing my second application 5 weeks later.  I&#x27;d probably let it go longer if this weekend wasn&#x27;t a holiday. My greys have faded to a light red and I have about 3/4 of inch new grey growth.  Don&#x27;t see much fading in the rest of my hair, but my natural color is pretty close to the product color.ch new grey growth.  Don&#x27;t see much fading in the rest of my hair, but my natural color is pretty close to the product color.</li>
            <li> The two step process was a LOT of work especially to end up with bright orange roots. I was truly disappointed with the process.</li>
