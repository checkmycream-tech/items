            <li>Turmeric Serum - Paraben Free!]]</li>
            <li>I bought keeva cream instead, it&#x27;s working much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this turmeric serum.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m once again confident leaving the house w/o a stich of makeup</li>
            <li>More importantly it is gentle and I have realized your skin speaks to you when it is happy and when it is pain - just listen to it :)</li>
            <li>but I loved this so much, I want everyone to try it!</li>
            <li>Turmeric is very good for your skin- especially acne.</li>
            <li>and this is the perfect compliment to the series of other glycolics and retinols I use.</li>
            <li>This is helping to keep my pores clean, and gives a better look to my complexion.</li>
            <li>The serum did make my skin feel smooth and seemed to decrease oil on my forehead and chin.</li>
            <li>Made my breakouts clean up, it&#x27;s like silk when you put it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean earthy sort of smell.</li>
            <li>Trust me when I say I&#x27;ve tried many many products - Proactiv, facials, epiduo, retina-A, red light therapy, AHA/BHA acne lines and laser.</li>
            <li>The fridge and have it cool.</li>
            <li>i love love love it , the skin on my face and neck is so beautiful in such a short time after using the product.i have used a lot of products in the past and this is the best hands down!</li>
            <li>or when I&#x27;m fresh out of the morning shower I apply it once in the morning</li>
            <li>This still has no odor, non-drying, non-greasy, quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>Skin cleared right up</li>
            <li>It smells good and sinks in fast.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, it spreads pretty well around</li>
            <li>and I look forward to the results in the long run, it has great potential and if you&#x27;re looking for something to treat your skin and help treat your break outs</li>
            <li>so I like the fact this is paraben free and made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with this company: I&#x27;ve been gradually moving from Ren skincare products to other, less expensive but effective organic brands and I&#x27;m happy so far.</li>
            <li>So, I cannot remember why I bought this other than I liked the paraben-free and organic nature of it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sensitive to most products just fyi.</li>
            <li>I started using the turmeric serum first as a gentle way of introducing this to my skin</li>
            <li>This keeps my skin clear of acne, improves overall tone and simply feels great</li>
            <li>It has helped clear up my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re big, they hurt, and don&#x27;t easily go away.</li>
            <li>I just use a little on each spot after I wash my face, and it&#x27;s healing nicely.</li>
            <li>meehh.. doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>So, I decided to go gentle and all organic to give my skin a break.</li>
            <li>Think it works but really dries my face out.  </li>
            <li>Turmeric is my main cooking spice because of</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product for the price, but I would not recommend it for severe acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mid 30s woman experiencing mild acne since 30.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older but still have a couple areas that have break outs.  </li>
            <li>Decided to give a go and used instead of my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use only organic, natural, mostly wild-crafted facial products and was looking for a natural acne serum when I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I am a nutritionist and a vegetarian and eat only organic foods and use only organic/paraben free skincare and cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I have never written a review in my life before because I can never be sure if I will stick to this product, but I will stick to this for a long long time.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and acne prone.</li>
            <li>This serum is the only thing I have seen that can tighten pores so effectively: I applied it overnight and in the morning the few enlarged pores on my cheek were not visible!</li>
            <li>I have definitely noticed a difference in my pores (which are large and tend to clog).</li>
            <li>B004VW630O Clear Face</li>
            <li>skin almost 100% clear again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleases with the results so far</li>
            <li>I try to use mostly natural products on my skin</li>
            <li>I can only use it to spot treat which kind of sucks.  </li>
            <li>but so far since using this I haven&#x27;t had a major pimple popping out like it would without it.</li>
            <li>It goes a long way and my fave has cleared up so much.</li>
            <li>I am very choosy about my skin care products and have tried at-home turmeric masks before with bad results (stained my fair skin).</li>
            <li>Plus it really cleared up the few stress spots I&#x27;d been having very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>as most functioning products do, you can&#x27;t expect instant over night difference if you&#x27;re having a pretty bad break out</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much of this product as a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> I wash my face with a everyday drug store face cleanser</li>

            <li> Prior to this I was going through a really bad break out due to stress</li>
            <li> At least two week.</li>
            <li> So I decided to bite the bullet and try it again even though it was a little expensive for me.</li>
            <li> I still had blemishes, however, they did not get worse.</li>
            <li> The pricepoint and size of the product would unfortunately deter me from buying the product again.</li>

            <li> Thank you Passport to Organics for developing THE BEST ORGANIC TURMERIC SERUM! I am a nutritionist and a vegetarian and eat only organic foods and use only organic/paraben free skincare and cosmetics. Turmeric is my main cooking spice because of it&#x27;s excellent health benefits; and to have a very rich, chemical/paraben free [[ASIN:B004VW630O Clear Face Turmeric Serum - Paraben Free!]] organic turmeric serum is A BIG PLUS for my vegetarian, &amp; green life style! Please NEVER CHANGE the great ingredients and quality of this TURMERIC SERUM because I plan to use your products forever. This serum leaves my oily/acne prone skin velvety, flawless &amp; glowing!!! THANK YOU PASSPORT TO ORGANICS!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work... I used it for 2 weeks. My pimple didn&#x27;t go away.  I bought keeva cream instead, it&#x27;s working much better.</li>
            <li> This is helping my acne. I have cystic acne and I&#x27;m seeing improvement.</li>
            <li> Really liked the smell and the texture of the product. It didn&#x27;t break my face out which was a bonus. The pricepoint and size of the product would unfortunately deter me from buying the product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired about every natural serum, spot treatment, cream you can find. Nothing has worked as good as this has. I bought this for the 1st time about two years ago and I loved it. Made my breakouts clean up, it&#x27;s like silk when you put it on. I stopped using it cause I thought I could find something cheaper. My face was really bad blackheads, breakouts on my checks. So I decided to bite the bullet and try it again even though it was a little expensive for me. I&#x27;m so glad I did. It goes a long way and my fave has cleared up so much. My face is looking great thanks to the Turmeric Serum! So if you are on the fence about purchasing please give it a try! I&#x27;m not a person who gives reviews but I loved this so much, I want everyone to try it!</li>
            <li> meehh.. doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 weeks. Prior to this I was going through a really bad break out due to stress and I really wanted to take care of it before it left marks or got worse. I have oily skin and I&#x27;m not sensitive to most products just fyi. This stuff doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, it spreads pretty well around and it actually helped my breakout. It took a few days as most functioning products do, you can&#x27;t expect instant over night difference if you&#x27;re having a pretty bad break out but so far since using this I haven&#x27;t had a major pimple popping out like it would without it. I wash my face with a everyday drug store face cleanser and then I apply the serum or when I&#x27;m fresh out of the morning shower I apply it once in the morning and before I go to bed as well. I&#x27;m pleases with the results so far and I look forward to the results in the long run, it has great potential and if you&#x27;re looking for something to treat your skin and help treat your break outs I recommend this. My only gripe is the smell is something I&#x27;m not used to but it&#x27;s nothing that will prevent me from using it again, you can tell it has something organic in it is all. No perfumy smell like other concocted products.</li>
            <li> My son have a lot of scar from acne,  he&#x27;s use while it work for his face, but have to take time,  it can not clear in one or two day.  At least two week.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this if you have a dry skin. I did not like this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this turmeric serum. It is part of my daily routine, I use it both morning and night. It has helped clear up my skin tremendously. It is very light and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this, but I&#x27;m glad I got it! I have delt with cystic acne for 16 years (since I was 19) on my chin and cheeks. They&#x27;re big, they hurt, and don&#x27;t easily go away. This serum hasn&#x27;t fully gotten rid of them under the skin BUT... it has sped up the healing on the surface of the skin!!! You wouldn&#x27;t even know the cyst is there!  No pain, no open sore, not bright redness! I just use a little on each spot after I wash my face, and it&#x27;s healing nicely.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30s and have had acne for as long as I can remember. I use only organic, natural, mostly wild-crafted facial products and was looking for a natural acne serum when I purchased this product. I used it morning and evening for a couple months and did not see any difference in my breakouts. I still had blemishes, however, they did not get worse. The serum did make my skin feel smooth and seemed to decrease oil on my forehead and chin. It&#x27;s a decent product for the price, but I would not recommend it for severe acne.</li>
            <li> This serum is the only thing I have seen that can tighten pores so effectively: I applied it overnight and in the morning the few enlarged pores on my cheek were not visible! Plus it really cleared up the few stress spots I&#x27;d been having very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with this company: I&#x27;ve been gradually moving from Ren skincare products to other, less expensive but effective organic brands and I&#x27;m happy so far. My skin glows these days from using the Turmeric cream and serum together.</li>
            <li> 2nd order. I&#x27;m mid 30s woman experiencing mild acne since 30. Recently changed all my skin care to organic, all-natural. Hard to know which products were responsible for drastic change. Skin cleared right up and I&#x27;m once again confident leaving the house w/o a stich of makeup (it had been YEARS). This still has no odor, non-drying, non-greasy, quickly absorbed. I use after clarisonic+cleanser and toner and follow w moisturizer (eminence probiotic) Ran out of this stuff and mistakenly ordered the tumeric face cream instead of serum. Decided to give a go and used instead of my normal moisturizer. Bam-acne returned. May work for winter but too oily for summer. Re-ordered the serum. 24 hrs and 2 applications later...skin almost 100% clear again. It was definitely this stuff. Give it a try- you have nothing to lose but the pox upon your face.</li>
            <li> I try to use mostly natural products on my skin so I like the fact this is paraben free and made with natural ingredients. Turmeric is very good for your skin- especially acne. You don&#x27;t need to use very much of this product as a little goes a long way. It has a turmeric scent but it&#x27;s not overwhelming and I actually like it. It&#x27;s a clean earthy sort of smell. So, if you have acne prone skin this is an excellent product for you to try!!</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and acne prone. Trust me when I say I&#x27;ve tried many many products - Proactiv, facials, epiduo, retina-A, red light therapy, AHA/BHA acne lines and laser. I was tired of all of it because it not only failed to work consistently but it also made my skin go through pain. So, I decided to go gentle and all organic to give my skin a break. I started using the turmeric serum first as a gentle way of introducing this to my skin but it made all the difference. Now I use the turmeric serum and turmeric cream. I have used this for 3 months and it took only a week to see a difference. No purging or anything. My skin can breathe and it is radiant! I have never written a review in my life before because I can never be sure if I will stick to this product, but I will stick to this for a long long time. It is acne fighting, all organic and anti aging. More importantly it is gentle and I have realized your skin speaks to you when it is happy and when it is pain - just listen to it :)</li>
            <li> This is helping to keep my pores clean, and gives a better look to my complexion. I use it at night, followed by moisturizer. I have definitely noticed a difference in my pores (which are large and tend to clog). Will definitely keep buying.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, so nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> i love love love it , the skin on my face and neck is so beautiful in such a short time after using the product.i have used a lot of products in the past and this is the best hands down!</li>
            <li> this is a terrific serum..fine lines ..even finer. a must try product..you wont be dissappointed.havd been using it only for two weeks.</li>
            <li> Think it works but really dries my face out.  I can only use it to spot treat which kind of sucks.  Other reviewers didn&#x27;t seem to have that problem.  I have combination skin so the area around my mouth and under my nose is always dry and the rest can be somewhat oily, this BURNED the bejeezus out of my dry areas, I had to wash it off immediately, and seemed to dry the rest of my face out.  But that&#x27;s just me maybe</li>
            <li> I have used this on and off for months, but I like to put it I. The fridge and have it cool. Feels good!</li>
            <li> This is one of those times that 5 stars is just not enough! I am very choosy about my skin care products and have tried at-home turmeric masks before with bad results (stained my fair skin). So, I cannot remember why I bought this other than I liked the paraben-free and organic nature of it. I have to change up my skin care to keep my skin looking good and this is the perfect compliment to the series of other glycolics and retinols I use. This keeps my skin clear of acne, improves overall tone and simply feels great (the smell is great). I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older but still have a couple areas that have break outs.  I&#x27;ve used this a few times now as an evening fixer and it seems to work really good (not overnight but it helps with problem).  It smells good and sinks in fast.</li>
