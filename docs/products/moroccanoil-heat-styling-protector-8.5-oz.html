            <li>Love the scent !</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Use this heat styling spray to keep fine, fly away hair tamed and well-coiffed.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not as thrilled as I had hoped to be.</li>
            <li>I am sure this is a good product for most people.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft and it smells great too!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the product however not too thrilled about the amount of alcohol that is in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Working good so far, my hair looked so beautiful and healthy after using this product along with the frizz control</li>
            <li>did love the shampoo</li>
            <li>Buy more time with you</li>
            <li>I bought it because I love Maroccanoil treatment.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I actually love everything made by Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my coarse wavy hair!  </li>
            <li>Favorite for giving my hair a salon-done look.</li>
            <li>Love all the Moroccan oil products.  </li>
            <li>so glad I found it on amazon</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I love Amazon ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>The smell is great and it leaves my hair looking smooth and straight with every use.</li>
            <li>Moroccan oil products are really great, light weight no heavy feeling and really smells great, my stylist couldn&#x27;t come through for me,</li>
            <li>May be good as a leave in but curly hair but for straight hair I would not recommend at all.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if it makes a difference, but it smells good.</li>
            <li>Looks shiny &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light spray, so it doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily.</li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair as smooth or shiny as the Chi products.</li>
            <li>Works great on my fine, curly, fuzzy hair when I&#x27;m using the flat iron.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely great for flat ironing, but beware of using while using a waver.</li>
            <li>It is a great product that keeps my hair from frizzing and looking dry.</li>
            <li>it leaves your hair hard, ive ALWAYS used heat protectors and I guess the cheaper ones work best.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and does not weigh down  my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have a full bottle at home being unused.</li>
            <li>Product was about 3/4ths full</li>
            <li>I love these products however this particular item has alcohol in it..</li>
            <li>Light, nice smell and not to heavy for my fine hair I also use in-between washes as a refresher and style!</li>
            <li>my long hair nice &amp; easy</li>
            <li>This product is good, but I prefer the oil rather than this because it seemed to dry my hair out somewhat.  </li>
            <li>I will stick with Alterna Anti-Breakage Thermal Protectant Spray Free of Parabens,Gluten,SodiumChloride, Phthalates and synthetic Color.and reduces breakage by 87% and instantly repairs and strengthening Hair and smells 100% better than this .</li>
            <li>I think it is worth it though - hence the 5 star recommendation.</li>
            <li>Leaves it sticky, kind of freezy, and dry.</li>
            <li>Light not a heavy product!</li>
            <li>Also very high in alcohol content and DRYING!</li>
            <li>The Alcohol seems to linger through the Day,not Pretty.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;Really does keep my hair from burning during curling and such!!</li>
            <li>Today was my first day using this product</li>
            <li>If you blow dry or straighten your hair every day this stuff is great to help protect against daily heat damage.</li>
            <li>I use this most the time when I dry my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great not is not effective!</li>
            <li>I was really surprised to be so disappointed as the line smells soooo good and the oil is great.</li>
            <li>could be more hydrating, almost feels like a loose hairspray&lt;br /&gt;wish</li>
            <li>it really protec from thermal damage...</li>
            <li>Thanks for the efficiency and honesty.</li>
            <li>I have very wavy (almost curly) hair -</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>The real stuff no issues</li>
            <li>gentle on the hair shaft</li>
            <li>After using this for a week, my hair became absolutely fried</li>
            <li>the scent is heavenly just don&#x27;t spray to much on</li>
            <li>My hair does not frizz with the high humidity, stays straight.</li>
            <li>makes my hair full, also allows it to hold the blow out for an extra day or so.</li>
            <li>Live this product!</li>
            <li>I live in Florida so keeping my hair straight is a challenge during the summer months; takes lots of abuse.  </li>
            <li>One thing to note about this product is that it is a little more labor intensive than I thought.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and it does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smell</li>
            <li>You have to spray each section of hair prior to using the hot tool.</li>
            <li>I have used Chi heat styling on my thick, dry, curly, frizz prone hair to flat iron it for years and was happy with the results.</li>
            <li>A few things i like about this for example it does leave a shine and  seems to leave my Hair Frizz Free</li>
            <li>Now, there could be some operator error involved as I am FAR from a professional stylist.</li>
            <li>but so far I still have hair</li>
            <li>Honestly my hair could just about burn off before I would notice because I am so addicted to the smell of these products.</li>
            <li>This product is heavy and will not hold a curl, but if you want your hair to lay flat then this is the product for you! :)</li>
            <li>this stuff made my hair so sticky and dry feeling it might be the right bottle but definalty not the same product.</li>
            <li>It also helps with the wave that inevitably comes back (with rain, humidity), my hair stays straight all day.</li>
            <li>I thought it would smell exactly like the other Moroccan Oil products, but this product has a alcohol-base smell.  </li>

            <li> I had heard a lot about these products but this one in particular leaves my hair stiff and with no shine, didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> I bought it to protect my hair from flat ironing but it makes your hair crunchy and sticky.</li>
            <li> and they suggested I try this for flat ironing.</li>
            <li> It left my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it as heat protection when I blow dry and used the flat iron.</li>
            <li> This product protects it and helps with the frizz, I should&#x27;ve tried this long ago.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and this product is way too heavy.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair extremely dry.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry out my hair instead of smoothing it out.</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil Heat Styling Protection does not leave my hair dry, which is a problem for me.</li>
            <li> Works well for straightening, do not use with just a curly blow dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything on my hair that actually boosts my mood due to the heavenly smell!</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel very dry.  </li>
            <li> but the conditioner was not what I expected i was looking for something to make combing thur</li>
            <li> but this was not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> is way over powering unlike other brands of Moroccanoil</li>
            <li> So disappointed because I love the oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works as a heat protector because I only ended up using it twice.  </li>
            <li> But this heating styling product leaves my hair feeling very rough.  </li>
            <li> ,The down size is the smell of Alcohol</li>
            <li> Helps to keep the frizz down</li>
            <li> I feel compelled to write a review because this product is extremely expensive for such a low quality.</li>
            <li> However, I will say that there&#x27;s a slight odor of burnt hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a month and a half</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no greasy feeling, your hair doesn&#x27;t go limp.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product is a waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep trying it for a few days</li>
            <li> Again, not sure if it&#x27;s the operator or the product but honestly, I&#x27;ve never smelled that before with other heat protection products.</li>
            <li> However, after using this product, my hair is hard to brash through.</li>
            <li> not a fan product makes hair very stiff and not workable</li>
            <li> Also the hair stay hard after drying.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> and i was forced to get a hair cut.</li>
            <li> not sure how alcohol is protecting your hair from heat!</li>
            <li> But crispy/hardenned hair is not a good look....not a novice here either!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m game!</li>
            <li> Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m disappointed because I like the smell and sometimes the Chi products make me itchy.</li>
            <li> and I hated it!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> This stuff  is the worst!</li>
            <li> and i needed a heat protectant spray for the days i didn&#x27;t wash my hair, however, it made the ends of my hair disgusting and it almost seemed as if it magnified the heat on my hair.</li>

            <li> I have been looking for a great styling product and I can truly say I have found it! Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed. There&#x27;s no greasy feeling, your hair doesn&#x27;t go limp. I love how shiny my hair is after using this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT, SMELLS AMAZING!!! :)</li>
            <li> Do not purchase.  The product makes your hair greesey after you dry/straighten it.  I thought it would smell exactly like the other Moroccan Oil products, but this product has a alcohol-base smell.  It makes your hair feel and look like you haven&#x27;t showered for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> All of the Moroccan Oil products I&#x27;ve used are great! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product is a waste. What  it actually does to your hair is: Leaves it sticky, kind of freezy, and dry. Even though I didn&#x27;t buy the product on Amazon I feel compelled to write a review because this product is extremely expensive for such a low quality.</li>
            <li> Dislike the smell and texture of product. Also the hair stay hard after drying.&lt;br /&gt;But it really protec from thermal damage...</li>
            <li> A few things i like about this for example it does leave a shine and  seems to leave my Hair Frizz Free,The down size is the smell of Alcohol is way over powering unlike other brands of Moroccanoil this does not have that great scent like the Cream or oil and i don&#x27;t spray alot and still leaves my Hair with that crunchy feeling.The Alcohol seems to linger through the Day,not Pretty.I will stick with Alterna Anti-Breakage Thermal Protectant Spray Free of Parabens,Gluten,SodiumChloride, Phthalates and synthetic Color.and reduces breakage by 87% and instantly repairs and strengthening Hair and smells 100% better than this .</li>
            <li> Item arrived ahead of schedule</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product i left my hair gummy n sticky feeling I don&#x27;t think i will use it again&lt;br /&gt;I did love the shampoo but the conditioner was not what I expected i was looking for something to make combing thur my long hair nice &amp; easy it was not</li>
            <li> I was so happy to buy this product until I started using it. It leaves my hair extremely dry. Also, while I was using it, it use to leave my hair auper knotty and I hated it!&lt;br /&gt;Now I have a full bottle at home being unused. Had to buy another heat protectant product.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product and recommend it to everyone. Thanks for the efficiency and honesty. Buy more time with you</li>
            <li> This stuff  is the worst! I bought it to protect my hair from flat ironing but it makes your hair crunchy and sticky. May be good as a leave in but curly hair but for straight hair I would not recommend at all. So disappointed because I love the oil but this was not what I expected at all. Plus, it has alcohol in it so it dries the hair too. Yuck!</li>
            <li> I bought it because I love Maroccanoil treatment. However, after using this product, my hair is hard to brash through. I bought it, but I think I&#x27;m not gonna use it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product and would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this product. It seems to dry out my hair instead of smoothing it out. Could work for others. I use the oil and it is a completely different feel then this spray</li>
            <li> Loved it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I actually love everything made by Moroccan Oil. The smell is great and it leaves my hair looking smooth and straight with every use. I have very wavy (almost curly) hair - when I use this styling protection, not only does it protect my hair but it also leaves my hair looking shiny. It also helps with the wave that inevitably comes back (with rain, humidity), my hair stays straight all day. One thing to note about this product is that it is a little more labor intensive than I thought. You have to spray each section of hair prior to using the hot tool. I think it is worth it though - hence the 5 star recommendation.</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo and conditioner a couple of years,  and they work wonderful.  But this heating styling product leaves my hair feeling very rough.  I don&#x27;t know if is protecting my hair from the heat.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff! I will be purchasing from them again. If you haven&#x27;t used this before - you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I love the Moroccan Oil products! I use the shampoo, conditioner, root boost, mask, hair spray, heat spray, and oil. I like to layer the products to extend the scent. This product smells great and does not weigh down  my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I truly recommend it! It gives a beautiful shinny effect in your hair! What are you waiting for? Just buy it and you wont regret.</li>
            <li> Use this heat styling spray to keep fine, fly away hair tamed and well-coiffed.  This is a great heat styling product and a good hair care line.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am sure this is a good product for most people. A friend of mine recommended this because she uses it however it did not work for me. It left my hair dry. I wanted to use it as heat protection when I blow dry and used the flat iron.</li>
            <li> not a fan product makes hair very stiff and not workable</li>
            <li> noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!&lt;br /&gt; this stuff made my hair so sticky and dry feeling it might be the right bottle but definalty not the same product.</li>
            <li> contains alcohol in the formula</li>
            <li> Live this product! Makes my hair very soft and it smells great too! Light not a heavy product! Love it!</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil Heat Styling Protection does not leave my hair dry, which is a problem for me. My hair does not frizz with the high humidity, stays straight.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep the frizz down</li>
            <li> Light, nice smell and not to heavy for my fine hair I also use in-between washes as a refresher and style!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the product however not too thrilled about the amount of alcohol that is in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> it leaves your hair hard, ive ALWAYS used heat protectors and I guess the cheaper ones work best. I was really surprised to be so disappointed as the line smells soooo good and the oil is great. But crispy/hardenned hair is not a good look....not a novice here either!</li>
            <li> The product is great. I live in Florida so keeping my hair straight is a challenge during the summer months; takes lots of abuse.  This product protects it and helps with the frizz, I should&#x27;ve tried this long ago.</li>
            <li> Working good so far, my hair looked so beautiful and healthy after using this product along with the frizz control</li>
            <li> Smells great not is not effective! Also very high in alcohol content and DRYING! I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my coarse wavy hair!  I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;Really does keep my hair from burning during curling and such!!</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery. Good Product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works as a heat protector because I only ended up using it twice.  It left my hair feeling gross and like there was a ton of product on it.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this most the time when I dry my hair. It arrived on time and was what i was looking for in a product.</li>
            <li> makes my hair full, also allows it to hold the blow out for an extra day or so. Love the scent !</li>
            <li> Favorite for giving my hair a salon-done look.</li>
            <li> Love all the Moroccan oil products.  Works great on my fine, curly, fuzzy hair when I&#x27;m using the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Make your hair sticky and greasy looking after straightening.</li>
            <li> It is a great product that keeps my hair from frizzing and looking dry. My hair is fine and it does not weigh it down. Looks shiny &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil products are really great, light weight no heavy feeling and really smells great, my stylist couldn&#x27;t come through for me, so glad I found it on amazon</li>
            <li> I had heard a lot about these products but this one in particular leaves my hair stiff and with no shine, didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and this product is way too heavy. Plus it smelled a lot like rubbing alcohol. Would not purchase again or if I did I would try their line for thinner hair. When I purchased this I didn&#x27;t know they had products for thinner hair.</li>
            <li> The real stuff no issues</li>
            <li> could be more hydrating, almost feels like a loose hairspray&lt;br /&gt;wish is were a hydrating protection&lt;br /&gt;still gentle on the hair shaft</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely great for flat ironing, but beware of using while using a waver. This product is heavy and will not hold a curl, but if you want your hair to lay flat then this is the product for you! :)</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel very dry.  It smells awesome.  Works well for straightening, do not use with just a curly blow dry.</li>
            <li> I love these products however this particular item has alcohol in it.. not sure how alcohol is protecting your hair from heat! still like the product but probably will not order again. smells great!</li>
            <li> Marvelous heat protector .</li>
            <li> Today was my first day using this product and I&#x27;m on the fence about it. It seems to have left a sticky, crunchy residue. Now, there could be some operator error involved as I am FAR from a professional stylist. I use the shampoo and conditioner so I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m getting the scent from that or if the heat protection is adding to that. However, I will say that there&#x27;s a slight odor of burnt hair. Again, not sure if it&#x27;s the operator or the product but honestly, I&#x27;ve never smelled that before with other heat protection products. I&#x27;m going to keep trying it for a few days but I&#x27;m not as thrilled as I had hoped to be.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I noticed that my ends were getting gross and i needed a heat protectant spray for the days i didn&#x27;t wash my hair, however, it made the ends of my hair disgusting and it almost seemed as if it magnified the heat on my hair. After using this for a week, my hair became absolutely fried and i was forced to get a hair cut.</li>
            <li> This product is good, but I prefer the oil rather than this because it seemed to dry my hair out somewhat.  It also contains alcohol which I don&#x27;t like to use with heat, but then maybe all products of this type contain alcohol - I don&#x27;t know.  The packing was insufficient and there was a big dent on the side, but the spray still worked.  I am very sensitive to smell but I do tolerate all Moroccan Oil products so I will continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> This is a winner.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I have hopped on the curling wand band wagon. I&#x27;ve been using for about a month and a half and I feel it is helping add some protection for my hair. Honestly my hair could just about burn off before I would notice because I am so addicted to the smell of these products. I&#x27;ve never used anything on my hair that actually boosts my mood due to the heavenly smell! I feel there is nothing that can 100% save damage from heat styling but so far I still have hair so I&#x27;m game!</li>
            <li> It seems good. I can&#x27;t really tell if it makes a difference, but it smells good. It&#x27;s a light spray, so it doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and the scent is heavenly just don&#x27;t spray to much on</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff it gives my hair more body and protects it from all the heat products I use</li>
            <li> I have used Chi heat styling on my thick, dry, curly, frizz prone hair to flat iron it for years and was happy with the results. I won a gift certificate for a salon I have never been to and they suggested I try this for flat ironing. Since I had a gift certificate, I bought it and I&#x27;ve now used it about three times. It does not leave my hair as smooth or shiny as the Chi products. It works &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but I went back to what I know leaves my hair silkiest, I&#x27;m disappointed because I like the smell and sometimes the Chi products make me itchy. Even though I didn&#x27;t buy this here on Amazon, I wanted to add my comments here for anyone with similar hair issues.</li>
            <li> If you blow dry or straighten your hair every day this stuff is great to help protect against daily heat damage.</li>
            <li> It works. I can recoment you the product</li>
            <li> This is a amazing product for your hair! I love it and I love Amazon ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> The bottle was leaking.  Product was about 3/4ths full</li>
