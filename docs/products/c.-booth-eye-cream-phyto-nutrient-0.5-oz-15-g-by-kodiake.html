    <ol>
            <li>I DONT LIE ITS GREAT!</li>
            <li>Great results!</li>
            <li>c.booth eye cream used to be wonderful.</li>
            <li>this is the best eye cream I ever used.</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>and my eyes look great</li>
            <li>Great eye cream that does what it says.  </li>
            <li>And then I found C. Booth&#x27;s nutrient eye cream at a discount store and I loved it</li>
            <li>This cream is not even a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I cant believe that something this cheap works so great!</li>
            <li>That keeps me from wanting to order more!</li>
            <li>, it goes great under concealer, it leaves my eye skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this because Avon stopped making the eye cream I liked</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this product because I love C Booth&#x27;s lotions, and the first time I used it nothing happened.</li>
            <li>I would purchase this again. :)</li>
            <li>After more use there will be no evidence they were ever there..</li>
            <li>I used it for many years recommending and giving it to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Glad I found it ..  </li>
            <li>I loved patting it gently under each eye in the am before my tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Clearly rancid, as the fresh product I DO know has a pleasant scent!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and does not irritate eyes in any way.  </li>
            <li>The C. Booth black licorice eye cream was one of the best things in my cabinet.</li>
            <li>, please, folks, let us keep sellers educated and honest about sell-by and expiration dates, especially when it comes to better products with no preservatives, because you will literally be burned every time!  </li>
            <li>It filled in the lines and never stung.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;*It is light</li>
            <li>Love that it is reasonable.</li>
            <li>This Eye Cream is gentle, creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Booth products are made from nothing but the best of natural and organic extracted and whole ingredients (fruit, herbs, vegetables, vitamins), which DO NOT last much beyond the sell-by date.</li>
            <li>Besides asking about the freshness of the product before buying, write reviews afterward and tell about your experiences, even if you don&#x27;t feel it worth your time and money to return the products each and every time.</li>
            <li>BUY RIGHT</li>
            <li>I only paid a little over 5 bucks and it work just as good or better than a $30 product...</li>
            <li>Buy for seller NIRAD they are reliable and fast!</li>
            <li>The boxes were yellowing and said on top for Rite Aid only NOT for resale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried so many eye creams but this is the only one that works.excelent product would not go a day without applying it</li>
            <li>I suppose I might repurchase this if my under eye circles come back, but I will continue searching for an eye cream that I really love.</li>
            <li>The C.Booth Phyto Nutrient Eye Cream, which I was excited to order, not having been able to find it for a while, smelled, just like the other out-of-date products--of vomit!  </li>
            <li>This product really needs to be discontinued on Amazon, the seller is selling out of date, very old rancid product and imagine it goes around your EYES!!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I am very dissaponted with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*It is a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Seems to do more for my under-eye bags than other products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay eye cream other than that though.</li>
            <li>, a little peice of me would die inside :) this is my new go to eye</li>
            <li>This new version is a pitiful runner up to the that.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend to people prone to allergic reactions or those with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this daily and it is very lightweight and nourishing to the eye area.</li>
            <li>(Well, it was when I purchased it almost 4 months ago), it has gone up considerably since then.&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li>Takes very little product and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>The negative reviews may be enough to stimulate some positive change, and the positive reviews enough to encourage sellers to sell nothing but fresh product.</li>
            <li>I have ordered about four of them, the first was ok and the others were all old, smelled bad and rancid.  </li>

            <li> Old enough to burn two little moon shapes, one under each eye, that made it look as though I&#x27;d received two shiners!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am shocked to be honest...</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, but the skin around my eye area is specially dry.</li>
            <li> and I still have half the jar left ...</li>
            <li> I only use it at night because I found it to be a little too oily for daytime use</li>
            <li> /&gt;*A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> From now on, I plan to ask the sellers how old their products are BEFORE I purchase, because claims of &amp;#34;NEW,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;BRAND NEW,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;SHRINK WRAPPED,&amp;#34; obviously mean less than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Although I should have known better, I held my breath and tried a small amount under each eye anyway--after all, neither the packaging nor bottle had a date (alert: a very bad sign when these are missing), so how old could the cream be, anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will NOT put this any where on my body much less around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The black licorice eye cream, that is.</li>
            <li> Dark circles disappear after a few weeks and eyes look brighter, and makes u look rested.</li>
            <li> the dark cirlcles are virtually GONE no lie!</li>
            <li> , if you get a little in your eye it burns like hell, will never order anything from this seller again.</li>
            <li> feel that it has lightened my under eye area a little bit&lt;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> waste of money, its eye cream</li>
            <li> This product must have been expired due to the strong rotten smell, awful.</li>
            <li> I am disabled with chronic illness and unable to go out and shop myself, so it is frustrating to have to sit and home and wait to determine whether or not my purchases are going to be a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream locally out of desperation and am so sorry.</li>
            <li> Not sure what ingredient I was allergic to, but it was not good.</li>
            <li> All you need is a very small amount to cover the while eye area.</li>
            <li> I get so tired of purchasing products that don&#x27;t do what they say the will.  </li>
            <li> I feel terrible about giving away my last two jars to friends because then I found out that the company stopped making it.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry if you purchase this eye cream.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;*It smelled &#x27;stale&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very irritating to my eyes.</li>
            <li> it is dangerous.  </li>
            <li> horrible, smells terrible, boxes were faded and yellow,</li>

            <li> The C.Booth Phyto Nutrient Eye Cream, which I was excited to order, not having been able to find it for a while, smelled, just like the other out-of-date products--of vomit!  Clearly rancid, as the fresh product I DO know has a pleasant scent! Although I should have known better, I held my breath and tried a small amount under each eye anyway--after all, neither the packaging nor bottle had a date (alert: a very bad sign when these are missing), so how old could the cream be, anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Old enough to burn two little moon shapes, one under each eye, that made it look as though I&#x27;d received two shiners!&lt;br /&gt; What should I have expected?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During these orders, it got so that I was dreading the receipt of Amazon packages in the mail. I am disabled with chronic illness and unable to go out and shop myself, so it is frustrating to have to sit and home and wait to determine whether or not my purchases are going to be a complete waste of money. However, I am going to try not to let myself be fooled in future, and hope my ideas below are helpful for others, in ordering any products with expiration dates:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C. Booth products are made from nothing but the best of natural and organic extracted and whole ingredients (fruit, herbs, vegetables, vitamins), which DO NOT last much beyond the sell-by date. From now on, I plan to ask the sellers how old their products are BEFORE I purchase, because claims of &amp;#34;NEW,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;BRAND NEW,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;SHRINK WRAPPED,&amp;#34; obviously mean less than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please, folks, let us keep sellers educated and honest about sell-by and expiration dates, especially when it comes to better products with no preservatives, because you will literally be burned every time!  Besides asking about the freshness of the product before buying, write reviews afterward and tell about your experiences, even if you don&#x27;t feel it worth your time and money to return the products each and every time. The negative reviews may be enough to stimulate some positive change, and the positive reviews enough to encourage sellers to sell nothing but fresh product.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product because I love C Booth&#x27;s lotions, and the first time I used it nothing happened. The second day, my eyes started to itch, and the third day I woke up with red, swollen and blistered skin all around my eyes (underneath &amp; on my eyelids). I ended up at Urgent Care getting a steroid shot in my hip. Not sure what ingredient I was allergic to, but it was not good. Would not recommend to people prone to allergic reactions or those with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, but the skin around my eye area is specially dry. When I need go shopping for a moisturizing cream, all I find is eye creams for undereye circles, I never find just a simple moisturizing eye cream. And then I found C. Booth&#x27;s nutrient eye cream at a discount store and I loved it, it goes great under concealer, it leaves my eye skin smooth. It doesn&#x27;t sting (but of course I don&#x27;t apply inside my eye). I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream. All you need is a very small amount to cover the while eye area. I only use it at night because I found it to be a little too oily for daytime use but I still give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream locally out of desperation and am so sorry. The C. Booth black licorice eye cream was one of the best things in my cabinet. I feel terrible about giving away my last two jars to friends because then I found out that the company stopped making it. I look at least a decade younger than anybody can guess and this eye cream is one reason. I loved patting it gently under each eye in the am before my tinted moisturizer. It filled in the lines and never stung. This new version is a pitiful runner up to the that.</li>
            <li> Seems to do more for my under-eye bags than other products I&#x27;ve used.  Takes very little product and goes on easily.  However, since it was an Amazon add-on item, I do not know why I should be charged $4.99 shipping--that is supposedly the purpose of having add-on.  That keeps me from wanting to order more!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This cream is not even a good moisturizer. I am very dissaponted with this purchase.  I won&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily and it is very lightweight and nourishing to the eye area. I would purchase this again. :)</li>
            <li> Buy for seller NIRAD they are reliable and fast! I cant believe that something this cheap works so great! I gave it about a week or so and my eyes look great the dark cirlcles are virtually GONE no lie! After more use there will be no evidence they were ever there.. and I still have half the jar left ...although it is a small jar  it does not take much just follow the directions once in the morning and once at night for about 3 times a week sometimes I do 4......I am shocked to be honest... I only paid a little over 5 bucks and it work just as good or better than a $30 product... please don&#x27;t stop selling this, a little peice of me would die inside :) this is my new go to eye cream!...THANK YOU IT WORKS MIRACLES ...BUY RIGHT NOW PEOPLE... I DONT LIE ITS GREAT!</li>
            <li> Great eye cream that does what it says.  Finally!!!  I get so tired of purchasing products that don&#x27;t do what they say the will.  You will not be sorry if you purchase this eye cream.</li>
            <li> This Eye Cream is gentle, creamy and smooth.  Easy to apply and does not irritate eyes in any way.  Great results!</li>
            <li> This product really needs to be discontinued on Amazon, the seller is selling out of date, very old rancid product and imagine it goes around your EYES!!  This is not only unethical it is dangerous.  I have ordered about four of them, the first was ok and the others were all old, smelled bad and rancid.  The boxes were yellowing and said on top for Rite Aid only NOT for resale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT put this any where on my body much less around my eyes.  Please do NOT order this product.</li>
            <li> c.booth eye cream used to be wonderful. The black licorice eye cream, that is. I used it for many years recommending and giving it to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;This product is nothing like the former. It is very irritating to my eyes. I thought to use it as a facial cream but it flakes and can&#x27;t be used  under even the lightest application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W</li>
            <li> this is the best eye cream I ever used. Dark circles disappear after a few weeks and eyes look brighter, and makes u look rested. I have tried so many eye creams but this is the only one that works.excelent product would not go a day without applying it</li>
            <li> Love that it is reasonable. My hubby even noticed a change.  Yeah!!  Glad I found it ..  Hope they don&#x27;t stop making it</li>
            <li> Soothing and cooling and not greasy</li>
            <li> horrible, smells terrible, boxes were faded and yellow, waste of money, its eye cream, if you get a little in your eye it burns like hell, will never order anything from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Smells awful. I would not purchase anymore. This product must have been expired due to the strong rotten smell, awful.</li>
            <li> I bought this because Avon stopped making the eye cream I liked and I was looking for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random:&lt;br /&gt;*It is in a plastic container&lt;br /&gt;*It smelled &#x27;stale&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;*It is a reasonable price. (Well, it was when I purchased it almost 4 months ago), it has gone up considerably since then.&lt;br /&gt;*I feel that it has lightened my under eye area a little bit&lt;br /&gt;*A little goes a long way, I&#x27;m just now reaching the bottom of the pot and I use it 2-3 times a day since I bought it&lt;br /&gt;*It is light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;*Ever since the beginning it will sting my eyes for about 20 seconds after application, ouch!&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s a bit greasy, if I don&#x27;t let it sink in all the way before putting my make up on it makes my concealer slide and look funky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably would not repurchase this again because it irritates my eye after I put it on. I have to close my eye and hope that makes the stinging stop. It&#x27;s an okay eye cream other than that though. I suppose I might repurchase this if my under eye circles come back, but I will continue searching for an eye cream that I really love.</li>
            <li> Very good product., immediate effect</li>
    </ol>
