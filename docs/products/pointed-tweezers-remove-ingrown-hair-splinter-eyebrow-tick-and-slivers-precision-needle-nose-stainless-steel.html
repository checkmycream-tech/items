            <li>The tweezer were heavier then most</li>

            <li>These are my new favorite tweezers!</li>

            <li>Not only would they be good for your makeup bag, but also your crafting supplies.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems like such a small thing, but having tweezers that work well, grasp even fine hair easily, and do the job they&#x27;re meant for, is priceless.</li>
            <li>they are BY FAR my favorite pair and GO EVERYWHERE with me.  </li>
            <li>Major difference on pain factor, so much easier and more precise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Use - Because these tweezers have a super-sharp, fine tip, they can easily pick up in-grown hairs with minimal damage to the surrounding skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall, quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>and these are exactly what</li>
            <li>It is exactly what she needed.  </li>
            <li>only by providing such a superior product but also with the care and attention to detail in their packaging .This</li>
            <li>The black velvet case is nice too as it helps keep them protected.</li>
            <li>The handle part of the tweezer is heavy duty, strong material and the tip of the tweezers are perfect for grabbing those fine, short eyebrow hairs that are so tough to get to.</li>
            <li>And the little bag is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I can usually only find the cheap tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Thank You so much.</li>
            <li>and it has a very blunt end.</li>
            <li>and these are the best tweezers I have ever used to remove wood splinters and tiny shrouds of broken glass from my fingers, hands and forearms.  </li>
            <li>It comes in it&#x27;s own velvety pouch and a small plastic cover to protect the points from poking when not in use.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend these to family and friends.</li>

            <li>The tips are super sharp and can pick up the tiniest hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tips come together precisely, not like cheap tweezers that don&#x27;t quite line up.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know there was a big difference between tweezers, until reading an article in a blog, so I went on the hunt for these eyebrow tweezers, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>I am completely spoiled now and don&#x27;t think I could use anything else for my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>They have a god grip to even small areas and fine hair..  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Construction -  These tweezers are larger than your typical cheap tweezers from the make-up aisle.  </li>

            <li> I purchased these for my wife and she was thrilled with them. The quality is very good with the tips meeting precisely.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these Eyebrow Tweezers. It seems like such a small thing, but having tweezers that work well, grasp even fine hair easily, and do the job they&#x27;re meant for, is priceless. And the little bag is a nice touch. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice item. Very good quality construction; the metal is strong and just the right thickness. The tips come together precisely, not like cheap tweezers that don&#x27;t quite line up. Very well packaged (love the little pouch). Overall, quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These were just what I was looking for!!! I didn&#x27;t really know there was a big difference between tweezers, until reading an article in a blog, so I went on the hunt for these eyebrow tweezers, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Major difference on pain factor, so much easier and more precise. I am completely spoiled now and don&#x27;t think I could use anything else for my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen an ingrown hair tweezer before until I saw this. I get ingrown hairs on a rare occasion when I shave, but it&#x27;s super annoying when I do. These things are amazing! the point helps get below the surface and makes the process as painless as possible. A must have for everyone who has to deal with ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.. It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> The Best pair of tweezers I have ever owned!  I can usually only find the cheap tweezers.  The stores I frequent don&#x27;t carry anything like this!  They came with a cover for the tips &amp; also a velvet bag to store them in.  They are so precisely made &amp; of excellent quality.  I am going to keep these tweezers in their bag &amp; hopefully they won&#x27;t be used by anyone but me! I did receive these at a reduced cost for an honest opinion &amp; I hit the jackpot! Thank You!</li>
            <li> What an amazing tweezers , this product arrived just as described . This product arrived in a timely manner and was packaged perfectly , it arrived in excellent condition .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a precision tweezers for women and men, stainless steel tweezer, perfect for beauty, eyebrows, splinters, grooming and facial hair.Perfect for tweezing eyebrows quickly and easily the fine points grabs tiny eyebrow hairs. Won&#x27;t break at the roots or pinch the skin. They also remove ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an exceptional set of tweezers .I found them to work amazingly , they really grab any kind of hair with ease, they are also perfect for removing splinters with out causing to much pain .I found these to pluck the hairs easier then any other tweezers I have ever owned .Not only by providing such a superior product but also with the care and attention to detail in their packaging .This is truly am amazing company with an amazing product .If you are looking for a product like this for yourself or as a gift look no further you have found it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I more than highly recommend this product ,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers for shaping up my brows. The pointed tips gives you the chance to pick just one hair at a time without worrying about plucking multiple hairs on accident leaving you with over plucked brows. The tips are sharp so you don&#x27;t have to worry about dual tweezers not grabbing the hair that needs to be plucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say these may not be for someone who doesn&#x27;t pluck often and has a lot of extra hairs they need to pull but even then I would suggest these for the stubborn hairs and for properly shaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really impressed how easy it is to grab just one hair and these are exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these and says she will be ordering more of these for gifts come Christmas time to give all her friends!</li>
            <li> These are so nice and top quality, they are just what I needed. Thank You so much.</li>
            <li> Awesome .. Easy to use !!</li>
            <li> The tweezer were heavier then most but I like that. They have a god grip to even small areas and fine hair..  they are BY FAR my favorite pair and GO EVERYWHERE with me.  I guard them lol they are easy to hold, and hold tight to what you are using them for..  I need about 20 more pair of these!  One for every room, and everywhere I go!</li>
            <li> These ingrown hair tweezers are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever bought. The handle part of the tweezer is heavy duty, strong material and the tip of the tweezers are perfect for grabbing those fine, short eyebrow hairs that are so tough to get to. I like the protective tip that is on the tweezers when I received them; plan on keeping it on when not in use so I can protect the tip and it&#x27;s useability. Highly recommend these ingrown hair tweezers. (they are exactly as described, maybe better)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these tweezers.  They are well made, nicely designed and easy to use.  Unlike cheap tweezers, the tips come together perfectly, require minimal force to close and fit well in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction -  These tweezers are larger than your typical cheap tweezers from the make-up aisle.  They fit easily in your hand.  they are coated with a matte enamel that makes it easier to hold onto them.  They don&#x27;t slip from your fingers.  The tips are super sharp and can pick up the tiniest hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use - Because these tweezers have a super-sharp, fine tip, they can easily pick up in-grown hairs with minimal damage to the surrounding skin.  I have not had to use them for this yet, but I would also imagine they would be excellent for getting close to the skin to remove ticks.  They also work well for your everyday plucking needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other uses - I found these to also be useful in performing delicate crafting tasks.  You can pick up tiny beads or hold small pieces of paper with ease.  Not only would they be good for your makeup bag, but also your crafting supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging - The tweezers come with a silicone tip protector.  It may be easy to lose, but if you can keep up with it, it should help you keep from bending or breaking the tips of your tweezers.  They also come packaged in a nice velvet bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these tweezers at a discount in exchange for a review, but I highly recommend them.  They would make a very nice addition to anyone&#x27;s makeup bag.</li>
            <li> great tweezers!  I do woodworking as a hobby and these are the best tweezers I have ever used to remove wood splinters and tiny shrouds of broken glass from my fingers, hands and forearms.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my wife  She loved it.  It is exactly what she needed.  Loved using it.</li>
            <li> These are my new favorite tweezers! They are pointed and get every single little hair. I usually thread my eyebrows but I tweeze in between for touch ups. This is also great for ingrown hair which my husband gets in his beard and also great for splinters. Not only are these great to carry in your makeup bag but it would also make a great addition to a first aid kit. It comes in it&#x27;s own velvety pouch and a small plastic cover to protect the points from poking when not in use. I received a discount in exchange for my honest review. I would highly recommend these to family and friends.</li>
            <li> These Pointed Tweezers are for sure a must have! These tweezers are easy to hang on to. The pointed ends help grab annoying hairs with so much ease. I&#x27;ve noticed with the pointed tweezers that it doesn&#x27;t hurt near as bad when you pull like some other tweezers. I love that I can now get the annoying ingrown hairs that I get under my chin without having to waste a lot of time. I keep these tweezers in my makeup bag that stays in my purse so I can always have them close by or for when I&#x27;m out and about! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> These tweezers are so precise and are easy to use with a nice, comfortable grip!</li>
            <li> For the longest time, the only tweezers I&#x27;ve had, have been the 99 cent - $2 dollar grocery store type. It&#x27;s brand name is LA CROSS and it has a very blunt end. I actually like these tweezers. They work well but with these pointy ones - it just makes it easier to pluck and shaping my brows. The pointed ones are better for ingrown hairs and extra-fine hairs. The Beverly Hills Boutique tweezer body itself is flatter, and the gripping part is easier to hold onto. They also measure about 1&amp;#34; longer than the cheaper tweezers.The black velvet case is nice too as it helps keep them protected. I received this product as part of a promotional deal for my unbiased opinion. I received no compensation and have no connection to this company. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Arrived in time. Happy with my purchace</li>
            <li> Amazing tweezers. They are wonderful for only getting one hair, instead of many at a time.</li>
