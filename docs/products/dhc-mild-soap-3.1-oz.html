            <li>I love this as a face soap I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>But in the end, isn&#x27;t that what we really need when we CLEAN our face?</li>

            <li>I keep it in the shower in the large plastic</li>
            <li>This soap is gentle enough for your face(no harsh sulfate), with a very light smell, what i love about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t do anything fancy for you (no whitening, no anti-aging etc.)</li>

            <li>They are the only product I buy when i splurge on expensive top of the line skincare!</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly, I have extremely dry skin and this soap seems to tone down the redness.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li>I had been using Dove Sensitive facial soap prior to this, and my skin would be so dry that it actually would pull on my mouth when I turned my head after using it.  </li>

            <li> I have been using the DHC Mild Soap for several years.  I use it daily with the face brush.  I keep it in the shower in the large plastic case.&lt;br /&gt;The bar I bought before this one, I put the date I started using it.  It lasted me one year and 3 months!  That&#x27;s with everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks and feels great.  I highly recommended this soap and will continue making it a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge DHC fan, most of their product is meh to me, but this mild soap and the olive oil make up remover are definitely two of my top favorite item in the facial product list. They are cheap, and does amazing job. This soap is gentle enough for your face(no harsh sulfate), with a very light smell, what i love about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t do anything fancy for you (no whitening, no anti-aging etc.), just keeps your face super clean. But in the end, isn&#x27;t that what we really need when we CLEAN our face? How much whitening affect can a facial cleanser have anyways?

It comes in a hardboard paper box packaging that i just use as a soap container, and it works perfect. Definitely a product that i would recommend to everyone (actually a lot of my friends already uses this).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for a number of years.  One of the reasons I like it so much is that it does not over lather and therefore is easy to rinse off.  It leaves you with a clean feeling face in little time. I highly recommend this for anyone who likes their skin to feel fresh, clean, but not oily.

            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year for smooth face!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, been using it for years!</li>
            <li> Have used this soap for a decade.</li>
            <li> DHC is the best skin care line you will find. It is a bit pricey but they offer generous samples and travel size. Velvet skin coat, Pacific Salt Scrub (which i think is now discontinued), etc. are a luxury you should afford yourself.  They are the only product I buy when i splurge on expensive top of the line skincare!</li>
            <li> I tried this soap to see if it would help my skin stop looking so red and irritated.  I have hypothyroidism, so my skin tends to get really dry.  I had been using Dove Sensitive facial soap prior to this, and my skin would be so dry that it actually would pull on my mouth when I turned my head after using it.  This soap has helped.  It rinses off really well and clean, and my skin is not near as flaky or dry after using it.  My skin still has some breakout and redness, but perhaps I need to ask a dermatologist about that (may be rosacea?)...</li>
            <li> This is a light but effective cleansing product for the face.  It&#x27;s easy to travel with and doesn&#x27;t melt like so many soaps. Also easy to fly with since it isn&#x27;t liquid.  This product has been a constant companion of mine for many years.  It&#x27;s great and has no fragrance or allergic reactions at least for me.</li>
            <li> I love this mild soap! my skin doesn&#x27;t feel any dry also it cleans so well! better than my $20,$30 cleansers. Plus,it works excellently with clarisonic brush!  I bought 2 for my mom and she love it too.</li>
            <li> I love this as a face soap I have very sensitive skin many products irritate my face, this soap is gentle and deep cleans even when I forget to remove my makeup first  I bought one for my daughter</li>
            <li> Best glycerin soap ever. Love DHC</li>
            <li> My cousin sent me this in my Christmas care package. I&#x27;m so glad I saved the box, because seven months later, I am ordering another. The first bar is not used up yet. I have several autoimmune diseases and many skin sensitivities. I love the mild fragrance, &#x27;rinsability&#x27;, and silky feel it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> it great. it helps me clean my face so good. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love  DHC soaps and will reorder this when I get low</li>

            <li> BEST SOAP EVER!  Never drying, and cleanses thoroughly.  I&#x27;ve used it for many years.</li>
            <li> Nice soap but on older skin it seems to be a little more drying - great for summertime use and I use the Olive Soap in winter when there&#x27;s not as much moisture in the air.  Its still a great product!</li>
