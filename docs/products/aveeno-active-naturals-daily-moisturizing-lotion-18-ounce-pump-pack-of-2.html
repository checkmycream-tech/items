            <li>This is just as good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a good texture.</li>
            <li>I thought the pack of 2 was a good buy</li>
            <li>With body wash my skin feels so good that i dont feel the need to apply moisturizer at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Apply once after a shower and you are good to go all day and night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good around the eyes, on the hands, and anywhere that needs moisture.  </li>
            <li>It does not smell all that good</li>
            <li>The lotion is very smooth, and it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years and have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>If you can find it wholesale or on sale --- but sure to stock up!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks, and my skin is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Amazing skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Aveeno products really are the best out there for skin issues like itching skin or eczema.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about a month now and although it feels nice going on</li>
            <li>EVEN ON ITS OWN</li>
            <li>/&gt;+Super deluxe, your skin deserves something nice</li>
            <li>being said, I really think Aveeno lotions are the best out there.</li>
            <li>Incredibly nice moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion</li>
            <li>That is not a flaw in the product of course, just my own inattention, however the product is greasy compared to the Vaseline moisturizer I have been using.</li>
            <li>This is a good lotion, but there are better out there.</li>
            <li>awesome to have around - very nourishing.</li>
            <li>Unscented, allergy-proof, and effective.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, it also helped keep me warm.</li>
            <li>I have tried every lotion under the sun and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>When I went for my yearly dermatological skin check up, the N.P, said my face was very smooth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even use the Lavender Aveeno but that is ok.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li>Aveeno makes some of my favorite skin products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>Nothing works magically like this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it and use it all the time.</li>
            <li>I love aveeno products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found the Aveeno to be an all around better product.  </li>
            <li>and I know so many people that use it,</li>
            <li>AND IT DIDN&#x27;T MAKE ME BREAK OUT!!!! :-)</li>
            <li>this hydrates telling your skin to not make so much oil) Great product.</li>
            <li>Many Aveeno products contain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many studies have found a link between parabens and breast cancer.</li>
            <li>This is better than all of them combined.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I do love Aveeno products and if this one had sun protection built-</li>
            <li>WE LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I was so impressed with it that i went ahead and pruchased Aveeno daily moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li>And it has no scent, which I love.   </li>
            <li>and my hands feel and look better.</li>
            <li>I had been using Amazon&#x27;s search filters to find body lotion with a 15 SPF or greater and this was offered up in the results.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and have been buying it for years.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed at all!!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Yes I am enjoying this product - will order again.</li>
            <li>I used to use Vaseline (the cocoa butter one), but this product is much better for me.</li>
            <li>so I knew I would be satisfied.  </li>
            <li>And this lotion is a clean, nice, not greasy</li>
            <li>I have been using it for my kid for a long time and it is the best I ever used.</li>
            <li>I also discovered that it&#x27;s great to use when flying, especially on my face/neck/chest area: greatly reduces dryness from dry airplane air, and works great under foundation any time.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for curing your dry hands or use after shaving.</li>
            <li>You could tell which product in pharmacy is the best by which product pharmacy brand tries to emulate.</li>
            <li>this is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is affordable and available at most stores.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance free</li>
            <li>Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, since I tend to get acne with other heavier lotions.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, is not greasy, and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild.</li>
            <li>it is the colloidal oatmeal ingredients and the easy application.</li>
            <li>It has no scent, which is fine and even desirable, but when I&#x27;m wearing it I&#x27;m concerned I will stain the fabric of any upholstered chair I sit on or the Alcantara seats in my car.  </li>
            <li>My complexion is fine.</li>
            <li>Came really quick!</li>
            <li>It is very smoothing without being greasy, love it!</li>
            <li>This Aveeno Lotion feels great, no pores clogging(!) and cheaper on Amazon then in pharmacy!     </li>
            <li>It is not greasy at all, goes on smooth and lasts all day.   </li>
            <li>But it goes away in just a few minutes, leaving skin without any scent at all, and feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, so it&#x27;s important to me that my lotions don&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>My skin feels great only with one application.</li>
            <li>, I enjoy and use the product.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll still pay more than for the inferior products, but this is so worth it.</li>
            <li>I used this product for about 3 months because at first it made y skin feel good, wasn&#x27;t greasy, and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno for many years now and have found that it provides a great temporary relief of these issues, and perhps the superior results over other brands that \\&quot;claim\\&quot; to have similar healing powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sinks into skin beautifully.</li>
            <li>But, as far as having a handy lotion around for anyone to use, it is good for adults and young ones.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I&#x27;m already familiar with the quality of&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have read the detailed ingredient list first!  </li>
            <li>You do not need much so a bottle lasts for many months.</li>
            <li>the classification as a carcinogen need not apply if the full refining history is known and it can be shown that the substance from which it is produced is not a carcinogen.</li>
            <li>Full of gunk.</li>
            <li>the full refining history is known and it can be shown that the substance from which it is produced is not a carcinogen\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;It can be contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which is is associated with cancer.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>If used as a daily lotion, it is good.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and not greasy, but moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent (unscented), is not greasy, doesn&#x27;t bother my son&#x27;s skin if I touch him after putting it on.  </li>
            <li>Its not greasy and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It is more effective than the other lotions I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its relatively safe for adults and kids as it relates to environmentally friendly ratings and natural product contents.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to any one who is looking for a great moisturizer taht not only works</li>
            <li>It has no smell and quickly gets absorbed and leaves the skin nourished.</li>
            <li>I love it because it keeps my skin very soft</li>
            <li>but this one is so mild, I can apply it right after shaving or on a sunburn.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Methylparaben is quickly absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li>and ive used lubriderm for years and   this lotion is by far better.</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed, makes no shine on the skin, and truly has no fragrance.</li>
            <li>Once the lotion is absorbed into your hands you forget you even put any on.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or oily and rubs right in.</li>
            <li>Putting on this right after a shower, I sweep over powder foundation or blush on, and it will not cake or look like you&#x27;re pealing at all.</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>This Aveeno moisturizing lotion feels really good on my skin and soaks into the skin quickly without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>Packaging and stuff was great as usual for a product from Amazon.</li>
            <li>To be fair it does seem to constitute a large portion of the lotion itself and is great for itching and irritated skin, but I find it a bit disturbing that a product with one natural ingredient (plus water) would be so quick to label itself as \\&quot;Natural.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also mildly stop the inflamation, together with the moisure, it heal the skin so fast.</li>
            <li>I had to do a double take because I had gotten it at such a great deal from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I personally find it highly effective and wouldn&#x27;t go too long without it in the dry, windy desert climate where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being a great product</li>
            <li>First of all this product contains two types of alcohols (benzyl and cetyl).  </li>
            <li>, my skin looks perfect, without even the small peling, which used to happen about once per a couple of week(due to the chlorine in the swimming pool water that I regularly swam at).</li>
            <li>Definitely two thumbs up! :)</li>
            <li>I took off one star because there is a less-than-glamorous smell when the lotion is first applied.</li>
            <li>Among the studies linking the petrolatum impurity PAHs to breast cancer is a Columbia University study in which researchers found that the breast tissue of women with breast cancer was 2.6 times more likely to contain elevated levels of PAHs bound to DNA (called DNA adducts) than the breast tissue of women without breast cancer (Rundle et al. 2000).</li>
            <li>Aveeno Daily Moisturizing lotion is my #1 favorite of lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a heavy make up wearer, but I do wear foundation and sometimes a light blush.</li>
            <li>Soft on skin and comfortable</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wihle I&#x27;ve found Aveeno products to be of good quality, there are a few things that you should be aware of before using this item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy and is absorbed quickly, leaving skin refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>It give so much moisure to the skin, stop the itch right away.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this cream for my one year old daughter.</li>
            <li>It feels so soft and smooth going on and really penetrates into the skin.</li>
            <li>It is a good lotion in that it is creamy and almost liquid like, so even a small amount lasts a while.</li>
            <li>I usually have good luck ordering with Amazon, however, this package arrived with someone else&#x27;s packing slip and was not the product that I ordered</li>
            <li>I got some pretty blue bottles, filled them with this lotion and set one by every sink in the house.</li>
            <li>I had patches of dry areas on my forearm, but after three days of using this product, I was able to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>Recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li>I recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t take me too long to discover that a certain ubiquitous merchandiser whose well-known name starts with W, is producing its own version of this with exactly the same ingredients, but for a lower price tag.</li>
            <li>I really truly do.  </li>
            <li>I no longer get rashes from my medications or from too much sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>My whole family loves this lotion.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any real scent, and stays on even after washing my hands once or twice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It contains alcohol, it is a very comedogenic and causes skin irritations and dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ships fast.</li>
            <li>Fragrance-free so the whole family can use it.  </li>
            <li>so i needed something that really works...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>One or two applications a day really help.  </li>
            <li>As for scent, this product really doesn&#x27;t have one.  </li>
            <li>You will smell a light scent when you put it on, but it will disappear shortly after.    </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- nice smell (not a strong fragrance, but</li>
            <li>So I went right out and got some and discovered that I can cover every square millimeter of my bod with this, without feeling as though I ought to get right back in the shower to get the sticky stuff off.</li>
            <li>AND IT REALLY DOES MOSTURIZE OLDER DRIER SKIN.  </li>
            <li>I feel like doing a \\&quot;real person\\&quot; commercial for this lotion, and it&#x27;s rare that I feel so positive about something.  </li>
            <li>But more than that is it leaves a slightly tacky film on your skin after it dries.</li>
            <li>It could be a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This Aveeno lotion is very gentle yet very moisturizing with no oily film left on the skin.</li>
            <li>but it really soaks in and keeps your skin soft all day.</li>
            <li>Needless to say it&#x27;s a great product, but the pump doesn&#x27;t work : for two bottles in the pack I bought.  </li>
            <li>When I was younger I use to make fun of my dad for using lotion.  </li>
            <li>After that you should be able to use it for another few weeks.    </li>
            <li>I would recommend putting it on right after a shower, but it works just as well if you&#x27;re on the run and only have time to smear some on on the way out.</li>
            <li>Figured I&#x27;d try a new lotion, one that doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li>b) made a lot of claims I didn&#x27;t think it could live up to.</li>
            <li>Also, the Aveeno has that slight pleasant fragrance typical of Aveeno soap products.  </li>
            <li>I also looked it up on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep website and found it has a very low toxicity rating, which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>Plus, my skin is very sensitive to fragrances, alcohols, and lanolin-- some lotions even sting and burn--</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Shame on Aveeno for putting petrolatum in a product they tout as all natural!</li>
            <li>Like a 13 year old a school boy!</li>
            <li>While this won&#x27;t cure an outbreak, it leaves my skin so soft and smooth that outbreaks happen MUCH less often.  </li>
            <li>My skin stays soft and supple for days.  </li>
            <li>The Walgreens near us sells it for $8 for 12oz.</li>
            <li>I bought Aveeno thinking it was all natural, based on the label.</li>
            <li>The National Toxicology Programs finds that some PAHs are reasonable anticipated to be human carcinogens, and the State of California lists a number of PAHs as carcinogens in its Proposition 65 program (NTP 2002, OEHHA 2004).  </li>
            <li>Skin is soft and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>a natural smell)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This keeps my skin wonderfully soft.  </li>
            <li>Love the body lotion, it really help to smooth dry skin in cold weather.</li>
            <li>As a guy who doesn&#x27;t use a whole lot of lotion type products I was pretty lost about a year ago when I developed an inch long dry spot on my face.  </li>
            <li>The only way for me to avoid this extra irritation is to soak in a hot bath to let the skin hydrate a bit, then apply the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended not only by me, but by my transplant doctors and fellow patients.    </li>
            <li>The only real natural ingredient I can see on the bottle would be the oatmeal.  </li>
            <li>we put these all around the house, since we have a new born and we&#x27;re constantly washing our hands, bottles, etc.</li>
            <li>It is extremely soothing to irritated skin, helps avoid itching from straps on urinary leg bags and is very gentle on ,my skin.</li>
            <li>lotion works really well for my dry skin and even my eczema.</li>
            <li>Works really well for dry skin and acne prone skin as well.  </li>
            <li>Deals with dry skin very well.</li>
            <li>Based on a quick Wikipedia search they seem to have some protection against bacterial growth, itching, and uneven texture.  </li>
            <li>Most have very little if any odor when compared to others that smell like fruit baskets, and they work well on dry irritated skin.</li>
            <li>I really do encourage you to spend the extra few dollars for quality; you really do get what you pay for!</li>
            <li>It works exactly like it says, is the only product that has helped with my very dry skin without making my face and neck feel greasy -- it helps with psoriasis too! -- and doesn&#x27;t have that funny smell that a lot of other creams tend to.</li>
            <li>quality, long lasting, gentle lotion.</li>
            <li>If you are strick about only using natural ingredients on your body, you might want to investigate dimethicone.    </li>
            <li>It helped stop the dryness, but my face was still red in areas and it wouldn&#x27;t completely soothe my skin.</li>
            <li>Anyone with sensitive skin should try this lotion for lasting relief.</li>
            <li>It actually does keep your skin soft for hours.</li>
            <li>But if someone is looking for a lotion to help with severely dry skin, they may want to find a product that addresses that particular need.</li>
            <li>its more expensive but cant live without it.</li>
            <li>Normally I feel cold all winter, but I noticed that sealant/protectant quality of the dimethicone helped me stay warm, possibly due to not losing so much water through my skin?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously you will want to speak to your docotor before trying any new products, but I highly recommend this to those who suffer from minor dry skin irritations.</li>
            <li>It completely eliminated dry skin and eczema I get on my elbows and arms and it keeps my skin soft and moisturized for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>No dry skin!</li>
            <li>There are no dry spots!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a student on a tight budget, and I can&#x27;t really afford to go wild on fancy-schmancy makeup and face creams and</li>
            <li>Whatever the active ingredient in this is, it really works well.  </li>
            <li>It makes skin soft, and lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that you can use it often but heavy enough to last in really dry climates.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny to me that they promote the colloidal oatmeal as the key moisturizing ingredient - must be related to the \\&quot;active naturals\\&quot; registered trademark (which is just a trademark!).</li>
            <li>I mainly need extra moisturizing on my legs which become very dry and itchy (especially during cold/windy days.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day, so I don&#x27;t find myself scratching dry spots near the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Aveeno has products specifically for sensitive skin and dry skin as well.</li>
            <li>AT long last...a moisturizer for sensitive skin that actually works.  </li>
            <li>The Environment Canada Domestic Substances List classifies Petrolatum as a high human health priority and as expected to be toxic or harmful.</li>
            <li>I like this enough to include it in a gift basket for other new moms.</li>

            <li> This really is a great deal from Amazon because I was in walmart today and one bottle of this was $9.82.  </li>
            <li> Great, non greasy lotion for those of us who are concerned about skin cancer.  </li>

            <li> Great, good quality product and</li>
            <li> Great product for a good price.</li>
            <li> This is just as good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a good texture.</li>
            <li> I thought the pack of 2 was a good buy</li>
            <li> With body wash my skin feels so good that i dont feel the need to apply moisturizer at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Apply once after a shower and you are good to go all day and night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good around the eyes, on the hands, and anywhere that needs moisture.  </li>
            <li> It does not smell all that good</li>
            <li> The lotion is very smooth, and it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years and have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> If you can find it wholesale or on sale --- but sure to stock up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks, and my skin is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Amazing skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Aveeno products really are the best out there for skin issues like itching skin or eczema.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about a month now and although it feels nice going on</li>
            <li> EVEN ON ITS OWN</li>
            <li> /&gt;+Super deluxe, your skin deserves something nice</li>
            <li> being said, I really think Aveeno lotions are the best out there.</li>
            <li> Incredibly nice moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion</li>
            <li> That is not a flaw in the product of course, just my own inattention, however the product is greasy compared to the Vaseline moisturizer I have been using.</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion, but there are better out there.</li>
            <li> awesome to have around - very nourishing.</li>
            <li> Unscented, allergy-proof, and effective.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, it also helped keep me warm.</li>
            <li> I have tried every lotion under the sun and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> When I went for my yearly dermatological skin check up, the N.P, said my face was very smooth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even use the Lavender Aveeno but that is ok.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li> Aveeno makes some of my favorite skin products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> Nothing works magically like this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it and use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I love aveeno products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found the Aveeno to be an all around better product.  </li>
            <li> and I know so many people that use it,</li>
            <li> AND IT DIDN&#x27;T MAKE ME BREAK OUT!!!! :-)</li>
            <li> this hydrates telling your skin to not make so much oil) Great product.</li>
            <li> Many Aveeno products contain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many studies have found a link between parabens and breast cancer.</li>
            <li> This is better than all of them combined.  </li>
            <li> and I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I do love Aveeno products and if this one had sun protection built-</li>
            <li> WE LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I was so impressed with it that i went ahead and pruchased Aveeno daily moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li> And it has no scent, which I love.   </li>
            <li> and my hands feel and look better.</li>
            <li> I had been using Amazon&#x27;s search filters to find body lotion with a 15 SPF or greater and this was offered up in the results.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and have been buying it for years.</li>
            <li> Not disappointed at all!!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Yes I am enjoying this product - will order again.</li>
            <li> I used to use Vaseline (the cocoa butter one), but this product is much better for me.</li>
            <li> so I knew I would be satisfied.  </li>
            <li> And this lotion is a clean, nice, not greasy</li>
            <li> I have been using it for my kid for a long time and it is the best I ever used.</li>
            <li> I also discovered that it&#x27;s great to use when flying, especially on my face/neck/chest area: greatly reduces dryness from dry airplane air, and works great under foundation any time.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for curing your dry hands or use after shaving.</li>
            <li> You could tell which product in pharmacy is the best by which product pharmacy brand tries to emulate.</li>
            <li> this is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is affordable and available at most stores.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance free</li>
            <li> Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, since I tend to get acne with other heavier lotions.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, is not greasy, and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The smell is very mild.</li>
            <li> it is the colloidal oatmeal ingredients and the easy application.</li>
            <li> It has no scent, which is fine and even desirable, but when I&#x27;m wearing it I&#x27;m concerned I will stain the fabric of any upholstered chair I sit on or the Alcantara seats in my car.  </li>
            <li> My complexion is fine.</li>
            <li> Came really quick!</li>
            <li> It is very smoothing without being greasy, love it!</li>
            <li> This Aveeno Lotion feels great, no pores clogging(!) and cheaper on Amazon then in pharmacy!     </li>
            <li> It is not greasy at all, goes on smooth and lasts all day.   </li>
            <li> But it goes away in just a few minutes, leaving skin without any scent at all, and feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, so it&#x27;s important to me that my lotions don&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great only with one application.</li>
            <li> , I enjoy and use the product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll still pay more than for the inferior products, but this is so worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 3 months because at first it made y skin feel good, wasn&#x27;t greasy, and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno for many years now and have found that it provides a great temporary relief of these issues, and perhps the superior results over other brands that \\&quot;claim\\&quot; to have similar healing powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sinks into skin beautifully.</li>
            <li> But, as far as having a handy lotion around for anyone to use, it is good for adults and young ones.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I&#x27;m already familiar with the quality of&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have read the detailed ingredient list first!  </li>
            <li> You do not need much so a bottle lasts for many months.</li>
            <li> the classification as a carcinogen need not apply if the full refining history is known and it can be shown that the substance from which it is produced is not a carcinogen.</li>
            <li> Full of gunk.</li>
            <li> the full refining history is known and it can be shown that the substance from which it is produced is not a carcinogen\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;It can be contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which is is associated with cancer.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> If used as a daily lotion, it is good.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and not greasy, but moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> It has a mild scent (unscented), is not greasy, doesn&#x27;t bother my son&#x27;s skin if I touch him after putting it on.  </li>
            <li> Its not greasy and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It is more effective than the other lotions I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its relatively safe for adults and kids as it relates to environmentally friendly ratings and natural product contents.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to any one who is looking for a great moisturizer taht not only works</li>
            <li> It has no smell and quickly gets absorbed and leaves the skin nourished.</li>
            <li> I love it because it keeps my skin very soft</li>
            <li> but this one is so mild, I can apply it right after shaving or on a sunburn.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Methylparaben is quickly absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li> and ive used lubriderm for years and   this lotion is by far better.</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbed, makes no shine on the skin, and truly has no fragrance.</li>
            <li> Once the lotion is absorbed into your hands you forget you even put any on.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or oily and rubs right in.</li>
            <li> Putting on this right after a shower, I sweep over powder foundation or blush on, and it will not cake or look like you&#x27;re pealing at all.</li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> This Aveeno moisturizing lotion feels really good on my skin and soaks into the skin quickly without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> Packaging and stuff was great as usual for a product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> To be fair it does seem to constitute a large portion of the lotion itself and is great for itching and irritated skin, but I find it a bit disturbing that a product with one natural ingredient (plus water) would be so quick to label itself as \\&quot;Natural.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also mildly stop the inflamation, together with the moisure, it heal the skin so fast.</li>
            <li> I had to do a double take because I had gotten it at such a great deal from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I personally find it highly effective and wouldn&#x27;t go too long without it in the dry, windy desert climate where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being a great product</li>
            <li> First of all this product contains two types of alcohols (benzyl and cetyl).  </li>
            <li> , my skin looks perfect, without even the small peling, which used to happen about once per a couple of week(due to the chlorine in the swimming pool water that I regularly swam at).</li>
            <li> Definitely two thumbs up! :)</li>
            <li> I took off one star because there is a less-than-glamorous smell when the lotion is first applied.</li>
            <li> Among the studies linking the petrolatum impurity PAHs to breast cancer is a Columbia University study in which researchers found that the breast tissue of women with breast cancer was 2.6 times more likely to contain elevated levels of PAHs bound to DNA (called DNA adducts) than the breast tissue of women without breast cancer (Rundle et al. 2000).</li>
            <li> Aveeno Daily Moisturizing lotion is my #1 favorite of lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a heavy make up wearer, but I do wear foundation and sometimes a light blush.</li>
            <li> Soft on skin and comfortable</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wihle I&#x27;ve found Aveeno products to be of good quality, there are a few things that you should be aware of before using this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy and is absorbed quickly, leaving skin refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> It give so much moisure to the skin, stop the itch right away.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this cream for my one year old daughter.</li>
            <li> It feels so soft and smooth going on and really penetrates into the skin.</li>
            <li> It is a good lotion in that it is creamy and almost liquid like, so even a small amount lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I usually have good luck ordering with Amazon, however, this package arrived with someone else&#x27;s packing slip and was not the product that I ordered</li>
            <li> I got some pretty blue bottles, filled them with this lotion and set one by every sink in the house.</li>
            <li> I had patches of dry areas on my forearm, but after three days of using this product, I was able to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> Recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> I recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t take me too long to discover that a certain ubiquitous merchandiser whose well-known name starts with W, is producing its own version of this with exactly the same ingredients, but for a lower price tag.</li>
            <li> I really truly do.  </li>
            <li> I no longer get rashes from my medications or from too much sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> My whole family loves this lotion.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any real scent, and stays on even after washing my hands once or twice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It contains alcohol, it is a very comedogenic and causes skin irritations and dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ships fast.</li>
            <li> Fragrance-free so the whole family can use it.  </li>
            <li> so i needed something that really works...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> One or two applications a day really help.  </li>
            <li> As for scent, this product really doesn&#x27;t have one.  </li>
            <li> You will smell a light scent when you put it on, but it will disappear shortly after.    </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- nice smell (not a strong fragrance, but</li>
            <li> So I went right out and got some and discovered that I can cover every square millimeter of my bod with this, without feeling as though I ought to get right back in the shower to get the sticky stuff off.</li>
            <li> AND IT REALLY DOES MOSTURIZE OLDER DRIER SKIN.  </li>
            <li> I feel like doing a \\&quot;real person\\&quot; commercial for this lotion, and it&#x27;s rare that I feel so positive about something.  </li>
            <li> But more than that is it leaves a slightly tacky film on your skin after it dries.</li>
            <li> It could be a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This Aveeno lotion is very gentle yet very moisturizing with no oily film left on the skin.</li>
            <li> but it really soaks in and keeps your skin soft all day.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it&#x27;s a great product, but the pump doesn&#x27;t work : for two bottles in the pack I bought.  </li>
            <li> When I was younger I use to make fun of my dad for using lotion.  </li>
            <li> After that you should be able to use it for another few weeks.    </li>
            <li> I would recommend putting it on right after a shower, but it works just as well if you&#x27;re on the run and only have time to smear some on on the way out.</li>
            <li> Figured I&#x27;d try a new lotion, one that doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> b) made a lot of claims I didn&#x27;t think it could live up to.</li>
            <li> Also, the Aveeno has that slight pleasant fragrance typical of Aveeno soap products.  </li>
            <li> I also looked it up on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep website and found it has a very low toxicity rating, which is important to me.  </li>
            <li> Plus, my skin is very sensitive to fragrances, alcohols, and lanolin-- some lotions even sting and burn--</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Shame on Aveeno for putting petrolatum in a product they tout as all natural!</li>
            <li> Like a 13 year old a school boy!</li>
            <li> While this won&#x27;t cure an outbreak, it leaves my skin so soft and smooth that outbreaks happen MUCH less often.  </li>
            <li> My skin stays soft and supple for days.  </li>
            <li> The Walgreens near us sells it for $8 for 12oz.</li>
            <li> I bought Aveeno thinking it was all natural, based on the label.</li>
            <li> The National Toxicology Programs finds that some PAHs are reasonable anticipated to be human carcinogens, and the State of California lists a number of PAHs as carcinogens in its Proposition 65 program (NTP 2002, OEHHA 2004).  </li>
            <li> Skin is soft and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> a natural smell)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin wonderfully soft.  </li>
            <li> Love the body lotion, it really help to smooth dry skin in cold weather.</li>
            <li> As a guy who doesn&#x27;t use a whole lot of lotion type products I was pretty lost about a year ago when I developed an inch long dry spot on my face.  </li>
            <li> The only way for me to avoid this extra irritation is to soak in a hot bath to let the skin hydrate a bit, then apply the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended not only by me, but by my transplant doctors and fellow patients.    </li>
            <li> The only real natural ingredient I can see on the bottle would be the oatmeal.  </li>
            <li> we put these all around the house, since we have a new born and we&#x27;re constantly washing our hands, bottles, etc.</li>
            <li> It is extremely soothing to irritated skin, helps avoid itching from straps on urinary leg bags and is very gentle on ,my skin.</li>
            <li> lotion works really well for my dry skin and even my eczema.</li>
            <li> Works really well for dry skin and acne prone skin as well.  </li>
            <li> Deals with dry skin very well.</li>
            <li> Based on a quick Wikipedia search they seem to have some protection against bacterial growth, itching, and uneven texture.  </li>
            <li> Most have very little if any odor when compared to others that smell like fruit baskets, and they work well on dry irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I really do encourage you to spend the extra few dollars for quality; you really do get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> It works exactly like it says, is the only product that has helped with my very dry skin without making my face and neck feel greasy -- it helps with psoriasis too! -- and doesn&#x27;t have that funny smell that a lot of other creams tend to.</li>
            <li> quality, long lasting, gentle lotion.</li>
            <li> If you are strick about only using natural ingredients on your body, you might want to investigate dimethicone.    </li>
            <li> It helped stop the dryness, but my face was still red in areas and it wouldn&#x27;t completely soothe my skin.</li>
            <li> Anyone with sensitive skin should try this lotion for lasting relief.</li>
            <li> It actually does keep your skin soft for hours.</li>
            <li> But if someone is looking for a lotion to help with severely dry skin, they may want to find a product that addresses that particular need.</li>
            <li> its more expensive but cant live without it.</li>
            <li> Normally I feel cold all winter, but I noticed that sealant/protectant quality of the dimethicone helped me stay warm, possibly due to not losing so much water through my skin?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously you will want to speak to your docotor before trying any new products, but I highly recommend this to those who suffer from minor dry skin irritations.</li>
            <li> It completely eliminated dry skin and eczema I get on my elbows and arms and it keeps my skin soft and moisturized for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> No dry skin!</li>
            <li> There are no dry spots!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a student on a tight budget, and I can&#x27;t really afford to go wild on fancy-schmancy makeup and face creams and</li>
            <li> Whatever the active ingredient in this is, it really works well.  </li>
            <li> It makes skin soft, and lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough that you can use it often but heavy enough to last in really dry climates.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny to me that they promote the colloidal oatmeal as the key moisturizing ingredient - must be related to the \\&quot;active naturals\\&quot; registered trademark (which is just a trademark!).</li>
            <li> I mainly need extra moisturizing on my legs which become very dry and itchy (especially during cold/windy days.  </li>
            <li> It lasts all day, so I don&#x27;t find myself scratching dry spots near the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Aveeno has products specifically for sensitive skin and dry skin as well.</li>
            <li> AT long last...a moisturizer for sensitive skin that actually works.  </li>
            <li> The Environment Canada Domestic Substances List classifies Petrolatum as a high human health priority and as expected to be toxic or harmful.</li>
            <li> I like this enough to include it in a gift basket for other new moms.</li>
            <li> I only discovered it this winter, when my hands are always dry and red and this lotion cured them literally instantly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for everyday use without a greasy texture or perfume smell.</li>
            <li> A bottle will last you an extremely long time.  </li>
            <li> I suspect the alcohols also are present to quickly dry the lotion and seal it in, and that does dry your skin for a short period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It relieves my dry skin with only one application per day, as opposed to twice a day with Lubraderm.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Isopropyl Palmitate is considered a short chain ester that feels dry on our skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin, occasionally bordering on eczema.  </li>
            <li> I work in a field which requires me to wash my hands multiple times a day and have problems with dry hands and skin in the winter time.</li>
            <li> Put it on my face on dry mornings and instantly feel the moisture, but its not slimy or oily feeling either.</li>
            <li> and my hands are back to being dry.</li>
            <li> I tried several different lotions and creams with absolutely no change.  </li>
            <li> There are plenty of moisturizers ive used in the past that absorb quickly into the skin like this lotion does and lasts a few hand washes.</li>
            <li> This note applies to certain complex oil-derived substances in Annex I&#x27;&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything under the sun until I found plain old Aveeno.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricier than other lotions, but it actually works.  </li>
            <li> 2- If your hands or other skin is severley dry or cracking it can cause further irritation.</li>
            <li> I have dry itchy skin with eczema</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this is the lotion to use.</li>
            <li> Within a week, my face cleared up (this is after having this dry spot for over 6 months).  </li>
            <li> and I used to get really dry hands.  </li>
            <li> sometimes I need quite a bit to alleviate dry</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommends Aveeno for dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion I think falls below the standard of your average moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using a similar Lubraderm product to relieve dry skin.  </li>
            <li> cons: While it is affordable in general, it is slightly pricey compared with other store brands.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this lotion to anyone who has dry skin issues!    </li>
            <li> It can feel slightly tacky, but it&#x27;s non-greasy, won&#x27;t clog pores, and it actually helped stop breakouts!</li>
            <li> With floridas cold weatehr recently i was experiencing dry skin (plus i was pregnant and just deliverd a baby)</li>
            <li> I have eczema, my skin is very dry</li>
            <li> I swim a lot in a chlorinated pool which makes my skin very dry  </li>
            <li> (I hate the smell) but that is pretty much its only downside.</li>
            <li> It seems a little heavy and might clog pores if you have sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also sensitive to perfumes and scented lotions but this hardly has a smell at all.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical on how long it would work, however.</li>
            <li> I used to use a neutrogena unscented lotion which was discontinued a few years back.  </li>
            <li> I used it last winter, and it made all the difference in the world to keep my skin moisturized day and night, and no more dry winter skin itch.</li>
            <li> My mom and husband both who hate lotion but have horribly dry skin use this VERY sparingly, and it helps SO much.</li>
            <li> Due to having had cancer and have gone through chemo</li>
            <li> And I never had problem with other bottle pumps before.    </li>
            <li> I use this product for my face and body and I never have any burning sensations as I do with other products.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot throughout the day due to my job</li>
            <li> but other than that</li>
            <li> I never use any other brand of lotion.  </li>
            <li> My face has always been red due to the irritating effects of the topical medication.</li>
            <li> Despite being labeled as \\&quot;Active Naturals\\</li>
            <li> I selected the Aveeno Active Naturals product as a substitute.   </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and apply lotion everyday after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> and I have to be careful not to use products with perfumes or harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it&#x27;s truly fragrance-free and doesn&#x27;t use anything to mask the scent of the ingredients, but the downside is a slight plastic/rubber/chemical smell.</li>
            <li> The Lubraderm had a slight chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> As you can imagine, my hands and other skin can become very irritated from washing and cold weather.</li>
            <li> No, it seems to be absorbed into the epidermis without leaving any unpleasant residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly excited with the \\&quot;moisturizes for 24 hours\\&quot; claim.  </li>
            <li> a little flaky at the dispenser</li>
            <li> Whenever I prefer a heavier/greasier moisturizer I just add a little baby oil or Vaseline to ensure it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I thought I should write a little something about my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All other products I&#x27;ve tried through the past few months just didn&#x27;t cut it and then someone suggested I try Aveeno</li>
            <li> , I do have a few nitpicks to share.  </li>
            <li> It is derived from Isopropyl Alcohol, synthetic alcohol and Palmatic Acid, a fatty acid from palm oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do have to reapply a few times a day to maintain an optimal coating.</li>
            <li> so I picked up a few bottles here from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> And I am extremely pale as well.</li>
            <li> I kept searching for everyday body lotions which didnt smell bad, worked well and made my skin feel very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs well into the skin and doesnt get clumpy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I do find that when I go without the lotion for too long a period it does sting at first if I have badly cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nevertheless, if you can look past the misleading name</li>
            <li> She looked red and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Also this comes with a small bonus 25oz travel tube.</li>
            <li> I had a bad allergy, the skin on my face got red, itchy, inflamed, and then dry and flaky...</li>
            <li> No strong fragrance either!</li>
            <li> Even though it is expensive, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I put it on after I shower and hardly ever itchy or patchy</li>
            <li> I was initially a little skeptical when I picked up a bottle of this stuff, simply because it a) was expensive and</li>
            <li> PAHs, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, are common contaminants in petrolatum, also called petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like it would work as well as it does because it isn&#x27;t thick and goopy</li>
            <li> I also found the lotion thick and sticky like a liquid paste.  </li>
            <li> Thick and moisturizing without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> Read the ingredients and you will see what I mean.</li>
            <li> but can be VERY difficult to get open</li>
            <li> A think layer will work (seriously).</li>
            <li> It does have petrolatum in it which I was told is not good for you.  </li>
            <li> My hands also began to get really tough and chapped and upon discontinuing use this went away.</li>
            <li> It has solved all of my poor skin issues.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave behind a greasy feeling, just do not pack on layers.</li>
            <li> &quot; the majority of the ingredients are quite artificial.  </li>
            <li> I purchased unscented, but felt the \\&quot;no smell smell\\&quot; was unpleasant.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great on my cracked hands.</li>
            <li> I got  this product thats 2 pack aveeno moisturizer in April (2015) and the expiry date is July (2015). They should have mentioned it.</li>
            <li> You could tell which product in pharmacy is the best by which product pharmacy brand tries to emulate. This Aveeno Lotion feels great, no pores clogging(!) and cheaper on Amazon then in pharmacy!     Arthur Chachuna  [...]</li>
            <li> Due to having had cancer and have gone through chemo I now react to any type of perfume or dye out there.  I really truly do.  I have tried everything under the sun until I found plain old Aveeno.  I can&#x27;t even use the Lavender Aveeno but that is ok.  This is just as good.  My skin stays soft and supple for days.  I no longer get rashes from my medications or from too much sun exposure.  This stuff is magic.  It has solved all of my poor skin issues.  And I am extremely pale as well.</li>
            <li> AT long last...a moisturizer for sensitive skin that actually works.  I have tried a ton over the years...and nothing worked for me.  Really impressed and thankful.</li>
            <li> Different because of the dimethicone! It&#x27;s funny to me that they promote the colloidal oatmeal as the key moisturizing ingredient - must be related to the \\&quot;active naturals\\&quot; registered trademark (which is just a trademark!). If you are strick about only using natural ingredients on your body, you might want to investigate dimethicone.    That said, I am so happy I stumbled upon this product/ingredient. I used it last winter, and it made all the difference in the world to keep my skin moisturized day and night, and no more dry winter skin itch. Interestingly, it also helped keep me warm. Normally I feel cold all winter, but I noticed that sealant/protectant quality of the dimethicone helped me stay warm, possibly due to not losing so much water through my skin? I also discovered that it&#x27;s great to use when flying, especially on my face/neck/chest area: greatly reduces dryness from dry airplane air, and works great under foundation any time. I work with my hands, so always wash my hands after applying, as it can leave a waxy feeling (that&#x27;s the dimethicone!).</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this lotion. It is not greasy at all, goes on smooth and lasts all day.   My mom and husband both who hate lotion but have horribly dry skin use this VERY sparingly, and it helps SO much. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Aveeno makes some of my favorite skin products and this is no exception. I am a guy and because this is non-scented it works equally well for me and my wife. It goes on easy, is not greasy, and lasts throughout the day. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated. I use it on face and hands. You do not need much so a bottle lasts for many months. Recommended</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for keeping my skin from drying out and cracking.  It doesn&#x27;t have any real scent, and stays on even after washing my hands once or twice.  I personally find it highly effective and wouldn&#x27;t go too long without it in the dry, windy desert climate where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being a great product, I do have a few nitpicks to share.  First of all this product contains two types of alcohols (benzyl and cetyl).  Based on a quick Wikipedia search they seem to have some protection against bacterial growth, itching, and uneven texture.  Unfortunately, I do find that when I go without the lotion for too long a period it does sting at first if I have badly cracked skin.  I suspect the alcohols also are present to quickly dry the lotion and seal it in, and that does dry your skin for a short period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the name of the product is rather misleading.  Despite being labeled as \\&quot;Active Naturals\\&quot; the majority of the ingredients are quite artificial.  The only real natural ingredient I can see on the bottle would be the oatmeal.  To be fair it does seem to constitute a large portion of the lotion itself and is great for itching and irritated skin, but I find it a bit disturbing that a product with one natural ingredient (plus water) would be so quick to label itself as \\&quot;Natural.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, if you can look past the misleading name it&#x27;s a great lotion and woks beautifully.</li>
            <li> Dealing with the after effects of a bone marrow transplant, this lotion saved me a lot of itching and skin peeling.  Highly recommended not only by me, but by my transplant doctors and fellow patients.    It&#x27;s a bit pricier than other lotions, but it actually works.  It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I had a bad allergy, the skin on my face got red, itchy, inflamed, and then dry and flaky...I tried allergy cream, hydrocortisone, and even the cream that my Dr. prescribed me which contains steroid. Nothing works magically like this lotion. It give so much moisure to the skin, stop the itch right away. It also mildly stop the inflamation, together with the moisure, it heal the skin so fast. I am using it on my face as night cream now, my skin looks perfect, without even the small peling, which used to happen about once per a couple of week(due to the chlorine in the swimming pool water that I regularly swam at). I do not write review often, but I recommend this product with no reservation.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical on how long it would work, however. I was taken aback when I saw that the lotion held up to its bargain and worked ALL DAY!    I will recommend this lotion to anyone who has dry skin issues!    Definitely two thumbs up! :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it would work as well as it does because it isn&#x27;t thick and goopy but it really soaks in and keeps your skin soft all day. I&#x27;m also sensitive to perfumes and scented lotions but this hardly has a smell at all. Buying from amazon is cheaper than buying from target or walmart.</li>
            <li> Aveeno has become a staple at our house. Love it and use it all the time. This was the best deal I could find. The Walgreens near us sells it for $8 for 12oz. For the 36oz we got from Amazon, it was $18 -- savings of $6 for the same amount of oz.</li>
            <li> I love aveeno products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion works really well for my dry skin and even my eczema. I put it on after I shower and hardly ever itchy or patchy after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good texture. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or oily and rubs right in. I even use it on my face after I shave and I don&#x27;t break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended I use it and I am happy he did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of any negatives.</li>
            <li> This is the best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;m kind of a product junkie. It is the only one I&#x27;ve found that lives up to the claim of \\&quot;24-hour moisturization.\\&quot; It feels velvety, not greasy, and tackles even chapped or coarse skin. I looooove the way my skin feels with this lotion. The colloidal oatmeal as an ingredient also helps soothe itching. Plus, my skin is very sensitive to fragrances, alcohols, and lanolin-- some lotions even sting and burn-- but this one is so mild, I can apply it right after shaving or on a sunburn.      I took off one star because there is a less-than-glamorous smell when the lotion is first applied. I appreciate that it&#x27;s truly fragrance-free and doesn&#x27;t use anything to mask the scent of the ingredients, but the downside is a slight plastic/rubber/chemical smell. But it goes away in just a few minutes, leaving skin without any scent at all, and feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It completely eliminated dry skin and eczema I get on my elbows and arms and it keeps my skin soft and moisturized for 24 hours. I&#x27;ve tried numerous creams and lotions and none of them has worked as well as aveeno. As another person pointed out, I think the key ingredient is Dimethicone 1.25%. I probably would not use this on my face though. It seems a little heavy and might clog pores if you have sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li> I bought Aveeno thinking it was all natural, based on the label. I should have read the detailed ingredient list first!  This product contains Petrolatum, which is banned or restricted for use in cosmetics in the EU. The Environment Canada Domestic Substances List classifies Petrolatum as a high human health priority and as expected to be toxic or harmful. The European Union applies the risk phrase R 45 (May cause cancer) with Note N to petrolatum. Note N reads &#x27;&#x27;the classification as a carcinogen need not apply if the full refining history is known and it can be shown that the substance from which it is produced is not a carcinogen. This note applies to certain complex oil-derived substances in Annex I&#x27;&#x27;.  PAHs, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, are common contaminants in petrolatum, also called petroleum jelly. Among the studies linking the petrolatum impurity PAHs to breast cancer is a Columbia University study in which researchers found that the breast tissue of women with breast cancer was 2.6 times more likely to contain elevated levels of PAHs bound to DNA (called DNA adducts) than the breast tissue of women without breast cancer (Rundle et al. 2000). The National Toxicology Programs finds that some PAHs are reasonable anticipated to be human carcinogens, and the State of California lists a number of PAHs as carcinogens in its Proposition 65 program (NTP 2002, OEHHA 2004).  Shame on Aveeno for putting petrolatum in a product they tout as all natural!</li>
            <li> I had previously been using a similar Lubraderm product to relieve dry skin.  When I went to reorder I found that Amazon no longer carried it.  I selected the Aveeno Active Naturals product as a substitute.   I have found the Aveeno to be an all around better product.  It relieves my dry skin with only one application per day, as opposed to twice a day with Lubraderm.  Also, the Aveeno has that slight pleasant fragrance typical of Aveeno soap products.  The Lubraderm had a slight chemical smell.  Also, the Aveeno is 18-ounce per bottle, as opposed to 16 for Lubraderm.</li>
            <li> its more expensive but cant live without it. Got recommended by my cousin, and she wont use anything else. Now i know why... Thank you~!</li>
            <li> I use acne medication to prevent breakouts and mind you, it takes a toll on your skin. My face has always been red due to the irritating effects of the topical medication. I&#x27;ve being using the medication along with Lubriderm for 6 years to soothe the irritation. It helped stop the dryness, but my face was still red in areas and it wouldn&#x27;t completely soothe my skin. Figured I&#x27;d try a new lotion, one that doesn&#x27;t clog pores. Aveeno is always on commercials and I know so many people that use it, so I figured I&#x27;d try it. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks, and my skin is AMAZING. No redness! Even toned! No dry skin! Happy, soothed, non-burned skin! AND IT DIDN&#x27;T MAKE ME BREAK OUT!!!! :-) I love this product! It thoroughly moisturizes and made my skin SO happy! Totally recommend to acne prone individuals especially for those with skin that goes through a lot of abuse! You don&#x27;t have to avoid T-zones with this lotion either! It can feel slightly tacky, but it&#x27;s non-greasy, won&#x27;t clog pores, and it actually helped stop breakouts! (Dryness causes oil glands to go into overproduction causing acne- this hydrates telling your skin to not make so much oil) Great product. Period.</li>
            <li> Stay away. Full of gunk. Many Aveeno products contain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Distearyldimonium Chloride is a quaternary ammonium salt. (Quaternary ammonium salts are used as disinfectants, surfactants, fabric softeners, and as antistatic agents.)It is synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;The Environment Canada Domestic Substance List didn&#x27;t find it harmful, or toxic, but the Europian Union - Classification &amp; Labelling says: \\&quot;Distearyldimonium Chloride is irritant and is synthetic detergents additives too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Isopropyl Palmitate: It is a thickening and emollient agent. It is derived from Isopropyl Alcohol, synthetic alcohol and Palmatic Acid, a fatty acid from palm oil.&lt;br /&gt;Isopropyl Palmitate is considered a short chain ester that feels dry on our skin.&lt;br /&gt;It contains alcohol, it is a very comedogenic and causes skin irritations and dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Methylparaben: is a preservative. Methylparaben is quickly absorbed through the skin. Many studies have found a link between parabens and breast cancer. After being exposed to the sun, studies show that 19% of the skin cells treated with Methylparaben had died. Parabens, including methylparaben, have estrogenic affects on the body, which means they can affect the reproductive glands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Petrolatum: Alias Vaselin, petroleum jelly. In the European Union, petrolatum can only be used in cosmetics \\&quot;if the full refining history is known and it can be shown that the substance from which it is produced is not a carcinogen\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;It can be contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which is is associated with cancer.&lt;br /&gt;The European Union classifies petrolatum a carcinogen and restricts its use in cosmetics. PAHs in petrolatum can also cause skin irritation and allergies.&lt;br /&gt;It prevents the skin breathe, clogs the pores, preventing the skin detoxify and strenghtens the tendency of inflammation. Causes dryness as well.&lt;br /&gt;Petrolatum or mineral oil jelly and mineral oils can cause skin photosensitivity or promote sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;The industry uses it as a lubricant.romote sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;The industry uses it as a lubricant.</li>
            <li> this is great for sensitive skin. i have eczema and ive used lubriderm for years and   this lotion is by far better. not oily at all. doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feeling after applying</li>
            <li> Anyone with sensitive skin should try this lotion for lasting relief. I have dry itchy skin with eczema and this is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t make my skin burn. I&#x27;ve been using the Aveeno for several years now and use it daily. I highly recommend this for everyday use without a greasy texture or perfume smell. The 2 pack at Amazon was a great deal when you sign up for subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> Aveeno products really are the best out there for skin issues like itching skin or eczema.  I also use the Aveeno Itch concentrated lotion.  This really is a great deal from Amazon because I was in walmart today and one bottle of this was $9.82.  I had to do a double take because I had gotten it at such a great deal from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Amazing skin moisturizer. I have dry skin and apply lotion everyday after I get out of the shower. Aveeno is the prefect product for me.</li>
            <li> Great, non greasy lotion for those of us who are concerned about skin cancer.  Ships fast.</li>
            <li> This lotion was my 2nd Aveeno product and both just didn&#x27;t work for me,.....made my skin blotchy, red and itchy.  I also found the lotion thick and sticky like a liquid paste.  I purchased unscented, but felt the \\&quot;no smell smell\\&quot; was unpleasant. All in all this is a costlier lotion,...but reminded me of something from the Dollar Store.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it&#x27;s a great product, but the pump doesn&#x27;t work : for two bottles in the pack I bought.  I thought it&#x27;s just me, but after asking 2 friends to help. They couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make pump work either. And I never had problem with other bottle pumps before.    If anyone could let me know how on earth this bottle pump could work, it&#x27;ll be great.</li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin, occasionally bordering on eczema.  While this won&#x27;t cure an outbreak, it leaves my skin so soft and smooth that outbreaks happen MUCH less often.  In fact, I haven&#x27;t had one since I started using it.  This lotion was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I had tried them all:  Lubriderm, Eucerin, Vaseline, Suave, you name it.  This is better than all of them combined.  Fragrance-free so the whole family can use it.  Thick and moisturizing without feeling greasy.  It feels so soft and smooth going on and really penetrates into the skin. It lasts all day, so I don&#x27;t find myself scratching dry spots near the end of the day.  There are no dry spots!  I feel like doing a \\&quot;real person\\&quot; commercial for this lotion, and it&#x27;s rare that I feel so positive about something.  If you have dry skin, this is the lotion to use.</li>
            <li> This Aveeno moisturizing lotion feels really good on my skin and soaks into the skin quickly without feeling heavy. I thought the pack of 2 was a good buy and I am pleased with this product. No strong fragrance either!</li>
            <li> This aveeno lotion is one of the nicest lotions I&#x27;ve used.  It is very smoothing without being greasy, love it!</li>
            <li> I received the product and it was busted open in the envelope, not even in a box. The lotion actually had 2 bugs on the lotion that scattered from being busted open</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about a month now and although it feels nice going on I&#x27;m not exactly excited with the \\&quot;moisturizes for 24 hours\\&quot; claim.  I mainly need extra moisturizing on my legs which become very dry and itchy (especially during cold/windy days.  Of course you should re-apply after each hand washing.  My husband and kids use it occassionally and seem to like it.  It does have petrolatum in it which I was told is not good for you.  I do love Aveeno products and if this one had sun protection built-in I would rate it with 4 stars.</li>
            <li> GOOD STUFF!! Skin is soft and moisturized all day. I didn&#x27;t have to reapply.</li>
            <li> This lotion can me to feel no dryness in 24 hours without fragrance.  Aveeno Daily Moisturizing lotion is my #1 favorite of lotion.</li>
            <li> BOTH MY HUSBAND AND I USE THIS EACH DAY.  WE LOVE IT.  THE SKING ABSORBS IT WELL SO YOU ARE NOT GREASY AFTER APLICATION AND IT REALLY DOES MOSTURIZE OLDER DRIER SKIN.  NO SCENT TO SPEAK OF EITHER.  ADD A DROP OF ARGON OIL AND YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT IT!  EVEN ON ITS OWN IT IS WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, so it&#x27;s important to me that my lotions don&#x27;t smell. And this lotion is a clean, nice, not greasy lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for an aftershave, and I&#x27;ve been using it as an aftershave for about 6 years. It&#x27;s so much nicer to use this than to use a harsh, alcohol-based aftershave. It makes skin soft, and lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Great lotion&lt;br /&gt;+Super deluxe, your skin deserves something nice&lt;br /&gt;+Can use it for everything, and everywhere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Gets a little flaky at the dispenser</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer that i have found. My skin feels great only with one application. With floridas cold weatehr recently i was experiencing dry skin (plus i was pregnant and just deliverd a baby) so i needed something that really works...&lt;br /&gt; I was so impressed with it that i went ahead and pruchased Aveeno daily moisturizing body wash. With body wash my skin feels so good that i dont feel the need to apply moisturizer at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to any one who is looking for a great moisturizer taht not only works but does&#x27;t leave oily feelings after appliation.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and not greasy, but moisturizes well. I can use it in any season.</li>
            <li> It does not leave behind a greasy feeling, just do not pack on layers. A think layer will work (seriously). I always use it as a primer for my make up too. I&#x27;m not a heavy make up wearer, but I do wear foundation and sometimes a light blush. Putting on this right after a shower, I sweep over powder foundation or blush on, and it will not cake or look like you&#x27;re pealing at all. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, since I tend to get acne with other heavier lotions.</li>
            <li> I have tried every lotion under the sun and this one is by far the best! It actually does keep your skin soft for hours. I only discovered it this winter, when my hands are always dry and red and this lotion cured them literally instantly. I will never use anything else again. Apply once after a shower and you are good to go all day and night. And it has no scent, which I love.   I also use Aveeno Postively Radiant facial cleanser and have been for years. Perfect skin! Aveeno is a miracle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this lotion.  It&#x27;s good around the eyes, on the hands, and anywhere that needs moisture.  It&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li> Soft on skin and comfortable</li>
            <li> I work in a field which requires me to wash my hands multiple times a day and have problems with dry hands and skin in the winter time. As you can imagine, my hands and other skin can become very irritated from washing and cold weather. I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno for many years now and have found that it provides a great temporary relief of these issues, and perhps the superior results over other brands that \\&quot;claim\\&quot; to have similar healing powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wihle I&#x27;ve found Aveeno products to be of good quality, there are a few things that you should be aware of before using this item. 1- For people who have to wash their hands repeatedly it doesn&#x27;t last 24hrs. You do have to reapply a few times a day to maintain an optimal coating. 2- If your hands or other skin is severley dry or cracking it can cause further irritation. The only way for me to avoid this extra irritation is to soak in a hot bath to let the skin hydrate a bit, then apply the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I really think Aveeno lotions are the best out there. Most have very little if any odor when compared to others that smell like fruit baskets, and they work well on dry irritated skin. I like to put on a layer of Aloe gel and then ad a coating of Aveeno over that. I&#x27;ve also found that applying 10-15 drops of rubbing alcohol after applying the Aveeno helps to smoothe out the lotion and eliminate any greasy or sticky feeling on my hands. (((don&#x27;t ask me how it works, it just does!)))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously you will want to speak to your docotor before trying any new products, but I highly recommend this to those who suffer from minor dry skin irritations.</li>
            <li> I got some pretty blue bottles, filled them with this lotion and set one by every sink in the house. Now I remember to use hand lotion and my hands feel and look better. Good job, Aveeno and Amazon!</li>
            <li> Incredibly nice moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> Along with Aveeno soap I use this product on a daily basis. It is extremely soothing to irritated skin, helps avoid itching from straps on urinary leg bags and is very gentle on ,my skin. Will reorder as needed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended! I have eczema, my skin is very dry and I have to be careful not to use products with perfumes or harsh chemicals. I use this product for my face and body and I never have any burning sensations as I do with other products. Whenever I prefer a heavier/greasier moisturizer I just add a little baby oil or Vaseline to ensure it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback with this product is that it is a bit pricey. If you can find it wholesale or on sale --- but sure to stock up!</li>
            <li> Nice lotion but can be VERY difficult to get open</li>
            <li> I had been using Amazon&#x27;s search filters to find body lotion with a 15 SPF or greater and this was offered up in the results.  It&#x27;s only after we received it that I realized it has no sunscreen in it at all.  That is not a flaw in the product of course, just my own inattention, however the product is greasy compared to the Vaseline moisturizer I have been using. It has no scent, which is fine and even desirable, but when I&#x27;m wearing it I&#x27;m concerned I will stain the fabric of any upholstered chair I sit on or the Alcantara seats in my car.  Aveeno does make a moisturizer with a 15 SPF sunscreen in it....but this is not it and if that product feels as greasy as this does, it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m looking for anyway.</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly. Is not sticky. Sinks into skin beautifully. Softens skin. Its the only body/hand lotion that I use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for about $10 a bottle.  I works well and does not have any smell.  I will probably purchase it again when my current supply runs out.</li>
            <li> I was initially a little skeptical when I picked up a bottle of this stuff, simply because it a) was expensive and b) made a lot of claims I didn&#x27;t think it could live up to. I&#x27;m a student on a tight budget, and I can&#x27;t really afford to go wild on fancy-schmancy makeup and face creams and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, I&#x27;ll spend the money on. It works exactly like it says, is the only product that has helped with my very dry skin without making my face and neck feel greasy -- it helps with psoriasis too! -- and doesn&#x27;t have that funny smell that a lot of other creams tend to. I would recommend putting it on right after a shower, but it works just as well if you&#x27;re on the run and only have time to smear some on on the way out. I really do encourage you to spend the extra few dollars for quality; you really do get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Came really quick! Like a 13 year old a school boy! Aveno is awesome! Transformed my skin! &amp;#62;3</li>
            <li> I keep this by the changing table and use it several times a day because changing diapers dries out hands like nothing else.  I have another one by the kitchen sink for use after washing bottles.  It has a mild scent (unscented), is not greasy, doesn&#x27;t bother my son&#x27;s skin if I touch him after putting it on.  I also looked it up on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep website and found it has a very low toxicity rating, which is important to me.  I like this enough to include it in a gift basket for other new moms.</li>
            <li> My daughter been using the product for over nine years and she loves it.  Will continue to use it works</li>
            <li> I have been using it for my kid for a long time and it is the best I ever used. It has no smell and quickly gets absorbed and leaves the skin nourished. Recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> Great. Affordable. Goes a long way. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores. My complexion is fine.</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion, but there are better out there. Pros: It is affordable and available at most stores. It is a good lotion in that it is creamy and almost liquid like, so even a small amount lasts a while. The smell is very mild. I find it locks the moisture in the skin well, as opposed to simply providing a creamy moisturization. Also, it has some beneficial ingredients compared to some lotions, such as the soothing oatmeal complex.&lt;br /&gt;The cons: While it is affordable in general, it is slightly pricey compared with other store brands. It could be a little more moisturizing. If used as a daily lotion, it is good. But if someone is looking for a lotion to help with severely dry skin, they may want to find a product that addresses that particular need. But, as far as having a handy lotion around for anyone to use, it is good for adults and young ones. Aveeno has products specifically for sensitive skin and dry skin as well.</li>
            <li> The only one that works with my skin. Love this product and have been buying it for years. It&#x27;s light enough that you can use it often but heavy enough to last in really dry climates. Found out it was on Amazon for a great price and I picked it up immidiately. Not disappointed at all!! Thank you Amazon for stocking this product. Packaging and stuff was great as usual for a product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Put it on my face on dry mornings and instantly feel the moisture, but its not slimy or oily feeling either.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 3 months because at first it made y skin feel good, wasn&#x27;t greasy, and absorbed quickly. The lotion however, does not help you skin heal at all and in my case it made my hands and face really red in appearance after using for a period of time. My hands also began to get really tough and chapped and upon discontinuing use this went away.</li>
            <li> One or two applications a day really help.  Whatever the active ingredient in this is, it really works well.  It is more effective than the other lotions I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no aggressive chemical perfume smell to this lotion either, which I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years and have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> As a guy who doesn&#x27;t use a whole lot of lotion type products I was pretty lost about a year ago when I developed an inch long dry spot on my face.  I tried several different lotions and creams with absolutely no change.  I was starting to consider seeing a dermatologist when I saw the reviews on this stuff and decided to give it a try.    Within a week, my face cleared up (this is after having this dry spot for over 6 months).  Now I use it almost every morning - something I never thought I would do with lotion.  I recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> When I was younger I use to make fun of my dad for using lotion.  But ever since my girlfriend made me use it once I cannot stop using it after I get out of the shower now. (But I won&#x27;t tell my dad that!)    I have used this lotion for over a year now.  A bottle will last you an extremely long time.  I will use one squirt to get my hands and my face.  This lotion does not bother my face or give me acne.  It makes me feel refreshed and lasts all day.    As for scent, this product really doesn&#x27;t have one.  You will smell a light scent when you put it on, but it will disappear shortly after.    Here is a tip....  When the bottle gets low, you will have to open it up and try to move some of the lotion that is stuck to the sides. After that you should be able to use it for another few weeks.    This is a great product.  I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot throughout the day due to my job and I used to get really dry hands.  All other products I&#x27;ve tried through the past few months just didn&#x27;t cut it and then someone suggested I try Aveeno so I picked up a few bottles here from Amazon.  The product does work well and doesn&#x27;t wear off through the day however I find it takes quite a while for the lotion to soak into the skin before the oily feel goes away but other than that, I enjoy and use the product.</li>
            <li> I usually have good luck ordering with Amazon, however, this package arrived with someone else&#x27;s packing slip and was not the product that I ordered (I wanted the lotion with sunscreen).  After thinging a while about returning, with the hassle factor calculated, decided to keep and use.</li>
            <li> I was complaining of a terminal case of itchiness, to my dermatologist, who recommended this product. So I went right out and got some and discovered that I can cover every square millimeter of my bod with this, without feeling as though I ought to get right back in the shower to get the sticky stuff off. No, it seems to be absorbed into the epidermis without leaving any unpleasant residue. Even though it is expensive, it goes a long way. Now I won&#x27;t use anything else in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it didn&#x27;t take me too long to discover that a certain ubiquitous merchandiser whose well-known name starts with W, is producing its own version of this with exactly the same ingredients, but for a lower price tag. You&#x27;ll still pay more than for the inferior products, but this is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Great, good quality product and I love it. I will be ordering this again in the future.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have ever used, to keep skin moisturized, not greasy! Excellent on feet, or face, and everything in between!</li>
            <li> This lotion is one of the best on the market - love the way it feels, and it is unscented which is great - good price!</li>
            <li> Yes I am enjoying this product - will order again.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this cream for my one year old daughter. After I started putting cream on, I noticed she had red spot all over her body. She looked red and uncomfortable. It took me a week to realise that the cause was aveeno cream. Now I have stopped using it on her.</li>
            <li> I love it because it keeps my skin very soft and I did recomend  to some of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Works really well for dry skin and acne prone skin as well.  It does not cause break outs or anything.</li>
            <li> Love the body lotion, it really help to smooth dry skin in cold weather.</li>
            <li> I have been an Aveeno fan for years and used this product over the last several months so I thought I should write a little something about my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it is the colloidal oatmeal ingredients and the easy application. Its not greasy and it absorbs quickly. Its relatively safe for adults and kids as it relates to environmentally friendly ratings and natural product contents. It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes or have an obnoxious odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s where I struggle a bit with it...its not really that natural. Read the ingredients and you will see what I mean. But more than that is it leaves a slightly tacky film on your skin after it dries. I think this is why they can say it lasts up to 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I used to use Vaseline (the cocoa butter one), but this product is much better for me. The lotion is very smooth, and it feels great on my skin. It lasts all day too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- great texture&lt;br /&gt;- lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;- nice smell (not a strong fragrance, but a natural smell)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- sometimes I need quite a bit to alleviate dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5. Great product for a good price. Deals with dry skin very well.</li>
            <li> awesome to have around - very nourishing. we put these all around the house, since we have a new born and we&#x27;re constantly washing our hands, bottles, etc.</li>
            <li> AWESOME STUFF!  I have very sensitive skin and I can use this on my body and face without irritation and breakout.  Also this comes with a small bonus 25oz travel tube.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommends Aveeno for dry, itchy skin. I also use it t soften and protect diabetic feet. It is easily absorbed, makes no shine on the skin, and truly has no fragrance. It works for me.</li>
            <li> The back of the label says that it moisturizes your skin for 24 hours. All it takes is for me to wash my hands once and my hands are back to being dry. I have to remoisturize after every time I wash my hands, it doesnt last at all. There are plenty of moisturizers ive used in the past that absorb quickly into the skin like this lotion does and lasts a few hand washes. This lotion I think falls below the standard of your average moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Unscented, allergy-proof, and effective.I had patches of dry areas on my forearm, but after three days of using this product, I was able to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin wonderfully soft.  Ive been using it for about a year now.  I used to use a neutrogena unscented lotion which was discontinued a few years back.  I kept searching for everyday body lotions which didnt smell bad, worked well and made my skin feel very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs well into the skin and doesnt get clumpy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I&#x27;m already familiar with the quality of&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno products so I knew I would be satisfied.  Plus the price&lt;br /&gt;was right.</li>
            <li> This Aveeno lotion is very gentle yet very moisturizing with no oily film left on the skin. When I went for my yearly dermatological skin check up, the N.P, said my face was very smooth. I told her I had switched to Aveeno and she said, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s what I use.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> quality, long lasting, gentle lotion. We have it scattered throughout our house at every sink. It&#x27;s non greasy and is absorbed quickly, leaving skin refreshed and soft. We&#x27;ll probably never switch to anything else! Unscented as well, so it&#x27;s never interfering with a chosen perfume or body spray.</li>
            <li> Hi,I got items,Thank you</li>
            <li> I never use any other brand of lotion.  It does not sit on your skin nor does it feel greasy.  I swim a lot in a chlorinated pool which makes my skin very dry  Aveeno moisturizes my skin so I am not itchy all over!!  Love the fragrance free</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion since I received it. It is perfect for curing your dry hands or use after shaving. It does not smell all that good (I hate the smell) but that is pretty much its only downside. Once the lotion is absorbed into your hands you forget you even put any on. Which is great. The smell goes away with the lotion.</li>
