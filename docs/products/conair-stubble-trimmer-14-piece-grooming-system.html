            <li>Excellent item!</li>
            <li>The seller was excellent, received the product promptly after the purchase thru Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>All in all this was a great buy!  </li>
            <li>This is the best beard/body trimmer I have owned.</li>
            <li>The description on the package seemed impressive</li>
            <li>product life is very good</li>
            <li>With that said, this may be a great product.</li>
            <li>That seems fair to</li>
            <li>Price is fair.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a cheap way to get that shadow look then this is perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>to clean&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable in hand&lt;br /&gt;Holds a good charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t work good</li>
            <li>There were plenty of accessories and it is very easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>As with so many products today plastic of some form is used.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I will update this review once I have more feedback from this.</li>
            <li>but it does the job for the most part.</li>
            <li>You get many attachments for this</li>
            <li>It seems like most of them are for stubble beards.</li>
            <li>i keep a stubbled looked over my entire face, so the 5 included stubble guards are awesome and</li>
            <li>Works great thought it was more of a trimer,not for keeping a day or two old look</li>
            <li>: It is orange, so you can easily find it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li>Hair trim heads are okay, but the nose and ear accessory does not do an adequate job of trimming.</li>
            <li>speed settings are more audible than useful</li>
            <li>Clip on guards are cheap and flimsy, and scrap your face&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too cheap and not too expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price was very cheap for the good quality compared to more expensive and not so good trimmers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Antique or old tools, kitchen items that were made with loving care and still work well.  </li>
            <li>Offered grooming at a most reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Now I am left with a nose hair trimmer (which I never use) because I thought it would be a good idea to switch the components out...</li>
            <li>I suppose its useful if you have a face of light hair, or peach fuzz, but if you have anything resembling a full beard, this unit won&#x27;t even make a dent using any of the plastic attachment heads.</li>
            <li>Not the greatest, just keep looking unless it goes on serious sale.</li>
            <li>I hope they make this for a long time because it&#x27;s a good one.</li>
            <li>The person I sold it to happily bought it from me (new) for the same price I paid, and has had no complaints.  </li>
            <li>the plastic kind of seems a little cheap on it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, and keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li>The motor is failing, but I could not find the exact replacement model.</li>
            <li>This is a very compact and powerful beard and body hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>You have to follow the instructions and charge the batteries for 16 hours the first time before you ever use it.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that you are not purchasing a trimmer that runs on AA batteries.</li>
            <li>Which is exactly what I did not want</li>
            <li>I lost the plug to the first one and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement.</li>
            <li>First, the blade itself has three adjustments from close to semi close.</li>
            <li>There are then the mentioned attachments to help find the exact level that your looking for.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the new trimmer gets better shave with this then old</li>
            <li>whether I go with the grain or against it, I have many options to keep my beard at a very controlled SHORT length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to use strong scissors to open it.</li>
            <li>Pure junk.</li>
            <li>Clogs very fast&lt;</li>
            <li>Battery life is very good.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Works better than expected</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s not made very well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see why you would need anything other than this to groom your body,very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention, the little red LED light on the handle should have made me wondered.  </li>
            <li>since I have to wait 16 hours for the first charge to complete.</li>
            <li>This was the biggest peace of JUNK it won&#x27;t even cut one hair more less my beard</li>
            <li>Costs more than it should, even if it is less than 20 bucks</li>
            <li>okay, a little lacking in power.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Living/working/traveling overseas, and dealing with frequent power outages, this seemed to be a reasonable priced trimmer for my needs.  </li>
            <li>So I learned a lesson, and will spend a few more bucks and get what works well for me.</li>
            <li>After spending 5 minutes trying to open the packaging, and destroying it in the process, I saw a nice power adaptor...</li>
            <li>Also battery life seems to be pretty short.</li>
            <li>I am having to charge it back up from first time.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic, not very strong.</li>
            <li>This allows you to really control the amount of stubble you want to keep, plus on the back of the trimmer you can adjust the blade depth by 3 different increments.</li>
            <li>these aren&#x27;t like the normal guards you get with a trimmer, they&#x27;re much closer with the depth difference being slight, but noticeable.</li>
            <li>Go with that 110V&#x27;s straight out of the wall, spend the $60.00 on a quality one, and you save money in the long run!!!</li>
            <li>Battery barely makes it through 1 teim</li>
            <li>My previous one lasted a whole 2 months!  </li>
            <li>beard is typically about 4-5 days growth, trimmed very close.&lt;br /&gt;Reasons to like it:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>really like this little guy.</li>

            <li> really like this little guy.</li>
            <li> also, when just using the trimmer with no guard, the metal actually feels soft against your face, not grainy or scratchy like other ones i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> so the only application was the giant adjustable comb, but the teeth on that comb are really long and prevent me from trimming efficiently under the nose on the mustache.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s now all to battery long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Ive purchased a few different types, and this is my second purchase of this one.</li>
            <li> Not sure of the model, but it came with a &amp;#34;dock&amp;#34; type charger and never held a charge long enough to finish the job...</li>
            <li> Just make a fast buck the name of the game today.</li>
            <li> I have over the years been a dedicated Wahl user, so when my last one went, I thought I would save a few bucks and try this unit.</li>
            <li> I had a deep cut since one very sharp edge!  </li>
            <li> The first one failed after, perhaps five years.</li>
            <li> I would review other products with a longer battery life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I use 1 and fade down to 5 using the 1,3 and 5 attachments.</li>
            <li> Do it very carefully, otherwise the packaging material could be a risk!</li>
            <li> This shaver broke in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Used as a hair clipper, although not intended for this use, it worked (a little slow).&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> /&gt;So is one of the few products were</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This unit needs about a 1 hour charge before every trimming, or it runs dead halfway through.</li>
            <li> attachments can be messy</li>
            <li> One false move and you&#x27;re left with a bald spot.</li>
            <li> This is the second Conair trimmer that completely failed.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ine of very few on the market that are adjustable with a slide switch - adjustable w/o adding attachments.</li>
            <li> Using it without works, but gives a very uneven cut.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a scum</li>
            <li> /&gt;Heads are sometimes tough to remove&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li> getting tired of manufacturing making items that you buy and throw away get anew one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it for my fiance and when I asked him what he said poor</li>
            <li> However, the packaging is a pain in the ass (sorry for the language).</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the nose trimming accessory on the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item about 2 months ago and am not greatly impressed with it.</li>
            <li> To my disappointment, the blind faith I had with purchasing items through Amazon failed me (Shame on me!).</li>
            <li> But I just wanted to share my disappointment so that folks out there don&#x27;t buy it hoping it is AA battery operated.</li>

            <li> As with so many products today plastic of some form is used. This shaver broke in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;Just getting tired of manufacturing making items that you buy and throw away get anew one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Antique or old tools, kitchen items that were made with loving care and still work well.  Just make a fast buck the name of the game today.</li>
            <li> Used as a hair clipper, although not intended for this use, it worked (a little slow).&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life.</li>
            <li> Excellent product ,just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Love it. Short battery life but otherwise terrific. I wll buy another when mine stops working, which happens to all razors eventually.</li>
            <li> This was the biggest peace of JUNK it won&#x27;t even cut one hair more less my beard I am done with Amazon cause all the stuff I order is JUNK I will buy from a store were it all works</li>
            <li> one of the best trimmers i have ever used and i cut hair ..AA1</li>
            <li> The product seems to comply with it promises. However, the packaging is a pain in the ass (sorry for the language). I had to use strong scissors to open it. Do it very carefully, otherwise the packaging material could be a risk! I had a deep cut since one very sharp edge!  I will update this review once I have more feedback from this. It was for a gift.</li>
            <li> Product was as needed/desired. Offered grooming at a most reasonable price.  Don&#x27;t see why you would need anything other than this to groom your body,very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Excellent item!....Received as described!....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the quality of the trimmer, as it didn&#x27;t work out of the box. I tried charging in the evening, and let it run overnight (they say to allow 16 hours to charge), and no go. Gave up, trying a different trimmer.</li>
            <li> While on travel, I left my Norelco at home, so I went to a CVS and bough this model based on recommendation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It is orange, so you can easily find it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Short battery life&lt;br /&gt;  takes several swipes to cut anything&lt;br /&gt;  speed settings are more audible than useful&lt;br /&gt;  Clip on guards are cheap and flimsy, and scrap your face&lt;br /&gt;  Costs more than it should, even if it is less than 20 bucks&lt;br /&gt;  Clogs very fast&lt;br /&gt;  Whats the tube of oil for? This is supposed to be a stubble trimmer</li>
            <li> I use for trimming my beard daily, and very occasionally for hair trimming.  Ive purchased a few different types, and this is my second purchase of this one. The first one failed after, perhaps five years. That seems fair to me.&lt;br /&gt;My beard is typically about 4-5 days growth, trimmed very close.&lt;br /&gt;Reasons to like it:&lt;br /&gt;1) it&#x27;s ine of very few on the market that are adjustable with a slide switch - adjustable w/o adding attachments. That means  whether I go with the grain or against it, I have many options to keep my beard at a very controlled SHORT length.&lt;br /&gt;2) Battery life is very good.&lt;br /&gt;3) product life is very good&lt;br /&gt;4) Price is fair. Not too cheap and not too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;5) case and construction are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;So is one of the few products were I&#x27;ve tried many, and keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s now all to battery long lasting.  I had the product charging for 10 hours, the next day I was triming for a wedding and the battery only lasted me 15-18 min.  I would review other products with a longer battery life.</li>
            <li> Works well.got to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the nose trimming accessory on the trimmer.  Hair trim heads are okay, but the nose and ear accessory does not do an adequate job of trimming. I have a non-rechargeable, battery operated earlier model of your trimmer.  The motor is failing, but I could not find the exact replacement model.</li>
            <li> Pure junk. Battery barely makes it through 1 teim</li>
            <li> My husband likes it.  Does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> It works.  I bought it for my fiance and when I asked him what he said poor so that&#x27;s what it is the plastic kind of seems a little cheap on it but it does the job for the most part.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected</li>
            <li> Broke after 2nd time being used. I guess it&#x27;s not made very well. Cheap plastic, not very strong. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This is a very compact and powerful beard and body hair trimmer.  The price was very cheap for the good quality compared to more expensive and not so good trimmers.  There were plenty of accessories and it is very easy to operate.  The seller was excellent, received the product promptly after the purchase thru Amazon.com.  All in all this was a great buy!

            <li> This is the best beard/body trimmer I have owned. The unit works well and is built well. I saw some complaints about the unit not holding a charge but mine holds a charge for 3-4 weeks at a time. You have to follow the instructions and charge the batteries for 16 hours the first time before you ever use it. I hope they make this for a long time because it&#x27;s a good one.</li>
            <li> I bought this item about 2 months ago and am not greatly impressed with it. I have over the years been a dedicated Wahl user, so when my last one went, I thought I would save a few bucks and try this unit. The description on the package seemed impressive so I thought the trimmer would be too. You get many attachments for this but I have no idea what each one does. It seems like most of them are for stubble beards. I prefer about 3/8\\&quot; on mustache and beard so the only application was the giant adjustable comb, but the teeth on that comb are really long and prevent me from trimming efficiently under the nose on the mustache. Also battery life seems to be pretty short. This unit needs about a 1 hour charge before every trimming, or it runs dead halfway through. This is unlike the Wahls I&#x27;ve had, which get a bout three or four trims on a charge. So I learned a lesson, and will spend a few more bucks and get what works well for me.</li>
            <li> i keep a stubbled looked over my entire face, so the 5 included stubble guards are awesome and something i haven&#x27;t seen before. these aren&#x27;t like the normal guards you get with a trimmer, they&#x27;re much closer with the depth difference being slight, but noticeable. This allows you to really control the amount of stubble you want to keep, plus on the back of the trimmer you can adjust the blade depth by 3 different increments. also, when just using the trimmer with no guard, the metal actually feels soft against your face, not grainy or scratchy like other ones i&#x27;ve used. really like this little guy.</li>
            <li> I have no opinion about the product itself, I never used it.  The person I sold it to happily bought it from me (new) for the same price I paid, and has had no complaints.  However, the advertised specs (on the Amazon page) state the trimmer runs on 2 AA batteries (not included), this is not the case.  The trimmer is a rechargeable unit, 110v (no AA batteries).&lt;br /&gt;Living/working/traveling overseas, and dealing with frequent power outages, this seemed to be a reasonable priced trimmer for my needs.  To my disappointment, the blind faith I had with purchasing items through Amazon failed me (Shame on me!). With that said, this may be a great product. Just be aware that you are not purchasing a trimmer that runs on AA batteries.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the new trimmer gets better shave with this then old</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since November 10/2014and just today 3/1/2015 I am having to charge it back up from first time.</li>
            <li> Although the description reads that it is AA battery operated, it is NOT so.  After spending 5 minutes trying to open the packaging, and destroying it in the process, I saw a nice power adaptor... Which is exactly what I did not want, I wanted it to be battery operated.  I should have paid more attention, the little red LED light on the handle should have made me wondered.  I therefore cannot review the product itself yet since I have to wait 16 hours for the first charge to complete. But I just wanted to share my disappointment so that folks out there don&#x27;t buy it hoping it is AA battery operated.</li>
            <li> This is my second Conair Stubble trimmer. I lost the plug to the first one and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement. The product description doesn&#x27;t do stubble seekers justice. First, the blade itself has three adjustments from close to semi close. There are then the mentioned attachments to help find the exact level that your looking for. If your looking for a cheap way to get that shadow look then this is perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I use 1 and fade down to 5 using the 1,3 and 5 attachments. It gives me the stubble look that im seeking. I keep the rest of the attachments in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precise stubble trimming&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable in hand&lt;br /&gt;Holds a good charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads are sometimes tough to remove&lt;br /&gt;Many attachments can be messy</li>
            <li> I like it okay, a little lacking in power.</li>
            <li> This is the second Conair trimmer that completely failed.  Day 1: Opened the box, flipped through the instructions, when I went to switch over to the nose trimmer the stubble trimmers plastic busted off!  Now I am left with a nose hair trimmer (which I never use) because I thought it would be a good idea to switch the components out...My previous one lasted a whole 2 months!  Not sure of the model, but it came with a &amp;#34;dock&amp;#34; type charger and never held a charge long enough to finish the job...Meanwhile, my corded Wahl &amp;#34;peanut&amp;#34; trimmer from 2004 is shaving my nuts like it did the day I got it!  I have learned 1 thing from the dozen or so &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; trimmers I have had over the years, Forget the recharging ones...Go with that 110V&#x27;s straight out of the wall, spend the $60.00 on a quality one, and you save money in the long run!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work good it all it&#x27;s a scum</li>
            <li> I probably only have myself to blame for purchasing this instead of a proper beard trimmer. I suppose its useful if you have a face of light hair, or peach fuzz, but if you have anything resembling a full beard, this unit won&#x27;t even make a dent using any of the plastic attachment heads. Using it without works, but gives a very uneven cut. One false move and you&#x27;re left with a bald spot.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest, just keep looking unless it goes on serious sale. Nose trimmer doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Works great thought it was more of a trimer,not for keeping a day or two old look</li>
