            <li>Thanks Aussie for making a great product!</li>
            <li>I found this conditioner when i was searching the hair dyes and someone said this was gonna be your best friend after dying your hair too much</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of Aussie&#x27;s signature scent for it&#x27;s products which is kind of tropical.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Really softens your hair and smells great!!!!</li>
            <li>I was worried about it because my hair is very coily, but this is definitely great for all hair type!</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>and while I loved the TGIF line I love Aussie</li>
            <li>The opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend always tells me my hair smells nice.</li>
            <li>I really do love this product and so happy it found me :)</li>
            <li>I also love the smell of this product, it smells good and tropical but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It feels so nice</li>
            <li>Yep, I&#x27;ll go with the $1 and go get me some nice vodka with the rest to make fancy cocktails while my hair smells like the beach.</li>
            <li>but on it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>I like how effective this was for me.</li>
            <li>Nice not having to remove tops or flip up caps and then remember to replace them.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see that Aussie introduced a version for color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>The older version was awesome!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful, fragrant smell, very-creamy texture and feel, and a new kind of upside-down twist-off dispenser.</li>
            <li>I reviewed this product for free from the amazing BZZagent!</li>
            <li>normally I use hairspray to keep the frizz away and my hair was perfectly curly bouncy and no frizz.</li>
            <li>Great smelling and hair full of life....</li>
            <li>It makes your hair healthy, strong, shiny, voluminous and full of awesome smell.</li>
            <li>I loved how strong my hair felt afterwards as well.</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant and leaves my hair feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best one out there, but for the price, it gets the job done and leaves your hair very soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and the ends look awesome!</li>
            <li>My hair tangles very easy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to squeeze.</li>
            <li>It also comes out of the bottle very easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong compared to the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Even the more severe damage I have is looking better!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was how good it smelled!</li>
            <li>Smells awesome &amp; leaves my hair feeling soft !</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair that tangles very very easily!  </li>
            <li>Once I get my hair coated, it doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of it, it does mix nicely with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once I get my hair coated, it doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of it, it does mix nicely with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>For the most part, I just give into the whimsy of the &amp;#34;hair gods&amp;#34; and let them decide what kind of hair day it will be.</li>
            <li>3 minute miracle is by far one of the best conditioners I have used!</li>
            <li>My opinions are truthful and my own.</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised with this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used so far.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it leaves your hair feeling soft, shiny, and manageable for days after using it.</li>
            <li>It looks silky smooth and it doesn&#x27;t have frizz to it anymore plus the conditioner smells really good.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a cool coconut drink on a nice tropical getaway!</li>
            <li>I loved the smooth texture of the conditioner in my hair.</li>
            <li>this is one of the best products i tested from them so far.</li>
            <li>I got to try it free as part of BzzAgent, a sample review site, and I loved it.</li>
            <li>My stylist made sure she instructed me on home care ( she did an amazing cut &amp; color on my hairüòç)</li>
            <li>This morning my hair still smells wonderful and feels soft.</li>
            <li>This easy 3 minute formula makes my hair a lot smoother and shiny!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Love love love this product!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the best products that I have ever used because my hair has never felt so silky and has never been so manageable without any frizz, even on the most humid of days!</li>
            <li>Her remained soft and moist and was more manageable after washing which made me very happy.</li>
            <li>I love Aussie products, and for the most part it is because I think they smell amazing.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner also smells really good, kinda like coconut and leaves my hair smelling clean.</li>
            <li>the promotion provided me with 2 bottles.. one of which was taken by one of my relatives who enjoyed the product just as much as I did when she tried it while applying it to my daughters mane.its definitely a great product and the price for what you get is the icing on top!</li>
            <li>Can we first mention how great this smells?</li>
            <li>when leaving for more than 3 minutes it gives lots of shine to my hair and i have very fine medium dye medium blond hair with split end.</li>
            <li>First time using it , and I&#x27;m in love lol.</li>
            <li>it.it smells super good</li>
            <li>I recommend this as a good quick fix when you don&#x27;t have time to use a hair mask and sit in the shower for 15-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>This product tames it, makes it softer, and in an all around better condition.  </li>
            <li>With regards to the scent, personally I enjoyed it smells of tropical fruits</li>
            <li>But after using 3 Minute Miracle Moist my hair felt like it had more substance to it - hydration</li>
            <li>I love the scent of the product and how it gives my hair a natrual shine.</li>
            <li>This product does have dimethicone which is a non soluble silicone that can cause build up on hair and many people warn against it.</li>
            <li>I do find that conditioners that are a bit more watery are easier to apply to my hair.</li>
            <li>But I will make this product apart of my hair routine because I was satisfied with my results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I will make this product apart of my hair routine because I was satisfied with my results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been meaning to try this product for a while, so when I was offered to try it free through BzzAgent, I jumped on it!</li>
            <li>I love the packaging.</li>
            <li>Glad I got the chance to start using this again</li>
            <li>One of my college roommates absolutely love this stuff and she would lend me her conditioner on occasion.</li>
            <li>And I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product is just OK.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Everything was ok.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I was able to sample this product, courtesy of Aussie.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more manageable</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for everyone out there who needs a hair product that really does what it claims, it is also a great value.</li>
            <li>i love this product :)</li>
            <li>It smells FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>Thank you to Bzzagent and Aussie for letting me try the product for free!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the smell of coconuts!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>and I love smelling it on my hair all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth, touchable, silky self!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this moisture treatment.</li>
            <li>Love the way they designed the bottle no opening the top</li>
            <li>Wifey claims that combining hair oil treatment such as Argan Oil of Morocco for example after this conditioning provides her with perfect style and control.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy more after this.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; one is much better than this.</li>
            <li>we love it.</li>
            <li>She tried and fall in love, now always when I go to USA</li>
            <li>Make sure you remove the sticker on the bottom of the bottle before you get into the shower.  </li>
            <li>so make sure that&#x27;s gone before you get it.  </li>
            <li>The smell was OK for me...</li>
            <li>Often times, I use conditioner and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference at all, so this is a welcome change.  </li>
            <li>It has definitely left a great impression!</li>
            <li>This product changed my hair--for the better.</li>
            <li>and it did a lot better for her hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for me but better for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Maybe if my hair had some of these issues I would see more of a difference with this product but as compared to others I don&#x27;t see the benefits as a &amp;#34;Deep&amp;#34</li>
            <li>However when I dyed my hair blonde, it didn&#x27;t moisturize as well.overall great product, good buy.</li>
            <li>I love the product and have recommended it to my friends and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Nice light scent.</li>
            <li>the LONGER you leave it in the BETTER</li>
            <li>I want to order about five more.  </li>
            <li>I really love the scent of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received a free sample from BzzAgent and Aussie all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>The moisture was okay but didn&#x27;t blow my mind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Aussie 3 Minute Miracle many times through the years.</li>
            <li>This is better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it with steam, and found the benefits to be even better.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner...</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I have to say how pleased I am with it.</li>

            <li>Absolutely love the way this makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>My hair feels a bit stronger and more shiny.  </li>
            <li>That is my favorite thing about this conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I love the way my hair feels after.</li>
            <li>I love this 3 Minute Miracle Moist conditioner.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rave enough about how awesomely this product is packaged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall Thoughts: I really enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li>My hair just doesn&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li>a smidgen better and for the cost</li>

            <li>i&#x27;ve tried many</li>
            <li>Love the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I received this free to try from BzzAgent in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really thought it did a great job keeping its promises.  </li>
            <li>I love the price</li>
            <li>I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li>I did really love the scent though.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this and my hair loves it too.</li>
            <li>I really love how this product is dispensed as well.  </li>
            <li>Love the packaging and size.</li>
            <li>: I got this item free from Bzzagent!</li>
            <li>I received this product to try for free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>This Aussie 3 Minute Miracle is one of the best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve run across.</li>
            <li>also the packaging is phenomenal because it is just a squeeze tube</li>
            <li>I love the bottle in the shower, but made the mistake of bringing this with in my suitcase.</li>
            <li>so oooooo many times...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it :)  </li>
            <li>This is one of the two best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s definitely the BEST VALUE out there.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to more uses and</li>
            <li>I saw a difference, and it was more manageable after I used it.</li>
            <li>You wanna talk about healthy...</li>
            <li>so more kudos for that as well.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different ones and this is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li>Here goes the verdict.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up to Aussie for coming up with this innovative design for the bottle.</li>
            <li>but makes it more manageable.  </li>
            <li>but Aussie works just as great and does not even cost much.</li>
            <li>so I was happy to be able to test this product out thanks to BZZAGENT and AUSSIE.  </li>
            <li>I feel in love with Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle as soon as I opened the bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay now</li>
            <li>I would skip buying this and go for a better quality conditioner.</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to use this and for it to keep my hair moist.</li>
            <li>I was able to brush through with out snagging.</li>
            <li>THE BEST DEEP CONDITIONER.</li>
            <li>This I&#x27;m not so sure about.</li>
            <li>The outcome of using this was okay</li>
            <li>I love the size of it.</li>
            <li>More free stuff from bzzagent!  </li>
            <li>I love love this stuff</li>
            <li>The top comes with a hole covered with paper that you pull off to use it.  </li>
            <li>and this made it more manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so clean and healthy!</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in your hand and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS ONE OF THE BEST OF THE BEST.MY HAIR IS LONG, SILKY, AND NO SIGNS OF DAMAGE...</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, I loved how the creamy texture almost melted into my scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had pretty good hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of a really really sweet coconut</li>
            <li>My stylist has done an incredible job keeping it healthy despite the colorings, but I needed something at home to help keep it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to bzzagent and aussie I got to try this product, and I love it, not expensive and very good quality, one of the top of my list for hair products</li>
            <li>my hair was soooo soft and I was able to run my fingers right through my hair which I must mention both the conditioners and shampoo have excellent slip!</li>
            <li>If I had been shopping for myself, I would have selected Strong (as this variety generally tends to mimic Texturize the best) or Smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product when I received it!</li>
            <li>tried the Aussie \\&quot;3 Minute Miracle Color\\&quot; conditioner, it worked great, smelled good, left my hair significantly easier to deal with that</li>
            <li>I would give this more stars if it weren&#x27;t for the strong scent.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and healthy and it smells great.</li>
            <li>Before buying this product I would want to know if the product would make my hair more manageable most importantly.</li>
            <li>Those things aside, this is probably a great product for someone with different hair needs than my own.</li>
            <li>The best part of it is, this is very cheap compared to other products out there</li>
            <li>I was sent a free sample (From another website) and i liked it so much i decided to purchase another bottle!!!</li>
            <li>The consistency of the conditioner was also nice with a thicker feel so it all got into the hair rather than a more watery consistency that tends to slide right off and into the shower.</li>
            <li>product is very good and affordable, and a great choice for dry hair, for normal hair is more of a once a week treatment</li>
            <li>Though my hair is a bit on the fine side, it also tends to get frizzy in the more humid weather</li>
            <li>It makes my split ended, frayed, fine and tangled hair slightly more manageable and a lot softer.     </li>
            <li>This stuff certainly smells good.</li>
            <li>Very cool.  </li>
            <li>It just took a bit more time to apply because I work in sections with my hair and need a bit more product for full coverage.</li>
            <li>It just took a bit more time to apply because I work in sections with my hair and need a bit more product for full coverage.</li>
            <li>It leaves it shiny, soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair so soft and shiny plus its smells great.</li>
            <li>I was able to try out this product for free through Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>I do not have oily hair by the end of the day like I do when I use most products and if I choose not to wash my hair for a day it&#x27;s still just as smooth as it was the day before.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff leaves my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li>Great value for money, makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth and hydrated..... :)</li>
            <li>I was able to receive this sample for free.</li>
            <li>I bought it thinking it would perfect for deep conditioning my afro-textured hair since I got such great results from the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I wad able to try this product for free</li>
            <li>It really helps and smells good.</li>
            <li>RIGHT HERE IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Normally I wake up and my hair is oily, so this was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t leave this conditioner on for the full three minutes, it will still work wonders!</li>
            <li>The best $4 I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li>After just a couple days my hair is smoother, feels softer, and with just 3 mins in the shower easy.</li>
            <li>Aussie 3munute miracle is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to spread throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>It rinses out easily, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Bottle is extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My comb goes through easily without tangles</li>
            <li>the tangles were coming out so easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to just squeeze out without opening with wet/slippery hands.</li>
            <li>I can easily look like a hippie and</li>
            <li>Container is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I could easily finger</li>
            <li>and it is easy to hold while in the shower.</li>
            <li>The bottle design makes it really easy to use in the shower, I don&#x27;t have to worry about opening up a bottle or dropping the cap or anything like that.</li>
            <li>My hair is quite curly and tangles easily.</li>
            <li>After 3 minutes, it was relatively easy to rinse off.  </li>
            <li>I have used both the moist and strong ones from Aussie.</li>
            <li>I got this as part of a free promotion, but it is definitely worth buying on your own.</li>
            <li>After using it, my hair feels strong</li>
            <li>Too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Though, for the price point, I don&#x27;t see this being any more special than a knock-off pantene conditioner.  </li>
            <li>And the best aspect is its dispenser‚Äîa (ingenious) squeeze bottle with no cap/top to mess with!</li>
            <li>Finally, and most importantly, is how great it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Years of straightening with a flat iron thats who knows how many hundreds of degrees (i straightened my beard once as a joke... and it about melted my face off like the nazi at the end of Indiana Jones LOL...)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the ORIGINAL in the blah cream colored bottle and formulation that conditioned, moisturized and strengthened the hair, but it&#x27;s very close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a tween daughter, like everything else about her, her hair is also changing, she is sweating more and getting more tangles, frizz and even greasy roots while the tips seem fried, I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that can help her without breaking the bank, recently I received an invitation thru Bzzagent to try this product for free, I&#x27;ve have known and loved Aussie brand products for a while</li>
            <li>The dispenser seems to work just fine</li>
            <li>I have armpit length, fine color-treated hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and a lot of products make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>My hair went from frizzy and unmanageable to silky, smooth and easy to style.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to jump the gun too much on a review because I know that shampoos and conditioners can work great at first and</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I love the bold purple color of the bottle and think it stands out on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance and consistency:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>:) It didn&#x27;t really take care of the frizz, but the moisture part was pretty good.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant light scent, soft and creamy in your hand.</li>
            <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair and feeling how soft it was!</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer‚Äã for my curly/wavy hair and works quick for a cheap price, make sure and add the coupon on amazon for some $$ back in your pocket!</li>
            <li>And the best part is, it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down at all!</li>
            <li>This stuff makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I received it for free thanks to Aussie, but I&#x27;d buy it on my own now.  </li>
            <li>After just 1 use I could already tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>IT WAS HUGE FOR ME.</li>
            <li>I used this once and noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>This was part of a bzzagent campaign that I received to try for free, so I figured, what the heck,</li>
            <li>I received Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle Moist for free from the brand to test out and review.</li>
            <li>I just tried the Aussie 3 minute conditioner I got free from BzzAgent</li>
            <li>This three minute moist deep conditioner works great.</li>
            <li>I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and really liked it so much that I purchased another bottle from Amazon..</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky smooth and no tangles.</li>
            <li>I received two bottles of the Aussie three-minute miracle from Bzzagent.com for free.</li>
            <li>I received this free from Aussie through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I got this free from bzzagent and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li>This helps give her smooth, shiny, silky hair.  </li>

            <li>I loved the smell and it definitely made my hair softer!</li>
            <li>Definitely a good drugstore option for a deep conditioner!</li>
            <li>Overall, though, good conditioner.</li>
            <li>All in all, not a bad product.  </li>

            <li>I use to use this all the time years ago before other people caught on that is was really great.</li>
            <li>Well, after a couple times I was able to see a difference, my hair does not only look better now</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizing hair mask I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have tried a variety of much more expensive hair salon brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product and would love to try the &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; next as I&#x27;ve had a lot of breakage since pregnancy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing deep conditioner it makes my hair feel silky smooth and moist</li>
            <li>it goes by quickly).</li>
            <li>However, I think I will likely supplement with a weekly deep conditioning treatment to keep my hair feeling as great as it looks!</li>
            <li>For you ladies out there looking for a quick fix for frizzled ends, this may be the product for you.</li>
            <li>It has left my hair feeling so nice and smooth and silky.</li>

            <li>This conditioner smells okay, but the old Aussie scent was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner left a nice, light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I would like to try some of the other products in the range and see if there is another one that would be a better fit more me especially for such a great price and being readily available in most stores.</li>
            <li>i have tried many conditioners but let me tell you that this one right here is the real deal.</li>
            <li>so it gets tangled pretty easily, so I was excited to find a product that worked very with my hair!</li>
            <li>I got to try it free to try Thanks to being a Bzz Agent and Aussie!</li>
            <li>I got to try this product for free thanks to Aussie!</li>
            <li>I got to test this product for free thanks to Aussie!</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t act like most normal hair.</li>
            <li>but I decided to get my hair bleached and dyed for the very first time ...</li>
            <li>I use this as my normal conditioner and it keeps my hair looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Aussie!</li>
            <li>first off i got this free from bzzagent to test.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice sweet and subtle smell and not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This new conditioner comes in five types:  Moist, Color, Shine, Strong, and Smooth.  </li>
            <li>Got the chance to try the 3 Minute Miracle(moist) free for testing purposes from Aussie and within just one use, my hair felt brand new, soft, shiny &amp; overall healthy!!!.</li>
            <li>I pretty much don&#x27;t know what frizz is anymore, which is a HUGE plus in my book!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fast and easy to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 3 Minute Miracle in Moist about 5 times and find the product to be pretty good when it comes to a daily conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>Aussie 3 minute miracle is super easy to use, I love the bottle dispenser, it only takes 3 minutes</li>
            <li>, it rinses easily and really improves my hair.  </li>
            <li>Intense moisture, washes away easily</li>
            <li>Definitely a good option for people with dry hair.</li>
            <li>First off, I would like to say that I love how the bottle is stored with the opening on the bottom so that there is always conditioner ready to be squeezed out.</li>
            <li>&quot; simply very quickly repairs very damaged</li>
            <li>First of all, I love that I can just do it in the shower without taking any more time than regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>I plan to use it once a week and will definitely be buying more of it!</li>
            <li>My hair is so much softer and smoother with this conditioner!!  </li>
            <li>Most conditioners claim to be the best at moisturizing, but usually fall short of those claims when it comes on to textured hair.</li>
            <li>and this definitely made it more manageable!</li>
            <li>and if I don&#x27;t regularly deep condition my hair it ends up looking dry, so I&#x27;m always on the crusade for the perfect product.</li>

            <li>I also love the way my curls naturally set when I air-dry my hair now.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact you rarely see ads for conditioners featuring women with textured hair.</li>
            <li>When I received my bzzkit ( Free full size bottle to try from bzzagent.com) , I was really hoping for a miracle ;-)  </li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the bottle though.</li>
            <li>Its a shame that since Aussie was looking to revamp their product line they didn&#x27;t take a more natural approach.</li>
            <li>Since Pantene discontinued their fantastic Texturize line, I‚Äôve been searching for the right product to replace it, so I was excited to be included in the new Aussie 3-Minute Miracle conditioner test for BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>So I was very excited to try this, but it really didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use no long waiting times, or need for additional time or steps.</li>
            <li>If there was some great benefit to using this product, such as the extreme moistness described, this might be able to be overlooked.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair less frizzy and amazingly shiny!</li>
            <li>This is the best product ever, although I keep on trying other hair treatments, but  this is the one I always go back too.</li>
            <li>I have used no other conditioner that has given me such great results.</li>
            <li>So, this past weekend, I was able to try Aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle conditioner that I was able to receive for free.</li>
            <li>I ws glad to see that I wan&#x27;t the only one to notice that the new product is not as good as the old one.  </li>
            <li>and she was right</li>
            <li>It rinses out just right, and does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li>The price for this ($2.97 as of this review, with an additional $1 off coupon) on Amazon right now is a STEAL.</li>
            <li>so I said yes right away, I received a sample of the 3 min miracle moist</li>
            <li>(like right now, it&#x27;s $1 off a price of $2...</li>
            <li>many of my natural hair products didn&#x27;t show these results on the first use.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a pleasant slight coconut fragrance.</li>
            <li>It also left a very strong coconut smell.  </li>
            <li>I just recently went platinum blonde and soon experienced the maintenance nightmare after my first at home wash!</li>
            <li>I also noticed when styling for going out, that it was easier to manipulate my hair, I have a decrease in breakage (after 2.5 weeks of use), and I had a bit more shine with more curl definition and less</li>
            <li>I also noticed when styling for going out, that it was easier to manipulate my hair, I have a decrease in breakage (after 2.5 weeks of use), and I had a bit more shine with more curl definition and less</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that this product would help keep my hair nice and moist and soft but that wasn&#x27;t really the case.</li>
            <li>The product is not thick or creamy, and it is light in both texture and smell.</li>
            <li>Now I can save a few dollars and have nice hair every day!</li>
            <li>While 3 minutes may seem like a long time to spend with your conditioner, the nice smell makes it a pleasing experience, with hints of coconut and cocoa butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it smells so good and makes your hair nice and soft ,I&#x27;m not sure about the bottle design but would buy it again!</li>
            <li>It was a product that stood strong and worked better than any other product.  </li>
            <li>I use this every day in place of my regular conditioner?&amp;#34; Since it is a deep conditioner I assumed that it&#x27;s best to just use it 2 - 3 times a week at most to avoid weighing down my hair</li>
            <li>You will not regret spending $3 to achieve amazingly soft, strong hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has just been kind of dry and scraggly ever since, even after getting a hair cut.</li>
            <li>I was totally surprised how easy it was to part my hair.</li>
            <li>Another huge plus, as my hair is color-treated and has some light heat damage from occasional straightening.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look or feel dry and has a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li>My dyed and hot-tooled hair gets a refreshing, moisturizing reprieve from this economical deep conditioner once a week.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I think I used too much because my hair became oily quick.</li>
            <li>Easy for no mess.</li>
            <li>It came very fast to my house</li>
            <li>Soft, full, pretty nice actually ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve colored my hair for eons, and my 10 year old daughter has a ton of fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>For the price it is a decent buy-but do not expect a true hair miracle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved the regular Aussie 3 minute miracle for a long time, but had no idea it came in a special version for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Literally after one use those straight ends began to curl up!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it for the first time, my first impression is that Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle Moist sure does the job of a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>Omg I love this product and totally recommend it.thanks to bzzagent</li>
            <li>It does have water listed as the first ingredient which is a plus&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>first impressions/ what stood out first was the bottle and design.</li>
            <li>I did notice that after incorporating this deep conditioner in my hair care routine, that my hair was noticeably softer and a bit more manageable.</li>
            <li>I did notice that after incorporating this deep conditioner in my hair care routine, that my hair was noticeably softer and a bit more manageable.</li>
            <li>I did not style my hair but my hair stayed soft and frizz free all day.</li>
            <li>Most conditioners make my red hair run.</li>
            <li>Have been using Aussie products for some time and they are consistent in their delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the exception of this oil product, the Aussie 3 minute miracle really was a 3 minute miracle!</li>
            <li>It made my once unmanageable hair, soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>For me this conditioner worked pretty well</li>
            <li>I did like this one better then the garnier frutis one that is around the same price as this.</li>
            <li>However both of them said it smells different  and will update you after couple more</li>
            <li>My regular conditioner works better for me than this did.</li>
            <li>As for the look the conditioner gave my hair, I just could not get a consistent result.  </li>
            <li>Potion #9 leave in conditioner works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Aussie!</li>
            <li>The first time I got USA I could buy this &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I was hoping more from a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I first caught a hint of coconut</li>
            <li>I received this as part of a promotion from Aussie, but for the price, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I love this and it has replaced my regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this Aussie 3 minute miracle moist deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>my hair is moisturized and manageable after the first use.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite deep conditioners out there!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, it&#x27;s not the best that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something I wouldn&#x27;t normally purchase on my own hut will definitely repurchase once I run out.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite deep conditioners.</li>
            <li>most awesome deep conditioner in regular OTC, not sure why stores don&#x27;t sell this anymore</li>
            <li>I received this deep conditioner for free courtesy of bzzagent.com!</li>
            <li>I use this bi weekly-or mix with some almond oil to do some real moisturizing when I need to!</li>
            <li>First I washed me hair with Suave shampoo</li>
            <li>It smells like candy, leaves hair soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the 3 minute miracle moist deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair really soft, shiny, and frizz free.</li>
            <li>, it actually helps define the waves more.</li>
            <li>I love the Aussie 3 minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I feel it really makes my hair softer and easier to manage!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see any difference before styling (my hair is big and frizzy anyway) but after straightening it is softer and more manageable.   </li>
            <li>the first thing I noticed was the opening to the bottle.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more shower products that were convenient to open like Aussie Three Minute Miracle.</li>
            <li>my hair was so light and soft.</li>
            <li>I will say that while this product works wonders on my hair, it doesn&#x27;t do so all by itself so don&#x27;t expect to be able to toss everything out leaving only this in your arsenal.  </li>
            <li>like really really well!</li>
            <li>I think this stuff really is a miracle for my frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>This season my favorite deep conditioner at the drugstore is</li>
            <li>This stuff has made my hair soft and light again.  </li>
            <li>and I really like this stuff!  </li>
            <li>This helps pop my curls and leave the soft, shiny and tangle free.</li>
            <li>First time I used it, I could feel the results.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different deep conditioners and this is the best one!!</li>
            <li>The design is more convenient and will shave a couple seconds off your daily routine at minimum.</li>
            <li>My hair was definitely shinier and more manageable.</li>
            <li>When I used it for the first time, I kept it in my hair for 3 minutes</li>
            <li>:)  Overall</li>
            <li>I was ready to put it to the test!</li>
            <li>By the time I rinsed it out, my hair was incredibly soft, smooth, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was the absolute softest it&#x27;s ever been!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love how my hair feels after using Aussie 3 Minute Miracle, it left my hair feeling stronger than ever.</li>
            <li>and it leaves ur hair so soft and smooth from the moment it touches ur hair.</li>
            <li>In the top left pic my I washed &amp; conditioned my hair with the pureology.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Each of my hair strands is very fine, but is very curly, so it creates a ton of volume, so of makes it seems thicker than it actually is.</li>
            <li>The Scent ‚Äì While it‚Äôs on the coconut/tropical fruity side (think: sunscreen) - and I generally prefer floral ‚Äì it‚Äôs nevertheless pleasant when using the shampoo and leaves your hair smelling gently fragrant the next day.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try this product for free from Bzzagent and the results are exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>really works it leaves my hair really soft and smells great better than other deep conditioners i&#x27;ve tried and trust me me</li>
            <li>I love the squeeze tube bottle and the like vacuum seal it has.</li>
            <li>used the whole line (conditioner, shampoo &amp; 3 minute miracle) starting with the conditioner as my prepoo followed by the shampoo to cleanse followed by the 3 minute miracle to deep condition and my hair has never felt better!!</li>
            <li>This product not only is amazing for your hair but what adds to the benefits at least for me was the great smell and how amazingly soft and refreshed my hair felt after I was done using this!</li>
            <li>Before using this my hair was really frizzy and kind of dry</li>
            <li>Was lucky enough to get some free Aussie 3 Minute Miracle conditioning product from BzzAgent</li>
            <li>Much like all the other Aussie products it smells absolutely amazing and is so worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is very wasy to open and the packaing is super easy to store and use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pleasant and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS AND HAVE REALLY BEEN ENJOYING THE EXTRA QUIET TIME I GET IN THE BATHROOM.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this product through bzzagent promotions and after one use my hair is soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>It did provide a nice amount of slip, but I&#x27;ve tried other conditioners ([[ASIN:B00GOQFOD2</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I normally use high end or sulfate free shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so moisturizing that it&#x27;s already replaced about 3 hair products since I don&#x27;t need to do much else to make my hair look and feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and leaves your hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it helps relieve my dry scalp and keeps my hair looking soft and silky for up to 24 hours.</li>
            <li>When using this product and letting my hair air dry, I find that my hair will more predictably go towards waves/loose curls with good volume and no frizz!&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>I used this and didn&#x27;t think much of it until later during the day when I thought to myself, &amp;#34;wow, my hair feels super light + healthy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Soft shiny hair with a clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a quick and easy fix to dry, frizz-prone hair.</li>
            <li>However this is a really good deep conditioner, for a low price.</li>
            <li>The Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner leaves the hair feeling very flexible and smooth!</li>
            <li>, if I love it so much, why did I give it only 4 stars?  </li>
            <li>this completely brought my hair back to life, it&#x27;s super soft, moisturized and healthy!</li>
            <li>The fragrant conditioner is rich, creamy and works through the hair never weighing it down and leaving it full of volume, detangled and full of life.</li>
            <li>Makes my super processed bleached hair extremely soft!</li>
            <li>I bought the \\&quot;Aussie 3 minute miracle\\&quot; conditioner because my hair needed help quick and this was within my budget, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting much more than average results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since 2010 with positive results of hydration, softness, silkiness and shine.</li>
            <li>My hair was very smooth once dry and the fragrance was like being on a tropical island.</li>
            <li>There is also a great scent left behind that I love.</li>
            <li>This awesome Aussie conditioner gave live back to my dead mane!</li>
            <li>As mentioned earlier, my hair can go pretty easily between wavy and straight.</li>
            <li>I left the conditioner in for about 3 minutes and rinsed it - easy</li>
            <li>, my hair is SUPER soft, and shiny too...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it after every shampoo, maybe once a week, twice a week in the winter when my hair is more dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>My hair feels a lot better and not so dry.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use you just turn over the bottle and squeeze, no cap to open.</li>
            <li>and in just 3 easy minutes, I have moisture restored back into my hair.</li>
            <li>The bottle design makes it easy to get all the conditioner till the last drop!</li>
            <li>i left it in for about 3-5 mins and once I rinsed it out my hair felt better than my normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>Although this conditioner left my hair feeling silky and easy to manage, It also made my hair fall out.</li>
            <li>The scent is slightly different that the normal version, but still appealing.  </li>
            <li>, my dry hair will never feel silky), and more manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and easy to use, you just leave it in your hair for 3 minutes before rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>This deep conditioner is easy to use and takes just 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Between the baby and my three year old and my full time job though, I just don&#x27;t have time to do much for it.</li>
            <li>I love trying deep conditioners, so I was excited to try Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioning Treatment thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Aussie Moist is my new hair friend!!</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a good travel product (Something you take on vacation) because it works fast but for long term use I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those with my hair type.</li>
            <li>My hair feels super soft after I rinse this out, and very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try it out since my hair is fairly dry and damaged.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Honing in on individual hair needs and selecting from their array of products always yields fine results.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or weighed down after use but clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am a BzzAgent and thanks to Aussie, I received a free product trial of Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner</li>

            <li>I DEFINITELY will buy this product on a regular basis because of how amazing this Aussie product leaves my hair and my daughters</li>
            <li>The white bottom part of the bottle where the condition is dispensed from looks a bit cheap - it reminds me of a factory sample as opposed to the finished product.</li>
            <li>After the time had passed, I washed the conditioner out and didn&#x27;t really feel any difference just upon washing it out.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it</li>
            <li>I received  this deep conditioner on behalf of Aussie to try out for free.</li>

            <li>I really wish they would stop monkeying around with something that just worked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gentle on my hair color.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>There is no cap; it&#x27;s a straight squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li>I did notice it is much smoother</li>
            <li>Its also really managable</li>
            <li>This 3 minute conditioner really moisturizes your hair.  </li>
            <li>The hair is very supple.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend it!</li>
            <li>But that wouldn&#x27;t matter if it didn&#x27;t work; luckily, it really does.</li>

            <li>and it worked well for that too, especially with the light coconut scent it has.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re unsure whether to buy this or not, it wasn&#x27;t that much money from what I recall, I would give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li>I have really chemically damaged hair and this works wonders for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve over processed my hair so much</li>
            <li>THANKS AUSSIE.</li>
            <li>TO HOW MUCH BUILD UP IT CAUSED.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this, and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li>I am on my way to repairing my hair thanks to Aussie 3 minute miracle and to Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li>Thanks Aussie 3 minute miracle.</li>
            <li>, I have very frizzy and wavy hair</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>After using Aussie 3-minute miracle once, my hair looked and felt much softer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very committed seller</li>
            <li>This conditioner works really well</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the scent is too much, and too fruity for me.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bzzagent</li>
            <li>This treatment really works.</li>
            <li>This conditioner not only smells fabulous</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t linger that much after you rinse it out</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;ve never tried the Aussie brand, but was always curious.</li>
            <li>Last night when washing - my hair felt silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks to bzzagent and aussie</li>
            <li>so you dont feel like you have too much product in your hair.  </li>
            <li>This Aussie 3 Minute Miracle really is a miracle.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, the bottle design is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I only had to use this once and put it in my hair for 3 minutes and it completely transformed my hair into silky, smooth, amazingness!</li>
            <li>, the bottle is very convenient and well designed because the dispenser is on the bottom allowing gravity to work in your favor, the product has a fruity kind of smell that appeals to young women, it is white and creamy and easily slides thru the hair, it has easy to follow instructions, and calls for applying on clean wet her and letting it work for 3 min, conviniently songs last about that long, so</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that the bottle is upside down which I love.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got naturally curly hair, and I live in an exceptionally humid climate (it was over 80% humidity INSIDE at work the other day).</li>
            <li>but didn&#x27;t live up to the stellar reviews.</li>
            <li>I have tried other deep conditioners in the past, but thanks to Aussie and BzzAgent, I was able to try this product for free and fell in love!</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner as it leaves my hair, I believe, much smoother than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It smells good, not like mothballs or aqua net like other companies stuff has..</li>
            <li>I left it one my hair for three minutes as the bottle instructs and I love how soft and full looking it has left my hair.</li>
            <li>After I rinsed it out, my daughter&#x27;s hair retained moisture and had way more manageability than when I&#x27;ve used other products.  </li>
            <li>I use it myself and mostly on my daughter, who has extremely curly gair that is prone to dryness..</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t notice the scent to be overwhelmingly coconut as other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li>, it is different and unique bottle.</li>
            <li>What was once all over the place, dry and really frizzy is now soft and has added some much needed moisture that most conditioners just can&#x27;t do for me.</li>
            <li>Last but not least, I want to thank Aussie and BzzAgent for letting me try this product for free.</li>
            <li>The first thing I will say is that it absolutely did make my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li>have long, super thick, color-treated hair and my ends look dry, so I&#x27;m always on the hunt for the perfect conditioner.</li>
            <li>is one specially made to keep hair color longer especially if you highlight or color your hair.</li>
            <li>After a short blow dry, my hair feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It also kept my hair frizz free when I had a stretched style, like a curlformer set.</li>
            <li>My hair felt smooth but not &#x27;soft&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the product since my hair was straight and limp.</li>
            <li>First, I miss the old Aussie scent.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take it ALL out, but MOST of it, and cuts down on time.</li>
            <li>I thought this would weigh it down more.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without it !</li>
            <li>So even though your hands are wet or slippery, it is easy to handle the bottle, get the product out and tend to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When dry, your hair is smooth and has a sheen.  </li>
            <li>I think this would be better for people with slightly thinner hair than mine.</li>
            <li>I am now able to comb through my hair without losing half of it to knots that need to be worked out.</li>
            <li>It was easy to comb out and wasn&#x27;t tangly when wet.</li>
            <li>I love how affordable this product is and how I don&#x27;t have to spend a ton of money on a deep conditioner to get the same results.</li>
            <li>(I avoided my scalp since the richness of conditioners tend to break me out, but that wasn&#x27;t particular to this product.)</li>
            <li>I have such a problem with tangles that I have to constantly work to keep my hair healthy if I want to have my hair just over soldier length.</li>
            <li>However, the product has enough enough plusses (and is so affordable) that I would try Strong or Smooth next to give the line another go.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use this, as well as other Aussie products, such as their Hair Insurance leave in conditioner spray, and my hair mostly behaves itself!</li>
            <li>My hair stayed nice and soft but when humidity hit I ended up with a puffball and then my hair dried out.</li>
            <li>I also love how it is so simple to use and only requires one step.</li>
            <li>the price, it‚Äôs done a decent job of keeping my hair ‚Äúmoist.‚Äù</li>
            <li>Hair lacks softness: One of the only cons that I&#x27;ve had with using this product is that while my hair LOOKS fantastic, it&#x27;s not as soft as I would like.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t great for a quick shower, you definitely have to leave it in for the 3 minutes for it to work, which isn&#x27;t convenient all the time.</li>
            <li>I do have highlights so my color was &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Many months later, I use it on an irregular basis and a deep conditioner</li>
            <li>its like a mess- proof top.</li>
            <li>It is quite thick and coats your hair easily, meaning you don&#x27;t need a huge amount, but washes out easily also and does not leave my hair looking or feeling weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li>I loved the faint coconut smell of this product right away.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after just one use and would even compare its effects to high priced salon brands.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It definitely isn&#x27;t like a hair treatment at the salon, (which is the best, and leaves my hair silky soft and moisturized, but it is expensive as heck), but for its price, it worked VERY well for my 3b/c hair.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>rinsing, I was so surprised by how easily this conditioner rinsed out of the hair and yet how wonderfully soft it left my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I‚Äôve tried better deep conditioners ‚Äî and paid the extra cost for it too ‚Äî Aussie‚Äôs 3 Minute Miracle is a great affordable option for everyday deep conditioning and gives your tresses that extra bit of attention if you overly manhandle it with coloring, blow-drying, curling, straightening, etc.</li>
            <li>I began using this deep conditioner and the first use I felt and saw a difference!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have a bunch of little stray strands on top of my head</li>
            <li>The most bothersome thing to me about this little thing is the smell.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make it soft or healthier but it did make it much easier to de tangle and unless your willing to pay major bucks</li>
            <li>I have been using this for the last 10 years, I have very fine dry hair and live in the tropics.</li>
            <li>I have found that Natural 7 Oil - Argan Oil - from Proclaim works very well.  </li>
            <li>It was amazing to my normally, frizzy, thick hair.</li>
            <li>Really makes a difference , leaves hair feeling soo soft.</li>
            <li>My hair felt smooth and hydrated while wet.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t however do much for my frizziness; it reduced it but didn&#x27;t completely get rid of it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always on top of my head in a messy bun based on my work.</li>
            <li>This morning, I shampooed my hair like normal and then used the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist conditioner for 2 minutes, 45 seconds like the bottle said.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: It is definitely worth trying because no two individuals are the same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: It is definitely worth trying because no two individuals are the same.</li>
            <li>I love that it just takes a few minutes as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first time using it, I noticed my hair was much softer the next day.  </li>
            <li>Depending on how long I waited to use my hair dryer, or even (as a night-shower-er) how many hours I was awake after blow drying, I got different looks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and it seems like my hair looks and feels better after I style.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the normal Aussie smell.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s normally frizzy, and</li>
            <li>To the point of normal hair.</li>
            <li>So many products out there leave my hair feeling limp or oily or fried out after conditioning, but NOT Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle.</li>
            <li>Shampoo your hair as normal, then apply the 3 Minute Miracle ... and proceed with your showering duties.  </li>
            <li>it would still benefit those with normal- greasy hair</li>
            <li>I dried and styled my hair and love how it looks and feels.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try something new for my dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I leave it on over night and rinse out in the morning, makes your hair lovely and soft , and does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>and when I blow dry my hair, it is silky soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I moved to Colorado a few years ago and the dry climate has not been good to my hair.</li>
            <li>This product works great with my long, super thick, and often dry hair.</li>
            <li>I just adjusted the amount I used the next time (a quarter size) and it worked just right.</li>
            <li>It does help tame down the frizz and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I got this item free from BZZ Agent and I never really heard of using an Aussie Product on natural hair, but this worked WONDERS!  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes really well but rinses without leaving a heavy residue on my hair (my hair is fine)</li>
            <li>I was knot and tangle free even while wet!</li>
            <li>My hair also normally frizzes in humidity, working in NYC and all, and I noticed that it really does not frizz as much on the days I use my deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is truly my new go-to hair care product that I just cant live without.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I live in the desert</li>
            <li>I cant live without it</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m still a fan of this new version.  </li>
            <li>I am leery to new hair products because my curly hair is so unruly that I never know what&#x27;s going to work and</li>
            <li>The consistency of the conditioner was not watered down and also not too thick - easy to spread and made it very easy to detangle my hair with my fingers.</li>
            <li>Of course, it&#x27;s almost cheap enough in stores to get a new bottle for trips and just throw away the extra, but that feels so wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As stated in the directions (and name), I leave this conditioner on clean wet hair for 3 minutes and let the miracles start working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was suffering from super dry hair after having a baby.</li>
            <li>i tried this product hoping to see an improvement in my dry hair and luckily it worked.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this in the future, but it&#x27;s nice as an everyday conditioner.</li>
            <li>After just one use, my dry, bleached highlights became super soft and so manageable!</li>
            <li>After the three minutes was up, I rinsed my hair and it felt very soft.</li>
            <li>I have 3 children who keep me very busy</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry hair and with one use my hair was left so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I was able to glide the comb through my hair with very little tangling.</li>
            <li>WOW, was I ever pleasantly surprised!!</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry hair, thanks to using heat products while styling.</li>
            <li>My hair is not thick but not thin and very dry at the ends due to coloring and highlights, but decently healthy otherwise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This provides a great conditioning treatment for much less than other deep conditioners.</li>
            <li>Although fragrances can be drying , it is listed as the 7th ingredient which means compared to the first or second ingredient it doesn&#x27;t have as much.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Three minutes in the shower for a week of soft, shiny hair!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I saw an instant boost in shine and hydration.</li>
            <li>Overall the product works pretty well, but I think there is room for improvement.  </li>
            <li>Overall the product does work pretty well and is inexpensive compared to others products out there on the market.  </li>
            <li>Well, I must say that I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Not only did this conditioner deliver 24 hour shine after only one treatment, it left my hair ten times stronger and made my hair feel healthy again!</li>
            <li>In fact, it left my hair feeling lighter and much cleaner than ever before!</li>
            <li>I am disappointed in this product because it has a wonderful price point ($2.99-$3.19) at Walmart and Target, so it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li>My hair always comes out soft and shiny with a normal conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other deep conditioners that cost wayyy more than this one</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well this worked!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft &amp; shiny!</li>
            <li>I can surely say that I will not be using any other deep conditioner!</li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft and does reduce frizz when out the shower!</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and shiny after using this product and I hope to never be without it!</li>
            <li>The first thing a person notices with this conditioner is the smell, it is nothing short of heavenly.  </li>
            <li>After trying countless deep conditioners and none of them working like they said they would (my hair would either be greasy or weighted down), I was pleasantly surprised by how great Aussie 3 minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner worked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you have dry thirsty hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner smooths on easily and provides the moisture weight that keeps really thick, dry hair smooth and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t feel like it really helped my hair anymore than a normal non deep conditioner would.</li>
            <li>I just would not be able to use it regularly in the winter without my hair getting weighed down.</li>
            <li>This sorts out the tangle mess and makes my hair feel smooth like silk.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that it offers 3x moisture and will completely restore your hair in just 3 minutes!</li>
            <li>It is not a time saver for your average shower, but the benefits of a salon-like moisturizing treatment at home is worth it!</li>
            <li>I used to use this product a long time ago when there was only one version of the three minute miracle conditioner, but I&#x27;m so glad they&#x27;ve expanded the line to suit different hair types.  </li>
            <li>After I fried my color treated hair with a flat iron (*smh*)</li>
            <li>/&gt;After letting my hair air-dry, I could definitely see that my strands were less frizzy and they felt more hydrated and smoother.</li>
            <li>I love that I can get a deep conditioning treatment without any heat and in less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>However, I did not find that it was any more moisture-enhancing than any typical deep conditioner sold at the supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, but also very dry due to coloring and highlights.  </li>
            <li>and it really makes my hair super soft after I blow dry and flat iron it.  </li>
            <li>but I feel like my hair is significantly softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>Now, again, I had never had my hair dyed before, though I did happen to know that bleaching was hard on your hair having grown up in the 90&#x27;s and witnessing the Eminem and JTL bleached hair look-alikes (or &#x27;not so&#x27; look-alikes in most cases) ...  </li>
            <li>I have used a million conditioners by now and several different types of deep conditioning options like oils and other deep conditioners in general and nothing has ever felt so great in my hair as this.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to be dry and brittle especially since I use a relaxer in my hair, so I was really excited Bzzagent picked me to try Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist.</li>
            <li>I never am able to run my fingers through wet hair and need a wide tooth comb but with this, I had no issues.</li>
            <li>(These are just things I noticed and am bringing up in the interest of giving a complete review, but they in no way affected my thoughts on the product itself.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The instructions don&#x27;t state how frequently the product could/should be used.</li>
            <li>makes your hair shine and soft</li>
            <li>As a natural curly/kinky hair girl moisture is everything.</li>
            <li>Once i rinsed it, my hair felt so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>and it make my hair feel soft and look shiny,  </li>
            <li>My curls are so soft and bouncy</li>
            <li>, thats all you really can expect from a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>I even started using it on my 8 and 9 year old.</li>
            <li>If you are either getting ready to color your hair, or you&#x27;ve just colored it, then this is definitely the product for you!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle, and for any of you with natural curls, you know that nothing IS.</li>
            <li>My hair is double processed and heat styled which means it&#x27;s really damaged.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>My hair stayed soft and shiny all day so that I could not stop looking in the mirror and receiving non stop compliments from friends and coworkers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my hair managable on busy mornings when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time</li>
            <li>I can always rely on it to take all my knots out while I&#x27;m in the shower and when I get out I can still feel my hair is moisturized and soft but not heavy or oily feeling.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly 3b type hair, I need moisture in order to even look semi-presentable.</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for soft, silky, manageable hair, give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It left my hair ready to be styled without using anything else on my hair.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how soft my hair was after I used this.</li>
            <li>When the three minutes are up, I rinse and my hair is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Just directly squeeze into your hand and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes it soft and silky like it used to be</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It left my hair very macil i recommend</li>
            <li>Well not with this line, my hair remained soft while drying</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this soft in years.</li>
            <li>With curly natural hair, this makes things easier for me.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel soft and silky</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t completely take away the frizz</li>
            <li>Claiming to fix split ends is a feat that nearly all conditions claim and none follow through on, even $1,000 carotene treatments do not even fix split ends.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However after rinsing it out, my hair didn&#x27;t really feel deep conditioned and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Your hair will be soft and shiny and smell delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were in complete</li>
            <li>ON MY 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER.</li>
            <li>MY HAIR IS SOFT AND MANAGEABLE</li>
            <li>I received this conditioner courtesy of Aussie for testing purposes, and I&#x27;m honestly surprised at myself for not trying it sooner.</li>
            <li>I have been using Aussie 3-minute miracle on and off since I was 13 years old and am now 34.</li>
            <li>so that when I&#x27;m ready to condition my hair, it will come out with a simple squeeze.</li>
            <li>Using it too frequently causes my scalp to have build up and become itchy.</li>
            <li>I really like this deep conditioner!</li>
            <li>I have natural 4a type hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have naturally wavy / curly hair...</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft and conditioned</li>
            <li>This conditioner made my hair -- including the damaged part -- soft and shiny and oh-so-manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair feels a bit softer but only repeated usage will tell how miraculous this product really is.</li>
            <li>It only takes a few minutes for this product to begin working it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li>But Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner is worth the extra couple of minutes I spend in the shower!</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve splurged here and there on expensive salon-only products, and this 3 Minute Miracle stands its own - at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>bottle is smaller than I expected, but given that you aren&#x27;t expected to use the conditioning treatment every day, it will last a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the thick texture consistency.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and how thick it is.</li>
            <li>I have tried some expensive items to make my hair look good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to find a conditioner that makes it feel healthy and like its getting back to its normal strength and this product is doing just that!  </li>
            <li>She has a thick mane of hair and stated that this is one of the only products she has found that makes her hair silky smooth with no frizz or tangles which allows for her hairbrush to glide right through.  </li>
            <li>It took a lot longer than 3 minutes to clean up the mess.</li>
            <li>I normally have very frizzy, dry hait since I color my hair</li>
            <li>i let my hair air dry just to see and feel the exact effects of the product.</li>
            <li>I also love the unique squeeze bottle that isn&#x27;t annoying like other caps, it doesn&#x27;t have a top</li>
            <li>WHERE LESS DRY :)</li>
            <li>At first I really disliked the smell, but after a few uses I have grown to love it.</li>
            <li>However, when I went to dry my hair, I had very minimal hair come out, leaving me with a clean bathroom sink!</li>
            <li>I have long, thick hair that I like to be smooth and sleek, but which can turn wavy and frizzy if I‚Äôm not using the right hair regimen.  </li>
            <li>The product is pretty good but the packaging is bad.  </li>
            <li>that demands style or an up-do) hair that has a tendency to dry out fast, and this product really helps bring back control, shine, and softness.</li>
            <li>This product is not the same as the older version.  </li>
            <li>Most of em, even salon-grade products, have left my hair looking limp or greasy after using them (even when I use a teensy bit!)</li>
            <li>Thanks Aussie! will definitely purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>I have my roots dyed monthly and typically use a super moisturizing conditioner, but I decided to try this instead.</li>
            <li>There are other benefits to the conditioner, it is thicker than most other conditioners.</li>
            <li>Overall, this conditioner did a decent job of conditioning my hair, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away.</li>
            <li>My hair is super long now so after my shower its super hard to get a brush through the ends.</li>
            <li>The other reviewers were right.</li>
            <li>My Wife and my young daughter both are very lucky to have thick hair .</li>
            <li>the cheap (Suave brand) conditioner I usually use.</li>
            <li>Just be careful that you don&#x27;t squeeze out too much at one time!</li>
            <li>when i go outside, my hair does not get fizzy as it normally does.</li>
            <li>I have dry and damaged hair gets staticy in certain environments.</li>
            <li>So in the end, whether you have thin, fine hair like mine, or really thick and coarse hair, I recommend it to everybody who wants shiny, silky hair without interrupting their busy lifestyles or breaking the bank :)</li>
            <li>I have tried everything under the sun to get my unruly hair to calm down.</li>
            <li>I really did like the dispenser at the bottom of the bottle and find it much easier to get the right amount of product with less mess.</li>
            <li>and it has really made my hair smooth and no fly aways.</li>
            <li>Additionally my ends no longer look dry  thanks to Aussie 3 minute miracle and to Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li>You could easily do the same with your current conditioner (just leave it onto to damp, not dripping wet hair after shampoo for 3+ minutes) and achieve similar results.</li>
            <li>As the mom of 4, I&#x27;m constantly in a rush to get in and out of the shower as fast as possible.</li>
            <li>It not only moisturize my hair but also leaves my hair straight and shine only in 5 minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>Not only is it fast, it actually works.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling a little heavier than my daily conditioner but that could be what also left it feeling better conditioned.  </li>
            <li>every extra minute is SO helpful for this busy working mom of three!</li>
            <li>I would still be willing to try one of the other ones just not the moist one again.</li>
            <li>I can easily take a trip to my local drugstore and pick up one or a few!</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin hair and this product left it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I received two 8-ounce bottles for free for the test, and by the end of the test (a little less than two months later, washing my hair 3-4 times/week), I was just finishing the first bottle.  </li>
            <li>What I mean by this is that for my hair texture I need a little more than 3 minutes because I don&#x27;t feel like its enough for full penetration especially as a stand alone product.</li>
            <li>What I mean by this is that for my hair texture I need a little more than 3 minutes because I don&#x27;t feel like its enough for full penetration especially as a stand alone product.</li>
            <li>hair is very dry and damaged, and using this just twice a week really rejuvenates it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple quick and easy, it would be silly not to use it regularly!!!</li>
            <li>I found this to be a great conditioner, but a little heavy for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>i tend to have pretty dry hair that gets really frizzy when i don&#x27;t use leave-in conditioners or other such conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>I have used nearly every deep condition or dangler on the market.  </li>
            <li>Aussie&#x27;s 3-Minute Miracle is by far the HOLY GRAIL of deep conditioners in my books.</li>
            <li>This will definitely replace my old conditioner</li>
            <li>and I have natural mixed hair.</li>
            <li>Hair feels so soft for days after and you only have to use it once a week for the results to continue.</li>
            <li>I never really conditioned my hair much, but now I do it weekly.</li>
            <li>Really actually truly fixed my puffy summer hair.</li>
            <li>For naturally curly hair, this is my life saver and one of the only ways I can comb through my hair after a shower.</li>
            <li>my hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy and tangled and my hair felt conditioned and soft for at last 3 days.</li>
            <li>My ends were super dry, my crown was dry and I needed a deep moisturizing</li>
            <li>It was so soft and bouncy once I left the salon!</li>
            <li>Ive barely started using this as well.</li>
            <li>Usually, while drying my hair, it just falls out in my fingers leaving me with what feels like a full head of hair all over my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>The fact that the cap is on the bottom of the container is kind of weird, however, as opening the container means to have to juggle the dispensed product, the cap and the bottle all at once.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: Recently had the opportunity to try the newly introduced version for color-treated hair and it did equally as well on my home-dyed hair.</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit skeptical about trying this product, just because it is not a brand I am  familiar with for my hair type</li>
            <li>A little bit tropical, a little bit floral, and not at all overwhelming like some products can</li>
            <li>The price is right as well, considering how much more expensive other hair products are.</li>
            <li>Okay so I am African American with transitioning hair (thick, and coarse, curly hair with a lot of damaged ends) and I was recommended to try this because of the price.</li>
            <li>It instantly transformed my hair from dry to moist, and I love how it only took a few minutes in the shower to achieve!</li>
            <li>once my hair dried it was silky smooth and so soft without feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li>I‚Äôd easily buy this again for the few dollars it cost, but I look forward to trying their other formulas: Shine and Strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips</li>
            <li>Honestly, I must say I&#x27;m a little skeptical with those highly rated products which are usually recommended on fashion and hair blogs, but this one really works.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it has, but if you really let it stay in your hair for at least 3 min, you will feel how smooth it will</li>
            <li>I used it on my daughter&#x27;s 4c coarse natural hair and it instantly became easier to detangle and provided a lot of slip.  </li>
            <li>Immediately I washed my hair and blow dry it, I noticed that my hair was very soft.</li>
            <li>I normally have very dry hair</li>
            <li>No other deep conditioner...not even overnight olive oil treatments, can compare to 3 minutes with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have thin very damaged hair from frequent chemical treatments and daily hot tools.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like other conditioners</li>
            <li>After dryer, although hair looked somewhat shiny, it was still pretty rough and dry</li>
            <li>I already get greasy roots and straw like strands the day after I wash/condition, but this stuff has made my hair feel so soft and my roots are no longer flat and greasy the next day!</li>
            <li>It always leaves my long hear soft  </li>
            <li>When my hair dried it was shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a fantastic conditioner that makes your hair look like you just had an expensive treatment done, try Aussie&#x27;s new 3 Minute Miracle Moist conditioner and you will never use another brand again!</li>
            <li>It used to dry very frizzy and you could tell it was dry just by looking at it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased a lot of deep conditioners in my life to maintain my healthy-looking long mane, so of course I have high expectations with each new product I try ‚Äî comparing and contrasting all the different brands, from the cheap to uber expensive.</li>
            <li>I particularly suffer from extreme breakage each time I touch my hair.</li>
            <li>also when i used heat tool,s my hair kept a nice shine when usually my hair is dull.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m right or not.</li>
            <li>but once I went to dry my hair it still felt really soft.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is much thicker than typical conditioners.  </li>
            <li>This is obviously a powerful, concentrated deep conditioner, because a little of it went a long way.  </li>
            <li>Oil is hard to use because a little bit goes a long way and some people may not have such dry hair like I do, and need oil over a dangler or a good deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>After rinsing it definitely left my hair soft and after blow drying my hair was much fuller than it usually is.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally big, the type of big that&#x27;s seen on Pantene&#x27;s &#x27;Don&#x27;t hate me because I&#x27;m beautiful&#x27; commercial/ads.</li>
            <li>my hair was so dry from last winter and after trying the Aussie conditioner my hair is so soft and manageable</li>
            <li>Received a free sample of the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle through #BzzAgent and, with my thick, dry hair, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li>If this comment or any of my other efforts work to get them to go back to the older version, then I would definitely give the product 5 stars!</li>
            <li>In the winter, when my hair gets really dry, I sometimes scrunch a little dab into my ends, during the day and my hair drinks it right up and spruces my curls back to live.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Remember, I have textured hair which means my hair is tightly coiled and with that comes fragile, really unmanageable hair on wash day.</li>
            <li>I have short fine hair and usually conditioner Waze my hair down.</li>
            <li>after one song she rinsed her hair, it was easy to rinse but left the hair feeling a bit slippery, of course this could be attributed to my soft water, I dried her hair and it looked healthy, no frizz and manageable, a bit less shiny than usual and a bit heavy, so I would recommend this product for after swimming or exercising or when your hair needs extra moisturizing but not for everyday use because it appears to me that it would cause a bit of buildup.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have thick and coarse hair, so most products are a let down, but not this!</li>
            <li>This can be both good and bad.</li>

            <li> I loved that it rinsed off without leaving any residue or hassle.</li>
            <li> I do recommend it for any naturalists it also good when detangling you hair</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The smell is great too, nothing too strong, it smells tropical and fruity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They both tried the conditioner and said it was very good and had a fresh and silky feeling.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing............</li>
            <li> It was absolutley amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and just what my hair needed.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and made my hair feel smooth, silky, shiny and allowed me to still style as I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> It makes my feel like it was done at the salon, it feels the softest ever and the silkiest and it also smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This is really an amazing product.</li>
            <li> However, I will say that Aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle does come with an amazingly convenient bottle design, and nice scent.</li>

            <li> It is great product at a fantastic price</li>
            <li> IT FEELS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair conditioners on the market, it&#x27;s every bit as good as something that you might buy from a hair salon but much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I really liked it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving</li>
            <li> It has a nice twist and squeeze feature with grip indentations on the sides which makes for a nice hold.</li>
            <li> Now that I mix my own from Sally&#x27;s(no longer in a box)</li>
            <li> Thanks Aussie for making a great product!</li>
            <li> I found this conditioner when i was searching the hair dyes and someone said this was gonna be your best friend after dying your hair too much</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of Aussie&#x27;s signature scent for it&#x27;s products which is kind of tropical.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Really softens your hair and smells great!!!!</li>
            <li> I was worried about it because my hair is very coily, but this is definitely great for all hair type!</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> and while I loved the TGIF line I love Aussie</li>
            <li> The opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend always tells me my hair smells nice.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product and so happy it found me :)</li>
            <li> I also love the smell of this product, it smells good and tropical but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It feels so nice</li>
            <li> Yep, I&#x27;ll go with the $1 and go get me some nice vodka with the rest to make fancy cocktails while my hair smells like the beach.</li>
            <li> but on it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> I like how effective this was for me.</li>
            <li> Nice not having to remove tops or flip up caps and then remember to replace them.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see that Aussie introduced a version for color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> The older version was awesome!  </li>
            <li> Wonderful, fragrant smell, very-creamy texture and feel, and a new kind of upside-down twist-off dispenser.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product for free from the amazing BZZagent!</li>
            <li> normally I use hairspray to keep the frizz away and my hair was perfectly curly bouncy and no frizz.</li>
            <li> Great smelling and hair full of life....</li>
            <li> It makes your hair healthy, strong, shiny, voluminous and full of awesome smell.</li>
            <li> I loved how strong my hair felt afterwards as well.</li>
            <li> It smells pleasant and leaves my hair feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best one out there, but for the price, it gets the job done and leaves your hair very soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and the ends look awesome!</li>
            <li> My hair tangles very easy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to squeeze.</li>
            <li> It also comes out of the bottle very easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong compared to the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Even the more severe damage I have is looking better!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was how good it smelled!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome &amp; leaves my hair feeling soft !</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair that tangles very very easily!  </li>
            <li> Once I get my hair coated, it doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of it, it does mix nicely with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I get my hair coated, it doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of it, it does mix nicely with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this many years ago and liked it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioning product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> just squeeze.it leaves my hair so smooth and smells so good.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it&#x27;s still great!</li>
            <li> For the most part, I just give into the whimsy of the &amp;#34;hair gods&amp;#34; and let them decide what kind of hair day it will be.</li>
            <li> 3 minute miracle is by far one of the best conditioners I have used!</li>
            <li> My opinions are truthful and my own.</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised with this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used so far.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it leaves your hair feeling soft, shiny, and manageable for days after using it.</li>
            <li> It looks silky smooth and it doesn&#x27;t have frizz to it anymore plus the conditioner smells really good.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a cool coconut drink on a nice tropical getaway!</li>
            <li> I loved the smooth texture of the conditioner in my hair.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best products i tested from them so far.</li>
            <li> I got to try it free as part of BzzAgent, a sample review site, and I loved it.</li>
            <li> My stylist made sure she instructed me on home care ( she did an amazing cut &amp; color on my hairüòç)</li>
            <li> This morning my hair still smells wonderful and feels soft.</li>
            <li> This easy 3 minute formula makes my hair a lot smoother and shiny!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best products that I have ever used because my hair has never felt so silky and has never been so manageable without any frizz, even on the most humid of days!</li>
            <li> Her remained soft and moist and was more manageable after washing which made me very happy.</li>
            <li> I love Aussie products, and for the most part it is because I think they smell amazing.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner also smells really good, kinda like coconut and leaves my hair smelling clean.</li>
            <li> the promotion provided me with 2 bottles.. one of which was taken by one of my relatives who enjoyed the product just as much as I did when she tried it while applying it to my daughters mane.its definitely a great product and the price for what you get is the icing on top!</li>
            <li> Can we first mention how great this smells?</li>
            <li> when leaving for more than 3 minutes it gives lots of shine to my hair and i have very fine medium dye medium blond hair with split end.</li>
            <li> First time using it , and I&#x27;m in love lol.</li>
            <li> it.it smells super good</li>
            <li> I recommend this as a good quick fix when you don&#x27;t have time to use a hair mask and sit in the shower for 15-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> This product tames it, makes it softer, and in an all around better condition.  </li>
            <li> With regards to the scent, personally I enjoyed it smells of tropical fruits</li>
            <li> But after using 3 Minute Miracle Moist my hair felt like it had more substance to it - hydration</li>
            <li> I love the scent of the product and how it gives my hair a natrual shine.</li>
            <li> This product does have dimethicone which is a non soluble silicone that can cause build up on hair and many people warn against it.</li>
            <li> I do find that conditioners that are a bit more watery are easier to apply to my hair.</li>
            <li> But I will make this product apart of my hair routine because I was satisfied with my results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I will make this product apart of my hair routine because I was satisfied with my results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to try this product for a while, so when I was offered to try it free through BzzAgent, I jumped on it!</li>
            <li> I love the packaging.</li>
            <li> Glad I got the chance to start using this again</li>
            <li> One of my college roommates absolutely love this stuff and she would lend me her conditioner on occasion.</li>
            <li> And I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product is just OK.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Everything was ok.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I was able to sample this product, courtesy of Aussie.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more manageable</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for everyone out there who needs a hair product that really does what it claims, it is also a great value.</li>
            <li> i love this product :)</li>
            <li> It smells FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> Thank you to Bzzagent and Aussie for letting me try the product for free!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the smell of coconuts!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> and I love smelling it on my hair all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth, touchable, silky self!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this moisture treatment.</li>
            <li> Love the way they designed the bottle no opening the top</li>
            <li> Wifey claims that combining hair oil treatment such as Argan Oil of Morocco for example after this conditioning provides her with perfect style and control.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy more after this.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; one is much better than this.</li>
            <li> we love it.</li>
            <li> She tried and fall in love, now always when I go to USA</li>
            <li> Make sure you remove the sticker on the bottom of the bottle before you get into the shower.  </li>
            <li> so make sure that&#x27;s gone before you get it.  </li>
            <li> The smell was OK for me...</li>
            <li> Often times, I use conditioner and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference at all, so this is a welcome change.  </li>
            <li> It has definitely left a great impression!</li>
            <li> This product changed my hair--for the better.</li>
            <li> and it did a lot better for her hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for me but better for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Maybe if my hair had some of these issues I would see more of a difference with this product but as compared to others I don&#x27;t see the benefits as a &amp;#34;Deep&amp;#34</li>
            <li> However when I dyed my hair blonde, it didn&#x27;t moisturize as well.overall great product, good buy.</li>
            <li> I love the product and have recommended it to my friends and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Nice light scent.</li>
            <li> the LONGER you leave it in the BETTER</li>
            <li> I want to order about five more.  </li>
            <li> I really love the scent of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received a free sample from BzzAgent and Aussie all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> and i love it</li>
            <li> The moisture was okay but didn&#x27;t blow my mind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Aussie 3 Minute Miracle many times through the years.</li>
            <li> This is better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with steam, and found the benefits to be even better.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner...</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I have to say how pleased I am with it.</li>

            <li> I received this free to try from BzzAgent in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really thought it did a great job keeping its promises.  </li>
            <li> I love the price</li>

            <li> : I got this item free from Bzzagent!</li>
            <li> I received this product to try for free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This Aussie 3 Minute Miracle is one of the best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve run across.</li>
            <li> also the packaging is phenomenal because it is just a squeeze tube</li>
            <li> I love the bottle in the shower, but made the mistake of bringing this with in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> so oooooo many times...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching it :)  </li>
            <li> This is one of the two best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s definitely the BEST VALUE out there.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to more uses and</li>
            <li> I saw a difference, and it was more manageable after I used it.</li>
            <li> You wanna talk about healthy...</li>
            <li> so more kudos for that as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different ones and this is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> Here goes the verdict.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up to Aussie for coming up with this innovative design for the bottle.</li>
            <li> but makes it more manageable.  </li>
            <li> but Aussie works just as great and does not even cost much.</li>
            <li> so I was happy to be able to test this product out thanks to BZZAGENT and AUSSIE.  </li>
            <li> I feel in love with Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle as soon as I opened the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay now</li>
            <li> I would skip buying this and go for a better quality conditioner.</li>
            <li> so I was pleased to use this and for it to keep my hair moist.</li>
            <li> I was able to brush through with out snagging.</li>
            <li> THE BEST DEEP CONDITIONER.</li>
            <li> This I&#x27;m not so sure about.</li>
            <li> The outcome of using this was okay</li>
            <li> I love the size of it.</li>
            <li> More free stuff from bzzagent!  </li>
            <li> I love love this stuff</li>
            <li> The top comes with a hole covered with paper that you pull off to use it.  </li>
            <li> and this made it more manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so clean and healthy!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in your hand and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS ONE OF THE BEST OF THE BEST.MY HAIR IS LONG, SILKY, AND NO SIGNS OF DAMAGE...</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, I loved how the creamy texture almost melted into my scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had pretty good hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of a really really sweet coconut</li>
            <li> My stylist has done an incredible job keeping it healthy despite the colorings, but I needed something at home to help keep it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to bzzagent and aussie I got to try this product, and I love it, not expensive and very good quality, one of the top of my list for hair products</li>
            <li> my hair was soooo soft and I was able to run my fingers right through my hair which I must mention both the conditioners and shampoo have excellent slip!</li>
            <li> If I had been shopping for myself, I would have selected Strong (as this variety generally tends to mimic Texturize the best) or Smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product when I received it!</li>
            <li> tried the Aussie \\&quot;3 Minute Miracle Color\\&quot; conditioner, it worked great, smelled good, left my hair significantly easier to deal with that</li>
            <li> I would give this more stars if it weren&#x27;t for the strong scent.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and healthy and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product I would want to know if the product would make my hair more manageable most importantly.</li>
            <li> Those things aside, this is probably a great product for someone with different hair needs than my own.</li>
            <li> The best part of it is, this is very cheap compared to other products out there</li>
            <li> I was sent a free sample (From another website) and i liked it so much i decided to purchase another bottle!!!</li>
            <li> The consistency of the conditioner was also nice with a thicker feel so it all got into the hair rather than a more watery consistency that tends to slide right off and into the shower.</li>
            <li> product is very good and affordable, and a great choice for dry hair, for normal hair is more of a once a week treatment</li>
            <li> Though my hair is a bit on the fine side, it also tends to get frizzy in the more humid weather</li>
            <li> It makes my split ended, frayed, fine and tangled hair slightly more manageable and a lot softer.     </li>
            <li> This stuff certainly smells good.</li>
            <li> Very cool.  </li>
            <li> It just took a bit more time to apply because I work in sections with my hair and need a bit more product for full coverage.</li>
            <li> It just took a bit more time to apply because I work in sections with my hair and need a bit more product for full coverage.</li>

            <li> I do not have oily hair by the end of the day like I do when I use most products and if I choose not to wash my hair for a day it&#x27;s still just as smooth as it was the day before.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff leaves my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li> Great value for money, makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth and hydrated..... :)</li>
            <li> I was able to receive this sample for free.</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it would perfect for deep conditioning my afro-textured hair since I got such great results from the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wad able to try this product for free</li>
            <li> It really helps and smells good.</li>
            <li> RIGHT HERE IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Normally I wake up and my hair is oily, so this was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t leave this conditioner on for the full three minutes, it will still work wonders!</li>
            <li> The best $4 I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li> After just a couple days my hair is smoother, feels softer, and with just 3 mins in the shower easy.</li>
            <li> Aussie 3munute miracle is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it was easy to spread throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> It rinses out easily, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Bottle is extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My comb goes through easily without tangles</li>
            <li> the tangles were coming out so easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to just squeeze out without opening with wet/slippery hands.</li>
            <li> I can easily look like a hippie and</li>
            <li> Container is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I could easily finger</li>
            <li> and it is easy to hold while in the shower.</li>
            <li> The bottle design makes it really easy to use in the shower, I don&#x27;t have to worry about opening up a bottle or dropping the cap or anything like that.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite curly and tangles easily.</li>
            <li> After 3 minutes, it was relatively easy to rinse off.  </li>
            <li> I have used both the moist and strong ones from Aussie.</li>
            <li> I got this as part of a free promotion, but it is definitely worth buying on your own.</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair feels strong</li>
            <li> Too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Though, for the price point, I don&#x27;t see this being any more special than a knock-off pantene conditioner.  </li>
            <li> And the best aspect is its dispenser‚Äîa (ingenious) squeeze bottle with no cap/top to mess with!</li>
            <li> Finally, and most importantly, is how great it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Years of straightening with a flat iron thats who knows how many hundreds of degrees (i straightened my beard once as a joke... and it about melted my face off like the nazi at the end of Indiana Jones LOL...)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the ORIGINAL in the blah cream colored bottle and formulation that conditioned, moisturized and strengthened the hair, but it&#x27;s very close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a tween daughter, like everything else about her, her hair is also changing, she is sweating more and getting more tangles, frizz and even greasy roots while the tips seem fried, I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that can help her without breaking the bank, recently I received an invitation thru Bzzagent to try this product for free, I&#x27;ve have known and loved Aussie brand products for a while</li>
            <li> The dispenser seems to work just fine</li>
            <li> I have armpit length, fine color-treated hair</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and a lot of products make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair went from frizzy and unmanageable to silky, smooth and easy to style.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to jump the gun too much on a review because I know that shampoos and conditioners can work great at first and</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I love the bold purple color of the bottle and think it stands out on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance and consistency:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> :) It didn&#x27;t really take care of the frizz, but the moisture part was pretty good.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant light scent, soft and creamy in your hand.</li>
            <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair and feeling how soft it was!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer‚Äã for my curly/wavy hair and works quick for a cheap price, make sure and add the coupon on amazon for some $$ back in your pocket!</li>
            <li> And the best part is, it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down at all!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I received it for free thanks to Aussie, but I&#x27;d buy it on my own now.  </li>
            <li> After just 1 use I could already tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> IT WAS HUGE FOR ME.</li>

            <li> A good decent blow dry is good enough to keep my hair looking good for work!</li>

            <li> I love this stuff because it really does work miracles!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it again when Bzzagent gave me the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Often I&#x27;ll use it while having a hot cup of tea, leaving it on more than 3 minutes in a plastic shower cap or one for processing; uplifting for hair and spirit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> formulation has changed AGAIN since the original.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair that is not color treated and on the heathy side since I don&#x27;t tend to use many products or heat to style my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a great value and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> The container is kind of unique in that it isn&#x27;t necessary to remove the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li> frizz ball when I let it air dry, which I&#x27;m so happy about.</li>
            <li> I received it free from Aussie to try, but I am throwing out out my old conditioner (Paul Mitchell) and weekly hair treatments for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free thanks to Aussie, I must admit i&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> It has left my hair moist, fizz free, smelling good and no longer tangled when I get out the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and fun to squirt it out!&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing, and feels amazing when you&#x27;re washing it out of your wet hair.</li>
            <li> Others may not notice the difference so much, but it is effective and worth a try.</li>

            <li> I use it at least once a week, and my hair feels great!</li>
            <li> That is good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> For the price of this conditioner it works really good in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>

            <li> Thanks to Aussie, I&#x27;m trying this out for free!</li>
            <li> Follow directions and finish with a cool rinse.</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about this product, but it ultimately just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> then kind of peter out, but honestly, so far this stuff has been a godsend.  </li>
            <li> This is a true 3 minute miracles.</li>
            <li> It really works so much better than the others conditioners I have used.</li>
            <li> My hair is nice and soft and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> Deserves full 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Alberto Vo5 Silky Experiences Moisturizing Conditioner Shea Cashmere]] works very well and is my go-to conditioner) that provide even more silkiness and moisture.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and it definitely made my hair softer!</li>
            <li> Definitely a good drugstore option for a deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> Overall, though, good conditioner.</li>
            <li> All in all, not a bad product.  </li>
            <li> It squeezes out the right amount of a good consistency, white product that goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I love the bottle it comes in, It is so easy to use and allows you to control exactly how much product you want to use.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Bzz Agent and they were right.</li>
            <li> This stuff comes in an easily recognizable, easy to use bottle.  </li>
            <li> It rinsed out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> It smells a lot like butter, with a mild sweet fragrance in there too.</li>
            <li> Great value comparing to any other conditioner brand.</li>
            <li> I use to use this all the time years ago before other people caught on that is was really great.</li>
            <li> Well, after a couple times I was able to see a difference, my hair does not only look better now</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing hair mask I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have tried a variety of much more expensive hair salon brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product and would love to try the &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; next as I&#x27;ve had a lot of breakage since pregnancy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing deep conditioner it makes my hair feel silky smooth and moist</li>
            <li> it goes by quickly).</li>
            <li> However, I think I will likely supplement with a weekly deep conditioning treatment to keep my hair feeling as great as it looks!</li>
            <li> For you ladies out there looking for a quick fix for frizzled ends, this may be the product for you.</li>
            <li> It has left my hair feeling so nice and smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THE AUSSIE 3 MINUTE MIRACLE MOIST DEEP CONDITIONER FOR FREE FROM AUSSIE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST OPINION AND</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT CAUSES BUILD UP FAIRLY QUICKLY AND</li>
            <li> This is a actually a very brilliant idea, especially if you condition your hair daily.</li>
            <li> I am loyal to the Aussie brand</li>
            <li> The packaging is also super convenient and you can twist it to close for when you&#x27;re traveling.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells okay, but the old Aussie scent was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner left a nice, light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I would like to try some of the other products in the range and see if there is another one that would be a better fit more me especially for such a great price and being readily available in most stores.</li>
            <li> i have tried many conditioners but let me tell you that this one right here is the real deal.</li>
            <li> so it gets tangled pretty easily, so I was excited to find a product that worked very with my hair!</li>
            <li> I got to try it free to try Thanks to being a Bzz Agent and Aussie!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Aussie!</li>
            <li> I got to test this product for free thanks to Aussie!</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t act like most normal hair.</li>
            <li> but I decided to get my hair bleached and dyed for the very first time ...</li>
            <li> I use this as my normal conditioner and it keeps my hair looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Aussie!</li>
            <li> first off i got this free from bzzagent to test.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice sweet and subtle smell and not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This new conditioner comes in five types:  Moist, Color, Shine, Strong, and Smooth.  </li>
            <li> Got the chance to try the 3 Minute Miracle(moist) free for testing purposes from Aussie and within just one use, my hair felt brand new, soft, shiny &amp; overall healthy!!!.</li>
            <li> I pretty much don&#x27;t know what frizz is anymore, which is a HUGE plus in my book!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fast and easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 Minute Miracle in Moist about 5 times and find the product to be pretty good when it comes to a daily conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> Aussie 3 minute miracle is super easy to use, I love the bottle dispenser, it only takes 3 minutes</li>
            <li> , it rinses easily and really improves my hair.  </li>
            <li> Intense moisture, washes away easily</li>
            <li> Definitely a good option for people with dry hair.</li>
            <li> First off, I would like to say that I love how the bottle is stored with the opening on the bottom so that there is always conditioner ready to be squeezed out.</li>
            <li> &quot; simply very quickly repairs very damaged</li>
            <li> First of all, I love that I can just do it in the shower without taking any more time than regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I plan to use it once a week and will definitely be buying more of it!</li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer and smoother with this conditioner!!  </li>
            <li> Most conditioners claim to be the best at moisturizing, but usually fall short of those claims when it comes on to textured hair.</li>
            <li> and this definitely made it more manageable!</li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t regularly deep condition my hair it ends up looking dry, so I&#x27;m always on the crusade for the perfect product.</li>
            <li> For shiny strong, moisturize and  healthy- looking hair try this deep conditioner(3 minute miracle</li>
            <li> I instantly went on line and searched for the best products for dry colored hair.</li>
            <li> be.&lt;br /&gt;I usually dry my hair right after washing it and the product is also good for me.</li>
            <li> My hair feels more manageable, more smooth and a little healthier since I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing its the only conditioner and product that has reduced the frizz in just two days</li>

            <li> I had no frizz and even woke up the next morning with my hair feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> (PS I&#x27;m trying this product free thanks to Aussie and BzzAgent)</li>
            <li> : i received this product as a free sample for testing purposes thanks to Aussie</li>
            <li> and it absorbed the water and left my hair feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> (free thanks to Aussie)</li>
            <li> I got to try the 3 Minute Miracle Moist for free thanks to Aussie and Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fantastic deal and works really well.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty cool product.  </li>
            <li> My tangles were completely removed and I was left with glossy and lustrous hair that I was so proud to flaunt.</li>
            <li> It was easy to squeeze the sides and a steady stream of the product comes out without any difficulty in a 2-3 mm string of thickness.</li>
            <li> got this complimentary from bzzagent</li>
            <li> My hair is supe soft and has more volume after using.</li>
            <li> Its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I recieved a complimentary sample of this product.</li>
            <li> received this product complimentary for review purposes.</li>
            <li> and I really thought it did a good job for such an inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> its convenient and pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel soft and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> Nice AND Bigger than i thought</li>
            <li> After receiving this through BzzAgent, I will definitely be purchasing on my own as well.</li>
            <li> I also love the way my curls naturally set when I air-dry my hair now.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact you rarely see ads for conditioners featuring women with textured hair.</li>
            <li> When I received my bzzkit ( Free full size bottle to try from bzzagent.com) , I was really hoping for a miracle ;-)  </li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the bottle though.</li>
            <li> Its a shame that since Aussie was looking to revamp their product line they didn&#x27;t take a more natural approach.</li>
            <li> Since Pantene discontinued their fantastic Texturize line, I‚Äôve been searching for the right product to replace it, so I was excited to be included in the new Aussie 3-Minute Miracle conditioner test for BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> So I was very excited to try this, but it really didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use no long waiting times, or need for additional time or steps.</li>
            <li> If there was some great benefit to using this product, such as the extreme moistness described, this might be able to be overlooked.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair less frizzy and amazingly shiny!</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever, although I keep on trying other hair treatments, but  this is the one I always go back too.</li>
            <li> I have used no other conditioner that has given me such great results.</li>
            <li> So, this past weekend, I was able to try Aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle conditioner that I was able to receive for free.</li>
            <li> I ws glad to see that I wan&#x27;t the only one to notice that the new product is not as good as the old one.  </li>
            <li> and she was right</li>
            <li> It rinses out just right, and does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li> The price for this ($2.97 as of this review, with an additional $1 off coupon) on Amazon right now is a STEAL.</li>
            <li> so I said yes right away, I received a sample of the 3 min miracle moist</li>
            <li> (like right now, it&#x27;s $1 off a price of $2...</li>
            <li> many of my natural hair products didn&#x27;t show these results on the first use.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a pleasant slight coconut fragrance.</li>
            <li> It also left a very strong coconut smell.  </li>
            <li> I just recently went platinum blonde and soon experienced the maintenance nightmare after my first at home wash!</li>
            <li> I also noticed when styling for going out, that it was easier to manipulate my hair, I have a decrease in breakage (after 2.5 weeks of use), and I had a bit more shine with more curl definition and less</li>
            <li> I also noticed when styling for going out, that it was easier to manipulate my hair, I have a decrease in breakage (after 2.5 weeks of use), and I had a bit more shine with more curl definition and less</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this product would help keep my hair nice and moist and soft but that wasn&#x27;t really the case.</li>
            <li> The product is not thick or creamy, and it is light in both texture and smell.</li>
            <li> Now I can save a few dollars and have nice hair every day!</li>
            <li> While 3 minutes may seem like a long time to spend with your conditioner, the nice smell makes it a pleasing experience, with hints of coconut and cocoa butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it smells so good and makes your hair nice and soft ,I&#x27;m not sure about the bottle design but would buy it again!</li>
            <li> It was a product that stood strong and worked better than any other product.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day in place of my regular conditioner?&amp;#34; Since it is a deep conditioner I assumed that it&#x27;s best to just use it 2 - 3 times a week at most to avoid weighing down my hair</li>
            <li> You will not regret spending $3 to achieve amazingly soft, strong hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has just been kind of dry and scraggly ever since, even after getting a hair cut.</li>
            <li> I was totally surprised how easy it was to part my hair.</li>
            <li> Another huge plus, as my hair is color-treated and has some light heat damage from occasional straightening.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look or feel dry and has a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li> My dyed and hot-tooled hair gets a refreshing, moisturizing reprieve from this economical deep conditioner once a week.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I think I used too much because my hair became oily quick.</li>
            <li> Easy for no mess.</li>
            <li> It came very fast to my house</li>
            <li> Soft, full, pretty nice actually ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve colored my hair for eons, and my 10 year old daughter has a ton of fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> For the price it is a decent buy-but do not expect a true hair miracle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved the regular Aussie 3 minute miracle for a long time, but had no idea it came in a special version for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Literally after one use those straight ends began to curl up!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it for the first time, my first impression is that Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle Moist sure does the job of a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Omg I love this product and totally recommend it.thanks to bzzagent</li>
            <li> It does have water listed as the first ingredient which is a plus&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> first impressions/ what stood out first was the bottle and design.</li>
            <li> I did notice that after incorporating this deep conditioner in my hair care routine, that my hair was noticeably softer and a bit more manageable.</li>
            <li> I did notice that after incorporating this deep conditioner in my hair care routine, that my hair was noticeably softer and a bit more manageable.</li>
            <li> I did not style my hair but my hair stayed soft and frizz free all day.</li>
            <li> Most conditioners make my red hair run.</li>
            <li> Have been using Aussie products for some time and they are consistent in their delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the exception of this oil product, the Aussie 3 minute miracle really was a 3 minute miracle!</li>
            <li> It made my once unmanageable hair, soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> For me this conditioner worked pretty well</li>
            <li> I did like this one better then the garnier frutis one that is around the same price as this.</li>
            <li> However both of them said it smells different  and will update you after couple more</li>
            <li> My regular conditioner works better for me than this did.</li>
            <li> As for the look the conditioner gave my hair, I just could not get a consistent result.  </li>
            <li> Potion #9 leave in conditioner works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Aussie!</li>
            <li> The first time I got USA I could buy this &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was hoping more from a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I first caught a hint of coconut</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a promotion from Aussie, but for the price, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love this and it has replaced my regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this Aussie 3 minute miracle moist deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> my hair is moisturized and manageable after the first use.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite deep conditioners out there!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, it&#x27;s not the best that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something I wouldn&#x27;t normally purchase on my own hut will definitely repurchase once I run out.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> most awesome deep conditioner in regular OTC, not sure why stores don&#x27;t sell this anymore</li>
            <li> I received this deep conditioner for free courtesy of bzzagent.com!</li>
            <li> I use this bi weekly-or mix with some almond oil to do some real moisturizing when I need to!</li>
            <li> First I washed me hair with Suave shampoo</li>
            <li> It smells like candy, leaves hair soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the 3 minute miracle moist deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair really soft, shiny, and frizz free.</li>
            <li> , it actually helps define the waves more.</li>
            <li> I love the Aussie 3 minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I feel it really makes my hair softer and easier to manage!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see any difference before styling (my hair is big and frizzy anyway) but after straightening it is softer and more manageable.   </li>
            <li> the first thing I noticed was the opening to the bottle.</li>
            <li> I wish there were more shower products that were convenient to open like Aussie Three Minute Miracle.</li>
            <li> my hair was so light and soft.</li>
            <li> I will say that while this product works wonders on my hair, it doesn&#x27;t do so all by itself so don&#x27;t expect to be able to toss everything out leaving only this in your arsenal.  </li>
            <li> like really really well!</li>
            <li> I think this stuff really is a miracle for my frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> This season my favorite deep conditioner at the drugstore is</li>
            <li> This stuff has made my hair soft and light again.  </li>
            <li> and I really like this stuff!  </li>
            <li> This helps pop my curls and leave the soft, shiny and tangle free.</li>
            <li> First time I used it, I could feel the results.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different deep conditioners and this is the best one!!</li>
            <li> The design is more convenient and will shave a couple seconds off your daily routine at minimum.</li>
            <li> My hair was definitely shinier and more manageable.</li>
            <li> When I used it for the first time, I kept it in my hair for 3 minutes</li>
            <li> :)  Overall</li>
            <li> I was ready to put it to the test!</li>
            <li> By the time I rinsed it out, my hair was incredibly soft, smooth, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was the absolute softest it&#x27;s ever been!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels after using Aussie 3 Minute Miracle, it left my hair feeling stronger than ever.</li>
            <li> and it leaves ur hair so soft and smooth from the moment it touches ur hair.</li>
            <li> In the top left pic my I washed &amp; conditioned my hair with the pureology.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Each of my hair strands is very fine, but is very curly, so it creates a ton of volume, so of makes it seems thicker than it actually is.</li>
            <li> The Scent ‚Äì While it‚Äôs on the coconut/tropical fruity side (think: sunscreen) - and I generally prefer floral ‚Äì it‚Äôs nevertheless pleasant when using the shampoo and leaves your hair smelling gently fragrant the next day.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this product for free from Bzzagent and the results are exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> really works it leaves my hair really soft and smells great better than other deep conditioners i&#x27;ve tried and trust me me</li>
            <li> I love the squeeze tube bottle and the like vacuum seal it has.</li>
            <li> used the whole line (conditioner, shampoo &amp; 3 minute miracle) starting with the conditioner as my prepoo followed by the shampoo to cleanse followed by the 3 minute miracle to deep condition and my hair has never felt better!!</li>
            <li> This product not only is amazing for your hair but what adds to the benefits at least for me was the great smell and how amazingly soft and refreshed my hair felt after I was done using this!</li>
            <li> Before using this my hair was really frizzy and kind of dry</li>
            <li> Was lucky enough to get some free Aussie 3 Minute Miracle conditioning product from BzzAgent</li>
            <li> Much like all the other Aussie products it smells absolutely amazing and is so worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is very wasy to open and the packaing is super easy to store and use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pleasant and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS AND HAVE REALLY BEEN ENJOYING THE EXTRA QUIET TIME I GET IN THE BATHROOM.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product through bzzagent promotions and after one use my hair is soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> It did provide a nice amount of slip, but I&#x27;ve tried other conditioners ([[ASIN:B00GOQFOD2</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I normally use high end or sulfate free shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so moisturizing that it&#x27;s already replaced about 3 hair products since I don&#x27;t need to do much else to make my hair look and feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and leaves your hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it helps relieve my dry scalp and keeps my hair looking soft and silky for up to 24 hours.</li>
            <li> When using this product and letting my hair air dry, I find that my hair will more predictably go towards waves/loose curls with good volume and no frizz!&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> I used this and didn&#x27;t think much of it until later during the day when I thought to myself, &amp;#34;wow, my hair feels super light + healthy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Soft shiny hair with a clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a quick and easy fix to dry, frizz-prone hair.</li>
            <li> However this is a really good deep conditioner, for a low price.</li>
            <li> The Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner leaves the hair feeling very flexible and smooth!</li>
            <li> , if I love it so much, why did I give it only 4 stars?  </li>
            <li> this completely brought my hair back to life, it&#x27;s super soft, moisturized and healthy!</li>
            <li> The fragrant conditioner is rich, creamy and works through the hair never weighing it down and leaving it full of volume, detangled and full of life.</li>
            <li> Makes my super processed bleached hair extremely soft!</li>
            <li> I bought the \\&quot;Aussie 3 minute miracle\\&quot; conditioner because my hair needed help quick and this was within my budget, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting much more than average results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since 2010 with positive results of hydration, softness, silkiness and shine.</li>
            <li> My hair was very smooth once dry and the fragrance was like being on a tropical island.</li>
            <li> There is also a great scent left behind that I love.</li>
            <li> This awesome Aussie conditioner gave live back to my dead mane!</li>
            <li> As mentioned earlier, my hair can go pretty easily between wavy and straight.</li>
            <li> I left the conditioner in for about 3 minutes and rinsed it - easy</li>
            <li> , my hair is SUPER soft, and shiny too...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it after every shampoo, maybe once a week, twice a week in the winter when my hair is more dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> My hair feels a lot better and not so dry.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use you just turn over the bottle and squeeze, no cap to open.</li>
            <li> and in just 3 easy minutes, I have moisture restored back into my hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle design makes it easy to get all the conditioner till the last drop!</li>
            <li> i left it in for about 3-5 mins and once I rinsed it out my hair felt better than my normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> Although this conditioner left my hair feeling silky and easy to manage, It also made my hair fall out.</li>
            <li> The scent is slightly different that the normal version, but still appealing.  </li>
            <li> , my dry hair will never feel silky), and more manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and easy to use, you just leave it in your hair for 3 minutes before rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner is easy to use and takes just 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Between the baby and my three year old and my full time job though, I just don&#x27;t have time to do much for it.</li>
            <li> I love trying deep conditioners, so I was excited to try Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioning Treatment thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Aussie Moist is my new hair friend!!</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a good travel product (Something you take on vacation) because it works fast but for long term use I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those with my hair type.</li>
            <li> My hair feels super soft after I rinse this out, and very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try it out since my hair is fairly dry and damaged.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Honing in on individual hair needs and selecting from their array of products always yields fine results.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or weighed down after use but clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and thanks to Aussie, I received a free product trial of Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner</li>
            <li> This is a huge plus for me because I like to detangle with my deep conditioner in.</li>
            <li> I received Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist deep conditioner for free thanks to Aussie and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I DEFINITELY will buy this product on a regular basis because of how amazing this Aussie product leaves my hair and my daughters</li>
            <li> The white bottom part of the bottle where the condition is dispensed from looks a bit cheap - it reminds me of a factory sample as opposed to the finished product.</li>
            <li> After the time had passed, I washed the conditioner out and didn&#x27;t really feel any difference just upon washing it out.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it</li>
            <li> I received  this deep conditioner on behalf of Aussie to try out for free.</li>
            <li> , I just put it in after I shampoo, continue my shower, and rinse when I&#x27;m ready to get out.</li>
            <li> I really wish they would stop monkeying around with something that just worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gentle on my hair color.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> There is no cap; it&#x27;s a straight squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> I did notice it is much smoother</li>
            <li> Its also really managable</li>
            <li> This 3 minute conditioner really moisturizes your hair.  </li>
            <li> The hair is very supple.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend it!</li>
            <li> But that wouldn&#x27;t matter if it didn&#x27;t work; luckily, it really does.</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair feels softer and looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I got to try out Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle.  </li>
            <li> Definitely repurchasing after my free sample from bzzagent runs out.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> i dyed my hair at home too much because my hair color never came out the way i wanted.</li>
            <li> If you have frizzy, unmanageable hair, I highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> was a very watery substance like it had been opened and used.</li>
            <li> really did a number on my hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend~!</li>
            <li> Thanks to both Aussie and Bzz Agent</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> so you can just squeeze out how ever much you need.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My hair has been so much smoother and shinier thanks to Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle.</li>
            <li> My morning routine has been so much</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Recently I got a bottle free to try from Aussie.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week now, and I really like how moisturized my hair gets after using it.</li>
            <li> It really does moisturize my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Thanks too BzzAgent and Aussie, I got to test out Aussie&#x27;s Three Minute Miracle Moist, and I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> is very creamy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try this!</li>
            <li> Also, don‚Äôt skimp on the conditioner beforehand if your hair needs the extra TLC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Aussie and BzzAgent for providing this free product sample.</li>
            <li> My hair feels much softer and it&#x27;s easier to work with.</li>
            <li> My hair likes to straddle the line between wavy and straight.</li>
            <li> But I really wanted to try this</li>
            <li> Very good&lt;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much time but claims to do wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a free product trial of Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner</li>
            <li> Frizz is my biggest issue, and this really helps with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I Received Aussie Three Minute Miracle deep conditioning treatment free from Aussie.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually really frizzy</li>
            <li> Works way better than a dollar item would be expected to work</li>
            <li> Worked really well</li>
            <li> conditioner works really well to detangle,</li>

            <li> i shower now because it really helps my fdry hair.</li>
            <li> much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I leave it in while washing my body and haven&#x27;t really timed it.</li>
            <li> and it worked well for that too, especially with the light coconut scent it has.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re unsure whether to buy this or not, it wasn&#x27;t that much money from what I recall, I would give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li> I have really chemically damaged hair and this works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve over processed my hair so much</li>
            <li> THANKS AUSSIE.</li>
            <li> TO HOW MUCH BUILD UP IT CAUSED.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this, and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I am on my way to repairing my hair thanks to Aussie 3 minute miracle and to Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> Thanks Aussie 3 minute miracle.</li>
            <li> , I have very frizzy and wavy hair</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> After using Aussie 3-minute miracle once, my hair looked and felt much softer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very committed seller</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the scent is too much, and too fruity for me.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzzagent</li>
            <li> This treatment really works.</li>
            <li> This conditioner not only smells fabulous</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t linger that much after you rinse it out</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;ve never tried the Aussie brand, but was always curious.</li>
            <li> Last night when washing - my hair felt silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks to bzzagent and aussie</li>
            <li> so you dont feel like you have too much product in your hair.  </li>
            <li> This Aussie 3 Minute Miracle really is a miracle.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, the bottle design is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I only had to use this once and put it in my hair for 3 minutes and it completely transformed my hair into silky, smooth, amazingness!</li>
            <li> , the bottle is very convenient and well designed because the dispenser is on the bottom allowing gravity to work in your favor, the product has a fruity kind of smell that appeals to young women, it is white and creamy and easily slides thru the hair, it has easy to follow instructions, and calls for applying on clean wet her and letting it work for 3 min, conviniently songs last about that long, so</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that the bottle is upside down which I love.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got naturally curly hair, and I live in an exceptionally humid climate (it was over 80% humidity INSIDE at work the other day).</li>
            <li> but didn&#x27;t live up to the stellar reviews.</li>
            <li> I have tried other deep conditioners in the past, but thanks to Aussie and BzzAgent, I was able to try this product for free and fell in love!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner as it leaves my hair, I believe, much smoother than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It smells good, not like mothballs or aqua net like other companies stuff has..</li>
            <li> I left it one my hair for three minutes as the bottle instructs and I love how soft and full looking it has left my hair.</li>
            <li> After I rinsed it out, my daughter&#x27;s hair retained moisture and had way more manageability than when I&#x27;ve used other products.  </li>
            <li> I use it myself and mostly on my daughter, who has extremely curly gair that is prone to dryness..</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice the scent to be overwhelmingly coconut as other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> , it is different and unique bottle.</li>
            <li> What was once all over the place, dry and really frizzy is now soft and has added some much needed moisture that most conditioners just can&#x27;t do for me.</li>
            <li> Last but not least, I want to thank Aussie and BzzAgent for letting me try this product for free.</li>
            <li> The first thing I will say is that it absolutely did make my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li> have long, super thick, color-treated hair and my ends look dry, so I&#x27;m always on the hunt for the perfect conditioner.</li>
            <li> is one specially made to keep hair color longer especially if you highlight or color your hair.</li>
            <li> After a short blow dry, my hair feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It also kept my hair frizz free when I had a stretched style, like a curlformer set.</li>
            <li> My hair felt smooth but not &#x27;soft&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the product since my hair was straight and limp.</li>
            <li> First, I miss the old Aussie scent.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take it ALL out, but MOST of it, and cuts down on time.</li>
            <li> I thought this would weigh it down more.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without it !</li>
            <li> So even though your hands are wet or slippery, it is easy to handle the bottle, get the product out and tend to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When dry, your hair is smooth and has a sheen.  </li>
            <li> I think this would be better for people with slightly thinner hair than mine.</li>
            <li> I am now able to comb through my hair without losing half of it to knots that need to be worked out.</li>
            <li> It was easy to comb out and wasn&#x27;t tangly when wet.</li>
            <li> I love how affordable this product is and how I don&#x27;t have to spend a ton of money on a deep conditioner to get the same results.</li>
            <li> (I avoided my scalp since the richness of conditioners tend to break me out, but that wasn&#x27;t particular to this product.)</li>
            <li> I have such a problem with tangles that I have to constantly work to keep my hair healthy if I want to have my hair just over soldier length.</li>
            <li> However, the product has enough enough plusses (and is so affordable) that I would try Strong or Smooth next to give the line another go.</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this, as well as other Aussie products, such as their Hair Insurance leave in conditioner spray, and my hair mostly behaves itself!</li>
            <li> My hair stayed nice and soft but when humidity hit I ended up with a puffball and then my hair dried out.</li>
            <li> I also love how it is so simple to use and only requires one step.</li>
            <li> the price, it‚Äôs done a decent job of keeping my hair ‚Äúmoist.‚Äù</li>
            <li> Hair lacks softness: One of the only cons that I&#x27;ve had with using this product is that while my hair LOOKS fantastic, it&#x27;s not as soft as I would like.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t great for a quick shower, you definitely have to leave it in for the 3 minutes for it to work, which isn&#x27;t convenient all the time.</li>
            <li> I do have highlights so my color was &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; vibrant.  </li>
            <li> Many months later, I use it on an irregular basis and a deep conditioner</li>
            <li> its like a mess- proof top.</li>
            <li> It is quite thick and coats your hair easily, meaning you don&#x27;t need a huge amount, but washes out easily also and does not leave my hair looking or feeling weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li> I loved the faint coconut smell of this product right away.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after just one use and would even compare its effects to high priced salon brands.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It definitely isn&#x27;t like a hair treatment at the salon, (which is the best, and leaves my hair silky soft and moisturized, but it is expensive as heck), but for its price, it worked VERY well for my 3b/c hair.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> rinsing, I was so surprised by how easily this conditioner rinsed out of the hair and yet how wonderfully soft it left my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I‚Äôve tried better deep conditioners ‚Äî and paid the extra cost for it too ‚Äî Aussie‚Äôs 3 Minute Miracle is a great affordable option for everyday deep conditioning and gives your tresses that extra bit of attention if you overly manhandle it with coloring, blow-drying, curling, straightening, etc.</li>
            <li> I began using this deep conditioner and the first use I felt and saw a difference!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have a bunch of little stray strands on top of my head</li>
            <li> The most bothersome thing to me about this little thing is the smell.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make it soft or healthier but it did make it much easier to de tangle and unless your willing to pay major bucks</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last 10 years, I have very fine dry hair and live in the tropics.</li>
            <li> I have found that Natural 7 Oil - Argan Oil - from Proclaim works very well.  </li>
            <li> It was amazing to my normally, frizzy, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference , leaves hair feeling soo soft.</li>
            <li> My hair felt smooth and hydrated while wet.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t however do much for my frizziness; it reduced it but didn&#x27;t completely get rid of it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always on top of my head in a messy bun based on my work.</li>
            <li> This morning, I shampooed my hair like normal and then used the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist conditioner for 2 minutes, 45 seconds like the bottle said.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: It is definitely worth trying because no two individuals are the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: It is definitely worth trying because no two individuals are the same.</li>
            <li> I love that it just takes a few minutes as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first time using it, I noticed my hair was much softer the next day.  </li>
            <li> Depending on how long I waited to use my hair dryer, or even (as a night-shower-er) how many hours I was awake after blow drying, I got different looks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and it seems like my hair looks and feels better after I style.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the normal Aussie smell.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s normally frizzy, and</li>
            <li> To the point of normal hair.</li>
            <li> So many products out there leave my hair feeling limp or oily or fried out after conditioning, but NOT Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle.</li>
            <li> Shampoo your hair as normal, then apply the 3 Minute Miracle ... and proceed with your showering duties.  </li>
            <li> it would still benefit those with normal- greasy hair</li>
            <li> I dried and styled my hair and love how it looks and feels.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try something new for my dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I leave it on over night and rinse out in the morning, makes your hair lovely and soft , and does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> and when I blow dry my hair, it is silky soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I moved to Colorado a few years ago and the dry climate has not been good to my hair.</li>
            <li> This product works great with my long, super thick, and often dry hair.</li>
            <li> I just adjusted the amount I used the next time (a quarter size) and it worked just right.</li>
            <li> It does help tame down the frizz and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I got this item free from BZZ Agent and I never really heard of using an Aussie Product on natural hair, but this worked WONDERS!  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes really well but rinses without leaving a heavy residue on my hair (my hair is fine)</li>
            <li> I was knot and tangle free even while wet!</li>
            <li> My hair also normally frizzes in humidity, working in NYC and all, and I noticed that it really does not frizz as much on the days I use my deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is truly my new go-to hair care product that I just cant live without.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I live in the desert</li>
            <li> I cant live without it</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m still a fan of this new version.  </li>
            <li> I am leery to new hair products because my curly hair is so unruly that I never know what&#x27;s going to work and</li>
            <li> The consistency of the conditioner was not watered down and also not too thick - easy to spread and made it very easy to detangle my hair with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Of course, it&#x27;s almost cheap enough in stores to get a new bottle for trips and just throw away the extra, but that feels so wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As stated in the directions (and name), I leave this conditioner on clean wet hair for 3 minutes and let the miracles start working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was suffering from super dry hair after having a baby.</li>
            <li> i tried this product hoping to see an improvement in my dry hair and luckily it worked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this in the future, but it&#x27;s nice as an everyday conditioner.</li>
            <li> After just one use, my dry, bleached highlights became super soft and so manageable!</li>
            <li> After the three minutes was up, I rinsed my hair and it felt very soft.</li>
            <li> I have 3 children who keep me very busy</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and with one use my hair was left so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I was able to glide the comb through my hair with very little tangling.</li>
            <li> WOW, was I ever pleasantly surprised!!</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry hair, thanks to using heat products while styling.</li>
            <li> My hair is not thick but not thin and very dry at the ends due to coloring and highlights, but decently healthy otherwise.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This provides a great conditioning treatment for much less than other deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> Although fragrances can be drying , it is listed as the 7th ingredient which means compared to the first or second ingredient it doesn&#x27;t have as much.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Three minutes in the shower for a week of soft, shiny hair!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I saw an instant boost in shine and hydration.</li>
            <li> Overall the product works pretty well, but I think there is room for improvement.  </li>
            <li> Overall the product does work pretty well and is inexpensive compared to others products out there on the market.  </li>
            <li> Well, I must say that I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Not only did this conditioner deliver 24 hour shine after only one treatment, it left my hair ten times stronger and made my hair feel healthy again!</li>
            <li> In fact, it left my hair feeling lighter and much cleaner than ever before!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product because it has a wonderful price point ($2.99-$3.19) at Walmart and Target, so it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li> My hair always comes out soft and shiny with a normal conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other deep conditioners that cost wayyy more than this one</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this worked!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft &amp; shiny!</li>
            <li> I can surely say that I will not be using any other deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft and does reduce frizz when out the shower!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and shiny after using this product and I hope to never be without it!</li>
            <li> The first thing a person notices with this conditioner is the smell, it is nothing short of heavenly.  </li>
            <li> After trying countless deep conditioners and none of them working like they said they would (my hair would either be greasy or weighted down), I was pleasantly surprised by how great Aussie 3 minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you have dry thirsty hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smooths on easily and provides the moisture weight that keeps really thick, dry hair smooth and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t feel like it really helped my hair anymore than a normal non deep conditioner would.</li>
            <li> I just would not be able to use it regularly in the winter without my hair getting weighed down.</li>
            <li> This sorts out the tangle mess and makes my hair feel smooth like silk.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that it offers 3x moisture and will completely restore your hair in just 3 minutes!</li>
            <li> It is not a time saver for your average shower, but the benefits of a salon-like moisturizing treatment at home is worth it!</li>
            <li> I used to use this product a long time ago when there was only one version of the three minute miracle conditioner, but I&#x27;m so glad they&#x27;ve expanded the line to suit different hair types.  </li>
            <li> After I fried my color treated hair with a flat iron (*smh*)</li>
            <li> /&gt;After letting my hair air-dry, I could definitely see that my strands were less frizzy and they felt more hydrated and smoother.</li>
            <li> I love that I can get a deep conditioning treatment without any heat and in less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> However, I did not find that it was any more moisture-enhancing than any typical deep conditioner sold at the supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, but also very dry due to coloring and highlights.  </li>
            <li> and it really makes my hair super soft after I blow dry and flat iron it.  </li>
            <li> but I feel like my hair is significantly softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Now, again, I had never had my hair dyed before, though I did happen to know that bleaching was hard on your hair having grown up in the 90&#x27;s and witnessing the Eminem and JTL bleached hair look-alikes (or &#x27;not so&#x27; look-alikes in most cases) ...  </li>
            <li> I have used a million conditioners by now and several different types of deep conditioning options like oils and other deep conditioners in general and nothing has ever felt so great in my hair as this.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be dry and brittle especially since I use a relaxer in my hair, so I was really excited Bzzagent picked me to try Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist.</li>
            <li> I never am able to run my fingers through wet hair and need a wide tooth comb but with this, I had no issues.</li>
            <li> (These are just things I noticed and am bringing up in the interest of giving a complete review, but they in no way affected my thoughts on the product itself.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructions don&#x27;t state how frequently the product could/should be used.</li>
            <li> makes your hair shine and soft</li>
            <li> As a natural curly/kinky hair girl moisture is everything.</li>
            <li> Once i rinsed it, my hair felt so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> and it make my hair feel soft and look shiny,  </li>
            <li> My curls are so soft and bouncy</li>
            <li> , thats all you really can expect from a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> I even started using it on my 8 and 9 year old.</li>
            <li> If you are either getting ready to color your hair, or you&#x27;ve just colored it, then this is definitely the product for you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle, and for any of you with natural curls, you know that nothing IS.</li>
            <li> My hair is double processed and heat styled which means it&#x27;s really damaged.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> My hair stayed soft and shiny all day so that I could not stop looking in the mirror and receiving non stop compliments from friends and coworkers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my hair managable on busy mornings when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time</li>
            <li> I can always rely on it to take all my knots out while I&#x27;m in the shower and when I get out I can still feel my hair is moisturized and soft but not heavy or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly 3b type hair, I need moisture in order to even look semi-presentable.</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for soft, silky, manageable hair, give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It left my hair ready to be styled without using anything else on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how soft my hair was after I used this.</li>
            <li> When the three minutes are up, I rinse and my hair is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Just directly squeeze into your hand and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes it soft and silky like it used to be</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It left my hair very macil i recommend</li>
            <li> Well not with this line, my hair remained soft while drying</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this soft in years.</li>
            <li> With curly natural hair, this makes things easier for me.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel soft and silky</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t completely take away the frizz</li>
            <li> Claiming to fix split ends is a feat that nearly all conditions claim and none follow through on, even $1,000 carotene treatments do not even fix split ends.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However after rinsing it out, my hair didn&#x27;t really feel deep conditioned and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Your hair will be soft and shiny and smell delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were in complete</li>
            <li> ON MY 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS SOFT AND MANAGEABLE</li>
            <li> I received this conditioner courtesy of Aussie for testing purposes, and I&#x27;m honestly surprised at myself for not trying it sooner.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aussie 3-minute miracle on and off since I was 13 years old and am now 34.</li>
            <li> so that when I&#x27;m ready to condition my hair, it will come out with a simple squeeze.</li>
            <li> Using it too frequently causes my scalp to have build up and become itchy.</li>
            <li> I really like this deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> I have natural 4a type hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have naturally wavy / curly hair...</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft and conditioned</li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair -- including the damaged part -- soft and shiny and oh-so-manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair feels a bit softer but only repeated usage will tell how miraculous this product really is.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes for this product to begin working it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li> But Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner is worth the extra couple of minutes I spend in the shower!</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve splurged here and there on expensive salon-only products, and this 3 Minute Miracle stands its own - at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> bottle is smaller than I expected, but given that you aren&#x27;t expected to use the conditioning treatment every day, it will last a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the thick texture consistency.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it and how thick it is.</li>
            <li> I have tried some expensive items to make my hair look good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find a conditioner that makes it feel healthy and like its getting back to its normal strength and this product is doing just that!  </li>
            <li> She has a thick mane of hair and stated that this is one of the only products she has found that makes her hair silky smooth with no frizz or tangles which allows for her hairbrush to glide right through.  </li>
            <li> It took a lot longer than 3 minutes to clean up the mess.</li>
            <li> I normally have very frizzy, dry hait since I color my hair</li>
            <li> i let my hair air dry just to see and feel the exact effects of the product.</li>
            <li> I also love the unique squeeze bottle that isn&#x27;t annoying like other caps, it doesn&#x27;t have a top</li>
            <li> WHERE LESS DRY :)</li>
            <li> At first I really disliked the smell, but after a few uses I have grown to love it.</li>
            <li> However, when I went to dry my hair, I had very minimal hair come out, leaving me with a clean bathroom sink!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that I like to be smooth and sleek, but which can turn wavy and frizzy if I‚Äôm not using the right hair regimen.  </li>
            <li> The product is pretty good but the packaging is bad.  </li>
            <li> that demands style or an up-do) hair that has a tendency to dry out fast, and this product really helps bring back control, shine, and softness.</li>
            <li> This product is not the same as the older version.  </li>
            <li> Most of em, even salon-grade products, have left my hair looking limp or greasy after using them (even when I use a teensy bit!)</li>
            <li> Thanks Aussie! will definitely purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I have my roots dyed monthly and typically use a super moisturizing conditioner, but I decided to try this instead.</li>
            <li> There are other benefits to the conditioner, it is thicker than most other conditioners.</li>
            <li> Overall, this conditioner did a decent job of conditioning my hair, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away.</li>
            <li> My hair is super long now so after my shower its super hard to get a brush through the ends.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers were right.</li>
            <li> My Wife and my young daughter both are very lucky to have thick hair .</li>
            <li> the cheap (Suave brand) conditioner I usually use.</li>
            <li> Just be careful that you don&#x27;t squeeze out too much at one time!</li>
            <li> when i go outside, my hair does not get fizzy as it normally does.</li>
            <li> I have dry and damaged hair gets staticy in certain environments.</li>
            <li> So in the end, whether you have thin, fine hair like mine, or really thick and coarse hair, I recommend it to everybody who wants shiny, silky hair without interrupting their busy lifestyles or breaking the bank :)</li>
            <li> I have tried everything under the sun to get my unruly hair to calm down.</li>
            <li> I really did like the dispenser at the bottom of the bottle and find it much easier to get the right amount of product with less mess.</li>
            <li> and it has really made my hair smooth and no fly aways.</li>
            <li> Additionally my ends no longer look dry  thanks to Aussie 3 minute miracle and to Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> You could easily do the same with your current conditioner (just leave it onto to damp, not dripping wet hair after shampoo for 3+ minutes) and achieve similar results.</li>
            <li> As the mom of 4, I&#x27;m constantly in a rush to get in and out of the shower as fast as possible.</li>
            <li> It not only moisturize my hair but also leaves my hair straight and shine only in 5 minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> Not only is it fast, it actually works.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling a little heavier than my daily conditioner but that could be what also left it feeling better conditioned.  </li>
            <li> every extra minute is SO helpful for this busy working mom of three!</li>
            <li> I would still be willing to try one of the other ones just not the moist one again.</li>
            <li> I can easily take a trip to my local drugstore and pick up one or a few!</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair and this product left it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I received two 8-ounce bottles for free for the test, and by the end of the test (a little less than two months later, washing my hair 3-4 times/week), I was just finishing the first bottle.  </li>
            <li> What I mean by this is that for my hair texture I need a little more than 3 minutes because I don&#x27;t feel like its enough for full penetration especially as a stand alone product.</li>
            <li> What I mean by this is that for my hair texture I need a little more than 3 minutes because I don&#x27;t feel like its enough for full penetration especially as a stand alone product.</li>
            <li> hair is very dry and damaged, and using this just twice a week really rejuvenates it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple quick and easy, it would be silly not to use it regularly!!!</li>
            <li> I found this to be a great conditioner, but a little heavy for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> i tend to have pretty dry hair that gets really frizzy when i don&#x27;t use leave-in conditioners or other such conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> I have used nearly every deep condition or dangler on the market.  </li>
            <li> Aussie&#x27;s 3-Minute Miracle is by far the HOLY GRAIL of deep conditioners in my books.</li>
            <li> This will definitely replace my old conditioner</li>
            <li> and I have natural mixed hair.</li>
            <li> Hair feels so soft for days after and you only have to use it once a week for the results to continue.</li>
            <li> I never really conditioned my hair much, but now I do it weekly.</li>
            <li> Really actually truly fixed my puffy summer hair.</li>
            <li> For naturally curly hair, this is my life saver and one of the only ways I can comb through my hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> my hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy and tangled and my hair felt conditioned and soft for at last 3 days.</li>
            <li> My ends were super dry, my crown was dry and I needed a deep moisturizing</li>
            <li> It was so soft and bouncy once I left the salon!</li>
            <li> Ive barely started using this as well.</li>
            <li> Usually, while drying my hair, it just falls out in my fingers leaving me with what feels like a full head of hair all over my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> The fact that the cap is on the bottom of the container is kind of weird, however, as opening the container means to have to juggle the dispensed product, the cap and the bottle all at once.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Recently had the opportunity to try the newly introduced version for color-treated hair and it did equally as well on my home-dyed hair.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical about trying this product, just because it is not a brand I am  familiar with for my hair type</li>
            <li> A little bit tropical, a little bit floral, and not at all overwhelming like some products can</li>
            <li> The price is right as well, considering how much more expensive other hair products are.</li>
            <li> Okay so I am African American with transitioning hair (thick, and coarse, curly hair with a lot of damaged ends) and I was recommended to try this because of the price.</li>
            <li> It instantly transformed my hair from dry to moist, and I love how it only took a few minutes in the shower to achieve!</li>
            <li> once my hair dried it was silky smooth and so soft without feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôd easily buy this again for the few dollars it cost, but I look forward to trying their other formulas: Shine and Strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips</li>
            <li> Honestly, I must say I&#x27;m a little skeptical with those highly rated products which are usually recommended on fashion and hair blogs, but this one really works.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it has, but if you really let it stay in your hair for at least 3 min, you will feel how smooth it will</li>
            <li> I used it on my daughter&#x27;s 4c coarse natural hair and it instantly became easier to detangle and provided a lot of slip.  </li>
            <li> Immediately I washed my hair and blow dry it, I noticed that my hair was very soft.</li>
            <li> I normally have very dry hair</li>
            <li> No other deep conditioner...not even overnight olive oil treatments, can compare to 3 minutes with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have thin very damaged hair from frequent chemical treatments and daily hot tools.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like other conditioners</li>
            <li> After dryer, although hair looked somewhat shiny, it was still pretty rough and dry</li>
            <li> I already get greasy roots and straw like strands the day after I wash/condition, but this stuff has made my hair feel so soft and my roots are no longer flat and greasy the next day!</li>
            <li> It always leaves my long hear soft  </li>
            <li> When my hair dried it was shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a fantastic conditioner that makes your hair look like you just had an expensive treatment done, try Aussie&#x27;s new 3 Minute Miracle Moist conditioner and you will never use another brand again!</li>
            <li> It used to dry very frizzy and you could tell it was dry just by looking at it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of deep conditioners in my life to maintain my healthy-looking long mane, so of course I have high expectations with each new product I try ‚Äî comparing and contrasting all the different brands, from the cheap to uber expensive.</li>
            <li> I particularly suffer from extreme breakage each time I touch my hair.</li>
            <li> also when i used heat tool,s my hair kept a nice shine when usually my hair is dull.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m right or not.</li>
            <li> but once I went to dry my hair it still felt really soft.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is much thicker than typical conditioners.  </li>
            <li> This is obviously a powerful, concentrated deep conditioner, because a little of it went a long way.  </li>
            <li> Oil is hard to use because a little bit goes a long way and some people may not have such dry hair like I do, and need oil over a dangler or a good deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> After rinsing it definitely left my hair soft and after blow drying my hair was much fuller than it usually is.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally big, the type of big that&#x27;s seen on Pantene&#x27;s &#x27;Don&#x27;t hate me because I&#x27;m beautiful&#x27; commercial/ads.</li>
            <li> my hair was so dry from last winter and after trying the Aussie conditioner my hair is so soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Received a free sample of the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle through #BzzAgent and, with my thick, dry hair, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li> If this comment or any of my other efforts work to get them to go back to the older version, then I would definitely give the product 5 stars!</li>
            <li> In the winter, when my hair gets really dry, I sometimes scrunch a little dab into my ends, during the day and my hair drinks it right up and spruces my curls back to live.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remember, I have textured hair which means my hair is tightly coiled and with that comes fragile, really unmanageable hair on wash day.</li>
            <li> I have short fine hair and usually conditioner Waze my hair down.</li>
            <li> after one song she rinsed her hair, it was easy to rinse but left the hair feeling a bit slippery, of course this could be attributed to my soft water, I dried her hair and it looked healthy, no frizz and manageable, a bit less shiny than usual and a bit heavy, so I would recommend this product for after swimming or exercising or when your hair needs extra moisturizing but not for everyday use because it appears to me that it would cause a bit of buildup.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have thick and coarse hair, so most products are a let down, but not this!</li>
            <li> This can be both good and bad.</li>
            <li> I have highly processed hair, such as, I have dye between platinum blonde, to pink, back to platinum blonde, to grayish blonde back to pink, then to brown and eventually back to blonde..............</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that it not only left my hair soft, shiny, but fuller than usual.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and have very dry hair in the winter.  </li>
            <li> But this stuff really seems to tame them.  </li>
            <li> My hair is exposed almost daily to the flat iron and the blow dryer leaving my hair a bit crispy on the ends, especially in the front.</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;m left with simultaneously flat, frizzy, unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> They are the same price too, the one for &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; hair is for long hair, but it made my short hair grow dramatically!</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and usually I need a lot of product for a deep conditioning not with this one, this will last me a longer then most products.  </li>
            <li> I think it is so important that, despite it&#x27;s thick consistency, this conditioner does not weigh your hair down like you would imagine.</li>
            <li> i noticed that the actual conditioner was very thick and kind of hard to get out.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, as I don‚Äôt have dry or damaged hair, so unfortunately, no ‚Äúmiracles‚Äù were performed in my household.  </li>
            <li> dry as the Sahara Desert, but this left it feeling properly moisturized.</li>
            <li> After a few uses of this product I noticed my hair feels and looks much healthier after I blow dry it and use the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have just discovered the aussie line and am so happy that I did and mad that I&#x27;ve missing out all this time on it!</li>
            <li> The bottles are too small but this conditioner is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Long story short, my head is on fire and my hair is fried.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use my flat iron every day.</li>
            <li> THIS is the conditioner for me, it&#x27;s the only one I have used, since the first time I tried it, it&#x27;s very rich and even with my thick, dry curls, a little goes a long way, a bottle usually lasts me a month, washing my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> No waste at the end of the bottle or trying to prop it up so that the product rolls down to where you can access it and no need to close anything up.  </li>
            <li> What does that mean exactly?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really think of anything bad to say about it aside from the size of the bottle, but it is still cheap.</li>
            <li> My ends are typically dry however since using this product my hair feels quite different.</li>
            <li> For those suffering from dry, frizzy and unruly hair can totally count on this product.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product to people who have dry hair and need a boost of moisture in their hair routine.</li>
            <li> I think the product will actually let me start to grow my hair a bit since it seems to be doing wonders for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I relaxed my hair last week and it has been sooooo dry.</li>
            <li> and it left my dry in brittle.</li>
            <li> Normally I use some pricey products after showering to tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> Natural kinky hair is curly and sometimes very coily and  naturally it tends to be extremely dry because it hard for moisture to make it down the ends of our tresses due to all the twist and turns.</li>
            <li> The only thing I suggest is to use less conditioner if your hair is fine or thin.</li>
            <li> After this I will definitely look into trying their other products the next time I need hair care.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair which tangles easy</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky, and even helps a little with frizz in the summer.</li>
            <li> The deciding point for me was when I rinsed out and left my hair to dry because sometimes products work well while washing but as soon as I rinse out and dry</li>
            <li> I use it 2-3 times a week or whenever my hair feels extra dry and it always manages to refresh my hair and get rid of that crunchy dry end texture.</li>
            <li> Usually, I use a high end conditioning shampoo that is quite costly.</li>
            <li> It leave my hair feeling soft and looking silky, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like other deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find a conditioner that really works.</li>
            <li> If you have fine or thin hair you&#x27;ll likely find this conditioner to be too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the  3 Minute Miracle for anyone with thick, coarse hair like mine!</li>
            <li> The hair I have left isn&#x27;t colored, so I&#x27;m not sure I can provide a review of any substance besides my previous experience with Aussie products, all of which have been positive.</li>
            <li> I use it just like any usual conditioner except I leave it in for the 3-minute requirement and my hair is soft, silky, and the smell lasts until the next washing.  </li>
            <li> i only noticed minimal oil and no tangles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a shine to it that it hasn&#x27;t had in a long time.</li>
            <li> Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist replenished my long locks with three times the moisture.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> Cannot believe for the price and since it is not a professional product, will buy again</li>
            <li> It did leave my hair feeling soft and not too heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> About Me: I have fairly long hair of medium coarseness.</li>
            <li> No mess when my little sister goes to use it.</li>
            <li> THOUGH IT MAY BE A MINOR PROBLEM FOR SOME</li>
            <li> I am 31 &amp; have thick, straight, heavily-highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> : If you like voluminous hair, apply the deep conditioner only to the tips, or else it‚Äôll end up weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, I have very dry, curly hair and have tried endless products, from expensive salon products to store brands to masks...</li>
            <li> It broke off my hair and left ir very dry, wordt conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and it can very tangled and dry.</li>
            <li> Seriously I just took braids out after two weeks and usually I have a head full of tangles and with this it was next to none.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I have struggled with frizzy hair and dry ends for a long time</li>
            <li> I use regular Aussie shampoo and conditioner every other day of the week.</li>
            <li> (Red hair dye washes out faster than other colors.)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other deep conditioners that Aussie</li>
            <li> Sometimes I would shower using other products and it would leave my hair gross and greasy!</li>
            <li> I will be using this product for the rest of my life, hopefully they will make it that long!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to say I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Will definitely use this product again and look forward to trying the other varieties to meet my hair needs.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and curly hair, and I use intense moisturizing hair products regularly.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair.  </li>
            <li> dry frizzy and feel a bit lifeless from dryness.</li>
            <li> I have curl dry hair</li>
            <li> I would recommend this conditioning treatment if you have dry hair or even just dry ends.</li>
            <li> and it gets dry and damaged this helped hydrate it</li>
            <li> I too have curly hair that can get dry.</li>
            <li> I even notice a difference when I let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> I can either air dry or use a hair dryer</li>
            <li> I use this 1-2 times a week and also anytime my hair feels dry and crispy.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and needing some TLC.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, damaged, and over processed but this makes my hair feel like it washes away all of my hair problems.</li>
            <li> so my hair does get really dry sometimes</li>
            <li> Seriously, buy this product just to marvel at the wonders of modern engineering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have curly, dry, chemically processed hair that is prone to dandruff.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dry.</li>
            <li> i recommend this to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair up routinely for work, so the ends are usually dry and crispy.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry from getting it highlighted that I was thinking I was going to need to stop doing that altogether.  </li>
            <li> ONCE ITS DETANGLED AND DRY.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTERS HAIR FELT SOFTER AND HER DRY ENDS</li>
            <li> My hair was getting dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> My ends no longer look dry</li>
            <li> I waited to let it air dry</li>
            <li> Just looking at it you can tell it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is always dry</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair from all the heat damage</li>
            <li> My hair was dry, breaking and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Aussie‚Äôs 3 Minute Miracle Moist is one of the cheapest I‚Äôve tried, only costing a few bucks at my local superstore, so, admittedly, I wasn‚Äôt expecting ‚Äúmiracles.</li>
            <li> whenever I spend the extra few minutes leaving the deep conditioner in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this as my sole conditioner for the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> I keep this as an add in for deep conditioning which is a mixture of a few deep conditioners as well as some oil</li>
            <li> I used to have thick hair and used quite a bit of conditioner, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has changed.</li>
            <li> It is thin and fine and can get greasy, but if I don&#x27;t do a deep condition every once it a while, it gets dull and dry.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this for anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I use this deep conditioner without fail right after I shampoo and condition my hair.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and all you need is a quarter size amount for long hair, and a dime sized amount for short hair.</li>
            <li> My ends are usually dry due to using my flat iron often throughout the week</li>
            <li> I was kind of shocked when I seen my hair after it dried today because I only used gel</li>
            <li> My hair is usually frizzy and wild</li>
            <li> It was above average.</li>
            <li> I have thick African American hair with a very coarse texture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I slowed down on my use and my hair is breaking off bit by bit (the damaged color treated parts), I&#x27;m going to get back into using this again.</li>
            <li> With thinning hair the last thing I would have needed was something that weighed my hair down, which this does NOT do.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I have used moisturizing conditioners that only left my hair dry and brittle, like straw.</li>
            <li> My hair felt bristly and dry and I had split ends like nobody&#x27;s business!</li>
            <li> My hair felt so dry like straw!</li>
            <li> only small drawback is that the packaging makes me nervous in terms of potential messes.</li>
            <li> When I started using this product my hair was dry and the ends were rough.</li>
            <li> Leaves my long wavy thick hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> but i suggest using less of the product and only once a week.</li>
            <li> It made brushing through it the next day easier with less tangles.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the strong smell of coconut, but I don&#x27;t like the smell of coconut anyway.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair</li>
            <li> When it dries, my hair felt very dry and had some buildup.</li>
            <li> After using the &amp;#34;MOIST&amp;#34; a few times, I noticed it really helped tame my frizz!</li>
            <li> This is a little miracle in bottle, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I only need a little of this in my hair for it to work.</li>
            <li> It seemed that the conditioner is so moisturizing that if any moisture remained in my hair whatsoever when I lay my head down on the pillow (even if my hair felt dry to the touch), I would wake up with varying degrees of flat, limp, slightly frizzy and generally disobedient hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really manageable, but I had some tangles that were tough.</li>
            <li> Received this product from Aussie + was a little skeptical because it&#x27;s so cheap...</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to use, I hate a product that makes you stand in the shower for 10 long minutes before you can remove it, ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!</li>
            <li> It was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I mean could this really moisturize and transform my hair in as little as 3 minutes?</li>
            <li> After I shampooed, I followed the instructions and worked it into my wet hair.</li>
            <li> so thats rough on my hair too.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair tangled and rough.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t order it again online because it would be about 4dollars cheaper minus the shipping</li>
            <li> Feels like silk when wet.  </li>
            <li> When i deep condition it helps the process of my hair to control my fluffy hair...</li>
            <li> and it did what was expected</li>
            <li> No lid to try to unscrew with slippery wet hands.</li>
            <li> I only washed with shampoo, used the 3 minute miracle, then blow dried my hair without a brush.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hair wet</li>
            <li> It helped me through a wide variety of hair problems.</li>
            <li> It can make it harder to comb through and can feel like straw.</li>
            <li> They must have changed it sometime in the last few years because it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Such an odd combination!  </li>
            <li> Before using Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Deep Conditioner, my hair was dull and flat.</li>
            <li> I use a blow dryer and a flat iron a few times a week</li>
            <li> Like any other Black woman it takes me a long time to do my hair.</li>
            <li> It becomes pretty difficult to remove once it gets wet</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, color-treated hair, and I tend to use deep conditioners once a week in order to hydrate my hair.</li>
            <li> I will never turn to any other product but this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use other Aussie products as my taste has changed over the years</li>
            <li> (Probably due in part to hydrating ingredients like Aloe Leaf Extract and Jojoba Seed Oil.)  </li>
            <li> (I wash my hair every other day.)</li>
            <li> maybe once a week or every other week.  </li>
            <li> I usually put it on from the middle of my hair to the ends and then shave so it takes up the 3 minutes</li>
            <li> My long hair is overdue for a cut, so it‚Äôs kept my dried tips hydrated and not overly brittle</li>
            <li> After my hair was dry (air dried), I noticed my hair was shinier and sleeker with the ends being less dry than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to carry around when you travel.</li>
            <li> ( Due to the silicones)</li>
            <li> the other products in this line</li>
            <li> Aussie is what I prefer over other brands for my hair and they continue to slay with this product.</li>
            <li> , i would recommend it for my friends and family , and i would buy it again , and buy other products from aussie to my hair .</li>
            <li> If you just toss it in your bag, the pressure from other items may cause it to leak.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> No more having to shake and pound the conditioner bottles to get that last bit of conditioner out!</li>
            <li> well spent honey!</li>
            <li> I tried the product for 3 weeks using it every other day.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other time I shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aussie, PLEASE do NOT do like other companies have done and change the formula on a product that DOES NOT need any fixing.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I apply a decent amount to my hair after rising out my shampoo and leave it in for at least 3 minutes, usually while I shave my legs.</li>
            <li> I have a very rough and frizzy hair type.</li>
            <li> BUT this deep condtioner changed all that it cuts the time in half!!</li>
            <li> Overall, despite the affordability and availability of Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioning Treatment, I will not repurchase this product again due to its lackluster results and poor smell.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair and often find that I have trouble finding a conditioner that truly adds moisture to my hair; this one does wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I have used many expensive deep conditioners on my dry, frizzy hair with unhappy result.</li>
            <li> I am very particular about what I use in my hair so this was scary for me</li>
            <li> There is a big difference when I use this product, letting it sit in my hair for at least 3 minutes, and other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I use conditioner every single day and still find my hair being dry and hard to fix.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes so well and adds shine back to my dull hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also affordable, which is hard to find when it comes to deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> I suspect it will be hard to get the ends of the bottle out when I get down to the last bits.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that I found this at Target for $2.99.</li>
            <li> And, in my experience, it does leave hair noticeable smoother (at least to the person whose hair it is) compared to regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and it&#x27;s coarse.</li>
            <li> Not only did I use it for myself but also for my daughters who also have course thick hair...</li>
            <li> Aussie 3 Minute Miracle is a super-thick deep conditioner that does miracles to keep my thick hair in check.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t squirt out, even when the bottle is upside down.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, curly, dry, damaged, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Humidity is my enemy when it comes to my hair and with this conditioner I feel that my frizz has gone down a lot.</li>
            <li> This did not weigh my hair down, instead it repaired damage from coloring.</li>
            <li> I would say my frizz-o-meter was down by about 30%.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down</li>
            <li> I have bleached hair half-way down my head (ombre effect)</li>
            <li> I never see my color going down the drain when using either version.</li>
            <li> And it does not weigh down her curls or fade my color.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this conditioner even if you have long hair!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Other conditioners tend to weigh my hair down, and make it limp and flat and icky.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical over a $3 bottle of deep conditioner, but I was also very surprised when it worked!  </li>
            <li> Next is how thick this conditioner is which communicates the fact that a little of this goes a loooooong way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> With this shampoo, I have to dye it less often.</li>
            <li> Now I use it three times each week and my hair is stronger, healthier &amp; there&#x27;s way less breakage.</li>
            <li> which I like because I have slightly wavy hair and don&#x27;t want that to go away</li>
            <li> There is also noticeably less frizz when I move on to styling .</li>
            <li> typically nothing helps.  </li>
            <li> Hair type and products typically used always play a factor in how well it works for you</li>
            <li> BUT IN THIS CASE MY ROOTS GOT LESS OF A CHANGE -_-</li>
            <li> It does seem thicker and rinses cleaner with less residue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit odd.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any idea what makes the product for color-treated hair any different from regular 3 Minute Miracle and was unable to detect any difference.  </li>
            <li> I just put it my hair while shaving and by the time i was done my hair was no longer a dry mess!!  </li>
            <li> It has eliminated the need for other hair care products  to help tame my hair frustrations.</li>
            <li> Aussie moist shampoo and conditioner make my hair super dry and rough, and it smells horrible, and this 3 minute miracle moist does not make it any better, never ever had anything this bad.</li>
            <li> i found that after a few washes my hair did not feel nearly as dry as it usually does.</li>
            <li> do have dry air, thin, but a lot, and a bit long.</li>
            <li> My hair is a tangled mess when I get in the shower.</li>
            <li> The Three Minute Miracle doesn&#x27;t leave you disappointed and although I got it free</li>
            <li> I also have really long and thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair and frizz is my number one enemy.  </li>
            <li> I really did expect to receive the same at home results but was sadly disappointed to found out that  wasn&#x27;t gonna happen.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, dry hair, this conditioner is a godsend.  </li>
            <li> I like to add a little drop to my damp hair as a leave on conditioner as well</li>
            <li> A little curlier</li>
            <li> and sticking to the curly girl method it takes me a little longer then ususal.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down either!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the ability of this conditioner to completely lock in smoothness and keep the frizz out of my hair for an entire day!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x27;Moist&#x27; in this case leaves hair conditioned, fluffy and repaired.  </li>
            <li> and when I blow dried my hair</li>
            <li> so I towel/air dried after use</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> Also, I did not enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> It has removed the need for extra leave in conditioners after washing and conditioning and decreased frizz after blow drying and straightening.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, this product may work well for others but did not fit well for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried homemade, over the counter, and salon deep conditioners/hair masks, but end up with worse results than what I started with.</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND TO GIVE THIS ITEM A TRY FOR A FEW DOLLARS</li>
            <li> After my hair dried if felt and looked healthier and softer.</li>
            <li> The product is thick and not watery like some other conditioners.</li>
            <li> Why they don&#x27;t put this symbol in plain view is beyond me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel stiff like some...</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week and seems to tame my hair well.</li>
            <li> It has tame my hair in ways I have never imagined before.</li>
            <li> Tried this on my daughter&#x27;s very thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li> After using this once  my hair was crazy soft &amp; it continues to get softer with every use (every 3-4 days)!!</li>
            <li> My hair was still in pretty bad shape</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble in the past with aussie products causing me acne</li>
            <li> I rinsed my hair and then dried and styled it as usual.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, unruly, dry hair</li>
            <li> (I usually use a wide tooth comb) and this was done on two week old hair that was knotting badly.</li>
            <li> Little bit hard to squeeze</li>
            <li> There is very little to no scent.  </li>
            <li> Being that I like to have my hair straight, using a blowdryer and a straightener can put some bad damage on my hair.</li>
            <li> Daily hair frustrations are merely minutes of your morning now.</li>
            <li> (I have wavy hair and usually my ends</li>
            <li> Usually by the end of my work day my hair is oily and tangled.</li>
            <li> it did not get frizzy like it usually does.  </li>
            <li> I will be switching from the expensive product I currently use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my schedule doesn‚Äôt regularly allow for that</li>
            <li> My daily hair frustrations are merely minutes of my morning now.</li>
            <li> I usually put the conditioner in at the end and tie my hair up so that is doesn&#x27;t get rinsed out for the 3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wash my hair with my usual shampoo and then apply the Aussie condition and wait out the three minutes (shaving, washing my face, etc....</li>
            <li> Initially thought the packaging is weird</li>
            <li> it is not like your usual shower bottle.</li>
            <li> , I have a history of oily skin/scalp, so this isn&#x27;t out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> I made no change to my usual routine.</li>
            <li> It tops any of the expensive masques and in shower deep conditioners for a quarter of the cost.  </li>
            <li> But no so thick that you had trouble distributing it throughout your hair.</li>
            <li> and when I washed it , it was not tangled as much as I usually have.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy (but not cute wavy-</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes your dry brittle hair softer and less frizzy in this cold weather time.</li>
            <li> I struggle with dry and frizzy hair unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Before I used it my hair was really dull, not truly damaged</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to avoid them so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> My hair length is longer and that makes hard to manage .</li>
            <li> It is hard to control the amount of conditioner coming out of it.</li>
            <li> We have hard water</li>
            <li> It still works well, smells a little different than I remember but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> my hair is thick and wavy so its hard to keep it manageable...</li>
            <li> I had a baby just over a year ago, and the postpartum hair loss was not kind.</li>
            <li> I know some people have complained about the watery consistency of the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Moist  lately, and I can tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the bottle, as it can be difficult to squeeze with wet hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually insane how cheap this is.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it 2 years ago because I thought I wouldn&#x27;t need it anymore after cutting my hair short.</li>
            <li> I have THICK, wavy, unmanageable hair.  </li>
            <li> The Moist version I tried was thick and not watery at all.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my thick, courtly Indian hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick frizzy hair that takes forever to control of.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick conditioner so it can make my roots look oily</li>
            <li> If you use a lot of products that damage your hair or need some heavy conditioning for your hair buy and use!!</li>
            <li> In addition, the product&#x27;s scent subtly lingers in my hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical before using the conditioner because my hair is so unpredictable.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is subtle and non-flowery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used fancier brands that cost a ridiculous amount of money and they didn&#x27;t work as well as this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious.</li>
            <li> The smell may be a little weird to some people</li>
            <li> This product truly is a miracle to help restore moisture to my thick hair!</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t change your hair type, so my hair remains somewhat frizzy if I air dry, but it&#x27;s not as bad</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical upon trying this product, as other Aussie product had not worked on my hair (very thick, frizzy, wavy).</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> As for consistency, the conditioner is very thick.</li>
            <li> Probably a lot of people unnecessarily throwing the bottle in the trash by accident.)  </li>
            <li> THE POOR THING WAS ITCHING</li>
            <li> so it looked damaged and unhealthy.</li>
            <li> and I have never experienced anything like it.</li>
            <li> Also, there are unnecessary chemicals in this product I would prefer not to expose my family to.  </li>
            <li> The price is not that bad compared to other products on the market that sayyyyy it helps improve health of your hair and repairs...</li>
            <li> However, this could be the result of a long overdue hair appointment to chop away all those nasty little split ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some time ago, I damaged my hair with a bad dye job; even though I&#x27;ve been cutting the ends off every few months, a few inches of the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; remains.  </li>
            <li> I have to tell all my friends about this product, so they too can have a less painful washday experience.</li>
            <li> AT LEAST once!!</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have weird hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful I do not have to spend a lot of money on expensive hair masks anymore.</li>
            <li> and its not that expensive.</li>
            <li> I tried it expecting nothing to happen, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using all these expensive hair masks that have to sit in your hair for ~20 minutes to make any difference.</li>
            <li> So needless to say</li>
            <li> For $3 you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> but it made my hair weirdly frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for close to a month now, and have noticed a DRAMATIC change in my hair!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me thats impossible, because my hair will not cooperate that way.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me thats impossible, because my hair will not cooperate that way.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything but cutting it in an attempt to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> This made using it unpleasant, which should not be the case for conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have had issues with frizz and with this product my curls seem to curl not become frizzy messes, even in bad weather days.</li>
            <li> It turns any bad hair day into an Aussome one.</li>
            <li> or it looks bad.</li>
            <li> so I was a bit frustrated with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on day 3 of this stuff and honestly, as much as I hate to say it ...</li>
            <li> I have terribly heat damaged hair!</li>
            <li> I have horrible frizzy hair and wear it in a pony tail all the time</li>
            <li> this is insane~!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this item free from BZZ Agent and I never really heard of using an Aussie Product on natural hair, but this worked WONDERS!  I used it on my daughter&#x27;s 4c coarse natural hair and it instantly became easier to detangle and provided a lot of slip.  It has a thicker consistency so I would advise against using it as a leave-in conditioner.  After I rinsed it out, my daughter&#x27;s hair retained moisture and had way more manageability than when I&#x27;ve used other products.  I definitely recommend using this product if your hair tends to soak up moisture and for easier detangling.</li>
            <li> I have terribly heat damaged hair! I have tried everything but cutting it in an attempt to get rid of it. Well here&#x27;s the miracle I was looking for! Literally after one use those straight ends began to curl up! Even the more severe damage I have is looking better! Daily hair frustrations are merely minutes of your morning now. I got to try it free to try Thanks to being a Bzz Agent and Aussie!</li>
            <li> I think his product is great. I normally have very dry hair and it&#x27;s always on top of my head in a messy bun based on my work. I was excited to get this product through bzzagent promotions and after one use my hair is soft and supple.  I just put it my hair while shaving and by the time i was done my hair was no longer a dry mess!!  It&#x27;s simple quick and easy, it would be silly not to use it regularly!!!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing............I&#x27;m always hesitant when it comes to trying frizz control products.  I have THICK, wavy, unmanageable hair.  This product tames it, makes it softer, and in an all around better condition.  I love the way my hair feels and LOOKS after I use this stuff!!  This was part of a bzzagent campaign that I received to try for free, so I figured, what the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a try...........but it&#x27;s part of my regular routine now!  LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> Got the chance to try the 3 Minute Miracle(moist) free for testing purposes from Aussie and within just one use, my hair felt brand new, soft, shiny &amp; overall healthy!!!. It was absolutley amazing. I love how affordable this product is and how I don&#x27;t have to spend a ton of money on a deep conditioner to get the same results. I can easily take a trip to my local drugstore and pick up one or a few! and did I mention how delicious the smell is? yummy coconuts that still lingered after one day. Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing its the only conditioner and product that has reduced the frizz in just two days I was kind of shocked when I seen my hair after it dried today because I only used gel normally I use hairspray to keep the frizz away and my hair was perfectly curly bouncy and no frizz.</li>
            <li> I received Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle Moist for free from the brand to test out and review. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for the first time, my first impression is that Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle Moist sure does the job of a deep conditioner. After I shampooed, I followed the instructions and worked it into my wet hair. (I avoided my scalp since the richness of conditioners tend to break me out, but that wasn&#x27;t particular to this product.) The consistency of the conditioner was not watered down and also not too thick - easy to spread and made it very easy to detangle my hair with my fingers. With regards to the scent, personally I enjoyed it smells of tropical fruits (I believe I smelled coconut and pineapple in there).  I left the conditioner in for about 3 minutes and rinsed it - easy enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After letting my hair air-dry, I could definitely see that my strands were less frizzy and they felt more hydrated and smoother. (I have wavy hair and usually my ends dry frizzy and feel a bit lifeless from dryness. But after using 3 Minute Miracle Moist my hair felt like it had more substance to it - hydration I&#x27;d say.) In addition, the product&#x27;s scent subtly lingers in my hair. Actually, I used the product yesterday afternoon, and today the yummy scent is still in my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while I&#x27;d give the product 5/5 stars for its ease of use and performance, I did have some critiques on the packaging. (These are just things I noticed and am bringing up in the interest of giving a complete review, but they in no way affected my thoughts on the product itself.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The instructions don&#x27;t state how frequently the product could/should be used. I was left wondering &amp;#34;can I use this every day in place of my regular conditioner?&amp;#34; Since it is a deep conditioner I assumed that it&#x27;s best to just use it 2 - 3 times a week at most to avoid weighing down my hair but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m right or not. I think it&#x27;d be helpful if guidance was given in the instructions so that consumers don&#x27;t need to guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The white bottom part of the bottle where the condition is dispensed from looks a bit cheap - it reminds me of a factory sample as opposed to the finished product. The dispenser seems to work just fine so I have no problems with it functionally, but I wanted to point out that it&#x27;s not as aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical before using the conditioner because my hair is so unpredictable. I use conditioner every single day and still find my hair being dry and hard to fix. Usually, while drying my hair, it just falls out in my fingers leaving me with what feels like a full head of hair all over my bathroom sink. This morning, I shampooed my hair like normal and then used the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist conditioner for 2 minutes, 45 seconds like the bottle said. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the strong smell of coconut, but I don&#x27;t like the smell of coconut anyway. After the time had passed, I washed the conditioner out and didn&#x27;t really feel any difference just upon washing it out. However, when I went to dry my hair, I had very minimal hair come out, leaving me with a clean bathroom sink! My hair also had more volume and was much easier to style. The smell of coconut also went away, just leaving me with fresh-smelling, awesome hair! I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I just tried the Aussie 3 minute conditioner I got free from BzzAgent and I have to say I really liked it my hair was so dry from last winter and after trying the Aussie conditioner my hair is so soft and manageable I really loved the smell as well I really recommend it</li>
            <li> Omg I love this product and totally recommend it.thanks to bzzagent I got to try this beautiful product and I&#x27;m loving it.it smells super good makes your hair shine and soft</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgnet and Aussie for giving me the opportunity to test and review Aussie 3 minute Miracle for free. I already love the Aussie brand, so I knew i would love their new product. I struggle with dry and frizzy hair unfortunately. I love the scent of the product and how it gives my hair a natrual shine. I did notice that when i use this product my hair doesn&#x27;t turn into a big afro frizz ball when I let it air dry, which I&#x27;m so happy about. Makes it easier for me to straighten my hair. I don&#x27;t need to add adition products to control the frizz. So it&#x27;s going to save me money. The product isn&#x27;t too expensive. I hope you all get the chance to try out this product.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product free and as a promotion thanks to Aussie and Bzzagent and I am happy that I did. As a natural curly/kinky hair girl moisture is everything. I particularly suffer from extreme breakage each time I touch my hair. Natural kinky hair is curly and sometimes very coily and  naturally it tends to be extremely dry because it hard for moisture to make it down the ends of our tresses due to all the twist and turns. Therefore it is essential to use products that will maximize moisture. At first I was a bit skeptical about trying this product, just because it is not a brand I am  familiar with for my hair type and when I looked at the ingredients some things were a flag for me. This product does have dimethicone which is a non soluble silicone that can cause build up on hair and many people warn against it. It also has fragrance/parfum which can be drying to the hair. However I decided to use this product on my hair anyway because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It does have water listed as the first ingredient which is a plus&lt;br /&gt;2. Even though it does have silicone that isn&#x27;t water soluble , there are ways to work around this by using a ACV rinse or a clarifying shampoo&lt;br /&gt;3. Although fragrances can be drying , it is listed as the 7th ingredient which means compared to the first or second ingredient it doesn&#x27;t have as much.&lt;br /&gt;4. It has aloe and jojoba oil, which are both great for my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impressions/ what stood out first was the bottle and design. It has a nice twist and squeeze feature with grip indentations on the sides which makes for a nice hold. So even though your hands are wet or slippery, it is easy to handle the bottle, get the product out and tend to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell and Texture: It has a very nice sweet and subtle smell and not too overwhelming. The product is thick and not watery like some other conditioners. This can be both good and bad. I do find that conditioners that are a bit more watery are easier to apply to my hair. That&#x27;s not to say this product wasn&#x27;t. It just took a bit more time to apply because I work in sections with my hair and need a bit more product for full coverage. Once I get my hair coated, it doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of it, it does mix nicely with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work: Yes, sorta. What I mean by this is that for my hair texture I need a little more than 3 minutes because I don&#x27;t feel like its enough for full penetration especially as a stand alone product. (I usually deep condition with a hair steamer) As the product says sit for 2 mins and 45 secs, rinse then go. Unfortunately for me thats impossible, because my hair will not cooperate that way. I did notice that after incorporating this deep conditioner in my hair care routine, that my hair was noticeably softer and a bit more manageable. But I have to follow up with the L.O.C (leave-in, oil, cream) method with styling to keep my hair in a manageable state. I also noticed when styling for going out, that it was easier to manipulate my hair, I have a decrease in breakage (after 2.5 weeks of use), and I had a bit more shine with more curl definition and less fizzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: It is definitely worth trying because no two individuals are the same. Of course what it did or didn&#x27;t do for me, may or maynot be the same results for you. But I will make this product apart of my hair routine because I was satisfied with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#Gotitfree #BzzAgenthair. That&#x27;s not to say this product wasn&#x27;t.

            <li> I received  this deep conditioner on behalf of Aussie to try out for free. I tried it out the same day. i noticed that the actual conditioner was very thick and kind of hard to get out. I applied it all over my hair. It instantly felt like it was moisturizing my hair. I left it in for the three minutes and shaved my legs in the meantime. Once i rinsed it, my hair felt so soft and silky. My hair tangles very easy but once I went to dry my hair it still felt really soft. I did not style my hair but my hair stayed soft and frizz free all day. Usually by the end of my work day my hair is oily and tangled. i only noticed minimal oil and no tangles. I would definitely recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> What a great product. After just a couple days my hair is smoother, feels softer, and with just 3 mins in the shower easy. It has eliminated the need for other hair care products  to help tame my hair frustrations. I have had issues with frizz and with this product my curls seem to curl not become frizzy messes, even in bad weather days. I received it free from Aussie to try, but I am throwing out out my old conditioner (Paul Mitchell) and weekly hair treatments for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I use this to condition my hair and weaves every 2 - 3 weeks. It makes my hair so soft and healthy and it smells great.</li>
            <li> This is a little miracle in bottle, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! This awesome Aussie conditioner gave live back to my dead mane! I was suffering from super dry hair after having a baby. In just 3 minutes, my hair is now back to the shiny, manageable locks they once were. The best part is spending so little time and getting so much in return! I have tried other deep conditioners in the past, but thanks to Aussie and BzzAgent, I was able to try this product for free and fell in love! I will never turn to any other product but this one. If you want wonderfully healthy, hydrated, shiny hair then don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this now!</li>
            <li> I have weird hair. It is thin and fine and can get greasy, but if I don&#x27;t do a deep condition every once it a while, it gets dull and dry. I use this conditioner once a week and it works wonders! It leave my hair feeling soft and looking silky, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like other deep conditioners. I use regular Aussie shampoo and conditioner every other day of the week. I love it! I got to try this product for free thanks to Aussie!</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free thanks to Aussie, I must admit i&#x27;m glad that I did. I have horrible frizzy hair and wear it in a pony tail all the time so thats rough on my hair too. My hair feels healthier, hydrated and is shines. There is also a great scent left behind that I love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to try this product for a while, so when I was offered to try it free through BzzAgent, I jumped on it! And I&#x27;m glad I did! I use the Aussie 3 minute miracle once a week and my hair has never been healthier! It&#x27;s so fast and easy to use, I just put it in after I shampoo, continue my shower, and rinse when I&#x27;m ready to get out. That&#x27;s it! Three minutes in the shower for a week of soft, shiny hair! AND it smells AMAZING! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a quick and easy fix to dry, frizz-prone hair.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Deeeeep\\&quot; version of the 3 minute miracle is no substitute for the original.  It leaves my hair tangled and rough.  I really wish they would stop monkeying around with something that just worked.</li>
            <li> I use to use this when I ran out of the deep conditioner that hair dye comes with. Now that I mix my own from Sally&#x27;s(no longer in a box) I use this instead of that conditioner. It&#x27;s great for everyday conditioning, but there&#x27;s not a lot of it.I wish it came in a bigger bottle! :C It&#x27;s really gentle on my hair color. Most conditioners make my red hair run. (Red hair dye washes out faster than other colors.) With this shampoo, I have to dye it less often.Can&#x27;t really think of anything bad to say about it aside from the size of the bottle, but it is still cheap. I love the packaging. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> I used this many years ago and liked it. Don‚Äôt remember why I stopped using it‚Ä¶  It still works well, smells a little different than I remember but not in a bad way. It left my hair feeling a little heavier than my daily conditioner but that could be what also left it feeling better conditioned.  Glad I got the chance to start using this again and I‚Äôll continue with using it as my hair needs deeper conditioning.</li>
            <li> Aussie 3 Minute Miracle &#x27;Moist&#x27; Deep Conditioner seems to take off from the regular Aussie 3 Minute Miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Moist&#x27; in this case leaves hair conditioned, fluffy and repaired.  Guess that is the &#x27;moist&#x27; part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great affordable conditioner.  Have been using Aussie products for some time and they are consistent in their delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honing in on individual hair needs and selecting from their array of products always yields fine results.</li>
            <li> Works really well in my hair love this product</li>
            <li> I used to use Aussie products way back in college. One of my college roommates absolutely love this stuff and she would lend me her conditioner on occasion. I have thick curly hair and it&#x27;s coarse. I have to use a lot of conditioner to keep the curls shiny, not frizzy. This three minute moist deep conditioner works great. It also smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine is one specially made to keep hair color longer especially if you highlight or color your hair. I haven&#x27;t noticed if it kept the color or not since I have just started using it (and I need to color my hair again soon). I do notice that my hair is softer and curlier on the days I do use this. I often use it for longer than the three minutes that it suggests, simply because I want to. I don&#x27;t use other Aussie products as my taste has changed over the years but I supplement with this. And I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this for anyone with thick hair. It does help tame down the frizz and it smells great. The price is right as well, considering how much more expensive other hair products are. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product is not the same as the older version.  The older version was awesome!  They&#x27;ve obviously changed something because it doesn&#x27;t work like it used to! If this comment or any of my other efforts work to get them to go back to the older version, then I would definitely give the product 5 stars! As it is... maybe not even three stars!  I have extremely fine hair that tangles very very easily!  I have such a problem with tangles that I have to constantly work to keep my hair healthy if I want to have my hair just over soldier length. I have used nearly every deep condition or dangler on the market.  Most of them don&#x27;t work!  I have found that Natural 7 Oil - Argan Oil - from Proclaim works very well.  Oil is hard to use because a little bit goes a long way and some people may not have such dry hair like I do, and need oil over a dangler or a good deep conditioner. But the exception of this oil product, the Aussie 3 minute miracle really was a 3 minute miracle! It was a product that stood strong and worked better than any other product.  Then they had to go change the ingredients sometime in the last 3 years, so this product is just OK.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample through bzzagent for Aussie 3 Minute Miracle MOIST and it is the best. I have long thick hair and it can very tangled and dry. I am very particular about what I use in my hair so this was scary for me but I&#x27;m glad I did. This stuff is awesome! It has left my hair moist, fizz free, smelling good and no longer tangled when I get out the shower. It is very wasy to open and the packaing is super easy to store and use. I recommend this to anyone. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Everything was ok. Thanks</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat this stuff. I have thick, wavy (but not cute wavy- wavy that demands style or an up-do) hair that has a tendency to dry out fast, and this product really helps bring back control, shine, and softness. I love that it just takes a few minutes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only small drawback is that the packaging makes me nervous in terms of potential messes. There is no cap; it&#x27;s a straight squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, I have very dry, curly hair and have tried endless products, from expensive salon products to store brands to masks... THIS is the conditioner for me, it&#x27;s the only one I have used, since the first time I tried it, it&#x27;s very rich and even with my thick, dry curls, a little goes a long way, a bottle usually lasts me a month, washing my hair every other day. I also love the way it smells,kind of happy, fruity. In the winter, when my hair gets really dry, I sometimes scrunch a little dab into my ends, during the day and my hair drinks it right up and spruces my curls back to live.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only aussie product I use, I have tried their shampoos and was not that impressed, this conditioner, however is 5 stars and two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion from the company, to review,  and all I can say is, This stuff is amazing,  my hair went from fried frizz,  to manageable and has actually grown some! It is on my list of  &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34; beauty list.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner.  I have very thick, curly hair and it make my hair feel soft and look shiny,  I use it every time I shampoo.  I have used no other conditioner that has given me such great results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deep conditioner for over a week now and I love it! I have curly hair and any extra boost of moisture that I can get I&#x27;ll take it! It truly does get the job done in just 3 minutes and you can&#x27;t beat that. My curls are so soft and bouncy I love it! Humidity is my enemy when it comes to my hair and with this conditioner I feel that my frizz has gone down a lot. I know when it&#x27;s time to use it again because my hair looks different. I style my hair with Aussie mouse and hair spray too so I know that&#x27;s an added bonus. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other deep conditioners that Aussie offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product for free thanks to Aussie and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> LOVED the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle. It was amazing to my normally, frizzy, thick hair. It made my hair softer, smoother and easier to manage. I loved how strong my hair felt afterwards as well. I highly recommend this product. I was able to sample this product, courtesy of Aussie. It made my once unmanageable hair, soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells amazing!!!! I would buy it again just for the smell of it!!! I won&#x27;t order it again online because it would be about 4dollars cheaper minus the shipping just go to go Walmart and buy it there. For me this conditioner worked pretty well but it didn&#x27;t feel like it really helped my hair anymore than a normal non deep conditioner would. It didn&#x27;t make it soft or healthier but it did make it much easier to de tangle and unless your willing to pay major bucks, thats all you really can expect from a deep conditioner. I did like this one better then the garnier frutis one that is around the same price as this.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I have curl dry hair and I&#x27;m always in the search for products that will help me moisture and keep my curls hydrated, and this does both. Before I used it my hair was really dull, not truly damaged but like it almost had no life. Well, after a couple times I was able to see a difference, my hair does not only look better now but it&#x27;s more manageable and it&#x27;s overall healthier. It is also very easy to use, I hate a product that makes you stand in the shower for 10 long minutes before you can remove it, ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that! So this 3 minute formula is perfect for me. I would recommend this product for everyone out there who needs a hair product that really does what it claims, it is also a great value. I tried this product for free thanks to Aussie.</li>
            <li> Received a free sample of the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle through #BzzAgent and, with my thick, dry hair, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. Boy, am I glad I did! After just one use, my dry, bleached highlights became super soft and so manageable! Normally I use some pricey products after showering to tame the frizz. With the 3 Minute Miracle, I didn&#x27;t have to use a thing! Talk about wash and wear- every extra minute is SO helpful for this busy working mom of three!</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and have very dry hair in the winter.  I used a smoothing shampoo and then used this Aussie 3 minute miracle conditioner.  I really saturated my head and piled my hair on top of my head for the 3 minutes.  I did notice it is much smoother and when I blow dried my hair it did not get frizzy like it usually does.  I would recommend this conditioning treatment if you have dry hair or even just dry ends.</li>
            <li> i love this product :)</li>
            <li> good  i will buy it ainÔºÅ&lt;br /&gt;very good</li>
            <li> Aussie&#x27;s 3-Minute Miracle is by far the HOLY GRAIL of deep conditioners in my books. I have armpit length, fine color-treated hair and if I don&#x27;t regularly deep condition my hair it ends up looking dry, so I&#x27;m always on the crusade for the perfect product. Most of em, even salon-grade products, have left my hair looking limp or greasy after using them (even when I use a teensy bit!)... but NOT 3 Minute Miracle. I&#x27;ve been using it once a week since I got it, and I LOVE it! After the 3 minutes is up and I rinse my hair, my hair is SUPER soft, and shiny too... Its also really managable and i noticed that my hair has a bit of a bounce to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing: It smells FANTASTIC! So in the end, whether you have thin, fine hair like mine, or really thick and coarse hair, I recommend it to everybody who wants shiny, silky hair without interrupting their busy lifestyles or breaking the bank :)</li>
            <li> WOW! The other reviewers were right. This is the best moisturizing hair mask I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have tried a variety of much more expensive hair salon brands. You will not regret spending $3 to achieve amazingly soft, strong hair.</li>
            <li> WOW! This product is worth every bit of hype! I use it myself and mostly on my daughter, who has extremely curly gair that is prone to dryness.. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and really liked it so much that I purchased another bottle from Amazon.. the promotion provided me with 2 bottles.. one of which was taken by one of my relatives who enjoyed the product just as much as I did when she tried it while applying it to my daughters mane.its definitely a great product and the price for what you get is the icing on top! So don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase!!</li>
            <li> Before using Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Deep Conditioner, my hair was dull and flat. Sometimes I would shower using other products and it would leave my hair gross and greasy! I was excited to try this product when I received it! I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, and I can tell you I absolutely LOVE this product! My hair has never felt so clean and healthy! My hair even looks fuller and is easier to style! I will continuing using this product on my hair! Its a lifesaver! Thanks Aussie for making a great product! Thank you to Bzzagent and Aussie for letting me try the product for free!</li>
            <li> This 3 minute conditioner really moisturizes your hair.  I could tell in the bath it comprehensively moisturizes it.  No tangles.  Feels like silk when wet.  You wash your hair, apply moisturizer and relax for 3 minutes.  When dry, your hair is smooth and has a sheen.  Fragrance is subtle and non-flowery.  Delighted with this product.  It does what it says.</li>
            <li> Nice ! Out of my expectations. The hair is very supple.</li>
            <li> I received 2 bottles of Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Conditioner FREEEEEEEE via bzzagent.com ..  I must say that I am very happy with this product. My ends are typically dry however since using this product my hair feels quite different. It looks silky and this conditioner makes my hair smell really good. Additionally my ends no longer look dry  thanks to Aussie 3 minute miracle and to Bzz Agent. #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
            <li> Nice price and good quality</li>
            <li> My Wife and my young daughter both are very lucky to have thick hair . They both tried the conditioner and said it was very good and had a fresh and silky feeling. I asked them was it impressive.. they said it is \\&quot;Good\\&quot;. However both of them said it smells different  and will update you after couple more uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will leave it at that.!</li>
            <li> I have so many great things to say about this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It has an amazing scent! I think it smells just like coconuts and I LOVE the smell of coconuts!&lt;br /&gt;2. I love the packaging it comes in! It&#x27;s so easy to use and fun to squirt it out!&lt;br /&gt;3. Most importantly, it leaves your hair feeling so soft and smooth! When I apply it, it feels so good on my hair. I leave it on for the duration of my shower and then I rinse it out with cool water. After it&#x27;s all washed out, you can just feel the softness in my hair. Sometimes I&#x27;ll use it as a deep, deep conditioning treatment and leave it on for 30-40 minutes with a plastic cap on and it makes my hair even better!&lt;br /&gt;4. The scent lasts in your hair which I love! It smells so good and I love smelling it on my hair all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second bottle and I&#x27;ll always repurchase the moist one! I highly reccommend it!</li>
            <li> Not the best. Contains harmful ingredients that can be carcinogenic.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have every used.  Leaves my hair silky smooth and no tangles.</li>
            <li> I received Aussie 3 Minute Miracle through bzzagent.com &amp; Aussie!  #gotitfree.  When I started using this product my hair was dry and the ends were rough. The first thing I noticed was how good it smelled! After the first time using it, I noticed my hair was much softer the next day.  I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and I absolutely love it! I use it at least once a week, and my hair feels great! I have also used it on my daughter and her hair doesnt get as tangled as before! Definitely a product I will keep buying!</li>
            <li> I received two bottles of the Aussie three-minute miracle from Bzzagent.com for free. I have very thick and curly hair, and I use intense moisturizing hair products regularly. So I was very excited to try this, but it really didn&#x27;t do much for me. My regular conditioner works better for me than this did. It also left a very strong coconut smell.  I think this would be better for people with slightly thinner hair than mine.</li>
            <li> I received this free from Aussie through BzzAgent. I was so excited to try something new for my dry, frizzy hair. Usually, I use a high end conditioning shampoo that is quite costly. I loved the faint coconut smell of this product right away. I don&#x27;t use a blow dryer so I towel/air dried after use and I was so happy with the results! I didn&#x27;t have to brush my hair after washing, which was a time saver a I have very long hair.  I was knot and tangle free even while wet! once my hair dried it was silky smooth and so soft without feeling weighed down. I&#x27;m in love with this product and would love to try the &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; next as I&#x27;ve had a lot of breakage since pregnancy. Thank you Aussie for letting me experience this product. I will be switching from the expensive product I currently use.</li>
            <li> Aussie 3 Minute Miracle conditioner rocks!  I noticed a difference after just one use and would even compare its effects to high priced salon brands.  This is truly my new go-to hair care product that I just cant live without.&lt;br /&gt; I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand</li>
            <li> I had a baby just over a year ago, and the postpartum hair loss was not kind. My hair has just been kind of dry and scraggly ever since, even after getting a hair cut. Between the baby and my three year old and my full time job though, I just don&#x27;t have time to do much for it. Enter  the Aussie three minute miracle treatment. I got this free from bzzagent and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. First of all, I love that I can just do it in the shower without taking any more time than regular conditioner. I put it on, then wash my face and soap up, then rinse it out and I&#x27;m good to go. But that wouldn&#x27;t matter if it didn&#x27;t work; luckily, it really does. After using it, my hair feels softer and looks so much healthier. It&#x27;s got a shine to it that it hasn&#x27;t had in a long time. I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I got to try out Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle.  This product is amazing and just what my hair needed.  It only takes a few minutes for this product to begin working it&#x27;s magic.  My hair is constantly being attacked by the hair dryer and curling iron.  This conditioner seemed to restore my hair to it&#x27;s smooth, touchable, silky self! #gotitfree</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioning product I have ever used. I have very dry hair and with one use my hair was left so soft and smooth! Definitely repurchasing after my free sample from bzzagent runs out.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this moisture treatment. I use it after I get my hair bleached and it does wonders. A++++</li>
            <li> excellent product. I arrive at the estimated time</li>
            <li> Aussie 3munute miracle is so easy to use.Love the way they designed the bottle no opening the top just squeeze.it leaves my hair so smooth and smells so good.My hair is so soft.I even started using it on my 8 and 9 year old.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair care products out there!  It leaves my hair feeling clean, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like other conditioners tend to do.  If you are either getting ready to color your hair, or you&#x27;ve just colored it, then this is definitely the product for you!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that I like to be smooth and sleek, but which can turn wavy and frizzy if I‚Äôm not using the right hair regimen.  Since Pantene discontinued their fantastic Texturize line, I‚Äôve been searching for the right product to replace it, so I was excited to be included in the new Aussie 3-Minute Miracle conditioner test for BzzAgent.  This new conditioner comes in five types:  Moist, Color, Shine, Strong, and Smooth.  If I had been shopping for myself, I would have selected Strong (as this variety generally tends to mimic Texturize the best) or Smooth.  I received Moist in the mail, though.  Not sure why, as I don‚Äôt have dry or damaged hair, so unfortunately, no ‚Äúmiracles‚Äù were performed in my household.  But I can still comment on the rest of my experience:  The Value - This is obviously a powerful, concentrated deep conditioner, because a little of it went a long way.  (Probably due in part to hydrating ingredients like Aloe Leaf Extract and Jojoba Seed Oil.)  I received two 8-ounce bottles for free for the test, and by the end of the test (a little less than two months later, washing my hair 3-4 times/week), I was just finishing the first bottle.  So at about $3/bottle on Amazon, it‚Äôs a VERY economical choice.  The Bottle ‚Äì a squeezable cylinder with ridges on the sides for grip ‚Äì is different from any shampoo bottle I‚Äôve ever used.  It fits comfortably in your hand and is very easy to use.  It also doesn‚Äôt have a cap, but the dispenser on the bottom never once leaked.  Very cool.  The only problem:  Nowhere on the bottle does it say it‚Äôs recyclable.  I thought all shampoo/conditioner bottles were these days.  Boo. (Edited 6/13/15:  If you unscrew the white cap, there&#x27;s a recycling symbol on the purple plastic underneath. Why they don&#x27;t put this symbol in plain view is beyond me. Probably a lot of people unnecessarily throwing the bottle in the trash by accident.)  The Consistency ‚Äì I know some people have complained about the watery consistency of the conditioner.  The Moist version I tried was thick and not watery at all.  The Scent ‚Äì While it‚Äôs on the coconut/tropical fruity side (think: sunscreen) - and I generally prefer floral ‚Äì it‚Äôs nevertheless pleasant when using the shampoo and leaves your hair smelling gently fragrant the next day.  The Look ‚Äì As for the look the conditioner gave my hair, I just could not get a consistent result.  Depending on how long I waited to use my hair dryer, or even (as a night-shower-er) how many hours I was awake after blow drying, I got different looks.  It seemed that the conditioner is so moisturizing that if any moisture remained in my hair whatsoever when I lay my head down on the pillow (even if my hair felt dry to the touch), I would wake up with varying degrees of flat, limp, slightly frizzy and generally disobedient hair.  If I showered in the morning or afternoon, however, then my hair looked sleek and radiant all day.  Unfortunately, my schedule doesn‚Äôt regularly allow for that so I would not buy Moist again.  However, the product has enough enough plusses (and is so affordable) that I would try Strong or Smooth next to give the line another go.</li>
            <li> I got this product as part of a promotion for the aussie brand and I love this product!  My daughter has curly hair that is often unruly and knotty.  This helps give her smooth, shiny, silky hair.  I use it for myself as well and am so pleased with how great it leaves my hair feeling.  This will definitely replace my old conditioner</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It left my hair soft and smooth. I def recommend this. I color my hair a lot and it gets dry and damaged this helped hydrate it</li>
            <li> Review of: Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner, 8 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife feels that the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle is one of the best conditioners she has ever used. She has a thick mane of hair and stated that this is one of the only products she has found that makes her hair silky smooth with no frizz or tangles which allows for her hairbrush to glide right through.  Wifey claims that combining hair oil treatment such as Argan Oil of Morocco for example after this conditioning provides her with perfect style and control.  She loves it.  That is good enough for me.  Five stars.</li>
            <li> I ws glad to see that I wan&#x27;t the only one to notice that the new product is not as good as the old one.  I wonder when this happens if they manage to save a tiny bit per container. I guess it would add up, but not if they lose customers.  I didn&#x27;t realize it until I had bought several on sale.  I won&#x27;t buy more after this.  Potion #9 leave in conditioner works pretty well.  I too have curly hair that can get dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful I do not have to spend a lot of money on expensive hair masks anymore. This cream is perfect for my dried colored frizzy hair. It leaves it shiny, soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got naturally curly hair, and I live in an exceptionally humid climate (it was over 80% humidity INSIDE at work the other day). It&#x27;s not a miracle, and for any of you with natural curls, you know that nothing IS. However this is a really good deep conditioner, for a low price. I use this, as well as other Aussie products, such as their Hair Insurance leave in conditioner spray, and my hair mostly behaves itself!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! My hair is double processed and heat styled which means it&#x27;s really damaged. This stuff makes a huge difference. The first time I used it I saw an instant boost in shine and hydration. Now I use it three times each week and my hair is stronger, healthier &amp; there&#x27;s way less breakage. I&#x27;ve used fancier brands that cost a ridiculous amount of money and they didn&#x27;t work as well as this. Aussie gave me a sample of 3 Minute Miracle through BzzAgent and now they have a repeat customer. Thanks Aussie!</li>
            <li> Aussie moist shampoo and conditioner make my hair super dry and rough, and it smells horrible, and this 3 minute miracle moist does not make it any better, never ever had anything this bad.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I received it as a promotion from a site, And I am grateful! Smells great and made my hair feel smooth, silky, shiny and allowed me to still style as I like it. Being that I like to have my hair straight, using a blowdryer and a straightener can put some bad damage on my hair. Until using 3 Minute Miracle Boost.  If you use a lot of products that damage your hair or need some heavy conditioning for your hair buy and use!!</li>
            <li> Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist replenished my long locks with three times the moisture. It strengthened, shined and smoothed my hair in 3 minutes, miraculously! I have fine hair and a lot of products make my hair greasy. This product did not!!!  My daily hair frustrations are merely minutes of my morning now. Plus, the smell is heavenly. I got to test this product for free thanks to Aussie! I am hooked and will continue to buy this product forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree, #DitchTheDrama and @AussieHair</li>
            <li> I use it after each shower I take (I wash my hair every other day.) I have used both the moist and strong ones from Aussie. The &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; one is much better than this. They are the same price too, the one for &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; hair is for long hair, but it made my short hair grow dramatically! So this is great, but the others are better!! :)</li>
            <li> I so love this conditioner! it makes my hair so soft and shiny plus its smells great. Some conditioners i have tried make my hair fall out this one doesn&#x27;t and its not that expensive. I found this conditioner when i was searching the hair dyes and someone said this was gonna be your best friend after dying your hair too much and she was right i dyed my hair at home too much because my hair color never came out the way i wanted. So i searched for reviews on this conditioner after that, it looks like everybody loves it so i bought it at Target so happy with it :)</li>
            <li> As the mom of 4, I&#x27;m constantly in a rush to get in and out of the shower as fast as possible. But Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner is worth the extra couple of minutes I spend in the shower! I used to use a leave-in conditioner, and always found my curly/wavy hair to be entirely too frizzy. If you have frizzy, unmanageable hair, I highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> was a very watery substance like it had been opened and used.</li>
            <li> i love it ! my mother and I used it !  we love it. It work well on the hair.I told people on the street about it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this aussie conditioner! I have long hair so it gets tangled pretty easily, so I was excited to find a product that worked very with my hair! I will repurchase this product over and over again! and it smelled amazing!</li>
            <li> I now have ombre hair and the bleach really did a number on my hair. I read lots of reviews about this conditioner and wanted to try it. I received a free sample from Bzz Agent and they were right. For the price of this conditioner it works really good in a short amount of time. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best one out there, but for the price, it gets the job done and leaves your hair very soft.</li>
            <li> My wife said the feeling is verygood.</li>
            <li> I always use this! It&#x27;s amazing and I have natural mixed hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I got USA I could buy this &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;. She tried and fall in love, now always when I go to USA I should to buy it, not only one, but two, three sometimes ten units</li>
            <li> I was hoping more from a deep conditioner. But did not find it as good as some of the reviewers did.</li>
            <li> this is insane~! My hair was getting really good after i used it~! wow. so impressive. Highly recommend~!</li>
            <li> I was able to try out this product for free through Bzzagent.  I was very excited to try it out since my hair is fairly dry and damaged.  Overall the product works pretty well, but I think there is room for improvement.  Make sure you remove the sticker on the bottom of the bottle before you get into the shower.  It becomes pretty difficult to remove once it gets wet so make sure that&#x27;s gone before you get it.  The smell was OK for me...I first caught a hint of coconut but then something I couldn&#x27;t quite distinguish.  Reminded me of the smell of popcorn.  Not sure what I thought about it at first but the scent stays with you all day and I started to dislike it after a while.  My coworkers thought it had a fruity smell.  After rinsing it definitely left my hair soft and after blow drying my hair was much fuller than it usually is.  Overall the product does work pretty well and is inexpensive compared to others products out there on the market.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel great. I have pretty dry hair, thanks to using heat products while styling. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and it seems like my hair looks and feels better after I style. It&#x27;s softer and not quite as frizzy. I even notice a difference when I let my hair air dry. It used to dry very frizzy and you could tell it was dry just by looking at it. This won&#x27;t change your hair type, so my hair remains somewhat frizzy if I air dry, but it&#x27;s not as bad and it&#x27;s defintiely softer. It smells nice too! I received this as part of a promotion from Aussie, but for the price, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty cool product.  I received it for free thanks to Aussie, but I&#x27;d buy it on my own now.  I&#x27;ve been using the Aussie Three Minute Miracle Moist  lately, and I can tell a difference.  My hair feels more manageable, more smooth and a little healthier since I&#x27;ve been using it.  Often times, I use conditioner and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference at all, so this is a welcome change.  This stuff comes in an easily recognizable, easy to use bottle.  It squeezes out the right amount of a good consistency, white product that goes on smoothly.  It rinses out just right, and does it&#x27;s job.  I&#x27;d recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> First time using it , and I&#x27;m in love lol. Smells awesome &amp; leaves my hair feeling soft ! It&#x27;s $2.97 at Wal-Mart !</li>
            <li> Thanks to both Aussie and Bzz Agent I was able to try out this awesome product! It has definitely left a great impression! I love this and it has replaced my regular shampoo. It makes my hair soft and smooth. I would definitely recommend for everyone to try. I have thick and coarse hair, so most products are a let down, but not this! #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
            <li> This product changed my hair--for the better. I&#x27;m serious. No other deep conditioner...not even overnight olive oil treatments, can compare to 3 minutes with this stuff. I have very fine and thin hair and this product left it soft and shiny. it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down either! You will not regret the purchase!</li>
            <li> I got this product to try for free thanks to BzzAgent  and I have to say that I&#x27;m a bit divided on it. I have very coarse and contrary hair (lol) so it doesn&#x27;t act like most normal hair. I was really hoping that this product would help keep my hair nice and moist and soft but that wasn&#x27;t really the case. My hair stayed nice and soft but when humidity hit I ended up with a puffball and then my hair dried out. I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday so I was a bit frustrated with it. Now I washed my daughter&#x27;s hair with it and she has finer hair than I do and it did a lot better for her hair. Her remained soft and moist and was more manageable after washing which made me very happy. It also has a very nice scent that I really loved which added to my liking of this product. It&#x27;s okay for me but better for my daughter. I got to try this product for free thanks to Aussie hair care.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have ever used.  It really works. Hair feels so soft for days after and you only have to use it once a week for the results to continue. It also smells delicious so that is a plus! I usually put the conditioner in at the end and tie my hair up so that is doesn&#x27;t get rinsed out for the 3+ minutes you have to leave it in.   All Aussie products so not disappoint, and this is no exception.   I got this as part of a free promotion, but it is definitely worth buying on your own.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS ONE OF THE BEST OF THE BEST.MY HAIR IS LONG, SILKY, AND NO SIGNS OF DAMAGE...ALL THE WAY TO THE TIPS.DELIVERY WAS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE TOO!</li>
            <li> The bottles are too small but this conditioner is very moisturizing. I wish they came in a bigger size because I&#x27;ll use this up in 2-3 washes.</li>
            <li> So, this past weekend, I was able to try Aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle conditioner that I was able to receive for free. Well, I must say that I am pleasantly surprised! I couldn&#x27;t believe that it offers 3x moisture and will completely restore your hair in just 3 minutes! In the past, I have used moisturizing conditioners that only left my hair dry and brittle, like straw. Not this conditioner!  When I first tried it, I loved how the creamy texture almost melted into my scalp. Right away, I noticed the difference in my hair as soon as I washed it out! My hair went from frizzy and unmanageable to silky, smooth and easy to style. Not only did this conditioner deliver 24 hour shine after only one treatment, it left my hair ten times stronger and made my hair feel healthy again! I was shocked at the ability of this conditioner to completely lock in smoothness and keep the frizz out of my hair for an entire day! My hair stayed soft and shiny all day so that I could not stop looking in the mirror and receiving non stop compliments from friends and coworkers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do I love the way this conditioner works, I love how it smells so heavenly! I also love how it is so simple to use and only requires one step. I also love the unique squeeze bottle that isn&#x27;t annoying like other caps, it doesn&#x27;t have a top so you can just squeeze out how ever much you need. Just be careful that you don&#x27;t squeeze out too much at one time! A little bit goes a long way and all you need is a quarter size amount for long hair, and a dime sized amount for short hair. I think it is so important that, despite it&#x27;s thick consistency, this conditioner does not weigh your hair down like you would imagine. In fact, it left my hair feeling lighter and much cleaner than ever before! My tangles were completely removed and I was left with glossy and lustrous hair that I was so proud to flaunt. Even if you don&#x27;t leave this conditioner on for the full three minutes, it will still work wonders! This is definitely one of the best products that I have ever used because my hair has never felt so silky and has never been so manageable without any frizz, even on the most humid of days! If you are looking for a fantastic conditioner that makes your hair look like you just had an expensive treatment done, try Aussie&#x27;s new 3 Minute Miracle Moist conditioner and you will never use another brand again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 Minute Miracle in Moist about 5 times and find the product to be pretty good when it comes to a daily conditioning treatment. I have fine straight hair that is not color treated and on the heathy side since I don&#x27;t tend to use many products or heat to style my hair. Maybe if my hair had some of these issues I would see more of a difference with this product but as compared to others I don&#x27;t see the benefits as a &amp;#34;Deep&amp;#34; conditioner. The smell reminds me of Aussie&#x27;s signature scent for it&#x27;s products which is kind of tropical. I really did like the dispenser at the bottom of the bottle and find it much easier to get the right amount of product with less mess. The consistency of the conditioner was also nice with a thicker feel so it all got into the hair rather than a more watery consistency that tends to slide right off and into the shower. I would like to try some of the other products in the range and see if there is another one that would be a better fit more me especially for such a great price and being readily available in most stores. Thanks to Aussie and BZZagent for allowing me to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing! Really makes a difference , leaves hair feeling soo soft. However when I dyed my hair blonde, it didn&#x27;t moisturize as well.overall great product, good buy.</li>
            <li> Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist is a lifesaver. It makes my hair managable on busy mornings when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time and/or I am in between washings. Most importantly, it helps relieve my dry scalp and keeps my hair looking soft and silky for up to 24 hours. I love that I can get a deep conditioning treatment without any heat and in less than 3 minutes. The first thing I noticed was that the bottle is upside down which I love. It was easy to squeeze the sides and a steady stream of the product comes out without any difficulty in a 2-3 mm string of thickness. The product is not thick or creamy, and it is light in both texture and smell. The smell is amazing and reminds me of coconuts and a beautiful tropical rainforest with fragrant flowers. While I was applying it, I noticed it didn&#x27;t create a lot of suds and it was easy to spread throughout my hair. I sang a song for the 2 minutes and 45 seconds the bottle recommends for it to remain in my hair. I loved that it rinsed off without leaving any residue or hassle. I noticed within the first week of using the product that my hair was easier to comb through in the mornings when I am rushing, and my scalp didn&#x27;t itch that much as it usually does from dryness. I love the product and have recommended it to my friends and will continue to use it. I received a free sample from bzzagent.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. I have short fine hair and usually conditioner Waze my hair down. This did not weigh my hair down, instead it repaired damage from coloring. Nice light scent.</li>
            <li> I love this Aussie 3 minute miracle moist deep conditioner. I have been using it for years to help my hair when it needs a boost. I don&#x27;t use it after every shampoo, maybe once a week, twice a week in the winter when my hair is more dry and brittle. I apply a decent amount to my hair after rising out my shampoo and leave it in for at least 3 minutes, usually while I shave my legs. It rinses out easily, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling to my hair.  I can either air dry or use a hair dryer and it looks great either way. It leaves my hair soft and silky, and even helps a little with frizz in the summer.</li>
            <li> I was totally surprised how easy it was to part my hair. I have coiled/kinky hair. I have never used Aussie before and was hesitant to try it but very glad I did.</li>
            <li> Really good product! I use pomade in my hair, and read online this helps to &#x27;degrease&#x27; it. Well, it works! It doesn&#x27;t take it ALL out, but MOST of it, and cuts down on time. I just put it in my hair WITH the pomade in, work it through and leave it. I know it says THREE minutes, but the LONGER you leave it in the BETTER it works. I leave it in for 30 mins - a hour, rinse my hair &amp; wash it- done!&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I&#x27;ll add some regular clarifying conditioner with it, I find combining &#x27;3 min Miracle&#x27; AND another conditioner works just as well.</li>
            <li> Bottle is extremely easy to use.  I want to order about five more.  In addition, it makes it super easy to use.  My hair feels a lot better and not so dry.  I never really conditioned my hair much, but now I do it weekly.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I bought it for my color treated hair, and it has left my hair noticeably softer. It also works well to help with tangles.</li>
            <li> I received two free bottles of this and I&#x27;m loving it so far. I have very dry hair and I found this really helps to keep my hair hydrated and smooth. Thanks Aussie! will definitely purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I really love the scent of this conditioner. It smells like coconut! My hair feels so good and soft after using this product. It really only takes one time of use to feel the difference. Just put it all over your hair or just the ends, wait three minutes and rinse off! I would recommend the 3 minute miracle to everyone! I had the opportunity to try this product out for free thanks to Aussie. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Can we first mention how great this smells? I love the squeeze tube bottle and the like vacuum seal it has. Easy for no mess. It gave me some much needed moisture without making my hair feel heavy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I got this complimentary from bzzagent but I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s very affordable because I will purchase again</li>
            <li> Really actually truly fixed my puffy summer hair. It took me from Pennsatucky to Arwen in 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Bless you, $4 bottle of conditioner.</li>
            <li> my hair is thick and wavy so its hard to keep it manageable...I use a lot of serum to keep it from frizzy....When i deep condition it helps the process of my hair to control my fluffy hair...smell amazing...and keep my hair smooth..try it for free through BzzAgent thanks to Aussie</li>
            <li> My hair is supe soft and has more volume after using. A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair a lot of different colors like blue, orange, etc., so obviously I have to bleach a lot. this completely brought my hair back to life, it&#x27;s super soft, moisturized and healthy!</li>
            <li> My hair has been so much smoother and shinier thanks to Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle. My morning routine has been so much nicer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample from BzzAgent and Aussie all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I was cursed with frizzy hair, and have tried everything short of shaving my head bald to fix it.  I was sent this product for free from BzzAgent to try out and review.  I tried it expecting nothing to happen, but I was wrong.  This product not only helps with split ends, but it tames the frizz.  I would say my frizz-o-meter was down by about 30%.  This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. I have very thin hair which tangles easy and it&#x27;s hard to find a conditioner that really works. I only need a little of this in my hair for it to work. I do not have oily hair by the end of the day like I do when I use most products and if I choose not to wash my hair for a day it&#x27;s still just as smooth as it was the day before.  My hair also normally frizzes in humidity, working in NYC and all, and I noticed that it really does not frizz as much on the days I use my deep conditioner. I haven&#x27;t noticed any cons. The smell may be a little weird to some people but it&#x27;s the normal Aussie smell. You will not regret buying this!  **I got this free from Bzzagent to test and review**</li>
            <li> I got this conditioner free from Bzzagent and i love it my hair is moisturized and manageable after the first use. many of my natural hair products didn&#x27;t show these results on the first use. I do recommend it for any naturalists it also good when detangling you hair</li>
            <li> I have used a million conditioners by now and several different types of deep conditioning options like oils and other deep conditioners in general and nothing has ever felt so great in my hair as this. It makes my feel like it was done at the salon, it feels the softest ever and the silkiest and it also smells AMAZING. You just can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li> Received it as a part of promotion from Aussie and loved every time I used it. For those suffering from dry, frizzy and unruly hair can totally count on this product. It makes your hair healthy, strong, shiny, voluminous and full of awesome smell. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good but didn&#x27;t live up to the stellar reviews. The moisture was okay but didn&#x27;t blow my mind. I would probably buy again though if my $ was short at the time.</li>
            <li> I tried this in my hair last night and omg....my hair not only smells EXTREMELY GOOD but it&#x27;s also shiny and manageable! Highly recommended! Before buying this product I would want to know if the product would make my hair more manageable most importantly. Manageability is a MUST for me! And the fact that it smells really good AND makes my hair shiny? Even BETTER!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I can never find it in stores! Great scent!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for review as a promotion for the brand.  However, my review is strictly my personal opinion.  I found this to be a great conditioner, but a little heavy for everyday use.  Though my hair is a bit on the fine side, it also tends to get frizzy in the more humid weather and I did find it did a good job at taming the frizz.  I just would not be able to use it regularly in the winter without my hair getting weighed down.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free from bzzagent. I love Aussie products, and for the most part it is because I think they smell amazing.  Best smelling products ever.  They also work...I have very thick, coarse, curly, dry, damaged, color treated hair.  I use a blow dryer and a flat iron a few times a week and I do go for haircuts/trims on a regular basis.  Aussie 3 minute miracle is super easy to use, I love the bottle dispenser, it only takes 3 minutes so I do not have to stand around in the shower forever or wear it overnight, it rinses easily and really improves my hair.  I like to add a little drop to my damp hair as a leave on conditioner as well and it really makes my hair super soft after I blow dry and flat iron it.  I do NOT use this product every time I was my hair...maybe once a week or every other week.  It is a great value and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Great product, much better than expected</li>
            <li> I love trying deep conditioners, so I was excited to try Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioning Treatment thanks to BzzAgent. I have long, thick, color-treated hair, and I tend to use deep conditioners once a week in order to hydrate my hair. I&#x27;ve heard of others raving about this product, but for me, I did not feel any noticeable difference after using this product. My hair did not feel hydrated nor did it feel softer. It just felt just as it would if I had used a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; conditioner. I am disappointed in this product because it has a wonderful price point ($2.99-$3.19) at Walmart and Target, so it&#x27;s affordable. Also, I did not enjoy the smell. It smelled like a mix of coconut and Play-doh. Such an odd combination!  Overall, despite the affordability and availability of Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioning Treatment, I will not repurchase this product again due to its lackluster results and poor smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the pool five days a week and always looking for a deep hair conditioner.  The product is pretty good but the packaging is bad.  One bump in my workout bag and I&#x27;d have conditioner all over my cloths.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite deep conditioners out there! I have been using this stuff for years. It really makes the condition of my hair feel much better.</li>
            <li> cheap and good...not much to talk about.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff leaves my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li> Before using this my hair was really frizzy and kind of dry but every since using this my hair has never been softer!!! Its a must try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Aussie 3 Minute Miracle many times through the years. Recently I got a bottle free to try from Aussie. I was pleasantly surprised that it&#x27;s still great! I&#x27;ve been using all these expensive hair masks that have to sit in your hair for ~20 minutes to make any difference. Yet the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle takes...3 minutes!...and gives you the same effect. It&#x27;s not perfect, it&#x27;s not the best that I&#x27;ve ever tried. But if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive, FAST and effective hair mask, this is the way to go. Its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Great quality and amazing moisture for an awesome price! I use this 1-2 times a week and also anytime my hair feels dry and crispy. It moisturizes so well and adds shine back to my dull hair. I love this stuff! It&#x27;s worth a try if you have dry thirsty hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had pretty good hair. Soft, full, pretty nice actually ... but I decided to get my hair bleached and dyed for the very first time ... Oh man, what a disaster. The woman bleaches and dyes my hair, screws up the color, then bleaches and dyes my hair AGAIN ... Now, again, I had never had my hair dyed before, though I did happen to know that bleaching was hard on your hair having grown up in the 90&#x27;s and witnessing the Eminem and JTL bleached hair look-alikes (or &#x27;not so&#x27; look-alikes in most cases) ...  Anyway, I&#x27;m just assuming this &#x27;hairstylist&#x27; knows what she&#x27;s doing... Long story short, my head is on fire and my hair is fried. My hair felt bristly and dry and I had split ends like nobody&#x27;s business! I didn&#x27;t know what to do! ... I happened to have needed some groceries the next day and stumbled upon Aussie 3 Minute Miracle in the hygiene aisle... Thank you JESUS! The first time I used it my hair felt SO much better. My hair was still in pretty bad shape but I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be a one time use, fix-all to my hair catastrophe, but look ya&#x27;ll ... I&#x27;m on day 3 of this stuff and honestly, as much as I hate to say it ... I think my hair may be in better condition NOW than it ever was before! Aussie and I are for life!</li>
            <li> Intense moisture, washes away easily</li>
            <li> Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner, 8 oz.This conditioner makes your dry brittle hair softer and less frizzy in this cold weather time. It has a pleasant light scent, soft and creamy in your hand. Easy to use you just turn over the bottle and squeeze, no cap to open.</li>
            <li> I was sent a free sample (From another website) and i liked it so much i decided to purchase another bottle!!! Really softens your hair and smells great!!!!</li>
            <li> It definitely isn&#x27;t like a hair treatment at the salon, (which is the best, and leaves my hair silky soft and moisturized, but it is expensive as heck), but for its price, it worked VERY well for my 3b/c hair. Each of my hair strands is very fine, but is very curly, so it creates a ton of volume, so of makes it seems thicker than it actually is. A little curlier and it would turn into an afro. And If I were living in the 80&#x27;s, I would be a hair model. My hair is naturally big, the type of big that&#x27;s seen on Pantene&#x27;s &#x27;Don&#x27;t hate me because I&#x27;m beautiful&#x27; commercial/ads. So it&#x27;s normally frizzy, and dry as the Sahara Desert, but this left it feeling properly moisturized. To the point of normal hair. :) It didn&#x27;t really take care of the frizz, but the moisture part was pretty good.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders on my hair. It smells amazing. I&#x27;ve had trouble in the past with aussie products causing me acne but this one doesn&#x27;t do that. I received a free sample of this from Bzzagent and I&#x27;m so happy i did. It&#x27;s something I wouldn&#x27;t normally purchase on my own hut will definitely repurchase once I run out. It leaves my hair so smooth without being greasy. The blonde parts I have also soften alot when I use it.</li>
            <li> I moved to Colorado a few years ago and the dry climate has not been good to my hair. I&#x27;ve been using Biolage moisturizing conditioner for months and it&#x27;s helped some. This is better. The price is unreal for what a great product it is. I am now able to comb through my hair without losing half of it to knots that need to be worked out. It smells amazing too, which is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite deep conditioners. I have extremely dry hair and often find that I have trouble finding a conditioner that truly adds moisture to my hair; this one does wonders for me. I&#x27;ve used it with steam, and found the benefits to be even better. Definitely a good option for people with dry hair.</li>
            <li> most awesome deep conditioner in regular OTC, not sure why stores don&#x27;t sell this anymore (or they&#x27;re all always sold out!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing deep conditioner it makes my hair feel silky smooth and moist I will definitely purchase this is got this to review from the brand I would love to thanks aussie for this promotion.</li>
            <li> Great value for money, makes your hair so soft. Cannot believe for the price and since it is not a professional product, will buy again</li>
            <li> I received this deep conditioner for free courtesy of bzzagent.com! I have been using this for a week now, and I really like how moisturized my hair gets after using it. I was worried about it because my hair is very coily, but this is definitely great for all hair type! Would definitely buy.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner... The only negative is that I found this at Target for $2.99. Before you hit the buy button check out your local stores...</li>
            <li> Price is right on here for 2 bucks! I use this bi weekly-or mix with some almond oil to do some real moisturizing when I need to! I have butt length hair, so I know what I am talking about!</li>
            <li> I received two full size sample free from BzzAgent to try. First I washed me hair with Suave shampoo and then I used this as my conditioner. Immediately I washed my hair and blow dry it, I noticed that my hair was very soft. when i go outside, my hair does not get fizzy as it normally does. i love it and I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product I would want to know how this would make y hair feel, look, and smell. So far all three are what I expected. This is my favorite conditioner! It&#x27;s really nice! I have dry and damaged hair gets staticy in certain environments. But this conditioner takes care of it so well! It really does moisturize my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair feel soft and nice. And the best part is, it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down at all! Other conditioners tend to weigh my hair down, and make it limp and flat and icky. But this one makes it soft, full, and gorgeous. **I received this product free as part of a promotion from the brand**</li>
            <li> I love this product! I was lucky enough to try this product for free from Bzzagent and the results are exactly what I was hoping for. My hair is exposed almost daily to the flat iron and the blow dryer leaving my hair a bit crispy on the ends, especially in the front. After a few uses of this product I noticed my hair feels and looks much healthier after I blow dry it and use the flat iron. For an good conditioner that doesn&#x27;t break the bank I HIGHLY recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> I was traveling to the US and this was the firs request to bring home. Family girls are very happy!</li>
            <li> I received the product in a satisfactory manner and before the scheduled time.</li>
            <li> I recieved a complimentary sample of this product. I have to say how pleased I am with it. My hair is colored, frizzy, somewhat damaged and tangly at the ends. After using it in the shower, my hair was tangle free immediately when rinsing. I never am able to run my fingers through wet hair and need a wide tooth comb but with this, I had no issues. My hair was very smooth once dry and the fragrance was like being on a tropical island. Best authentic coconut smell yet. I only wish it would last all day (the fragrance).</li>
            <li> Thanks too BzzAgent and Aussie, I got to test out Aussie&#x27;s Three Minute Miracle Moist, and I&#x27;m a fan. I used it a couple times a week and it did what was expected: deep conditioned my hair. It smells like candy, leaves hair soft, and smooth. My hair was dry and needing some TLC. It&#x27;s now revived. This will be my go to, when my hair needs a moisture pick me up.</li>
            <li> I got this free of charge from bzzagent as part of a promotion to try out and boy am I glad I did. This conditioner is super moisturizing and easy to use. The bottle design is wonderful - it&#x27;s like an easy squeeze ketchup bottle, so it saves you the time of opening a lid and getting conditioner everywhere. The smell is also incredible - just like coconut. It&#x27;s so moisturizing that it&#x27;s already replaced about 3 hair products since I don&#x27;t need to do much else to make my hair look and feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a veeery delicious SMELL.!!! is very creamy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the way this makes my hair feel. My hair is dry, damaged, and over processed but this makes my hair feel like it washes away all of my hair problems. And added bonus is that it smells so good! #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
            <li> This is really an amazing product. I can always rely on it to take all my knots out while I&#x27;m in the shower and when I get out I can still feel my hair is moisturized and soft but not heavy or oily feeling. I highly recommend you try this! I got this product to try for free through BzzAgent and I will be buying it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly 3b type hair, I need moisture in order to even look semi-presentable. Aussie 3 Minute Miracle has allowed me to look semi-presentable. As the name presents, you really only need 3 minutes. Aussie 3 minute miracle hydrates, smooths, hydrates and smells fantastic!! My hair looks great with minimal styling or product immediately after use. I do notice however  after a week I do need another application to keep the results. I would like to see this allow my hair to stay frizz free and hydrated longer than a week. I was giving this product free to review but my opinions are genuine and mine alone. I would recommend this product to women looking for immediate results.</li>
            <li> I love the 3 minute miracle moist deep conditioner. It leaves my hair really soft, shiny, and frizz free. I have really thick hair so this is a must have, especially as the weather is getting hotter ( and humid) . I usually put it on from the middle of my hair to the ends and then shave so it takes up the 3 minutes and in no time its time to rinse if off.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down which I like because I have slightly wavy hair and don&#x27;t want that to go away, it actually helps define the waves more. Another great thing that I like is the smell, its very pleasant. So if you are looking for soft, silky, manageable hair, give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> It did not give my the result I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, especially for the price! I use this along with Moroccan oil deep conditioner a couple times a week.  My hair feels a bit stronger and more shiny.  This has got to be the best bang for your buck out there.  Recommend and will continue to use</li>
            <li> My hair is not thick but not thin and very dry at the ends due to coloring and highlights, but decently healthy otherwise. I am a BzzAgent and thanks to Aussie, I received a free product trial of Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner and I really thought it did a good job for such an inexpensive product. It did leave my hair feeling soft and not too heavy feeling. The smell is so wonderful. That is my favorite thing about this conditioner. It left my hair ready to be styled without using anything else on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how soft my hair was after I used this.The smell was a nice summery coconut that made my hair smell good all day. BzzAgent sent me a free bottle to try and I am happy they did!!</li>
            <li> Preface: I received Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle as a free promotion from BzzAgent, in return for my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, super thick, color-treated hair and my ends look dry, so I&#x27;m always on the hunt for the perfect conditioner. So many products out there leave my hair feeling limp or oily or fried out after conditioning, but NOT Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle. I have been using it regularly in the shower. I&#x27;ll wash my hair with my usual shampoo and then apply the Aussie condition and wait out the three minutes (shaving, washing my face, etc....it goes by quickly). When the three minutes are up, I rinse and my hair is incredibly soft. My comb goes through easily without tangles and I love the way my hair feels after. It&#x27;s like a facial for my tresses. Bonus: I love the coconut smell! After a short blow dry, my hair feels clean and smooth. I highly recommend the  3 Minute Miracle for anyone with thick, coarse hair like mine!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing, and feels amazing when you&#x27;re washing it out of your wet hair. However, once my hair dries, it&#x27;s back to its frizz-prone self.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of deep conditioners in my life to maintain my healthy-looking long mane, so of course I have high expectations with each new product I try ‚Äî comparing and contrasting all the different brands, from the cheap to uber expensive. Aussie‚Äôs 3 Minute Miracle Moist is one of the cheapest I‚Äôve tried, only costing a few bucks at my local superstore, so, admittedly, I wasn‚Äôt expecting ‚Äúmiracles.‚Äù&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it‚Äôs done a decent job of keeping my hair ‚Äúmoist.‚Äù What does that mean exactly? My long hair is overdue for a cut, so it‚Äôs kept my dried tips hydrated and not overly brittle whenever I spend the extra few minutes leaving the deep conditioner in. While 3 minutes may seem like a long time to spend with your conditioner, the nice smell makes it a pleasing experience, with hints of coconut and cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the thick texture consistency. From experience, the thicker, the better! And the best aspect is its dispenser‚Äîa (ingenious) squeeze bottle with no cap/top to mess with! Just directly squeeze into your hand and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I‚Äôve tried better deep conditioners ‚Äî and paid the extra cost for it too ‚Äî Aussie‚Äôs 3 Minute Miracle is a great affordable option for everyday deep conditioning and gives your tresses that extra bit of attention if you overly manhandle it with coloring, blow-drying, curling, straightening, etc. I‚Äôd easily buy this again for the few dollars it cost, but I look forward to trying their other formulas: Shine and Strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: If you like voluminous hair, apply the deep conditioner only to the tips, or else it‚Äôll end up weighing your hair down. Also, don‚Äôt fast-track the process‚Äîit needs the 3 minutes to do its job. Also, don‚Äôt skimp on the conditioner beforehand if your hair needs the extra TLC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Aussie and BzzAgent for providing this free product sample.</li>
            <li> I have tried this before BzzAgent but I also tried it free from them and thanks to Aussie as part of a promotion. I love this 3 Minute Miracle Moist conditioner. It turns any bad hair day into an Aussome one. I live in the desert so my hair does get really dry sometimes and in just 3 easy minutes, I have moisture restored back into my hair. This conditioner also smells really good, kinda like coconut and leaves my hair smelling clean. I will forever be a fan of this conditioner and a fan of Aussie.</li>
            <li> Works well with low budget!</li>
            <li> This is a great inexpensive moisturizing conditioner. I have bleached hair half-way down my head (ombre effect) and of course it feels like straw. I got a free sample from BzzAgent and used the conditioner every day for about 1 1/2 weeks. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. My hair feels much softer and it&#x27;s easier to work with. I recommend this as a good quick fix when you don&#x27;t have time to use a hair mask and sit in the shower for 15-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love the Aussie 3 minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner.  I feel it really makes my hair softer and easier to manage!</li>
            <li> About Me: I have fairly long hair of medium coarseness. My hair likes to straddle the line between wavy and straight. For the most part, I just give into the whimsy of the &amp;#34;hair gods&amp;#34; and let them decide what kind of hair day it will be. Sometimes, however, the &amp;#34;hair gods&amp;#34; can be fickle and then I&#x27;m left with simultaneously flat, frizzy, unmanageable hair. Horror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Usage: I was  given two bottles of this product for free by the manufacturer through BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve used this as my sole conditioner for the last few weeks. As stated in the directions (and name), I leave this conditioner on clean wet hair for 3 minutes and let the miracles start working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Packaging:  I can&#x27;t rave enough about how awesomely this product is packaged. There is no flip lid that breaks. No lid to try to unscrew with slippery wet hands. The product simply comes in a squeeze tube that does not leak. Seriously, buy this product just to marvel at the wonders of modern engineering.&lt;br /&gt;2) Taming frizz: Enough said!&lt;br /&gt;3) Great for unleashing curls/waves: As mentioned earlier, my hair can go pretty easily between wavy and straight. When using this product and letting my hair air dry, I find that my hair will more predictably go towards waves/loose curls with good volume and no frizz!&lt;br /&gt;4) Great scent: This product smells awesome! A little bit tropical, a little bit floral, and not at all overwhelming like some products can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Hair lacks softness: One of the only cons that I&#x27;ve had with using this product is that while my hair LOOKS fantastic, it&#x27;s not as soft as I would like.  However, this could be the result of a long overdue hair appointment to chop away all those nasty little split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Thoughts: I really enjoyed using this product. I like the manageability, frizz control, and ease of use of this product. I am definitely going to continue using this product. However, I think I will likely supplement with a weekly deep conditioning treatment to keep my hair feeling as great as it looks!</li>
            <li> Received this product from Aussie + was a little skeptical because it&#x27;s so cheap... It works though! I used this and didn&#x27;t think much of it until later during the day when I thought to myself, &amp;#34;wow, my hair feels super light + healthy&amp;#34;. Then I remembered I used this! Impressed with Aussie. Initially thought the packaging is weird (it&#x27;s a squeeze bottle without a cap) but I&#x27;m happy with it now. It doesn&#x27;t leak and product will come out only if you squeeze it. Cheers!</li>
            <li> I got this for free as part of BzzAgent&#x27;s Aussie campaign. The price for this ($2.97 as of this review, with an additional $1 off coupon) on Amazon right now is a STEAL. For you ladies out there looking for a quick fix for frizzled ends, this may be the product for you. It is a deep conditioning treatment, which Aussie suggests you leave on for 3 minutes. You could easily do the same with your current conditioner (just leave it onto to damp, not dripping wet hair after shampoo for 3+ minutes) and achieve similar results. However, I will say that Aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle does come with an amazingly convenient bottle design, and nice scent. And, in my experience, it does leave hair noticeable smoother (at least to the person whose hair it is) compared to regular conditioner. Others may not notice the difference so much, but it is effective and worth a try.</li>
            <li> I received the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Conditioner for free as part of a promotion from the brand. So far, so good! This product works great with my long, super thick, and often dry hair. There is a big difference when I use this product, letting it sit in my hair for at least 3 minutes, and other conditioners. It has removed the need for extra leave in conditioners after washing and conditioning and decreased frizz after blow drying and straightening. It smells great and leaves my hair tangle free! My only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t great for a quick shower, you definitely have to leave it in for the 3 minutes for it to work, which isn&#x27;t convenient all the time. It is not a time saver for your average shower, but the benefits of a salon-like moisturizing treatment at home is worth it!</li>
            <li> If you want silky, smooth, great smelling hair with minimal frizz and flyaways then is is he product for you! The bottle design makes it easy to get all the conditioner till the last drop! Easiest 3 minutes of your life for amazing hair. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> This is a great value.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very dry and damaged, and using this just twice a week really rejuvenates it. It makes it soft and silky like it used to be and if you have damaged hair, you NEED this.</li>
            <li> Been using for a bit and it&#x27;s seems working good. It&#x27;s not greasy if you use lots of water to rinse. when leaving for more than 3 minutes it gives lots of shine to my hair and i have very fine medium dye medium blond hair with split end.</li>
            <li> so I had to try this because of the commercial! I loved the commercial!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I normally use high end or sulfate free shampoos and conditioners.  My hair always comes out soft and shiny with a normal conditioners.  But I really wanted to try this so I shampooed with sulfate free shampoo and used this for left it on my hair for a good 10 to 15 minutes.  I rinsed it out and I notched hair looked daker. I do have highlights so my color was &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; vibrant.  After dryer, although hair looked somewhat shiny, it was still pretty rough and dry looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was not that great. Didn&#x27;t work for my thick, courtly Indian hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. My hair just doesn&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> Very good&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair very macil i recommend</li>
            <li> For naturally curly hair, this is my life saver and one of the only ways I can comb through my hair after a shower. This doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or weighed down after use but clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have just discovered the aussie line and am so happy that I did and mad that I&#x27;ve missing out all this time on it! I actually tested this line out along wtih TGIF and while I loved the TGIF line I love Aussie a smidgen better and for the cost will definiltey be making this my staple line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the whole line (conditioner, shampoo &amp; 3 minute miracle) starting with the conditioner as my prepoo followed by the shampoo to cleanse followed by the 3 minute miracle to deep condition and my hair has never felt better!! Even as I washed out the shampoo my hair was soooo soft and I was able to run my fingers right through my hair which I must mention both the conditioners and shampoo have excellent slip! The deciding point for me was when I rinsed out and left my hair to dry because sometimes products work well while washing but as soon as I rinse out and dry so does my hair until I put something else on it. Well not with this line, my hair remained soft while drying and I was extremely pleased! Aussie Moist is my new hair friend!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Leaves my long wavy thick hair so soft and silky. It smells incredible too!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner as it leaves my hair, I believe, much smoother than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. It is quite thick and coats your hair easily, meaning you don&#x27;t need a huge amount, but washes out easily also and does not leave my hair looking or feeling weighed down or greasy. I straighten my hair almost every time I wash it so like to use a thicker conditioner such as this one. I can&#x27;t see any difference before styling (my hair is big and frizzy anyway) but after straightening it is softer and more manageable.   Also the bottle is a great design as it stands upright and you simply squeeze however much you need without removing any lids!  I would buy again!</li>
            <li> 3 minute miracle is by far one of the best conditioners I have used! I have extremely thick frizzy hair that takes forever to control of. After just 1 use I could already tell a huge difference. And I was lucky enough to find this great product and try it FREE thanks to Aussie and BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> ok so i have really damaged hair do to bleaching and dyeing it a lot i needed something that could moisturize and condition my hair this s*** really works it leaves my hair really soft and smells great better than other deep conditioners i&#x27;ve tried and trust me me i&#x27;ve tried many</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! Makes my super processed bleached hair extremely soft!</li>
            <li> I cant live without it</li>
            <li> Little bit hard to squeeze</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair feels strong</li>
            <li> Love the way it made my hair feel. I bleach my hair often and it restores the balance to prevent it from looking over processed</li>
            <li> A MUST BUY!!! i have tried many conditioners but let me tell you that this one right here is the real deal. I purchased this because I have heard wonderful thing about it. I had tangles in my hair and as soon as i put this on it and finger combed through my hair the tangles were coming out so easily.</li>
            <li> I received this free to try from BzzAgent in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have struggled with frizzy hair and dry ends for a long time so I was definitely intrigued about the 3 minute miracle moist deep conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t take much time but claims to do wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself has a different bottle than what I am used to. Instead of twisting or popping open a cap, you just squeeze and the conditioner comes out at the bottom. The conditioner has a fruity scent which is not overpowering and is actually quite pleasant. After the three minutes was up, I rinsed my hair and it felt very soft. After my hair was dry (air dried), I noticed my hair was shinier and sleeker with the ends being less dry than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to people who have dry hair and need a boost of moisture in their hair routine.</li>
            <li> it smells so good and makes your hair nice and soft ,I&#x27;m not sure about the bottle design but would buy it again!</li>
            <li> I have a tween daughter, like everything else about her, her hair is also changing, she is sweating more and getting more tangles, frizz and even greasy roots while the tips seem fried, I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that can help her without breaking the bank, recently I received an invitation thru Bzzagent to try this product for free, I&#x27;ve have known and loved Aussie brand products for a while so I said yes right away, I received a sample of the 3 min miracle moist, the bottle is very convenient and well designed because the dispenser is on the bottom allowing gravity to work in your favor, the product has a fruity kind of smell that appeals to young women, it is white and creamy and easily slides thru the hair, it has easy to follow instructions, and calls for applying on clean wet her and letting it work for 3 min, conviniently songs last about that long, so after one song she rinsed her hair, it was easy to rinse but left the hair feeling a bit slippery, of course this could be attributed to my soft water, I dried her hair and it looked healthy, no frizz and manageable, a bit less shiny than usual and a bit heavy, so I would recommend this product for after swimming or exercising or when your hair needs extra moisturizing but not for everyday use because it appears to me that it would cause a bit of buildup.&lt;br /&gt;The product is very good and affordable, and a great choice for dry hair, for normal hair is more of a once a week treatment</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, but also very dry due to coloring and highlights.  I&#x27;m always searching for a great leave-in conditioner that will restore moisture to my hair without leaving it limp / lifeless / greasy.  I received a free product trial of Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner and I really thought it did a great job keeping its promises.  It leaves my hair feeling soft but not limp and it smells wonderful.  I used to use this product a long time ago when there was only one version of the three minute miracle conditioner, but I&#x27;m so glad they&#x27;ve expanded the line to suit different hair types.  I will definitely be buying this again when my sample runs out!</li>
            <li> I love the price but It&#x27;s nothing special</li>
            <li> I have curly, dry, chemically processed hair that is prone to dandruff. I use this deep conditioner without fail right after I shampoo and condition my hair. The smell is divine! You only have to leave the product in for the recommended 2 mins 45 secs but I choose to leave it on for about 25 mins. while I do the rest of my bathroom routine. I rinse it out and my hair feels so smooth and is noticabely softer and easier to manage. You don&#x27;t even have to apply a leave-conditioner just wash and go! Love it and will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF RIGHT HERE IS AMAZING. I have tried other deep conditioners that cost wayyy more than this one but somehow Aussie has hit the nail with this product. My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this soft in years. Plus you don&#x27;t have to leave it in for more than 3 minutes which is great for those of us in a hurry. It also leaves this wonderful smell that lasts for days! This will defiantly be purchased again,</li>
            <li> Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist is a really good deep conditioner. To start with, it smells awesome. Secondly, the bottle design is pretty cool. It&#x27;s easy to just squeeze out without opening with wet/slippery hands. It also keeps  product from getting everywhere, and you don&#x27;t have to dip your hands into a jar which gets water and stray hairs into your product. Next,  putting it in, I found it had enough slip for me to detangle my curly hair with. This is a huge plus for me because I like to detangle with my deep conditioner in. With curly natural hair, this makes things easier for me. Finally, and most importantly, is how great it makes my hair feel. My hair feels super soft after I rinse this out, and very moisturized. There is also noticeably less frizz when I move on to styling . Another huge plus, as my hair is color-treated and has some light heat damage from occasional straightening. Frizz is my biggest issue, and this really helps with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free through a brand promotion on Bzzagent. The opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> I Received Aussie Three Minute Miracle deep conditioning treatment free from Aussie. I absolutely love it! the first thing I noticed was the opening to the bottle. it is not like your usual shower bottle. its like a mess- proof top. you take the protective sticker off an just squeeze. its convenient and pretty cool. I wish there were more shower products that were convenient to open like Aussie Three Minute Miracle. I felt as soon as I put the product in my hair it began working. i left it in for about 3-5 mins and once I rinsed it out my hair felt better than my normal conditioner. my hair was so light and soft. i let my hair air dry just to see and feel the exact effects of the product. my hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy and tangled and my hair felt conditioned and soft for at last 3 days. I definitely recommend Aussie Three Minute Miracle deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Aussie, I&#x27;m trying this out for free! This three minute miracle does the trick. I have my roots dyed monthly and typically use a super moisturizing conditioner, but I decided to try this instead. This worked amazing. It made my hair feel soft and silky and I only had to let it sit for 2-3 minutes. I had no frizz and even woke up the next morning with my hair feeling amazing. Normally I wake up and my hair is oily, so this was a pleasant surprise. The only thing I suggest is to use less conditioner if your hair is fine or thin. I used to have thick hair and used quite a bit of conditioner, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has changed. The first time I used it, I think I used too much because my hair became oily quick. I just adjusted the amount I used the next time (a quarter size) and it worked just right. PLEASE NOTE, I have a history of oily skin/scalp, so this isn&#x27;t out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> Works miracles in your hair, just like magic.&lt;br /&gt;But here is too pricy. Go to a Wal Mart instead !</li>
            <li> Overrated. Total hype product. Don&#x27;t believe me? Google some of the ingredients. My hair felt smooth and hydrated while wet. When it dries, my hair felt very dry and had some buildup. I did really love the scent though.</li>
            <li> Although this conditioner left my hair feeling silky and easy to manage, It also made my hair fall out. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Really great price and works pretty well on my hair so far. My hair is usually really frizzy and I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it doesn&#x27;t completely take away the frizz but I feel like my hair is significantly softer and less frizzy. Works way better than a dollar item would be expected to work</li>
            <li> Thanks to bzzagent and aussie I got to try this product, and I love it, not expensive and very good quality, one of the top of my list for hair products</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this and my hair loves it too. Born again hair virgin, transitioning and my hair loves it. The smell&#x27;s amazing and it melts away my tangles. I always buy in pairs.</li>
            <li> I am 31 &amp; have thick, straight, heavily-highlighted hair. For a while I wasn&#x27;t deep conditioning &amp; my hair suffered because of it. After using this once  my hair was crazy soft &amp; it continues to get softer with every use (every 3-4 days)!! I can&#x27;t wait for my sylist to get her hands in it on Friday. Must try.. &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the insanely great price!</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair and frizz is my number one enemy.  I can easily look like a hippie and typically nothing helps.  I was very skeptical over a $3 bottle of deep conditioner, but I was also very surprised when it worked!  I use it just like any usual conditioner except I leave it in for the 3-minute requirement and my hair is soft, silky, and the smell lasts until the next washing.  The smell reminds me of coconut.  I really love how this product is dispensed as well.  Just remove the sticker from the bottom hole and squeeze. PERFECT!  No waste at the end of the bottle or trying to prop it up so that the product rolls down to where you can access it and no need to close anything up.  I will say that while this product works wonders on my hair, it doesn&#x27;t do so all by itself so don&#x27;t expect to be able to toss everything out leaving only this in your arsenal.  It isn&#x27;t&#x27; the only thing you&#x27;ll ever need, but you need it!  Hair type and products typically used always play a factor in how well it works for you so try it for yourself!!  :)  If it doesn&#x27;t work, it was just three dollars, right?</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer‚Äã for my curly/wavy hair and works quick for a cheap price, make sure and add the coupon on amazon for some $$ back in your pocket!</li>
            <li> all in accordance with announcement</li>
            <li> Claiming to fix split ends is a feat that nearly all conditions claim and none follow through on, even $1,000 carotene treatments do not even fix split ends. Aussie 3-Minute Miracle is no different. There are other benefits to the conditioner, it is thicker than most other conditioners. It makes my split ended, frayed, fine and tangled hair slightly more manageable and a lot softer.     For the price it is a decent buy-but do not expect a true hair miracle.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging and size. It&#x27;s small enough to carry around when you travel. It&#x27;s also very easy to squeeze. This conditioner is great and does what it promised. It&#x27;s been several weeks since I started using and every time I wash my hair,  I could feel the softness it promised! The smell is great and it leaves on my hair for one to two day maximum. My boyfriend always tells me my hair smells nice. This easy 3 minute formula makes my hair a lot smoother and shiny!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free, courtesy of Aussie. My opinions are truthful and my own. I was very skeptical upon trying this product, as other Aussie product had not worked on my hair (very thick, frizzy, wavy). However, I was pleasantly surprised with this wonderful product. It made my hair less frizzy and amazingly shiny! I have never had shiny hair before; it makes my hair look so healthy! The design of the bottle is also an awesome change. No mess when my little sister goes to use it.</li>
            <li> Container is easy to use. The product comes out the bottom so no turning over and patting the bottle to get the product out. The conditioner is thick and creamy. Made my hair feel soft and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> Love it!! I have used many expensive deep conditioners on my dry, frizzy hair with unhappy result. After using Aussie 3 minute miracle my hair changes miraculously. It not only moisturize my hair but also leaves my hair straight and shine only in 5 minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I got this item free from Bzzagent!</li>
            <li> I received this product to try for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I really wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the product since my hair was straight and limp. I thought this would weigh it down more. I was very surprised that it not only left my hair soft, shiny, but fuller than usual. I made no change to my usual routine. I only washed with shampoo, used the 3 minute miracle, then blow dried my hair without a brush. I really do love this product and so happy it found me :)</li>
            <li> Worked really well and it smelled great!</li>
            <li> Okay so I am African American with transitioning hair (thick, and coarse, curly hair with a lot of damaged ends) and I was recommended to try this because of the price. I really like that it&#x27;s so cheap however I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner works really well to detangle, like really really well! I could easily finger detangle my entire head (I usually use a wide tooth comb) and this was done on two week old hair that was knotting badly. It also kept my hair frizz free when I had a stretched style, like a curlformer set. The smell is great too, nothing too strong, it smells tropical and fruity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However after rinsing it out, my hair didn&#x27;t really feel deep conditioned and moisturized. It was like there was a coating over it ( Due to the silicones) My hair felt smooth but not &#x27;soft&#x27;. Overall I think this is a good travel product (Something you take on vacation) because it works fast but for long term use I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those with my hair type.</li>
            <li> Nice AND Bigger than i thought</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved the regular Aussie 3 minute miracle for a long time, but had no idea it came in a special version for color treated hair.  So needless to say, I&#x27;m still a fan of this new version.  The scent is slightly different that the normal version, but still appealing.  Shampoo your hair as normal, then apply the 3 Minute Miracle ... and proceed with your showering duties.  Just leave it on your hair for a good 3 minutes, then rinse.  Your hair will be soft and shiny and smell delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair that tends to be frizzy if too much moisture gets removed.  This conditioner helps to maintain that moisture - I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> I received another Aussie product called \\&quot;3 Minute Miracle  Color\\&quot; which promises 10x the protection (from what?) \\&quot;Helps protect color-treated hair from damage\\&quot;. The hair I have left isn&#x27;t colored, so I&#x27;m not sure I can provide a review of any substance besides my previous experience with Aussie products, all of which have been positive. This stuff certainly smells good. But it&#x27;s a different product from what I was going to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Aussie \\&quot;3 Minute Miracle Color\\&quot; conditioner, it worked great, smelled good, left my hair significantly easier to deal with that the cheap (Suave brand) conditioner I usually use. The fact that the cap is on the bottom of the container is kind of weird, however, as opening the container means to have to juggle the dispensed product, the cap and the bottle all at once.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic conditioner. It has left my hair feeling so nice and smooth and silky. I love the smell of it and how thick it is. I left it one my hair for three minutes as the bottle instructs and I love how soft and full looking it has left my hair. I plan to use it once a week and will definitely be buying more of it!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dry. Like straw. This Aussie 3 Minute Miracle is one of the best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve run across. Over the years, I&#x27;ve splurged here and there on expensive salon-only products, and this 3 Minute Miracle stands its own - at a much lower price. Leaves hair feeling softer (not silky, just keepin it real, my dry hair will never feel silky), and more manageable. NOTE: Follow directions and finish with a cool rinse. That seems to seal your hair somehow.</li>
            <li> This did not leave my hair feeling conditioned at all.  It was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve US d in mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> Works great, 2nd time purchase</li>
            <li> I have extremely coarse hair, and this product smooths it out immediately! I used it once and already saw a difference. I can&#x27;t recommend buying this product enough!! After receiving this through BzzAgent, I will definitely be purchasing on my own as well.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff really is a miracle for my frizzy hair! I recently had my hair dyed and got highlights two weeks later. My hair is a tangled mess when I get in the shower. But after I shampoo I apply the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle and let it soak while I continue washing up. I rinse it out and the tangles are gone! I also love the smell of this product, it smells good and tropical but not overpowering. (PS I&#x27;m trying this product free thanks to Aussie and BzzAgent)</li>
            <li> i tend to have pretty dry hair that gets really frizzy when i don&#x27;t use leave-in conditioners or other such conditioning treatments. i tried this product hoping to see an improvement in my dry hair and luckily it worked. i found that after a few washes my hair did not feel nearly as dry as it usually does. also when i used heat tool,s my hair kept a nice shine when usually my hair is dull. i didn&#x27;t change anything else about my haircare routine when suing this product but now i know i need to add it to my shower routine. i recommend this to anyone with dry hair. it would still benefit those with normal- greasy hair but i suggest using less of the product and only once a week. i use it overtime i shower now because it really helps my fdry hair. also the packaging is phenomenal because it is just a squeeze tube and it is easy to hold while in the shower. i have never had a problem with the bottle squirting outs much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disclaimer: i received this product as a free sample for testing purposes thanks to Aussie</li>
            <li> I received Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist deep conditioner for free thanks to Aussie and BzzAgent. I had heard good things about this product, but it ultimately just wasn&#x27;t for me. It smells great, but it didn&#x27;t condition my hair as well as my regular conditioner. However, my hair is notoriously finicky, so it&#x27;s probably just me. I&#x27;m not a fan of the bottle, as it can be difficult to squeeze with wet hands. Those things aside, this is probably a great product for someone with different hair needs than my own. The price can&#x27;t be beat, so it&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
            <li> I wear my hair up routinely for work, so the ends are usually dry and crispy. I have to get a trim every couple months or it looks bad. I&#x27;ve been using Aussie 3 minute miracle for a month now, and I haven&#x27;t had a trim yet. I think the product will actually let me start to grow my hair a bit since it seems to be doing wonders for my dry hair. I leave it in while washing my body and haven&#x27;t really timed it. I did also use it in spinach as shave cream and it worked well for that too, especially with the light coconut scent it has. I love the bottle in the shower, but made the mistake of bringing this with in my suitcase. It took a lot longer than 3 minutes to clean up the mess. I wish there was a way to close the cap so you could bring it with while traveling. The drain of the bottle is the only thing that kept this from being a 5 star product. Of course, it&#x27;s almost cheap enough in stores to get a new bottle for trips and just throw away the extra, but that feels so wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;I got to sample this for free courtesy of an Aussie sampling through BzzAgent. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> Wonderful, fragrant smell, very-creamy texture and feel, and a new kind of upside-down twist-off dispenser. The Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner leaves the hair feeling very flexible and smooth!</li>
            <li> The wifes hair is FRIED! Years of straightening with a flat iron thats who knows how many hundreds of degrees (i straightened my beard once as a joke... and it about melted my face off like the nazi at the end of Indiana Jones LOL...) AND she has colored it so oooooo many times...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say - bam, she now has juicy hair! It smells good, not like mothballs or aqua net like other companies stuff has..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and aussie is a good brand.&lt;br /&gt;go.buy.now.</li>
            <li> Does what is supposed to do. Soft shiny hair with a clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I do have dry air, thin, but a lot, and a bit long.</li>
            <li> This reminds me of the conditioner you get in the hair dye packages.  It really helps and smells good.</li>
            <li> This product truly is a miracle to help restore moisture to my thick hair!</li>
            <li> One of the greatest  and most affordable conditioners out there. After I fried my color treated hair with a flat iron (*smh*) I felt hurt and lost. My hair was so listless and brittle. Moisturizers and oils just sat on my hair. I began using this deep conditioner and the first use I felt and saw a difference! Many months later, I use it on an irregular basis and a deep conditioner and I&#x27;m still in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slowed down on my use and my hair is breaking off bit by bit (the damaged color treated parts), I&#x27;m going to get back into using this again. Thanks Aussie!&lt;br /&gt;Check out the other products in this line, I plan to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because some may wonder is this is good for ethnic hair, YEP!</li>
            <li> This season my favorite deep conditioner at the drugstore is Aussie Moist 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deeeep Liquid Conditioner. I love the bottle it comes in, It is so easy to use and allows you to control exactly how much product you want to use. Much like all the other Aussie products it smells absolutely amazing and is so worth the price. A little goes a long way with this conditioner even if you have long hair!!!!!!! Always need this is my shower and use once a week!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is really really good. It does what it states on the packaging. It&#x27;s defentely a miracle. Wouldnt hesitate to purchase another one.</li>
            <li> The Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner was not for me.  The biggest issue with this product was that it had a chemical odor similar to hair dye. This made using it unpleasant, which should not be the case for conditioner.  If there was some great benefit to using this product, such as the extreme moistness described, this might be able to be overlooked.  However, I did not find that it was any more moisture-enhancing than any typical deep conditioner sold at the supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, this product may work well for others but did not fit well for me.</li>
            <li> I buy a ton of stuff through Amazon now that I have Amazon prime, but I actually just picked this product up at Walmart after reading reviews here on Amazon.  I don&#x27;t want to jump the gun too much on a review because I know that shampoos and conditioners can work great at first and then kind of peter out, but honestly, so far this stuff has been a godsend.  My hair was so dry from getting it highlighted that I was thinking I was going to need to stop doing that altogether.  Regular conditioners had zero effect.  This stuff has made my hair soft and light again.  I can&#x27;t stop touching it :)  If it keeps working this well, I&#x27;ll definitely start to order it in bulk from Amazon.  It&#x27;s already so inexpensive anyway.  Everybody&#x27;s hair is different, but I hope this works as well for you as it did for me!</li>
            <li> My friend recommend this conditioner! So I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;It works for me!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!  Where has this been all my life?!  My hair is so much softer and smoother with this conditioner!!  I don&#x27;t even have a bunch of little stray strands on top of my head like I used to.  I think I was the only one who has this as I never notice anyone else with that!  I will be using this product for the rest of my life, hopefully they will make it that long!  If you&#x27;re unsure whether to buy this or not, it wasn&#x27;t that much money from what I recall, I would give it a shot.  I love this conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> For the price, I was expecting a deception. But the product met the expectations I had. I recommend. Very good.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t handle the smell. Too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I literally just finished washing and conditioning my hair and hair is butter soft.&lt;br /&gt;Background: I have 4b relaxed hair with a short cut. Anyways, I relaxed my hair last week and it has been sooooo dry. My ends were super dry, my crown was dry and I needed a deep moisturizing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;So I washed my hair this morning and I used this conditioner, sat under my bonnet dryer. I was under the dryer for about an hour (online shopping) and I finally decided to rinse. . OMG OMG OMG - MY HAIR IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SOFTTTTT - the crown, my ends everything. It feels so nice, I can&#x27;t believe this is my hair. Lol.  I haven&#x27;t even applied my cantu leave in yet.&lt;br /&gt;This WILL be used in rotation w/ my ORS conditioner. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I bought this a couple of years ago. . Idk why but I didn&#x27;t like it. Maybe it needed a jumpstart with some heat, but now I am a believer! Lol.</li>
            <li> Its a good conditioner. I use it twice a week and seems to tame my hair well.</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Tks for send me perfectly!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Aussie is what I prefer over other brands for my hair and they continue to slay with this product. I have tried homemade, over the counter, and salon deep conditioners/hair masks, but end up with worse results than what I started with. I already get greasy roots and straw like strands the day after I wash/condition, but this stuff has made my hair feel so soft and my roots are no longer flat and greasy the next day! Will definitely be buying again and recommending to everyone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like hair magic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than those expensive ones I got from store. I love it! And it smells really good too.</li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this. I have really chemically damaged hair and this works wonders for me. I use this as my normal conditioner and it keeps my hair looking and feeling healthy. The smell is kind of a really really sweet coconut but it&#x27;s pleasant and not overwhelming. It&#x27;s a thick conditioner so it can make my roots look oily sometimes but I have short hair so it&#x27;s hard to avoid them so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. For $3 you can&#x27;t go wrong. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I have highly processed hair, such as, I have dye between platinum blonde, to pink, back to platinum blonde, to grayish blonde back to pink, then to brown and eventually back to blonde..............as you can see, I like to experiment with my hair color.  My stylist has done an incredible job keeping it healthy despite the colorings, but I needed something at home to help keep it soft and smooth.  This product is the best  I&#x27;ve ever used.  It tops any of the expensive masques and in shower deep conditioners for a quarter of the cost.  I am amazed at the low price and quality results.  I use it maybe three times a week and when I blow dry my hair, it is silky soft and smooth.  Try it, you can&#x27;t beat the cost.</li>
            <li> This is a true 3 minute miracles. It always leaves my long hear soft  I leave it longer in the ends and it works best if you wrapt a warm towel or shower with a plastic cap. It is great product at a fantastic price</li>
            <li> This is one of the two best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s definitely the BEST VALUE out there. It&#x27;s actually insane how cheap this is. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This works awesome. I tried another deep conditioner and it just made my hair oily. This one actually makes it softer and adds moisture.</li>
            <li> yes, it make a miracle</li>
            <li> Was lucky enough to get some free Aussie 3 Minute Miracle conditioning product from BzzAgent and I really like this stuff!  I&#x27;ve over processed my hair so much it&#x27;s hard to find a conditioner that makes it feel healthy and like its getting back to its normal strength and this product is doing just that!  Looking forward to more uses and how much better it looks/feels!</li>
            <li> i received the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle , tried it for the first time , it is really magical , it gave my hair smoothness , and its so moist , like i never felt before , and like i never had any problems with frizzles or dryness , i would recommend it for my friends and family , and i would buy it again , and buy other products from aussie to my hair .</li>
            <li> For shiny strong, moisturize and  healthy- looking hair try this deep conditioner(3 minute miracle Moist deep condition). It&#x27;s literally a miracle. It has tame my hair in ways I have never imagined before.My hair is usually frizzy and wild and I thought it was not going to work. However, it somehow managed to control the frizz. I saw a difference, and it was more manageable after I used it. Last but not least, I want to thank Aussie and BzzAgent for letting me try this product for free.</li>
            <li> I think EVERYOME should try aussie&#x27;s 3min repair AT LEAST once!! Or any Aussie product for that matter! This product not only is amazing for your hair but what adds to the benefits at least for me was the great smell and how amazingly soft and refreshed my hair felt after I was done using this!

The price is not that bad compared to other products on the market that sayyyyy it helps improve health of your hair and repairs... I cannot get enough of this product...  Not only did I use it for myself but also for my daughters who also have course thick hair... They were in complete aw after they felt their hair getting out of the shower and even the next day!

This Aussie product is a DEFINITE must in my book! So what are you waiting for!! Get out there and get your Aussie on!! I reviewed this product for free from the amazing BZZagent!</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THE AUSSIE 3 MINUTE MIRACLE MOIST DEEP CONDITIONER FOR FREE FROM AUSSIE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST OPINION AND HERE IT GOES....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE USED THE PRODUCT A TOTAL OF 3 TIMES ON MYSELF AND 1 ON MY 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. I LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS AND HAVE REALLY BEEN ENJOYING THE EXTRA QUIET TIME I GET IN THE BATHROOM. WHEN I RINSE THE CONDITIONER IT FEELS AMAZING. MY HAIR IS SOFT AND MANAGEABLE ONCE ITS DETANGLED AND DRY. MY DAUGHTERS HAIR FELT SOFTER AND HER DRY ENDS WHERE LESS DRY :) THANKS AUSSIE. HOWEVER, YES.... HOWEVER! THE PRODUCT CAUSES BUILD UP FAIRLY QUICKLY AND THOUGH IT MAY BE A MINOR PROBLEM FOR SOME IT WAS HUGE FOR ME. EVEN MY DAUGHTER HAD SOME BUILD UP THE POOR THING WAS ITCHING AND ALL. I DID TRY IT MID SHAFT AND BELOW AND IT MADE A DIFFERENCE TO HOW MUCH BUILD UP IT CAUSED. BUT IN THIS CASE MY ROOTS GOT LESS OF A CHANGE -_- OVER ALL I WOULD RECOMMEND TO GIVE THIS ITEM A TRY FOR A FEW DOLLARS AT WALMART ITS DEFINITELY COMPETITION TO MY $32 FROM A DESIGNER BRAND.</li>
            <li> My hair is super long now so after my shower its super hard to get a brush through the ends. I started to use the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner and I haven&#x27;t had that issue and it smells amazing!! I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Aussie!</li>
            <li> It is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used so far. My hair was getting dry and tangled. This sorts out the tangle mess and makes my hair feel smooth like silk. It really works so much better than the others conditioners I have used.</li>
            <li> *I received the moist version for free from BZZ AGENT* Love it! I have an oily scalp but my ends are getting drier . This has lead to my curls getting more tangled and difficult to managed. This helps pop my curls and leave the soft, shiny and tangle free.</li>
            <li> The deep conditioner works great.  I use it twice a week and it has really made my hair smooth and no fly aways.</li>
            <li> After trying countless deep conditioners and none of them working like they said they would (my hair would either be greasy or weighted down), I was pleasantly surprised by how great Aussie 3 minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner worked. I got to try it out as part of being a buzz agent, but I will be buying it again and again. You can feel a difference as soon as your rinse it out of your hair. The best part is that it leaves your hair feeling soft, shiny, and manageable for days after using it. I highly recommend getting this, and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner!!! I received this conditioner courtesy of Aussie for testing purposes, and I&#x27;m honestly surprised at myself for not trying it sooner. It&#x27;s simple and easy to use, you just leave it in your hair for 3 minutes before rinsing it out. I&#x27;ve been using it for close to a month now, and have noticed a DRAMATIC change in my hair! MY hair is softer now ( after years of color damage setting in), and I also almost always have a good hair day now! I pretty much don&#x27;t know what frizz is anymore, which is a HUGE plus in my book! I&#x27;ve noticed that the frizz is gone even when it&#x27;s raining outside, so more kudos for that as well. I also love the way my curls naturally set when I air-dry my hair now. This is definitely a product I recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. First time I used it, I could feel the results. My hair is nice and soft and feels healthier. The conditioner is nice and thick. I put it on my hair wet and it absorbed the water and left my hair feeling amazing. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received 2 bottles of Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Conditioner by being part of a Bzz Campaign and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this product. My ends are usually dry due to using my flat iron often throughout the week so it looked damaged and unhealthy. I have been using this product for over a month now and my hair looks completely different. It looks silky smooth and it doesn&#x27;t have frizz to it anymore plus the conditioner smells really good. My ends no longer look dry and I don&#x27;t have to use my flat iron every day. A good decent blow dry is good enough to keep my hair looking good for work! I am on my way to repairing my hair thanks to Aussie 3 minute miracle and to Bzz Agent. #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because it really does work miracles! I normally have very frizzy, dry hait since I color my hair and it&#x27;s curly. I only had to use this once and put it in my hair for 3 minutes and it completely transformed my hair into silky, smooth, amazingness! I got this free from bzz agent</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner! I have tried so many different ones and this is the best I have tried. Makes my hair smooth and hydrated..... :)</li>
            <li> I got this free through BzzAgent and I LOVE THIS!!! a leave in conditioner that works for my children and myself. it works for all kinds of thickness of hair. I have tried several different deep conditioners and this is the best one!! i may no longer need to look for another one.</li>
            <li> I have always equated the Aussie brand with exclusively Caucasian hair. I have thick African American hair with a very coarse texture. Most conditioners claim to be the best at moisturizing, but usually fall short of those claims when it comes on to textured hair. As a matter of fact you rarely see ads for conditioners featuring women with textured hair. Well maybe Aussie can change all that. Here goes the verdict.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up to Aussie for coming up with this innovative design for the bottle. The product comes out of the bottom. There are no screw off tops  or flip caps to contend with while in the shower. This is a actually a very brilliant idea, especially if you condition your hair daily. The design is more convenient and will shave a couple seconds off your daily routine at minimum. The flip side to this package , that could present itself as a  potential flaw is ease of transporting the product. I fear that if I take this bottle with me on a trip, it could spell disaster. If you just toss it in your bag, the pressure from other items may cause it to leak. I love the bold purple color of the bottle and think it stands out on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance and consistency:&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice the scent to be overwhelmingly coconut as other reviewers have said. The 3 Minute miracle has a definite tropical scent with what I would describe as a hint of  coconut. The fragrance was very pleasant and not too strong. As for consistency, the conditioner is very thick. But no so thick that you had trouble distributing it throughout your hair. It also comes out of the bottle very easily. I didn&#x27;t wipe mine clean after each use, and didn&#x27;t notice any clogs.&lt;br /&gt;Performance:&lt;br /&gt;This is where Aussie has won me over. This product is amazing and really makes hair Aussome. Remember, I have textured hair which means my hair is tightly coiled and with that comes fragile, really unmanageable hair on wash day. I applied the Aussie 3 minute miracle and waited threeminutes as indicated. I was able to glide the comb through my hair with very little tangling. The conditioner provided great slip and moisture. I blow dried my hair after and really saw the difference. My hair was definitely shinier and more manageable. I have to tell all my friends about this product, so they too can have a less painful washday experience. This conditioner works miracles, even on textured hair, which is very rare. Before Aussie I dreaded washing my hair, because I knew how unmanageable it would become. Thanks Aussie 3 minute miracle. I got mine free courtesy of Bzz agent.</li>
            <li> I have a very rough and frizzy hair type. My hair length is longer and that makes hard to manage . When I received my bzzkit ( Free full size bottle to try from bzzagent.com) , I was really hoping for a miracle ;-)  Aussie Three Minute Miracle- I like the bottle style, it is different and unique bottle. When I used it for the first time, I kept it in my hair for 3 minutes and when I washed it , it was not tangled as much as I usually have. I waited to let it air dry and it was softer and smoother than before. Note that, I have very frizzy and wavy hair and this will not make it go away but makes it more manageable.  The best part of it is, this is very cheap compared to other products out there and it really works. I have tried some expensive items to make my hair look good but Aussie works just as great and does not even cost much. :)  Overall a very good product. Deserves full 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Biught this at walmart after seeing so manu√±y good reviews. It broke off my hair and left ir very dry, wordt conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> I am loyal to the Aussie brand so I was happy to be able to test this product out thanks to BZZAGENT and AUSSIE.  This item truly is a miracle! After using the &amp;#34;MOIST&amp;#34; a few times, I noticed it really helped tame my frizz! Would definitley reccomend!</li>
            <li> I have been using Aussie 3-minute miracle on and off since I was 13 years old and am now 34. It helped me through a wide variety of hair problems. I stopped using it 2 years ago because I thought I wouldn&#x27;t need it anymore after cutting my hair short. I was excited to try it again when Bzzagent gave me the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to say I was wrong. Even with short hair, it works wonders. My personal hair problem is dryness. It can make it harder to comb through and can feel like straw. Just looking at it you can tell it&#x27;s dry. After using Aussie 3-minute miracle once, my hair looked and felt much softer. The effect didn&#x27;t lessen as I continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for everyone! It helps with a variety of hair problems and even has different varieties to help target your specific needs. It&#x27;s affordable and makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzzagent and Aussie, I was able to try the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist for free. My hair tends to be dry and brittle especially since I use a relaxer in my hair, so I was really excited Bzzagent picked me to try Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist. I was really skeptical at first. I mean could this really moisturize and transform my hair in as little as 3 minutes? I was ready to put it to the test! After I shampooed my hair, I grabbed the bottle of Aussie 3 minute miracle. First off, I would like to say that I love how the bottle is stored with the opening on the bottom so that there is always conditioner ready to be squeezed out. No more having to shake and pound the conditioner bottles to get that last bit of conditioner out! This bottle will let gravity do all the work so that when I&#x27;m ready to condition my hair, it will come out with a simple squeeze. The scent is amazing! It reminds me of a cool coconut drink on a nice tropical getaway! I loved the smooth texture of the conditioner in my hair. I waited the 3 minutes and then rinsed it out. It rinsed out pretty easily. I dried and styled my hair and love how it looks and feels. It doesn&#x27;t look or feel dry and has a nice shine to it. Will definitely use this product again and look forward to trying the other varieties to meet my hair needs.</li>
            <li> Im so in love with aussie 3 min miracle!  Its the best thing my hair has ever tried! It has everything to offer, nice looking hair, not expensive, great smell, and its just awesome! I got this free from aussie and i recommend it 100%! Try it you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> looooooooove looooove looooove this. first off i got this free from bzzagent to test. this is one of the best products i tested from them so far. makes my kinky curly hair so silky smooth. even use it in a spray bottle with water as a detangler and refrresher between washes. this is a naturalista must have!!!! quenches thirsty curls and makes them pop!!!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner and it is good for any type of hair. Great value comparing to any other conditioner brand. I recommend .</li>
            <li> I bought it at 0.99 as a add-on product.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this worked! I have very thick, unruly, dry hair so I left this conditioner in for 5 minutes instead of 3. By the time I rinsed it out, my hair was incredibly soft, smooth, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is smaller than I expected, but given that you aren&#x27;t expected to use the conditioning treatment every day, it will last a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This provides a great conditioning treatment for much less than other deep conditioners. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended! Very committed seller</li>
            <li> One of the best hair conditioners on the market, it&#x27;s every bit as good as something that you might buy from a hair salon but much more reasonably priced. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and leaves your hair so soft and smooth. I used to buy all my hair products from a salon but after trying the aussie brand I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since 2010 with positive results of hydration, softness, silkiness and shine. There&#x27;s a pleasant slight coconut fragrance. My dyed and hot-tooled hair gets a refreshing, moisturizing reprieve from this economical deep conditioner once a week. Using it too frequently causes my scalp to have build up and become itchy. Often I&#x27;ll use it while having a hot cup of tea, leaving it on more than 3 minutes in a plastic shower cap or one for processing; uplifting for hair and spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formulation has changed AGAIN since the original. It does seem thicker and rinses cleaner with less residue. It&#x27;s not as good as the ORIGINAL in the blah cream colored bottle and formulation that conditioned, moisturized and strengthened the hair, but it&#x27;s very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Recently had the opportunity to try the newly introduced version for color-treated hair and it did equally as well on my home-dyed hair. I never see my color going down the drain when using either version.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It smells pleasant and leaves my hair feeling smooth. I am not crazy about the bottle though. It is hard to control the amount of conditioner coming out of it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I must say I&#x27;m a little skeptical with those highly rated products which are usually recommended on fashion and hair blogs, but this one really works.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it has, but if you really let it stay in your hair for at least 3 min, you will feel how smooth it will be.&lt;br /&gt;I usually dry my hair right after washing it and the product is also good for me. The smell is just so delicious. Everybody noticed I had something different here.</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with Shea Moisture&#x27;s Anti-Breakage Strengthening Masque as a deep conditioner, and sat under a heated cap for about 30 minutes. My hair was the absolute softest it&#x27;s ever been! I&#x27;ll definitely be adding this to my hair routine.</li>
            <li> Great for really dry hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, this conditioner did a decent job of conditioning my hair, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away. It did provide a nice amount of slip, but I&#x27;ve tried other conditioners ([[ASIN:B00GOQFOD2 Alberto Vo5 Silky Experiences Moisturizing Conditioner Shea Cashmere]] works very well and is my go-to conditioner) that provide even more silkiness and moisture. I did like the scent. It&#x27;s very pleasant without being too overpowering. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this in the future, but it&#x27;s nice as an everyday conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I got to try it free as part of BzzAgent, a sample review site, and I loved it. It instantly transformed my hair from dry to moist, and I love how it only took a few minutes in the shower to achieve! It&#x27;s also affordable, which is hard to find when it comes to deep conditioning. Now I can save a few dollars and have nice hair every day!</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well and I only need to use it 2 times a week I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the scent is too much, and too fruity for me. I would give this more stars if it weren&#x27;t for the strong scent.</li>
            <li> I like this AUSSIE 3 MINUTE MIRACLE MOISTURIZING CONDITIONER.  I&#x27;ve colored my hair for eons, and my 10 year old daughter has a ton of fine, curly hair.  We both fight the frizzies.  But this stuff really seems to tame them.  Both of us have sleeker, smother hair when we use AUSSIE 3 MINUTE MIRACLE MOISTURIZING CONDITIONER a couple of time a week.  And it does not weigh down her curls or fade my color.  This is definitely good stuff.</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a Bzzagent campaign. Not only is it fast, it actually works. I don&#x27;t need to spend 20 minutes with a deep conditioner in my hair for amazing results! Also, it smells as good as it works!</li>
            <li> I got this item free from Bzz Agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this stuff is awesome - think beach in the summer. The bottle design makes it really easy to use in the shower, I don&#x27;t have to worry about opening up a bottle or dropping the cap or anything like that. Just squeeze it and go. And the price is really great - Amazon often posts coupons on here (like right now, it&#x27;s $1 off a price of $2...so only $1?? Yes please!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have color treated hair, and this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to harm it in any way, and honestly my current $40 fancy salon stuff seems to be on par with this one. So...$40 or $1? Yep, I&#x27;ll go with the $1 and go get me some nice vodka with the rest to make fancy cocktails while my hair smells like the beach. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really like this deep conditioner! I received it from Bzzagent for review purposes. I loved the smell and it definitely made my hair softer! It improved the look of my hair for sure! It didn&#x27;t however do much for my frizziness; it reduced it but didn&#x27;t completely get rid of it. Definitely a good drugstore option for a deep conditioner! I honestly couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair and feeling how soft it was! I also have really long and thick hair and this definitely made it more manageable!</li>
            <li> I am leery to new hair products because my curly hair is so unruly that I never know what&#x27;s going to work and how managable it will be once it dries. I feel in love with Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle as soon as I opened the bottle. The fragrant conditioner is rich, creamy and works through the hair never weighing it down and leaving it full of volume, detangled and full of life. The Three Minute Miracle doesn&#x27;t leave you disappointed and although I got it free (free thanks to Aussie) it was money well spent honey! Seriously I just took braids out after two weeks and usually I have a head full of tangles and with this it was next to none.</li>
            <li> I use to use this all the time years ago before other people caught on that is was really great. They must have changed it sometime in the last few years because it doesn&#x27;t work as well. It&#x27;s okay now but no miracle anymore. I keep this as an add in for deep conditioning which is a mixture of a few deep conditioners as well as some oil but on it&#x27;s own it didn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It came very fast to my house and I love it!</li>
            <li> I have natural 4a type hair and I think that this conditioner is comparable to the cheap 99 cents v05 conditioner that you can get at basically any store that sells hair products. This conditioner did nothing special for my hair and the smell is too overpowering. I would skip buying this and go for a better quality conditioner.</li>
            <li> I received two bottles of this conditioner for free for my opinion some buzzagent.  I tried the product for 3 weeks using it every other day.  The first thing I will say is that it absolutely did make my hair extremely soft. but it made my hair weirdly frizzy.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have naturally wavy / curly hair... I would still be willing to try one of the other ones just not the moist one again.</li>
            <li> I received Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist free to try. I have tried everything under the sun to get my unruly hair to calm down. Aussie 3 Minute Miracle has helped do just that! I love how soft and more manageable my hair has become. What was once all over the place, dry and really frizzy is now soft and has added some much needed moisture that most conditioners just can&#x27;t do for me.</li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels after using Aussie 3 Minute Miracle, it left my hair feeling stronger than ever. Thanks to Bzzagent I was able to receive this sample for free. My hair is always dry so I was pleased to use this and for it to keep my hair moist. I will keep using Aussie in the future.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Delivered on time, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
            <li> Like any other Black woman it takes me a long time to do my hair. and sticking to the curly girl method it takes me a little longer then ususal. BUT this deep condtioner changed all that it cuts the time in half!! and it leaves ur hair so soft and smooth from the moment it touches ur hair.</li>
            <li> I love the product, it is very good!</li>
            <li> This treatment really works. At first I really disliked the smell, but after a few uses I have grown to love it. It smells a lot like butter, with a mild sweet fragrance in there too. It leaves my hair very soft and the ends look awesome!</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!! I just recently went platinum blonde and soon experienced the maintenance nightmare after my first at home wash!üòñüò©üò´üò¢ It was so soft and bouncy once I left the salon! My stylist made sure she instructed me on home care ( she did an amazing cut &amp; color on my hairüòç) and I followed them exactly to the T!! She suggested I use Pureology ( I think I spelled it rgt lol) shampoo &amp; conditioner and it left my dry in brittle. The price of both the shampoo was over $60! I really did expect to receive the same at home results but was sadly disappointed to found out that  wasn&#x27;t gonna happen. I started to think OMG! What have I done!! My hair felt so dry like straw! I instantly went on line and searched for the best products for dry colored hair. Aussies 3min miracle came up a lot! So after researching I decided to give it a try &amp; I am soooooo happy I did!!! In the top left pic my I washed &amp; conditioned my hair with the pureology. In the lower left &amp; rgt pic I used  L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al Total repair 5 restoring shampoo and conditioned with the 3min miracle! This stuff literally saved my hair!! It&#x27;s so soft &amp; shiny! My ends aren&#x27;t crispy anymore! Lol!! I&#x27;m in love with this! The best $4 I&#x27;ve ever spent! I can surely say that I will not be using any other deep conditioner! Yes it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft and does reduce frizz when out the shower!</li>
            <li> It was above average. My hair is really manageable, but I had some tangles that were tough. But you can&#x27;t expect miracles. Ive barely started using this as well. It&#x27;s awesome for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I just started using this along with the Aussie Moist Shampoo &amp; the moist deep treatment, and I loove it! It leaves my hair so soft and smooth. I have really dry hair from all the heat damage so this works really good for me!!</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair twice after stripping it and then dyed it within two weeks time frame. My hair was dry, breaking and frizzy.  I used this once and noticed a huge difference.  I was able to brush through with out snagging. When my hair dried it was shiny and pretty. Will keep using and buying. But at Walmart or drugstore where it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> Bought this at a store years ago -used only once in a while. We have hard water and I have never experienced anything like it. When I couldn&#x27;t find it at my grocery store, I went to Amazon. It truly is a miracle!! I use it all the time now üòÑ</li>
            <li> THE BEST DEEP CONDITIONER. I get about 6 uses out of a bottle and it&#x27;s so cheap. I use it every other time I shampoo. My hair feels so soft and shiny after using this product and I hope to never be without it!</li>
            <li> Just as described. Delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite curly and tangles easily. This conditioner not only smells fabulous but it helps detangle my hair in the shower. It moisturizes really well but rinses without leaving a heavy residue on my hair (my hair is fine)</li>
            <li> Love it! Brought life back to the my bleached locks in just 3 minutes!</li>
            <li> This is a must have conditioner. I use it 2-3 times a week or whenever my hair feels extra dry and it always manages to refresh my hair and get rid of that crunchy dry end texture. The packaging is also super convenient and you can twist it to close for when you&#x27;re traveling. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the vanilla/coconut smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger that much after you rinse it out so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I am a devoted fan of Aussie Moist products. This I&#x27;m not so sure about. I bought it thinking it would perfect for deep conditioning my afro-textured hair since I got such great results from the shampoo and conditioner. The outcome of using this was okay but I felt like I got the same results from the regular conditioner. I love the size of it. Very convenient. The most bothersome thing to me about this little thing is the smell. It&#x27;s very strong compared to the shampoo and conditioner. I wish they would have laid off the fragrance. Sorry to say, but I will have to look for a better deep conditioner or just stick with the regular Aussie Moist conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got to try the 3 Minute Miracle Moist for free thanks to Aussie and Bzzagent. :) I&#x27;ve never tried the Aussie brand, but was always curious. After this I will definitely look into trying their other products the next time I need hair care. Last night when washing - my hair felt silky smooth. It smelt AMAZING! This morning my hair still smells wonderful and feels soft. My curly/wavy hair has also held and is not as frizzy. I look forward to seeing what continued use does for my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this recently and thought it was a great product for me. I have long thick hair and usually I need a lot of product for a deep conditioning not with this one, this will last me a longer then most products.  It was very easy to use no long waiting times, or need for additional time or steps. I have 3 children who keep me very busy so 3 minutes to give my hair a deep conditioning treatment is great. After my hair dried if felt and looked healthier and softer. I like how effective this was for me. I did get this product from BzzAgent #gotitfree to try for free, as part of an Aussie promotiol event, but I will continue to purchase it because of how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last 10 years, I have very fine dry hair and live in the tropics. This is the best product ever, although I keep on trying other hair treatments, but  this is the one I always go back too. I leave it on over night and rinse out in the morning, makes your hair lovely and soft , and does not weigh it down. I cannot live without it !</li>
            <li> Thanks to bzzagent and aussie I wad able to try this product for free and I loved it.  Only 3 minutes and you wash out so you dont feel like you have too much product in your hair.  Didn&#x27;t feel stiff like some... great job Aussie.</li>
            <li> More free stuff from bzzagent!  Tried this on my daughter&#x27;s very thick, long hair.  It moisturized well.  She loved the fragrance.  It made brushing through it the next day easier with less tangles.  All in all, not a bad product.  Though, for the price point, I don&#x27;t see this being any more special than a knock-off pantene conditioner.  Also, there are unnecessary chemicals in this product I would prefer not to expose my family to.  Its a shame that since Aussie was looking to revamp their product line they didn&#x27;t take a more natural approach.</li>
            <li> very useful and smells great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle in a bottle!!!!! It leaves my hair so soft and conditioned I love love this stuff</li>
            <li> If you have thick, dry hair, this conditioner is a godsend.  This conditioner smooths on easily and provides the moisture weight that keeps really thick, dry hair smooth and frizz-free.  If you have fine or thin hair you&#x27;ll likely find this conditioner to be too heavy.  This is not the conditioner for everyone, but if you need tons of moisture it&#x27;s a fantastic deal and works really well.  I only have two complaints.  First, I miss the old Aussie scent.  This conditioner smells okay, but the old Aussie scent was fantastic.  Bring that back!  My second issue is with the bottle.  It&#x27;s a bit odd. there&#x27;s no regular closure.  Some sort of external pressure keeps the product inside.  All you do is pull off a security label and squeeze.  I suspect it will be hard to get the ends of the bottle out when I get down to the last bits.  Overall, though, good conditioner.</li>
            <li> This Aussie 3 Minute Miracle really is a miracle.  Some time ago, I damaged my hair with a bad dye job; even though I&#x27;ve been cutting the ends off every few months, a few inches of the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; remains.  This conditioner made my hair -- including the damaged part -- soft and shiny and oh-so-manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if I love it so much, why did I give it only 4 stars?  It&#x27;s because of the opening...  The top comes with a hole covered with paper that you pull off to use it.  The conditioner is thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t squirt out, even when the bottle is upside down.  However, I can&#x27;t pack it in a suitcase when I go on vacation.  There&#x27;s no flip-top to cover the opening, and putting the bottle in a suitcase with no way to cover the opening is a disaster waiting to happen.  If there were a way to close this after removing the paper over the opening, I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could.  That Aussie didn&#x27;t put a cover over the opening hole is the dumbest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner is easy to use and takes just 3 minutes. After washing my hair in the shower I applied this conditioner and massaged it through my hair, from the routes to the ends. The container is kind of unique in that it isn&#x27;t necessary to remove the top of the bottle. There is a sticker covering the opening that needs to be peeled off and then I simply squeezed the bottle to release some conditioner. Nice not having to remove tops or flip up caps and then remember to replace them. The conditioner stays in the bottle when not being squeezed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting 3 minutes I rinsed my hair and then dried and styled it as usual. It was easy to comb out and wasn&#x27;t tangly when wet. The conditioner left a nice, light fragrance. The best part is that it made my hair look thicker and it held a curl well when I used a curling iron after drying. I have very fine hair and this made it more manageable.</li>
            <li> Aussie 3 Minute Miracle is a super-thick deep conditioner that does miracles to keep my thick hair in check.  I have used this product for years  -- it leaves my hair very soft and manageable.  I was thrilled to see that Aussie introduced a version for color-treated hair.  I don&#x27;t have any idea what makes the product for color-treated hair any different from regular 3 Minute Miracle and was unable to detect any difference.  As with all of the Aussie products I&#x27;ve tried, this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is much thicker than typical conditioners.  There is very little to no scent.  After 3 minutes, it was relatively easy to rinse off.  My hair feels a bit softer but only repeated usage will tell how miraculous this product really is.</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair</li>
            <li> I have thin very damaged hair from frequent chemical treatments and daily hot tools.  I bought the \\&quot;Aussie 3 minute miracle\\&quot; conditioner because my hair needed help quick and this was within my budget, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting much more than average results.  WOW, was I ever pleasantly surprised!! The first thing a person notices with this conditioner is the smell, it is nothing short of heavenly.  Next is how thick this conditioner is which communicates the fact that a little of this goes a loooooong way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When rinsing, I was so surprised by how easily this conditioner rinsed out of the hair and yet how wonderfully soft it left my hair.  With thinning hair the last thing I would have needed was something that weighed my hair down, which this does NOT do.  This \\&quot;3 minute miracle\\&quot; simply very quickly repairs very damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aussie, PLEASE do NOT do like other companies have done and change the formula on a product that DOES NOT need any fixing.  Keep this product EXACTLY as it is now and you will have a life-long customer!!</li>
