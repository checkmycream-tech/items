            <li> I love this oil.  I bought it to use in homemade natural body scrubs for Christmas presents.  Not only was it great in the body scrub, I started using it everyday when I got out the shower in place of baby oil.  My skin feels so soft especially on my hands and feet.  I might as well have been a commercial because I have all my family members using it and asking where they could get more.    Also it says pure and it feels 100% pure.  My mom bought another brand of almond oil and it had acetate in it along with other things.  It was thinner and didn&#x27;t have the same effects as this one.</li>
            <li> Sweet almond oil, so many uses. get some!</li>
            <li> This almond oil is very good for the price and mixes well with other essential oils to create a wonderful blend for my therapeutic massage clients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil a little over a year. I use the oil every day in the shower right before I dry off. It makes my skin so nice and supple. People always ask me what I do for my skin- this is it! This is a good quality oil and the approximate $54 is the best price I&#x27;ve seen. I use this oil in my homemade body butters. The gallon was the most economical choice considering how often I use it. It&#x27;s lasted me a little over a year. I will be purchasing my 2nd NOW foods gallon soon.</li>
            <li> I use NOW almond oil as a replacement to vegetable oil when cooking, and to make homemade lotions and soaps. I love the light scent and how versatile it is. The only problem I have is with the pump. I&#x27;ve had to for 3 months and the pump stopped working. Otherwise, great product.</li>
            <li> I use a ton of Sweet Almond Oil in my body products. NOW Foods is one of my constant providers for great oils and essential oils. I love that they offer a gallon size of many of the oils I use frequently.</li>
            <li> I use almond oil in place of lotion as well as in exfoliating scrubs.  This gallon size was perfect - the pump is so handy.  The oil itself is very pure and of exceptional quality.</li>
            <li> This is a first class product.  My Dad, my sister and I all use it when we get out of the shower.  It is food grade but works awesome on our skin!</li>
            <li> If your into home rub downs, this is the oil for you.  Very smooth feeling for both parties.  Doesn&#x27;t leave that oily, slick feeling on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a superior product and consistently meets my expectations.  It is great for dry skin solutions.  I&#x27;ve never been dissappointed with this item.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for the past three years to help with her dry skin. She is very sensitive to products with Propylene glycol, as well as a host of other ingredients. This product has produced no adverse reactions at all, and has worked very well in providing a satisfactory result for dry skin. It was delivered later than expected, however.</li>
            <li> My husband and I found this cute little shop about 40 miles from our house that made me this wonderful honeysuckle scented oil. Only problems were it was kind of a long drive we rarely took and it was a tad expensive.  One day I got the idea to google how to make scented body oil.  The answer was so incredibly easy I am kicking myself wondering why I didn&#x27;t do it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil by Now Foods was very reasonably priced.  It is excellent quality. It was shipped quickly and arrived safe and sound. I have used it on my face and on my body.  I have used it in body oil, body butter, made it into solid bar form, and used it on my face.  I will be buying this again and again to replenish when need be.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for the full product. I use it every night as massage oil. Partner&#x27;s comments were - use something that has a scent. I like no scent and so does she, if it is this or nothing.  :)  I seek this out...</li>
            <li> this oil is really, really good. my whole family use it as day and night skin care. never feel too much oil on your skin, just wait a few minutes you just feel you skin better, brighter, and soft. i love use it as night care, every morning i just feel my skin better and better. great oil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good product and very fast product.</li>
            <li> I use this as my face wash and &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;. Takes 5 years off in 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> This product is as advertised.  Shipping was prompt.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and when I received the seal was broken and a quarter of the content was lost !!!&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed !!</li>
            <li> At under $47.00 for a gallon of sweet almond oil I could not beat the price.  I am using it to make body scrubs.  it is just wonderful.  I just love the way my hands feel after using my body scrub which is made with this.</li>
            <li> All as expected. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I first tried this oil in the 4oz size because I have never used sweet almond oil before.  That was gone in a week.  Next I bought a 160z size and found all kinds of uses for it.  I went through that fairly quickly too so the only option left was to order the gallon size.  I make body butters with it.  Recently, I have gotten into soap making and this with other oils, make the most conditioning soap ever.  This oil is so soothing on the skin.  It absorbs right away and leaves no fragrance.  I use it everyday after a shower and I even condition my hair with it.  This has easily become my favorite oil.  Oh, I almost forgot, it comes with a pump for easy dispensing.</li>
            <li> excellent product i use it every day. would not know how to act if i didn&#x27;t use it. highly reccomended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!!! I have been using it on my body and my hair and it really make a  difference.</li>
