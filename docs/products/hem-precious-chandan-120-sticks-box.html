            <li>VERY strong feminine scent.  </li>
            <li>Its been my favorite for years which is why I bought so many!</li>

            <li>The smell is kind of okay.</li>
            <li>Like a temple fragrance, and great for inducing a calm environment.</li>
            <li>Great scent, not flowery, not too heavy, just perfect.</li>
            <li>Not extremely smokey, has a wonderful smell.</li>

            <li>nothing in the world smells better.</li>
            <li>and what a lovely smell the incense give out when they burn.</li>
            <li>Item came on time, I just love this incent is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love the products from this brand.</li>
            <li>i will suggest them to use, you will love it</li>
            <li>I am in love.</li>

            <li>my favorite now.  </li>
            <li>you will love them.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THE SMELL OF THESE.</li>
            <li>but this is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure youll love.</li>
            <li>My favorite incense.  </li>
            <li>We love the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>Love this and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite incense.</li>
            <li>This you couldn&#x27;t do burn in any occupied rooms unless you have a very strong nose - like work in Yankee Candle strong...</li>
            <li>All the HEM incense I use are quality scents that burn well, with consistent scent throughout the burn, and remains a good while afterwards.</li>
            <li>The smell is not that strong, Makes more smoke as compare to smell.</li>
            <li>Easy to light!</li>
            <li>love them came very quickly</li>
            <li>Very nice incense, not quite as strong as Nag Champa, nice to burn in a smaller area.</li>
            <li>PRICE IS RIGHT!!</li>
            <li>They do have a bit strong smell</li>
            <li>Strong, but earthy fragrant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s close, but the underlying burnt smell is strong and hubby thinks its too soapy smelling.  </li>
            <li>I really like Precious Chandan&#x27;s smell!</li>
            <li>Smells quite nice, but not like chandana really.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy scents that you can burn &amp;#60;20 feet away and not be sickened.  </li>
            <li>Cheap soap smell.</li>
            <li>what it was, i just wanted something cheap in bulk.</li>
            <li>and i still have the majority of it left and my room smells great</li>
            <li>feelings that come to mind are uplifting, energetic yet calm, almost aphrodisiac.</li>
            <li>You can light one and</li>
            <li>Smooth relaxing scent</li>
            <li>I light them in the morning and evening - prayer routine.</li>
            <li>awsome scent  took a chance not knowing what it smelled like  very happy with purchase and fast standard delivery</li>
            <li>HEM makes good incense so this was an unexpected quality of funk.</li>
            <li>a good buy,the only thing i have too say there not that strong smelling,i like a strong smell for mediation.</li>
            <li>They look really oily, and like I said, the smoke is kind of rich and oily too.</li>
            <li>scent is nice, but my boxes were crammed in an envelope, inside was many smushed sticks..going to do my best, smells great, bit its a broken up mess, keeps dying out any heat ot flame</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It is a slightly more intense sandalwood aroma that has milky tones, but the intensity is cheerful rather than medatative like Hem Sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>Unbelievable price, very nice scent!</li>
            <li>No wonder I love it so much</li>
            <li>but I have no idea how anyone could say this type actually smells good.</li>
            <li>your whole house/apartment will smell like it for a day or more.  </li>
            <li>Very calming and elegant.  </li>
            <li>The smell is bold, but not musky or overpowering.</li>
            <li>We are fan of this product and have bought many, many different times</li>
            <li>Quick shipper.</li>
            <li>Decent scent ok burn time.</li>
            <li>Not sickeningly sweet and overpowering, just pleasant and thoughtful.</li>
            <li>I have a bunch of others that I have picked up here and there and was hoping this would be my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>I tried, really I did, but this is just some strong, overpowering incense.</li>
            <li>I just love HEM brand incense - they smell great and are long lasting.</li>
            <li>It just makes me calm.</li>
            <li>To be fair it was burned on two different occasions just to make sure it was not my imagination (or mood) leaving such a foul impression.</li>
            <li>Not unpleasant, but far too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Super value, great but, long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more when I run out, but the quantity for the cost is incredible and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>, I loved my previous sandalwood incense.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite incense by far!!</li>
            <li>my favorite scent is first rain, this scent is just not favorite worthy, i didnt like how obnoxious and in your face it is, its too strong</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It might be better to buy this in cones, as that&#x27;s what I used back then.  </li>
            <li>If you like incense that is more traditional, try this!!!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>at first I wanted to gag, and then i gave it a second chance and fell in love.</li>
            <li>if that is all you burn Hem Sandalwood is peaceful.  </li>
            <li>As with most things it depends on the individual to like or dislike anything.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>It is by far my new favorite.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of an &amp;#34;eastern&amp;#34; type smell, sandalwood with some other things involved.</li>
            <li>There are 6 boxes packed in a large box.</li>
            <li>Very evenly burning sticks.</li>
            <li>This stuff straight up smells like bug spray.</li>
            <li>if you really like the smell of bug spray.</li>
            <li>Every time I burn it, whoever is in my home wants to take some with them.</li>
            <li>this is a REAL smell.  </li>
            <li>Indian HEM (in my experience is much bolder in all spectrums)</li>
            <li>As for the burn times I&#x27;ve been getting an average of 45 minutes per stick which I think is pretty good, especially considering the affordability of the 120 stick box.</li>
            <li>It may just be my particular senses</li>
            <li>I wanted to use something even more traditional and reminiscent of home, so I went for sandalwood.</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that this one is a high quality.</li>
            <li>This scent is warm, aromatic, sensual, rich, a little woody, perfumy, dark.</li>
            <li>;, this incense has a little more sandlewood going on.  </li>
            <li>This incense smells so good, yet subtle,  Doesn&#x27;t bother sensitive noses.  </li>
            <li>I have probably 20 different boxes of HEM incense, and I&#x27;ve only been disappointed with a couple; however, this is the best smelling, and most uplifting, opening scent I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li>THis incense as a new one for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands an they are not as rich...</li>
            <li>I really like that because other sticks that are kind of dry don&#x27;t allow the aroma to linger as long after it finished burning.</li>
            <li>very relaxing.fast delivery.considering ordering in the future.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great quality incense, I never heard of this company but they pleasantly surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have burnt it several times already, and neither hubby nor I are very fond of it.  </li>
            <li>Its scent is soft, relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amo</li>
            <li>5 stars by far.</li>
            <li>Earthy, yet a slight sweet tint to it.</li>
            <li>This is in a similar vein in that it has its own smokey, earthy scent - hard to describe exactly how it smells other than to say that if you don&#x27;t need your incense to smell like strawberries or coconut, you&#x27;ll probably like it.  </li>
            <li>Seems to have less of a burning scent more floral than other brands I&#x27;ve tried........</li>
            <li>I mean nose-burning strong.  </li>
            <li>All the HEM fragrances I have ordered, at least five, smell like cheap soap and nothing like the name of each implies.</li>
            <li>package nicely,package was not crushed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a heavy woody musk scent that&#x27;s certainly worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Not a favorite, but again not bad.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I expected to be able to at least detect a scent that wouldn&#x27;t make me question the odor.</li>

            <li> nothing in the world smells better.</li>
            <li> and what a lovely smell the incense give out when they burn.</li>
            <li> Item came on time, I just love this incent is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love the products from this brand.</li>
            <li> i will suggest them to use, you will love it</li>
            <li> I am in love.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> my favorite now.  </li>
            <li> you will love them.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THE SMELL OF THESE.</li>
            <li> but this is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure youll love.</li>
            <li> My favorite incense.  </li>
            <li> We love the smell of this.  </li>
            <li> Love this and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite incense.</li>
            <li> This you couldn&#x27;t do burn in any occupied rooms unless you have a very strong nose - like work in Yankee Candle strong...</li>
            <li> All the HEM incense I use are quality scents that burn well, with consistent scent throughout the burn, and remains a good while afterwards.</li>
            <li> The smell is not that strong, Makes more smoke as compare to smell.</li>
            <li> Easy to light!</li>
            <li> love them came very quickly</li>
            <li> Very nice incense, not quite as strong as Nag Champa, nice to burn in a smaller area.</li>
            <li> PRICE IS RIGHT!!</li>
            <li> They do have a bit strong smell</li>
            <li> Strong, but earthy fragrant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s close, but the underlying burnt smell is strong and hubby thinks its too soapy smelling.  </li>
            <li> I really like Precious Chandan&#x27;s smell!</li>
            <li> Smells quite nice, but not like chandana really.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy scents that you can burn &amp;#60;20 feet away and not be sickened.  </li>
            <li> Cheap soap smell.</li>
            <li> what it was, i just wanted something cheap in bulk.</li>
            <li> and i still have the majority of it left and my room smells great</li>
            <li> feelings that come to mind are uplifting, energetic yet calm, almost aphrodisiac.</li>
            <li> You can light one and</li>
            <li> Smooth relaxing scent</li>
            <li> I light them in the morning and evening - prayer routine.</li>
            <li> awsome scent  took a chance not knowing what it smelled like  very happy with purchase and fast standard delivery</li>
            <li> HEM makes good incense so this was an unexpected quality of funk.</li>
            <li> a good buy,the only thing i have too say there not that strong smelling,i like a strong smell for mediation.</li>
            <li> They look really oily, and like I said, the smoke is kind of rich and oily too.</li>
            <li> scent is nice, but my boxes were crammed in an envelope, inside was many smushed sticks..going to do my best, smells great, bit its a broken up mess, keeps dying out any heat ot flame</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is a slightly more intense sandalwood aroma that has milky tones, but the intensity is cheerful rather than medatative like Hem Sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable price, very nice scent!</li>
            <li> No wonder I love it so much</li>
            <li> but I have no idea how anyone could say this type actually smells good.</li>
            <li> your whole house/apartment will smell like it for a day or more.  </li>
            <li> Very calming and elegant.  </li>
            <li> The smell is bold, but not musky or overpowering.</li>
            <li> We are fan of this product and have bought many, many different times</li>
            <li> Quick shipper.</li>
            <li> Decent scent ok burn time.</li>
            <li> Not sickeningly sweet and overpowering, just pleasant and thoughtful.</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of others that I have picked up here and there and was hoping this would be my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> I tried, really I did, but this is just some strong, overpowering incense.</li>
            <li> I just love HEM brand incense - they smell great and are long lasting.</li>
            <li> It just makes me calm.</li>
            <li> To be fair it was burned on two different occasions just to make sure it was not my imagination (or mood) leaving such a foul impression.</li>
            <li> Not unpleasant, but far too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> Super value, great but, long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more when I run out, but the quantity for the cost is incredible and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> , I loved my previous sandalwood incense.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite incense by far!!</li>
            <li> my favorite scent is first rain, this scent is just not favorite worthy, i didnt like how obnoxious and in your face it is, its too strong</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It might be better to buy this in cones, as that&#x27;s what I used back then.  </li>
            <li> If you like incense that is more traditional, try this!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> at first I wanted to gag, and then i gave it a second chance and fell in love.</li>
            <li> if that is all you burn Hem Sandalwood is peaceful.  </li>
            <li> As with most things it depends on the individual to like or dislike anything.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> It is by far my new favorite.</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of an &amp;#34;eastern&amp;#34; type smell, sandalwood with some other things involved.</li>
            <li> There are 6 boxes packed in a large box.</li>
            <li> Very evenly burning sticks.</li>
            <li> This stuff straight up smells like bug spray.</li>
            <li> if you really like the smell of bug spray.</li>
            <li> Every time I burn it, whoever is in my home wants to take some with them.</li>
            <li> this is a REAL smell.  </li>
            <li> Indian HEM (in my experience is much bolder in all spectrums)</li>
            <li> As for the burn times I&#x27;ve been getting an average of 45 minutes per stick which I think is pretty good, especially considering the affordability of the 120 stick box.</li>
            <li> It may just be my particular senses</li>
            <li> I wanted to use something even more traditional and reminiscent of home, so I went for sandalwood.</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that this one is a high quality.</li>
            <li> This scent is warm, aromatic, sensual, rich, a little woody, perfumy, dark.</li>
            <li> ;, this incense has a little more sandlewood going on.  </li>
            <li> This incense smells so good, yet subtle,  Doesn&#x27;t bother sensitive noses.  </li>
            <li> I have probably 20 different boxes of HEM incense, and I&#x27;ve only been disappointed with a couple; however, this is the best smelling, and most uplifting, opening scent I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li> THis incense as a new one for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands an they are not as rich...</li>
            <li> I really like that because other sticks that are kind of dry don&#x27;t allow the aroma to linger as long after it finished burning.</li>
            <li> very relaxing.fast delivery.considering ordering in the future.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great quality incense, I never heard of this company but they pleasantly surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have burnt it several times already, and neither hubby nor I are very fond of it.  </li>
            <li> Its scent is soft, relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amo</li>
            <li> 5 stars by far.</li>
            <li> Earthy, yet a slight sweet tint to it.</li>
            <li> This is in a similar vein in that it has its own smokey, earthy scent - hard to describe exactly how it smells other than to say that if you don&#x27;t need your incense to smell like strawberries or coconut, you&#x27;ll probably like it.  </li>
            <li> Seems to have less of a burning scent more floral than other brands I&#x27;ve tried........</li>
            <li> I mean nose-burning strong.  </li>
            <li> All the HEM fragrances I have ordered, at least five, smell like cheap soap and nothing like the name of each implies.</li>
            <li> package nicely,package was not crushed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy woody musk scent that&#x27;s certainly worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Not a favorite, but again not bad.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I expected to be able to at least detect a scent that wouldn&#x27;t make me question the odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not turned off by the heavy woodsy scent, but of the spicy scent of this particular one, but I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> long ago, but it doesn&#x27;t quite make it.  </li>
            <li> and the scent lasts a long time. . . . . . .</li>
            <li> , i know its a strange way of judging incense</li>
            <li> It burns slow,the smell is deep but won&#x27;t make you cough or sneeze like other incenses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rectangular and in between the thick based japanese sticks and the thinner red ones you see used in Chinese offerings.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very characteristic aroma - of DEET mosquito repellant.</li>
            <li> For those wondering, the sticks are not super thick, but not thin either.</li>
            <li> I like Nag Champa and many others, but this is bad stuff.</li>
            <li> It heavy with scent from the moment you open the box.  </li>
            <li> Very calming, centering scent to meditate by..not sickening sweet, as some &amp;#34;flower&amp;#34; smelling sticks are.  </li>
            <li> To this particular olfactory the &#x27;smell&#x27; was faint, but offensive.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, but I gave it 4 stars because it is a little cologne-like for me.</li>
            <li> Smells heavily perfume-like to me.  </li>
            <li> I had a few Indian friends over that explained to me that Chandan was Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Japanese KOH Sandalwood is truly peaceful...but VERY subtle.  </li>
            <li> Not enjoyable at all.</li>
            <li> Have purchased these in the past and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> There is also very THICK, black smoke upon lighting.</li>
            <li> price cheap with the amount of sticks.....gets rid of those nasty odor in the kitchen after cooking.also scent</li>
            <li> Not to bad, as others have said, very similar to Sandalwood with a few spices added.</li>
            <li> One stick fills my four room apartment four an hour at least.</li>
            <li> It burns slowly and you get a lot of sticks in the box.</li>
            <li> At less than $0.05 per stick, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too overpowering and doesn&#x27;t have that bad &amp;#34;smoky&amp;#34; after smell that some have.  </li>
            <li> And unlike alot of off the wall incense with names of emotions or weather conditions or geographical terrain (where you have NO clue what the base line should be)...</li>
            <li> Boy, this is really terrible smelling stuff - I burned one stick and gave the rest away.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the scent, but I gave it 4 stars because it is a little cologne-like for me.</li>
            <li> Smells quite nice, but not like chandana really.  In fact, I have &#x27;forest&#x27; and &#x27;patchouli&#x27; from HEM as well, and I can&#x27;t tell the difference in the three, they should be very different, seems to me.</li>
            <li> nice smell,got it way sooner then it said,very happy about that a good buy,the only thing i have too say there not that strong smelling,i like a strong smell for mediation.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Good sandalwood oil and incense. This company makes the best. I buy it all the time and tell my friends too. And these folks sell it at a rock bottom price. I love it.</li>
            <li> Even the unlit stick fills the house with it&#x27;s very characteristic aroma - of DEET mosquito repellant. Incense...? No...</li>
            <li> I love the HEM incense line. The incense burns well and scents my home so nicely. I discovered it when I walked into a beauty salon where it was burning. The proprietress showed me the Jasmine box.  OH, my!  Then I went to Amazon.com and found all different scents.  I decided to try several.  Chandan is a hit with me! I&#x27;m about to order some more.</li>
            <li> Really good scent, complements the patchulli well.</li>
            <li> Very delightful scent.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Easily one of the best incense sticks I&#x27;ve burned when it comes to sandalwood. The smell is bold, but not musky or overpowering. For those wondering, the sticks are not super thick, but not thin either. It&#x27;s rectangular and in between the thick based japanese sticks and the thinner red ones you see used in Chinese offerings. As for the burn times I&#x27;ve been getting an average of 45 minutes per stick which I think is pretty good, especially considering the affordability of the 120 stick box.</li>
            <li> I tried, really I did, but this is just some strong, overpowering incense.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> price cheap with the amount of sticks.....gets rid of those nasty odor in the kitchen after cooking.also scent very relaxing.fast delivery.considering ordering in the future.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable price, very nice scent!</li>
            <li> VERY strong feminine scent.  I mean nose-burning strong.  Smells heavily perfume-like to me.  Not unpleasant, but far too strong for me.  I enjoy scents that you can burn &amp;#60;20 feet away and not be sickened.  This you couldn&#x27;t do burn in any occupied rooms unless you have a very strong nose - like work in Yankee Candle strong...</li>
            <li> Very nice incense, not quite as strong as Nag Champa, nice to burn in a smaller area.</li>
            <li> It just smells like smoke to me. It may just be my particular senses but I got nothing out of it. Oh well not every scent is for everybody.</li>
            <li> Good shipping. The size of sticks is standard. There are 6 boxes packed in a large box. The smell is not that strong, Makes more smoke as compare to smell. One stick burns for around 30 Minutes</li>
            <li> I took a chance and bought this without ever having smelled it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> It is very good ,i love it ....!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, smells wonderful and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> A must have ! It has a good smell and house smells great! I love it!</li>
            <li> If you count all the blades of grass, you will realize it doesn&#x27;t matter man, it just grass.  Be kind and tell someone you care about them man..  its so simple man</li>
            <li> All the HEM fragrances I have ordered, at least five, smell like cheap soap and nothing like the name of each implies. Cheap soap smell. Not enjoyable at all.</li>
            <li> You get a ton for this price, it&#x27;s like the ride Indiana Jones at Disney land but better!</li>
            <li> This incense smells so good, yet subtle,  Doesn&#x27;t bother sensitive noses.  The price is GREAT.  My daughter introduced me to this great incense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not turned off by the heavy woodsy scent, but of the spicy scent of this particular one, but I would recommend it to anyone. I love incense that is woodsy and earthy.</li>
            <li> Great product great price ! Love it! Thanks! Recommended for sure !</li>
            <li> Boy, this is really terrible smelling stuff - I burned one stick and gave the rest away.  I like Nag Champa and many others, but this is bad stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent. It is by far my new favorite. I had a few Indian friends over that explained to me that Chandan was Sandalwood. No wonder I love it so much, I loved my previous sandalwood incense. Will definitely buy more when I run out, but the quantity for the cost is incredible and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I like this as I have incense going most all day here. a Nice change and priced really good.</li>
            <li> I got this brand because this is what I had back home, but the one I had was Lavender. I wanted to use something even more traditional and reminiscent of home, so I went for sandalwood. Did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Lovely smelling incense, always puts a good feeling in the air.  Similar to a &amp;#34;Nag Champa&amp;#34;, this incense has a little more sandlewood going on.  Will always have this one around.</li>
            <li> I just love HEM brand incense - they smell great and are long lasting.</li>
            <li> scent is nice, but my boxes were crammed in an envelope, inside was many smushed sticks..going to do my best, smells great, bit its a broken up mess, keeps dying out any heat ot flame</li>
            <li> Very evenly burning sticks. The scent is incredible and lasts quite awhile throughout the house. Relaxing. Have purchased these in the past and will continue to do so. Excellent deal!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite incense by far!! I have probably 20 different boxes of HEM incense, and I&#x27;ve only been disappointed with a couple; however, this is the best smelling, and most uplifting, opening scent I&#x27;ve found yet. Not sickeningly sweet and overpowering, just pleasant and thoughtful.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best smelling incense I have ever tried.  It isn&#x27;t too overpowering and doesn&#x27;t have that bad &amp;#34;smoky&amp;#34; after smell that some have.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because some of the sticks leave a burnt wood smell afterwards bc they keep burning after the incense is gone.  Otherwise it&#x27;s great.  When I have guests over, they always compliment the smell of my house.</li>
            <li> nothing in the world smells better. NOTHING. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll even try another incense again. I buy these in bulk and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> this was exactly what I was looking for. package nicely,package was not crushed it was perfect. and what a lovely smell the incense give out when they burn. thank you will do business again</li>
            <li> Item came on time, I just love this incent is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I like this product and will continue the buy it.  The fragrance is wonderful and to my liking.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> A great incense for the morning, a pure and uplifting aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality incense, I never heard of this company but they pleasantly surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the box are 6 smaller boxes with 20 sticks each.</li>
            <li> These incenses were a steal for the price. They do have a bit strong smell but the smell is nice. I would buy them again</li>
            <li> Yep, love this stuff!  Very calming, centering scent to meditate by..not sickening sweet, as some &amp;#34;flower&amp;#34; smelling sticks are.  Burn it up, baby..</li>
            <li> Amazing! Best smelling insence ever.</li>
            <li> Strong, but earthy fragrant. Keeps mosquitos away too.</li>
            <li> This stuff straight up smells like bug spray. I know everyone is different but I have no idea how anyone could say this type actually smells good. Sure it smells good.....if you really like the smell of bug spray. What&#x27;s next.....an incense that smells like gasoline? How about a land fill?</li>
            <li> Super value, great but, long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance! Best quality. Love the products from this brand.</li>
            <li> Love this incense although its kind of toxic. reminds me of india</li>
            <li> We are fan of this product and have bought many, many different times</li>
            <li> I bought this six pack without ever smelling this scent.  I have a bunch of others that I have picked up here and there and was hoping this would be my new favorite.  I have burnt it several times already, and neither hubby nor I are very fond of it.  It&#x27;s close, but the underlying burnt smell is strong and hubby thinks its too soapy smelling.  It kind of reminds me of incense I use to burn when I was a teenager....long ago, but it doesn&#x27;t quite make it.  It might be better to buy this in cones, as that&#x27;s what I used back then.  I will wait and burn it when it warms up and see if that changes things.</li>
            <li> what else to say? indians who use it know what it is and who doesn&#x27;t use it i will suggest them to use, you will love it</li>
            <li> smells devine. comfort and sweetness I am in love.</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of okay.</li>
            <li> In a market full of brands, this is the BEST sandalwood incense I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve ever tried!!!! If you like incense that is more traditional, try this!!!</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is my favorite.  This is in a similar vein in that it has its own smokey, earthy scent - hard to describe exactly how it smells other than to say that if you don&#x27;t need your incense to smell like strawberries or coconut, you&#x27;ll probably like it.  It burns slowly and you get a lot of sticks in the box.</li>
            <li> Excellent and promptly service!!!</li>
            <li> i love this smell! i was scared i wouldn&#x27;t like it because i had no idea what it was, i just wanted something cheap in bulk. i bought this in june i believe and it is now August and i still have the majority of it left and my room smells great (:</li>
            <li> my favorite now.  you will love them.  and the scent lasts a long time. . . . . . .</li>
            <li> good product and very nice packing</li>
            <li> I prefer the patchouli incense.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SMELL OF THESE. PRICE IS RIGHT!!</li>
            <li> awsome scent  took a chance not knowing what it smelled like  very happy with purchase and fast standard delivery</li>
            <li> High quality product. I am trying out several fragrances but this is not my favorite. Good for people who don&#x27;t like lingering scents. Easy to light! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> smells soooooooooo good!</li>
            <li> For some reason, this scent made me itch all over, but that&#x27;s just me...  I have 118 sticks left...pooh.  Smells good though.</li>
            <li> How can I describe the scent of chandan? I&#x27;ll give it a try. A pleasant musk that is an acquired taste. Like caviar some scents take a couple \\&quot;tastings\\&quot; to adapt to, this is one of them. at first I wanted to gag, and then i gave it a second chance and fell in love. It&#x27;s a heavy woody musk scent that&#x27;s certainly worth 5 stars. feelings that come to mind are uplifting, energetic yet calm, almost aphrodisiac. something i&#x27;m sure youll love.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this brand before but never online. I was not disappointed. This is a great value and a fantastic buy. Get it!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE AROMA AND IS A GREAT VALUE</li>
            <li> My favorite incense.  I burn it all year around.  The neighbors comment on the pleasant aroma all summer.  Quick shipper.</li>
            <li> I really like Precious Chandan&#x27;s smell!</li>
            <li> These incense are a great value, but BOY are they STRONG.  You can light one and your whole house/apartment will smell like it for a day or more.  Use sparingly.  Has a nice, musky scent with accents of pine and patchouli.  Very calming and elegant.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> LOVE this fragrance!! Like a temple fragrance, and great for inducing a calm environment. Every time I burn it, whoever is in my home wants to take some with them.</li>
            <li> my favorite scent is first rain, this scent is just not favorite worthy, i didnt like how obnoxious and in your face it is, its too strong and it has a reddish feeling to it, i know its a strange way of judging incense but it was just reddish</li>
            <li> THis incense as a new one for me.  I am now a total fan of it!  Have recommended it to friends who tell me they have purchased it and are now fans too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands an they are not as rich... Seems to have less of a burning scent more floral than other brands I&#x27;ve tried........ Smooth relaxing scent it is my favorite!!!!</li>
            <li> We love the smell of this.  Earthy, yet a slight sweet tint to it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for $5.95 with Prime shipping, to me this is an excellent deal considering the quality of this incense. At less than $0.05 per stick, you really can&#x27;t go wrong. Before I bough this, I had purchased some incense sticks from a local head shop that were of inferior quality and I paid $0.10 per stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of quality, these incense sticks are great. The smell is really great, kind of like nag champa or others but it has a richer quality. It&#x27;s like you can almost feel the oils in the stick vaporizing as it burns. The smell is kind of an &amp;#34;eastern&amp;#34; type smell, sandalwood with some other things involved. They look really oily, and like I said, the smoke is kind of rich and oily too. I really like that because other sticks that are kind of dry don&#x27;t allow the aroma to linger as long after it finished burning.</li>
            <li> Not to bad, as others have said, very similar to Sandalwood with a few spices added. Decent scent ok burn time. Not a favorite, but again not bad.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this incense I never heard of it.  And unlike alot of off the wall incense with names of emotions or weather conditions or geographical terrain (where you have NO clue what the base line should be)...this is a REAL smell.  It is a slightly more intense sandalwood aroma that has milky tones, but the intensity is cheerful rather than medatative like Hem Sandalwood.  I am comparing apples to apples here.  Japanese KOH Sandalwood is truly peaceful...but VERY subtle.  Indian HEM (in my experience is much bolder in all spectrums)...if that is all you burn Hem Sandalwood is peaceful.  So if you want a \\&quot;brighter\\&quot; Hem Sandalwood...this is your choice.  NOT stronger!  Just a bit \\&quot;brighter\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I call this &amp;#34;elegance in a scent&amp;#34;. All the HEM incense I use are quality scents that burn well, with consistent scent throughout the burn, and remains a good while afterwards. This scent is warm, aromatic, sensual, rich, a little woody, perfumy, dark. Perfect by the fire at night, any season. This is the scent I use daily. It just makes me calm.</li>
            <li> This incense is coated. It heavy with scent from the moment you open the box.  One stick fills my four room apartment four an hour at least.</li>
            <li> Love this and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Great scent, not flowery, not too heavy, just perfect. Its been my favorite for years which is why I bought so many!</li>
            <li> The best incense in the world!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I expected to be able to at least detect a scent that wouldn&#x27;t make me question the odor. To be fair it was burned on two different occasions just to make sure it was not my imagination (or mood) leaving such a foul impression. To this particular olfactory the &#x27;smell&#x27; was faint, but offensive. There is also very THICK, black smoke upon lighting. HEM makes good incense so this was an unexpected quality of funk. As with most things it depends on the individual to like or dislike anything.</li>
            <li> I love this incense, mmm smells delicious. Its scent is soft, relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amo este incienso, mmm huele riquísimo. Es suave su olor, relajante.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite incense. I light them in the morning and evening - prayer routine. Makes my home smell like an Indian temple.</li>
            <li> The best incense I have ever used. Not extremely smokey, has a wonderful smell. Came in a day, too. Thank you so much! I will repurchase this item again!</li>
            <li> 5 stars by far.I&#x27;ve been using incense for years and I can tell you that this one is a high quality.It burns slow,the smell is deep but won&#x27;t make you cough or sneeze like other incenses.A sweet,deep musky kind of perfume.</li>
            <li> love them came very quickly the perfume smell goes away when you burn them</li>
            <li> My favorite incense! Great fragrance.</li>
