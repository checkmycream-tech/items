            <li>Shipment was overnight and right to my door.</li>
            <li>but so far so good they last about 7 days</li>
            <li>Why are folks surprised that the batteries are close to their expiration date, considering the huge discount they are be sold at from in-store pricing?  </li>
            <li>Great battery last a long time in hearing aid,  One of the leaders in Hearing Aid Batteries.  </li>
            <li>Works great and last a long time.</li>

            <li>Have ordered these twice and will order continue to order in the future as the price is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Great price and last long.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know much about the batteries - first time purchasing.  </li>
            <li>and I love the long tabs.  </li>
            <li>The first one I used made the hearing aid so much louder than those I had gotten &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; when I bought the aid.</li>
            <li>These are long lasting easy to use top quality batteries.</li>
            <li>Packaged by 4&#x27;s, and each container is very sturdy &amp; easy to open and close.</li>
            <li>The large tabs make it much easier and quicker to just get them in without a lot of drama or drawing attention to yourself.</li>
            <li>This arrived very quickly,BUT...</li>
            <li>It is so much easier for her to change batteries</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the prompt refund but still would not purchase from them again unless they could provide an expiration date on the front end.</li>
            <li>The tab makes it much easier to pull off the sticker.</li>
            <li>They give me one more day than any other battery I have tried</li>
            <li>I am surprised that this has happened, however, because ALL of my many previous purchase experiences with Amazon have been very positive.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>Otherwise would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Duracell makes high quality batteries.  </li>
            <li>I normally wear my hearing aids 17-18 hours a day.</li>
            <li>I normally get 5-7 days from my batteries.  </li>
            <li>and I have no complaint.</li>
            <li>They were priced lower than the Walmart price for 16, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if they were genuine Duracell at first, especially since the color guide for the battery was not exactly the same tone of brown as all the ones I had purchased from local Walmart stores.  </li>
            <li>I normally use rechargeable batteries, and had just put a new set of rechargeables in the charger.  </li>
            <li>I buy new packs in the store with 2017 expiration..</li>
            <li>They sent me a coupon for a new pack.  </li>
            <li>Received them (64 each) and found that the expiration date was March 2013 and that most of them would be past their expiration date at time of use.</li>
            <li>The little recyclable case is easy to manage and I can keep a supply in my desk, handbag and medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>The Duracell batteries fit in my hearing aide&#x27;s much better then other brands which seem to be a little smaller and fall out easier.</li>
            <li>the longer tab is easier to use than the regular one, particularly for older people with dexterity problems</li>
            <li>The battery&#x27;s expiration date is March 2013, which should to be clearly showed in the product description.  </li>
            <li>It can be a pain growing old.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how soon the product would meet</li>
            <li>These batteries may have been old.....</li>
            <li>Must be old stock they are trying to get rid of.  </li>
            <li>The Duracell will last a full week with regular changes on the same day each week.</li>
            <li>So, if you are out for dinner, in a meeting, or watching a movie, it is a royal pain to put batteries in the small battery holder when using the cheapo brands which are fine if you are home.</li>
            <li>They work, but don&#x27;t seem to last as long in use as truly fresh batteries.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Easy Tab&amp;#34; refers to a long tab on the sticker covering the battery until it&#x27;s ready for use.</li>
            <li>I started to open the package to use a pair of my brand new batteries.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and they last longer than the previous type of battery I was using.</li>
            <li>When you order a large quantity of batteries like this you expect the \\&quot;freshness\\&quot; date to be in the distant future.</li>
            <li>These batteries only last 3 days, normal Duracell batteries last a week.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t figure the small amount I was was worth the hassle of requesting a refund.  </li>
            <li>Fresh hearing aid batteries usually have an expiration date several years out.  </li>
            <li>Other batteries normally get expiration date somewhere in 2015-2016.</li>

            <li> These are decent batteries and last just as long as other hearing aid batteries on upper end of the scale.  </li>
            <li> Duracell Zinc Air batteries last 6-8 days for me as long as I completely open the battery door/compartment every night when I take my hearing aids</li>
            <li> Almost every pack half or more dead!!!</li>
            <li> You still received the correct number of batteries but for me I like to keep a pack in my purse and the 4 pack doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> also buy Ray-O-Vac zinc air batteries which last just as long &amp; sometimes longer than the Duracell batteries.</li>
            <li> Duracell is a long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> These batteries last as long as any I have used.</li>
            <li> However, the batteries were near expiration when I received them and the longest any of them lasted was a couple of days, some were less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the expiration date of the batteries I received was March 2013, which I think is somewhat older stock.  </li>
            <li> The Duracell provide important power for hearing aids under difficult conditions and prove their value and service to a friend with hearing issues.</li>
            <li> Hearing aids always quit at the most inconvenient of times.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of the company and found a lot of other people upset with the company the same as I was.</li>
            <li> batteries in a dry place when in storage.</li>
            <li> It was not stated in the product description that these units were near or past expiration.</li>
            <li> I have a pack in my briefcase and literally carry them with loose change in my pocket.</li>
            <li> Finally found some batteries - and had nearly the same number of bad batteries, and the same short lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked as well as any other batteries that I have used.</li>
            <li> Most worthless batteries I ever bought</li>
            <li> 3 out of the 16 were dead from the beginning (the little tab seal was in tact), and all of the other batteries lasted an average of 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ones I received had an expiration date of less than 1 year.</li>
            <li> She gets less interference with thes compared with her originals.</li>
            <li> It helps to have a little help.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain as I expected old stock to be picked up by some salvage operation and liquidated at seemly crazy pricing.</li>
            <li> I have over the ear hearing aids &amp; have used Duracell Zinc Air Batteries, size 312, in the past.</li>
            <li> I notice that this is a not uncommon experience for other reviewers of this product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these batteries in late January, 2013.  </li>
            <li> I will have to do without today, at least until by rechargeables finish charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I posted a negative review and was contacted by the seller who refunded my purchase price plus $10.  </li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> The mean time to failure was from 1 hour (17 batteries) to 4-5 days (the remainder).  </li>
            <li> Bought some with the hearing aid place and they were no good.</li>
            <li> I am unable to determine whether the poor performance was a function of the manufacture or the expired status of the product.  </li>
            <li> Seller should have disclosed the expiration date, but then if they did so, no one would order the nearly stale product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I almost didn&#x27;t find a retailer that would accept the coupon (they all sold packs with differing numbers of batteries that didn&#x27;t match the coupon/certificate).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I purchased these batteries in late January, 2013.  Received them (64 each) and found that the expiration date was March 2013 and that most of them would be past their expiration date at time of use. The mean time to failure was from 1 hour (17 batteries) to 4-5 days (the remainder).  From the aspect of the product performance, this was an unsatisfactory purchase.  I am unable to determine whether the poor performance was a function of the manufacture or the expired status of the product.  It was not stated in the product description that these units were near or past expiration.</li>
            <li> These are decent batteries and last just as long as other hearing aid batteries on upper end of the scale.  I wear Bernafon hearing aids about twelve hours a day and these generally last 5-6 days.  The only drawback to them is that they don&#x27;t come in a smaller locking dispenser that I can carry in my shirt pocket (like the [[ASIN:B0026905AI Rayovac Proline Size 312 Hearing Aid Batteries]]) so I can&#x27;t conveniently keep a pack handy. Other than that, they are good batteries and the tabs make it easy to install in the hearing aid.</li>
            <li> Great battery last a long time in hearing aid,  One of the leaders in Hearing Aid Batteries.  Fast shipper at a good price.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly,BUT...It is NOT as advertised.  It led you to beleive that&lt;br /&gt;you were purchasing 4 16 count packages of batteries but what was received was&lt;br /&gt;16(!) 4 count packages. You still received the correct number of batteries but for me I like to keep a pack in my purse and the 4 pack doesn&#x27;t last too long. It was a good price, but I will not order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Seller should have disclosed the expiration date, but then if they did so, no one would order the nearly stale product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batteries came with a 2013 expiration date.  Bought the same thing in the CVS yesterday with 2016 expiration.  Batteries don&#x27;t keep a charge in a package when they get close to expiration.</li>
            <li> Works great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product which was sold by Brooklyn Battery but fulfilled by Amazon at the end of July 2013.  I received the product promptly.  Today .. Aug 3,13 ... I started to open the package to use a pair of my brand new batteries.  But, before I opened the pkg, I noticed that the Expiration Date was March 2013.  I normally use rechargeable batteries, and had just put a new set of rechargeables in the charger.  So, I did need batteries.  I will have to do without today, at least until by rechargeables finish charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not open the out of date product package, but returned them to Amazon.  I notice that this is a not uncommon experience for other reviewers of this product.  Suffice to say, I will buy batteries from a more reliable source in the future.  I am surprised that this has happened, however, because ALL of my many previous purchase experiences with Amazon have been very positive.</li>
            <li> I have over the ear hearing aids &amp; have used Duracell Zinc Air Batteries, size 312, in the past. I normally wear my hearing aids 17-18 hours a day. Duracell Zinc Air batteries last 6-8 days for me as long as I completely open the battery door/compartment every night when I take my hearing aids off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also buy Ray-O-Vac zinc air batteries which last just as long &amp; sometimes longer than the Duracell batteries. I purchase either brand according to which price is best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CVS zinc air hearing aid batteries also last 6-8 days for me.</li>
            <li> Work great and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> These batteries are great and easy to use.  Have ordered these twice and will order continue to order in the future as the price is outstanding.  Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much about the batteries - first time purchasing.  But the packaging is great. Packaged by 4&#x27;s, and each container is very sturdy &amp; easy to open and close.</li>
            <li> These are back up batteries for the Ultra Ear ITC that I purchased. Giving the benefit of the doubt, I&#x27;m sure they work fine. Haven&#x27;t used them yet. Thank you.</li>
            <li> These batteries only last 3 days, normal Duracell batteries last a week.  These batteries will expire within the year, batteries you buy in the store have expiration dates 3-4 years from now.  This place makes their money through shipping costs, which don&#x27;t get refunded when you realize what you bought.  Do your homework and buy somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Worked as well as any other batteries that I have used.</li>
            <li> The package is the right size to fit in my hearing aid case so I always have spare batteries with me.  Duracell is a long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> These batteries last as long as any I have used. The little recyclable case is easy to manage and I can keep a supply in my desk, handbag and medicine cabinet. I recommend them without doubt or question.</li>
            <li> The battery&#x27;s expiration date is March 2013, which should to be clearly showed in the product description.  Other batteries normally get expiration date somewhere in 2015-2016.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my mother in law and I love the long tabs.  It is so much easier for her to change batteries</li>
            <li> Fresh batteries at a great price! Bought some with the hearing aid place and they were no good. No more!</li>
            <li> I buy new packs in the store with 2017 expiration..Almost every pack half or more dead!!! Most worthless batteries I ever bought</li>
            <li> These batteries are great and fresh.  I will order these again and again.</li>
            <li> It can be a pain growing old.  It helps to have a little help.  These batteries arrived ahead of schedule and worked as advertised.  It&#x27;s a pleasure doing business via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Only good for 12 days.</li>
            <li> Excellent long life batteries, delivered on time and very easy to order as promised.  I would recommend these to anyone that needs batteries so easy to use with the easy tab.</li>
            <li> They are working great.  The first one I used made the hearing aid so much louder than those I had gotten &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; when I bought the aid.</li>
            <li> Duracell Easy Tab Hearing Aid Batteries Size 312&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great for my hearing aids.  Each lasts about 5 days of use... I only use my hearing aids about 8 hours per day.... so I guess it can run about 40 hours....</li>
            <li> My hearing aid provider recommends Rayovac, but an attempt at convenience, I purchased a pack of these batteries.  3 out of the 16 were dead from the beginning (the little tab seal was in tact), and all of the other batteries lasted an average of 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hearing aids (Phonak Audeo) usually last 6-7 days on Rayovac or Kroger brand batteries (not sure who makes them, but they are just as consistent as Rayovac).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Duracell customer service.  They sent me a coupon for a new pack.  Unfortunately, I almost didn&#x27;t find a retailer that would accept the coupon (they all sold packs with differing numbers of batteries that didn&#x27;t match the coupon/certificate).  Finally found some batteries - and had nearly the same number of bad batteries, and the same short lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way I would purchase Duracells for my hearing aids is if it was the only option and I had an immediate need.  Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> The batteries worked great!!!!  They were priced lower than the Walmart price for 16, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if they were genuine Duracell at first, especially since the color guide for the battery was not exactly the same tone of brown as all the ones I had purchased from local Walmart stores.  But, I had no problem at all.  I will order again.  Since shipping was free, I actually saved even more buying this way.</li>
            <li> I am getting excellent results with these batteries.  I will soon be purchasing more.  The price was right and they last longer than the previous type of battery I was using.</li>
            <li> Good product. Watch the expiration date. I was surprised how soon the product would meet it&#x27;s expiration date. Don&#x27;t order too many packs at one time.</li>
            <li> These batteries may have been old.....These batteries did not perform as tey should even though the date said they were still good something was wrong.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy batteries on line again.</li>
            <li> Very convenient. Handy packaging and retrieval of batteries. The batteries seem to last longer also. Shipment was overnight and right to my door.</li>
            <li> When you order a large quantity of batteries like this you expect the \\&quot;freshness\\&quot; date to be in the distant future. The ones I received had an expiration date of less than 1 year. The company I got them from, Audiometrix, did not respond when I contacted them about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> Why are folks surprised that the batteries are close to their expiration date, considering the huge discount they are be sold at from in-store pricing?  I can&#x27;t complain as I expected old stock to be picked up by some salvage operation and liquidated at seemly crazy pricing.</li>
            <li> Duracell is as everyone knows a good brand the providing company sent near expiring battery&#x27;s with no explanation. I read reviews of the company and found a lot of other people upset with the company the same as I was.</li>
            <li> The Duracell batteries fit in my hearing aide&#x27;s much better then other brands which seem to be a little smaller and fall out easier.</li>
            <li> I normally get 5-7 days from my batteries.  The Duracell will last a full week with regular changes on the same day each week.</li>
            <li> the longer tab is easier to use than the regular one, particularly for older people with dexterity problems x x</li>
            <li> They are the best brand I have tried so far. They give me one more day than any other battery I have tried</li>
            <li> These are long lasting easy to use top quality batteries. They come nice looking package with easy loading tabs. The price was unbeatable.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped promptly....well packaged. This was for batteries for my hearing aids....both mine and wife&#x27;s. They were fresh and good. I&#x27;ll buy there again.</li>
            <li> They are batteries...</li>
            <li> A good battery at a very good price. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Duracell.  Shipped quickly with no freight charge.</li>
            <li> I received my batteries promptly and have no issues with their service.  However, the batteries were near expiration when I received them and the longest any of them lasted was a couple of days, some were less than 10 minutes.  I didn&#x27;t figure the small amount I was was worth the hassle of requesting a refund.  I posted a negative review and was contacted by the seller who refunded my purchase price plus $10.  I appreciated the prompt refund but still would not purchase from them again unless they could provide an expiration date on the front end.</li>
            <li> date too short for the quantity ordered.  there should have been a warning of short dating. i do not intend to order again.</li>
            <li> Good product and good service. My only complaint was that the expiration date of the batteries I received was March 2013, which I think is somewhat older stock.  Otherwise would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The Duracell provide important power for hearing aids under difficult conditions and prove their value and service to a friend with hearing issues.</li>
            <li> Duracell makes high quality batteries.  And these amplifier/ hearing aid batteries are recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Keep batteries in a dry place when in storage.</li>
            <li> My dad loves these batteries!</li>
            <li> Batteries are batteries!</li>
            <li> Great product and price.</li>
            <li> Hearing aids always quit at the most inconvenient of times. So, if you are out for dinner, in a meeting, or watching a movie, it is a royal pain to put batteries in the small battery holder when using the cheapo brands which are fine if you are home. The large tabs make it much easier and quicker to just get them in without a lot of drama or drawing attention to yourself. I have a pack in my briefcase and literally carry them with loose change in my pocket.</li>
            <li> Bought the batteries and had them sent to a different address.  Arrived the day it was promised.  I will reorder wend needed.</li>
            <li> Fresh hearing aid batteries usually have an expiration date several years out.  The ones I received had a &#x27;use by&#x27; date of 2013.  They work, but don&#x27;t seem to last as long in use as truly fresh batteries.</li>
            <li> This buy was great and what a huge saving from buying them elsewhere. . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Great price and last long.  I purchased these for my wife&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;hearing aide. Small and compact and fits perfect. Shipped&lt;br /&gt;on time.</li>
            <li> These are great i have had them in my hearing aid now for 5 days and they are still going strong</li>
            <li> I purchased 16 batteries (2 packs) and received them on 1/26/13 and they had an expiration date of March 2013. Must be old stock they are trying to get rid of.  It will be difficult to use them all before the expiration date.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I am using them now and can not give an honest opinion as of yet but so far so good they last about 7 days</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife. She is very happy with these batteries.She gets less interference with thes compared with her originals. She also gets 8-9 days usage out of them. Great product. Duracell 312!!!</li>
            <li> Duracell Easy Tab Hearing Aid Batteries Size 312 (16 batteries)&lt;br /&gt;Ordered these for Grandma. She loves them. Thank you! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Use these batteries as a backup when I run out of the Siemens batterys.They seem to have the same life as the Siemens brand provided by my hearing aid supplier.The container they have is convient too.Easy to carry with you.</li>
            <li> I guess the batteries are good. I have not used any, because I can&#x27;t use the pair of ear pieces.</li>
            <li> Duracell....... What can I say ? The best or nothing</li>
            <li> These batteries are excellent, long lasting. I would buy them again. However, I would prefer a cardboard holder rather than plastic for \\&quot;green\\&quot; reasons. Sharon St. John</li>
            <li> I like the way these batteries are packaged and would buy the product again.  The are very easy to get out of the packaging</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Easy Tab&amp;#34; refers to a long tab on the sticker covering the battery until it&#x27;s ready for use. The tab makes it much easier to pull off the sticker. Otherwise, these are the same batteries. They seem to last about a week in the hearing aid.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item in Sept. 2013 package &amp;#34;best buy&amp;#34; date is 06-2017. Batteries worthless by June 2014</li>
            <li> They work! There&#x27;s not a lot you can say about batteries but they do the job and I have no complaint.</li>
