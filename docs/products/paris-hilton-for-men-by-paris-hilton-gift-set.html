On the positive side, the gift set is much larger than I expected it to be compared to the picture. The fragrance is nice but nothing special; smells like a ripoff of another fragrance. The deodorant stick smells kinda weird to me, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. But overall for the price it&#x27;s excellent! Thumbs up.</li>
