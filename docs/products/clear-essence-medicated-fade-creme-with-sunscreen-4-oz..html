    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>very excellent product!!</li>
            <li>That said, it should still have worked on evening out my skin tones, as I am very fair, and it did nothing.</li>
            <li>If you have that, that would be great.</li>
            <li>I wish they would make this without that ingredient in it because it truly is a remarkable fade cream.</li>
            <li>This would be the best fade cream if they would have not added the ingredient petrolatum in it which is like putting pure vaseline on a acne prone</li>
            <li>Interesting to note that on the jar, it says it is for ethnic skin.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion the cream version is more noticeable on my face as opposed to the gel version.</li>
            <li>I have used this item for 2 weeks or more but has not seen any changes.</li>
            <li>I got some free minis of this product from my beauty supply store so at first I was like more junk.</li>
            <li>Secondly the product is performing according to expectation as the whole experience is great.    </li>
            <li>I now am able to go natural and appreciate my skin.</li>
            <li>I definitely like the gel version of this better.</li>
            <li>it really works.</li>
            <li>It has really made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I anm still trying to get someone to be responsible for my five bars of soap that I paid $52.00 for.</li>
            <li>I thought it was just my skin, but this cream really does cause breakouts that look like a rash.</li>
            <li>I will shop in the market again for something to work much faster.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Works very well for me</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to know that before I wasted my money on it, since I am Caucasian.  </li>
            <li>I have used this in the past with okay results.</li>
            <li>No complaints from me so far!</li>

            <li>But it does lighten the clear part of your face but darkens the marks that are already there.</li>
            <li>So far I have no issues with the product</li>
            <li>This product significantly lighten my complexion and no longer did I need to cover my face with makeup everyday!</li>
            <li>This does NOTHING to fade sun spots, and mine are not very dark at all.  </li>
            <li>First and foremost, was the delivery period, this product was delivered earlier than expected, as i was expecting it to take longer than it did</li>

            <li> I got some free minis of this product from my beauty supply store so at first I was like more junk. but I started using it and suprising to me it really works. It has really made a difference in my skin. for me it does work for evening out the skin tone which is my biggest problem. I have not had any breakouts.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, was the delivery period, this product was delivered earlier than expected, as i was expecting it to take longer than it did but it only took few days. Secondly the product is performing according to expectation as the whole experience is great.    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V2UK9S/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
            <li> This product was gonna expire 3 months before I got it, Amazon told me to contact the seller who was rude and only got back to me after3 weeks and didnt even refund me and I didnt even use the product and all I wanted was just to be send another product that will not epire soon.</li>
            <li> This would be the best fade cream if they would have not added the ingredient petrolatum in it which is like putting pure vaseline on a acne prone face not good. I wish they would make this without that ingredient in it because it truly is a remarkable fade cream. I would like to say to people who do not breakout but have dark discoloration on the face to use this because it does work as a fade cream just not for those who break-out.[[ASIN:B000V2UK9S Clear Essence Medicated Fade Creme W/Sunscreen 4Oz]]</li>
            <li> I suffered from multiple dark spots and discolorations after several battles with acne. This product significantly lighten my complexion and no longer did I need to cover my face with makeup everyday! I now am able to go natural and appreciate my skin. In conjunction with the Skin Beautifying Milk, I saw results in less than 4 weeks! Definitely give this product a try!</li>
            <li> This does NOTHING to fade sun spots, and mine are not very dark at all.  Interesting to note that on the jar, it says it is for ethnic skin.  It would have been nice to know that before I wasted my money on it, since I am Caucasian.

            <li> I anm still trying to get someone to be responsible for my five bars of soap that I paid $52.00 for.</li>
            <li> This product worked for a few weeks, and then it started by getting dry and then causing acne in the chin area and cheek area. It actually made my skin worse and I have no idea what I am going to do before my trip. So pay attention to the reviews because I didn&#x27;t and now look, if you are having problems go to a dermatologist and never buy these products. But it does lighten the clear part of your face but darkens the marks that are already there.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past with okay results. I definitely like the gel version of this better. In my opinion the cream version is more noticeable on my face as opposed to the gel version.</li>
            <li> I completely agree with the other poster. I thought it was just my skin, but this cream really does cause breakouts that look like a rash. Not reccommended in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The package arrived within two days of order. I have been using product for about three months.  Purpose of use is  to lighten my dark ankles.  The product works very slow however it appear to fade the dark skin instead of bleaching. I will continue to use the product until it is finish and if there is no change. I will shop in the market again for something to work much faster.</li>
            <li> I have used this item for 2 weeks or more but has not seen any changes. The shipping was on time but the creme does not work.</li>
            <li> very excellent product!! highly recommend!</li>
            <li> No complaints from me so far! It&#x27;s been four days and I can already feel the changes happening on my face from this product .</li>
            <li> When I receive it on 22 May, It show expire on 9/14, how can i use it????</li>
            <li> As Described. Thank you.</li>
            <li> So far I have no issues with the product but it does leave a greasy feel on the skin a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Works very well for me</li>
            <li> Not what i was expecting...i wanted the lotion version and not the creme version. If you have that, that would be great.</li>
