            <li>Best thing since peanut butter!</li>
            <li>Since the Crystal file didn&#x27;t wear out and the tube is still serviceable, the best course was to buy those items that needed replacing, the buffing files and the cuticle oil pen.</li>

            <li>Years ago, I used and loved Zeva, so I searched for it online and was thrilled when I saw Amazon had it in stock.  </li>
            <li>A friend introduced it to me while on Safari in Botswana and when I returned home I immediatly went to the computer and ordered more for myself and daughters!</li>

            <li>Great for a quick moisture break for your cuticles on both your hands and feet.</li>
            <li>I love the way it keeps my nails looking healthy!</li>
            <li>So I love doing my own nails-</li>
            <li>It smells great and is worth the price.</li>
            <li>So easy!</li>

            <li>The pen itself is a great idea and has a smart design.</li>
            <li>its like magic.  </li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Zeva&#x27;s cuticle oil pen for many years.</li>
            <li>I have been using Zeva Pens for more than 5 years and LOVE</li>
            <li>I love the application of the felt tip marker.</li>
            <li>LOVE this pen.  </li>
            <li>My favorite tool for moisturizing my cuticles.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; carried here in town any longer, so the best course was to buy individual replacement items.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for more than 12 years.</li>
            <li>The challenge with cuticle oils is that most brush on</li>
            <li>My hands have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I love this pen.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to find their products again online.  </li>
            <li>I was gifted this oil pen YEARS ago from a friend while I lived in Minneapolis.</li>
            <li>So, really it&#x27;s just a very handy skin moisturizer that you can stash in your purse or keep with your pens on your desk.</li>
            <li>This one is as easy as a magic marker.</li>
            <li>the best for dry cuticles.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to see the photos of this pen because it looked exactly like the one I loved from California</li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>Worked okay but nothing special.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, penetrates quickly and does not leave your fingers oily!</li>
            <li>Easy as 1,2,3 ZEVA gives them that fabulous manicured look.</li>
            <li>Love all of the oils in it(smells great) and it lasts a long time (fullest oil pen I&#x27;ve encountered).</li>
            <li>Another bonus is the pen itself, it&#x27;s such a great and portable design that you can leave it in your purse and not worry about it</li>
            <li>I wish the cap would fit on the end of the pen when you are using it.  </li>
            <li>(felt tip, filled with oil).  </li>
            <li>This is the first treatment that has kept my nails healthy looking, shiny, and strong.</li>
            <li>This product is easy &amp; convenient and does a great job of keeping your cuticles from getting too dry.  </li>
            <li>So, I am really excited to see that I can now buy it on Amazon:</li>
            <li>These are worth the price!</li>
            <li>The original kit included:</li>
            <li>The blend of oils is nice and it smells good, too, a little like almond oil.</li>
            <li>Especially good if you live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>Easy easy easy to apply ~ NO MESS!  </li>
            <li>And, most importantly, it really works.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a good cuticle pen since the one I had purchased from a nail boutique in California had run dry.  </li>
            <li>always look freshly manicured.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is also a more natural product than the Essie.</li>
            <li>This pen puts just the right amount of oil on my cuticles so my hands don&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>nice idea to have oil pen in my pocket, and the quality is fine, but hope to have it for less price</li>
            <li>Received the order quickly, which I really appreciated.</li>
            <li>While you may feel the oil seems a bit much when first applies, I rest assure you, the oil is gently absorbed into the bed of the nails and surrounding skin very quickly, and if you&#x27;re busy like I am, doesn&#x27;t have time to get anywhere else</li>
            <li>Okay, so I did a lot of cuticle oil pen researching because mine are super dry, and I&#x27;ve used burts bees cuticle oil, that helped, but</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, it works instantly!</li>
            <li>I like Sally Hansen, Bliss Kiss, and most especially the Body Shop almond oil pen.</li>
            <li>A screw top plastic tube to carry all of the above.</li>
            <li>I already see results that my super dry cuticles are gone.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks! :)</li>
            <li>First one is</li>
            <li>Really helps nurses&#x27; over-washed &amp; over-helled hands!</li>
            <li>I can actually get a manicure now:)</li>
            <li>nails\\&quot; after many years and am going back to my natural nails and the Zeva products are making the transition to my real nails easy.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend - well worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Helps dry cuticles to look better.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy and mess free and highly portable.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Zeva cuticle pen for years and it really keeps my cuticles moisturized and looking neat.  </li>
            <li>I use the pen daily and often to keep my cuticles moisturized and free of hang nails.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use since it provides just the right amount of oil, not causing a mess like other oils.     </li>
            <li>The Essie has a soft brush tip I like very much too.</li>
            <li>The new wrinkle is that they are now on Amazon -- a real plus.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>really keeps my cuticles soft...</li>
            <li>I rarely offer my review of products but can&#x27;t keep quiet with this one.</li>
            <li>I also have to wash my hands very frequently which adds to the breaking and peeling and dryness.</li>
            <li>This little pen puts just the right amount right where you need it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many Cuticle Oil Pens but no more.  </li>
            <li>You cuticles absorb the cream and there is no weird residue left over.</li>
            <li>although do be careful of that if you&#x27;re doing a quick moiture break during working hours.</li>
            <li>I am positive that I will purchase the pen in the future.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s nice about this is the tip is very firm and while applying the oil I found I could use it to push back my cuticles as well.</li>
            <li>It also helps with the dry skin and cracking I use to get right around my nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ultra convenient and even helps dissolve the old cuticle skin.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve never gone to a professional salon to have them done.</li>
            <li>No Mess, Oder, and so Convenient to use home, work, or while I travel, and made in USA.</li>
            <li>When I use this you can tell it starts to instantly moisturize and the next day it seems like the old cuticle is ready to fall off.  </li>
            <li>It has more moisturizing oil per volume than other pens - so, it costs less when you take that into consideration.</li>
            <li>it gives intense conditioning and is long lasting.  </li>
            <li>My job requires that I have short, natural nails.</li>
            <li>I had it for a LONG time and used VERY frequently as I am a stylist in a very busy salon and my hands are ON FIRE during these LONG winter months, in &amp; out of water, chemicals and all that jazz TO THE RESCUE .....</li>
            <li>and I live in dry climate</li>
            <li>The applicator tip is hard and slightly abrasive, like very fine sandpaper.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to judge how long it will last, but so far I think it will last long enough to be worth the money.</li>

            <li> The applicator tip is hard and slightly abrasive, like very fine sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to judge how long it will last, but so far I think it will last long enough to be worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had my Zeva cuticle pen quickly, and I have it in my pencil holder at work (ladies and gents, you KNOW how hard office work and the dry air in the office take a toll on your cuticles)</li>
            <li> the oil makes all that white dry skin instantly dissapear.  </li>
            <li> these pens last a very long time.  </li>

            <li> I will keep you updated and let you know how long the pen lasts.</li>
            <li> I use it all year long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other cuticle oil pens on the market, but I keep on coming back to Zeva&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Other cuticle pens I bought simply had Vaseline-like lotion in them (doesn&#x27;t work as well as oil!)  </li>
            <li> And it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> One thing is that I also use it on dry patches on my toes and elbows, too.</li>
            <li> I carry it in my purse for touch-ups on dry cuticles anywhere, from my car to London to after a bath to Hamburg to.....</li>
            <li> i use it every single day  </li>
            <li> I work at 35,000 feet in a very dry environment.  </li>
            <li> how well they work on my always too dry cuticles!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other types of pens and oils, but this product has it all.</li>
            <li> Other cuticle pens have a brush tip.  </li>
            <li> All other pens I&#x27;ve found are brushes, and you have to twist the bottom to get the oil to come out.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to have some normal health back.</li>
            <li> It is a game changer for anyone with soft, brittle nails.</li>
            <li> and you have to push down long and hard for the oil to saturate the tip before using.</li>
            <li> The recipe for the pen has changed (with a little Tea Tree oil) but still so nourishing to the cuticles.  </li>
            <li> Will never be without this little gem.</li>
            <li> Bath and body was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to the tip to press on your nail/cuticle to dispense the oil.  </li>
            <li> It does absorb quickly, so no significant oily residue.</li>
            <li> Stumbled upon this little beauty in the keys.</li>
            <li> i keep it in my bag and use it everyday.  </li>

            <li> Alas, it&#x27;s quite expensive.</li>

            <li> This product is a must.  i keep it in my bag and use it everyday.  just outline your cuticle with the felt tip and your fingers  always look freshly manicured.  the oil makes all that white dry skin instantly dissapear.  its like magic.  these pens last a very long time.  i use it every single day  and  replaced after almost 2yrs of use.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Zeva Cuticle Oil pen about a month ago, and have been using it daily ever since. It&#x27;s great to use since it provides just the right amount of oil, not causing a mess like other oils.     I recently removed my \\&quot;fake nails\\&quot; after many years and am going back to my natural nails and the Zeva products are making the transition to my real nails easy.    I love Zeva!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it works instantly!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Zeva cuticle pen from Amazon.  Years ago, I used and loved Zeva, so I searched for it online and was thrilled when I saw Amazon had it in stock.  I never have a problem with ANYTHING I order from Amazon, so it was a no-brainer that I would place the order.  I had my Zeva cuticle pen quickly, and I have it in my pencil holder at work (ladies and gents, you KNOW how hard office work and the dry air in the office take a toll on your cuticles) and I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I have tried many Cuticle Oil Pens but no more.  I will stick with the Zeva cuticle oil pen as the mixture of oils is just what my nails need...it gives intense conditioning and is long lasting.  A great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Zeva Cuticle Oil Pens for years and years. I&#x27;ve tried other types of pens and oils, but this product has it all. It&#x27;s ultra convenient and even helps dissolve the old cuticle skin. I use it all year long!</li>
            <li> Best cuticle oil I have found, and I have tried many. This really works. Alas, it&#x27;s quite expensive. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to judge how long it will last, but so far I think it will last long enough to be worth the money.</li>
            <li> The applicator tip is hard and slightly abrasive, like very fine sandpaper.  Other cuticle pens have a brush tip.  Zeva Cuticle Oil Pen polishes and smoothes my cuticles.  Just what I was looking for.  Thank You![[ASIN:B001ELU2UW Zeva Cuticle Oil Pen - .375 Fl Oz / 11 Ml]]</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Zeva&#x27;s cuticle oil pen for many years. So, I am really excited to see that I can now buy it on Amazon: [[ASIN:B001ELU2UW Zeva Cuticle Oil Pen - .375 Fl Oz / 11 Ml]]. I had crappy cuticles because they were always drying out with our harsh winters in Minnesota. I&#x27;ve tried other cuticle oil pens on the market, but I keep on coming back to Zeva&#x27;s. It has more moisturizing oil per volume than other pens - so, it costs less when you take that into consideration. It also smells great. And, most importantly, it really works. One thing is that I also use it on dry patches on my toes and elbows, too. So, really it&#x27;s just a very handy skin moisturizer that you can stash in your purse or keep with your pens on your desk.</li>
            <li> Ouch!  Maybe I&#x27;m using this wrong, but you seem to have to press the tip down to saturate it with oil.  VERY uncomfortable, even if I do it on my arm or elsewhere to initiate it.  Will not buy again.  I like Sally Hansen, Bliss Kiss, and most especially the Body Shop almond oil pen.</li>
            <li> I have been using Zeva Pens for more than 5 years and LOVE how well they work on my always too dry cuticles!! I am always getting questioned by people who see me using them-- and I always let them know that they can purchase them on- line. The new wrinkle is that they are now on Amazon -- a real plus.</li>
            <li> This Zeva cuticle pen is the best cuticle oil pen I have ever found and used! A friend introduced it to me while on Safari in Botswana and when I returned home I immediatly went to the computer and ordered more for myself and daughters! It is easy to use, penetrates quickly and does not leave your fingers oily! Best thing since peanut butter!</li>
            <li> I have been a life long cuticle picker and hangnail biter. I ordered this cuticle oil pen along with the Zeva bright polish and nail bubbles. I love the application of the felt tip marker. It makes it easy and mess free and highly portable. My cuticles look like they have always been baby smooth and lovely! It&#x27;s dramatically reduced hang nail formation for me. My only regret is that gave my second cuticle oil pen from my order away and didn&#x27;t keep it for myself! These are worth the price!</li>
            <li> LOVE this pen.  My favorite tool for moisturizing my cuticles.  Use it every morning and evening as well as carrying one in my bag.  So easy!</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to this nail product line, or takes care of your nails like ZEVA. I highly recommend - well worth every penny.  My nails are stronger, longer, and people are always asking me if I got my nails done &amp; what beautiful nails... Mine take a beating at work daily so I&#x27;ve never gone to a professional salon to have them done. Easy as 1,2,3 ZEVA gives them that fabulous manicured look. And the cuticle pen - love it too!  I used to have so many hangnails from work, &amp; this ZEVA cuticle pen does a great job at diminishing those as well as keeping your cuticles looking great.</li>
            <li> This is my fave cuticle oil pen ever. I carry it in my purse for touch-ups on dry cuticles anywhere, from my car to London to after a bath to Hamburg to.....</li>
            <li> I have been using the Zeva cuticle pen for years and it really keeps my cuticles moisturized and looking neat.  Received the order quickly, which I really appreciated.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; carried here in town any longer, so the best course was to buy individual replacement items. The original kit included: 1. Three nail buffing files -Cleaning, Smoothing &amp; Finishing, 2. A Crystal file, 3. Cuticle oil pen and 4. A screw top plastic tube to carry all of the above. Since the Crystal file didn&#x27;t wear out and the tube is still serviceable, the best course was to buy those items that needed replacing, the buffing files and the cuticle oil pen. Worked out perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for app. 12 years and will continue to do so.  Helps dry cuticles to look better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say just how thrilled I am to find this product! At 64 yr. and just finishing 8 rounds of CHEMO, plus I&#x27;m in gloves all day long (Dentistry) I was desperate to have some normal health back. I had tried solar oil, Studio 30 something, a&#x27;eda, &amp; those I can&amp;#34;t remember-but ZEVA is the answer. No Mess, Oder, and so Convenient to use home, work, or while I travel, and made in USA. BCFOG</li>
            <li> This is the greatest cuticle oil pen ever! I&#x27;ve been using these for more than 12 years. All other pens I&#x27;ve found are brushes, and you have to twist the bottom to get the oil to come out. This one is as easy as a magic marker. I use it all of the time.</li>
            <li> I think this Zeva Cuticle oil is great and gave one to a friend of miind and she loves it also we will be ordering it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharon  Topeka, Kansas</li>
            <li> Okay, so I did a lot of cuticle oil pen researching because mine are super dry, and I&#x27;ve used burts bees cuticle oil, that helped, but i didn&#x27;t like that it wasn&#x27;t convenient, so I noticed all the good reviews for this one and I thought I might give it a try, I literally just got the pen today and it already has done wonders. I already see results that my super dry cuticles are gone.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks! :)</li>
            <li> So I love doing my own nails- I honestly think it is therapeutic. I use the butter line for nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I came across this cuticle oil because it&#x27;s winter and I live in dry climate and I got tired of cracked hang nails. The pen itself is a great idea and has a smart design. It smells great and is worth the price. I am positive that I will purchase the pen in the future. I have purchased plenty of cuticle creams and oils in the past but I think I found my go to item now. You cuticles absorb the cream and there is no weird residue left over. Another bonus is the pen itself, it&#x27;s such a great and portable design that you can leave it in your purse and not worry about it leaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the oil seems like it lasts quite awhile. I will keep you updated and let you know how long the pen lasts.</li>
            <li> really keeps my cuticles soft...easy to use</li>
            <li> Worked okay but nothing special. The pen idea is great, you don&#x27;t get oil everywhere.</li>
            <li> The challenge with cuticle oils is that most brush on and you end up with oily fingers. This little pen puts just the right amount right where you need it. The blend of oils is nice and it smells good, too, a little like almond oil. I use it in conjunction with Zeva&#x27;s Austrian Crystal nail file and Ridgefiller base coat. My hands have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I love this pen.  I bought a starter kit from Zeva about 18 years ago in a mall in Minnesota.  I was so glad to find their products again online.  The recipe for the pen has changed (with a little Tea Tree oil) but still so nourishing to the cuticles.  Especially good if you live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> it is one of the greatest inventions of all times.  No more need for manicures.</li>
            <li> This is the second Zeva cuticle oil pen I&#x27;ve owned.  I work at 35,000 feet in a very dry environment.  I use the pen daily and often to keep my cuticles moisturized and free of hang nails.  Will never be without this little gem.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as Bath and Body discontinued there cuticle pen stick.  I do like this product.  I work in the hospital where washing hands repeatedly takes its toll on your nails and cuticles.  When I use this you can tell it starts to instantly moisturize and the next day it seems like the old cuticle is ready to fall off.  I only have 2 complaints and both are very minor.  First one is I wish the cap would fit on the end of the pen when you are using it.  I have lost the cap a couple of times when I used it at work or driving.  The second is the price.  Bath and body was a little cheaper and I didnt have to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> This pen puts just the right amount of oil on my cuticles so my hands don&#x27;t feel greasy. My cuticles look great too!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and the Essie pen at the same time to compare but they are apples and oranges, as they say. I like them both for different reasons. This one, the Zeva, is obviously more expensive than the Essie. It took me a second to realize this pen is like the markers that have liquid in the barrel and you have to push down long and hard for the oil to saturate the tip before using. What&#x27;s nice about this is the tip is very firm and while applying the oil I found I could use it to push back my cuticles as well. The Essie has a soft brush tip I like very much too. So for purposes of this review, I would say it depends what your personal preference and need is. I believe this is also a more natural product than the Essie. Cheers.</li>
            <li> the best for dry cuticles.  not too greasy and lasts forevery - I&#x27;ve used this before - it lasts years !!!</li>
            <li> Really helps nurses&#x27; over-washed &amp; over-helled hands!</li>
            <li> I was gifted this oil pen YEARS ago from a friend while I lived in Minneapolis. I had it for a LONG time and used VERY frequently as I am a stylist in a very busy salon and my hands are ON FIRE during these LONG winter months, in &amp; out of water, chemicals and all that jazz TO THE RESCUE ..... Zeva Cuticle Oil Pen!! Great for a quick moisture break for your cuticles on both your hands and feet. While you may feel the oil seems a bit much when first applies, I rest assure you, the oil is gently absorbed into the bed of the nails and surrounding skin very quickly, and if you&#x27;re busy like I am, doesn&#x27;t have time to get anywhere else LOL ... although do be careful of that if you&#x27;re doing a quick moiture break during working hours. The oil will show up on clothing, but it&#x27;s always come out when the occasion drip happens. BE GOOD TO YOUR CUTICLES</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a good cuticle pen since the one I had purchased from a nail boutique in California had run dry.  Other cuticle pens I bought simply had Vaseline-like lotion in them (doesn&#x27;t work as well as oil!)  I was so excited to see the photos of this pen because it looked exactly like the one I loved from California (felt tip, filled with oil).  I keep this pen in my purse and use it daily while waiting at stop lights on my way to work.  I love the way it keeps my nails looking healthy!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday because I have the worse cracked cuticles.  I keep it in my purse and it makes my hands look great.</li>
            <li> I rarely offer my review of products but can&#x27;t keep quiet with this one. Since birth I have had thin, peeling, dry nails. My job requires that I have short, natural nails. I also have to wash my hands very frequently which adds to the breaking and peeling and dryness. This is the first treatment that has kept my nails healthy looking, shiny, and strong. It also helps with the dry skin and cracking I use to get right around my nails. Love all of the oils in it(smells great) and it lasts a long time (fullest oil pen I&#x27;ve encountered). I carry it around with me and use it like chap stick. Aaaaaaaaah!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST cuticle oil pen I&#x27;ve ever used!  Easy easy easy to apply ~ NO MESS!  You can put it in your purse or keep it by your bedside and apply before sleep.  And it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> This product is easy &amp; convenient and does a great job of keeping your cuticles from getting too dry.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to the tip to press on your nail/cuticle to dispense the oil.  Product has a nice smell.  It does absorb quickly, so no significant oily residue.</li>
            <li> Stumbled upon this little beauty in the keys. It is a game changer for anyone with soft, brittle nails. I can actually get a manicure now:)</li>
            <li> nice idea to have oil pen in my pocket, and the quality is fine, but hope to have it for less price</li>
