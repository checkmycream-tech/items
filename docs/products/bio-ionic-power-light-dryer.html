            <li>I am very satisfied with my Bio Ionic Power Light Dryer.</li>
            <li>Its very light and doesn&#x27;t strain my arm...</li>
            <li>This one is a very good buy for the money and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>

            <li>Love this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>AND it seems to eliminate static issues.</li>
            <li>This was priced low and works great!</li>
            <li>You can just tell it&#x27;s a better quality than the driers that you can buy at Target or CVS  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Bio Ionic tools; they leave hair shiny and feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>, how much better could it be?</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is what my hairdresser suggested and I am glad she did.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stay put.....that would be ok if someone else was drying my hair</li>
            <li>Love the way it dries my hair..</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results of the combination of brush and dryer.</li>
            <li>This is one of the top ones that are sold at the salon where she works.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the purchase of this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>What I like most about it is how lightweight it is.  </li>
            <li>but like this one even better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have had probably 10 or more blow dryers in my lifetime....</li>
            <li>It will be the only one I buy from now on it is great!!</li>
            <li>I have been that person that refused to spend more than 40 dollars on a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I wish I had invested in a better dryer - but it is okay.  </li>
            <li>I love the nozzle selections, heat and speed settings.  </li>
            <li>and I am very picky considering I wear Great Lengths extensions.  </li>
            <li>This was a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Dries hair faster, kids and wife love it.  </li>
            <li>Every hair dresser that has touched my hair always has the comment that \\&quot;you have the most amount</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd purchase of this hair dryer, it is just perfect.  </li>
            <li>My last one lasted over 3 years, which is awesome</li>
            <li>Love love love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I love...</li>
            <li>If it were more than $100, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.  </li>
            <li>I can see why stylists would love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>If you every wonder why your hair looks so much better when your stylist blow dries it for you, one reason is his/her tools.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I bought this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I was glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>All the reviews I read where true (even though I was a bit sceptical by so many great ones wondering if they were indeed customers reviews); it is a fantastic hair dryer, leaving your hair smooth and shiny just like when you come out of your hairdresser.</li>
            <li>At first I was nervous to pay so much for a hair dryer but this is simply awesome.</li>
            <li>One of the things I like best is that it is lightweight and has a long cord.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine but still needs products to look smooth.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love my bio ionic power light dryer, as a professional hair stylist I always look for the best quality dryers that are quick and sufficient.</li>
            <li>They have amazing products, and they are worth the money.  </li>
            <li>These days most companies have moved to free shipping and returns.</li>
            <li>I am definitely looking forward now to styling my hair in the morning and getting a beautiful, sleek, frizz free result!  </li>
            <li>they are ALL TRUE!  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s lighweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It drys my hair very quickly and is light-weight.</li>
            <li>but this one is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I seem to be forever searching for the perfect dryer that offers the optimum combination of speed, lightness and minimal damage to my hair without a huge cost.  </li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>It is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel fried!</li>
            <li>Super light!  </li>
            <li>Hands down, the best products for a smooth blowout.</li>
            <li>It dries the hair very quickly, and the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button (that you can simply press and it stays until you &amp;#34;un&amp;#34; press it) is a great feature.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight and gets very hot!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser uses this dryer and when I found it on Amazon, she was upset that she paid more for the exact model from her supplier as I did!  </li>
            <li>she liked mine so much.</li>
            <li>In my home I use the Whisper Light dryer and at my salon I use the Power Light.  </li>
            <li>This dryer fit the bill for all the requirements I had..</li>
            <li>My hair has never, ever been this shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy and the different heat settings are great.</li>
            <li>Instead of a bushy dandelion head this dryer leaves my hair smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li>Always before I&#x27;ve used whatever was available at the hotels, but now I just don&#x27;t think I could do without my Bio Ionic</li>
            <li>We cannot get the attachments to fit.</li>
            <li>Safes time and works fantastic.</li>
            <li>When I decide to let them curly the fast drying helps get a nice curl definition.</li>
            <li>When I was done my hair looked surprisingly shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought this was a pretty good hair dryer but not for $120.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer is fairly light to handle and very powerful.</li>
            <li>I love the balance and feel of the dryer, drying time is greatly reduced and my hair is sleeker and shinier than with other dryers,virtually no fussing afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful, so don&#x27;t just look at the wattage and think, like I did,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful, so it does take some getting used to.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly and fairly light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This dryer came with some great reviews so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of the lightest dryers that I&#x27;ve bought, which makes it easy to dry hair.</li>
            <li>The BioIonic Power Light was well worth the money!  </li>
            <li>Just tried out my new hair dryer, love it!</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s assume they have more than one client a day ;)</li>
            <li>It is TOTALLY worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the best out there</li>
            <li>I am worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money&#x27;!</li>
            <li>Shea Shea Butter Ultra Rich Mask 7oz]], but nothing for styling.</li>
            <li>The first lasted me about 12 years and lots of travel (and probably would have lasted me longer if I had remembered to clean the air filter more than once every 5 years).</li>
            <li>( my mom also has very fine and straight</li>
            <li>but I wish I could use them because then I would be able to direct the air in a more controlled area.</li>
            <li>Light weight and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a great dryer - much faster than my old, heavier dryer.  </li>
            <li>Read the reviews for the Bio Ionic, bought it and couldn&#x27;t be more surprised and pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light, so you don&#x27;t have to worry if you have CT.  </li>
            <li>I was all ready to purchase this dryer from my salon for a lot more money but decided to check amazon first and boy am i glad I did...</li>
            <li>This was something special.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line: this is a good investment, especially when I&#x27;ve heard some stylists have had this brand for years-</li>
            <li>it has a cool button that will stay pressed so you don&#x27;t have to hold it for cool finishing...</li>
            <li>I really think you will love it as well....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a portable Bio Ionic hair dryer, and two full size versions.</li>
            <li>Going to take extra good care of this dryer</li>
            <li>Professional, knowledgable and courteous.</li>
            <li>It is light, dries with amazing speed and does not dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, relatively quiet and has a nice cool button setting that you don&#x27;t have to keep your finger on to keep it on-</li>
            <li>but I am excited to try new things and have my hair looking so much better.</li>
            <li>quick too..</li>
            <li>but it looks a like better than my older dryers.</li>
            <li>dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>They also come with an awesome 5 year warranty, which I have used, and they replace any broken hair dryer for free</li>
            <li>I have tried many different dryers (Solano, Babyliss and more).  </li>
            <li>and so it is very easy to direct the air away from your face and scalp.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think that it gets very hot.</li>
            <li>I first saw this Bio Ionic Power Light Dryer at my hair salon.  </li>
            <li>in the meantime this is the best thing that has happened to my hair beside&lt;br /&gt;the flat iron I bought  recently</li>
            <li>Even though it is light it is very sturdy.great buy!</li>
            <li>Is everything I was expecting, light weight, hot, and makes my hair shine.  </li>
            <li>Dries quick, air is powerful, and the body is pretty light.</li>
            <li>I love my new hair dryer.</li>
            <li>gave it a try to save money the higher price one really do work better</li>
            <li>Lightweight and super powerful.</li>
            <li>It makes blowouts easy and so fast.</li>
            <li>after one week it wouldn&#x27;t get hot anymore!  </li>
            <li>I took it to a very large family camping event and all of my Aunt&#x27;s fell in love with how quickly they were able to dry their hair.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my hair feels soft and healthy after the very first use.</li>
            <li>so it would be good to let it cool before stacking or storing it with other hair products.</li>
            <li>It works really well, much quieter than the one I had been using, my hair is a lot less frizzy at the ends or fly away in appearance and gives me more of the look I have when I leave the salon.  </li>
            <li>It is such an amazing dryer, even&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>Light weight, drys fast and adds volume.  </li>
            <li>This hairdryer greatly reduced drying time and left hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a pricey dryer - but I&#x27;m worth it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a stylist and a coworker had the same model hairdryer and said she liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>My hair feels fresh and nourished when I use this dryer.  </li>
            <li>but it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I use it with a Bio Ionic brush and, WOW, I love what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li>but it is so worth the $$</li>
            <li>and I am convinced that the Bio Ionic products are worth the price.</li>
            <li>This dryer offers so much more, doing 5-9 blowouts a day, and having it for over a year now</li>
            <li>I would never have gotten it at over $200, but for the price here on Amazon it was worth the investment.</li>
            <li>my hair looks more professionally done than when I used the mass market one.  </li>
            <li>This blowdryer was pricey, but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>This blowdryer has all the settings I need and actually makes my hair kind of shiny.  </li>
            <li>Its pricey but worth it</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought it on the recommendation of my hairstylist, as this is what my salon uses, and my hair finally feels as nice as when she styles it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>$110 is a lot of money, but it is well worth it for the performance and time savings.  </li>
            <li>The two nozzles are pretty cool, although I tend to use just one.</li>
            <li>I dries my hair fast and does leave it very soft, Very easy to handle.</li>
            <li>They make your hair feel great, and dry it faster than it normally does.</li>
            <li>Very light weight and pretty powerful, isn&#x27;t loud at all like some dryers are, I recommend if you want power and lightweight</li>
            <li>The old one still worked too, just didn&#x27;t get hot anymore, only slightly warm but after 3 years I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li>It also has an extra long cord so you can plug it in at an outlet and still be able to reach a good distance to a mirror.  </li>
            <li>I then proceeded to get my ipad and order it from Amazon right away.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended this dryer and he was so right.  </li>
            <li>Really helps cut down on fly away hair.</li>
            <li>This dryer works great, the hair dries fast, and leaves it soft, and effortlessly due to its light weight and power</li>
            <li>I purchased this blow dryer because the reviews said it was amazing, this dryer is clearly not for curly hair!</li>
            <li>I had been using a Chi Professional Low EMF Ceramic Hair Dryer and this one is superior.</li>
            <li>Also, Amazon has also been really easy as far as ordering and delivery.  </li>
            <li>am impressed by the extra long, professional grade power cord.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair very fast and is lightweight.  </li>
            <li>The dryer does not seem to get super hot, but it certainly gets the job done and my hair dries feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>So I just used this dryer yesterday for the first time</li>
            <li>I researched this extensively and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>but my hair is better now that I&#x27;ve upgraded from a lesser dryer that was frying my hair.</li>
            <li>It is a bit heavier than the Chi  Professional Low EMF Ceramic Hair Dryer, but is easier to handle and more comfortable to deal with.</li>
            <li>I continued to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my hair with this magical blowdryer and when I came out of the bathroom my husband actually said, &amp;#34;Your</li>
            <li>after blow-drying the dryer gets really hot</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li>My colorist first introduced me to Bio Ionic dryers about a year ago and now I refuse to use anything else.</li>
            <li>it is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer leaves my hair so soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>This dryer really delivers!  </li>
            <li>The first 2 T3&#x27;s died under warranty.  </li>
            <li>It cuts the drying time, is gentle because it offers so many different settings and it is easy to hold and handle.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too heavy and blows nice and hot to get my blow outs done quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain that the condition of my hair has improved since using it, as my hairdresser even commented on how healthy it is on my last visit to her.  </li>
            <li>Another benefit is that by using this dryer instead of the iron, my hair had about 100% more volume and didn&#x27;t go all flat and lifeless.</li>
            <li>Sure it is a bit pricey, but I have had the Bio Ionic OnePass flat iron now for over five years</li>
            <li>I do not have to use a flat iron unless I want a more sleek evening look.</li>
            <li>The dryer is a bit heavier than I had hoped, but overall I think it is good quality that will last.</li>
            <li>I tried to love this dryer and give it as much time as possible....</li>
            <li>This is the most I have ever spent on a dryer, but it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li>This new dryer has its own basket in my bathroom because I don&#x27;t want any issues with the power cord long term or getting knocked around in a drawer.  </li>
            <li>It is well made, light, quiet with just the right amount of heat.</li>
            <li>love the variety of settings and the long cord.....</li>
            <li>However, I was ready to return it after one use because it wasn&#x27;t blowing hot air.  </li>
            <li>Not that loud, drys hair quickly, and</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, sturdy and dries the hair twice as fast as&lt;br /&gt;ordinary dryers.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this one and am amazed how fast and non-damaging it dries my hair.</li>
            <li>It has an excellent cold shot option and varying settings to control the temp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine going back to my cheap, store bought hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li>The nozzle is narrow enough to fit the slot at my station, the dryer is light and powerful and the hot setting is really hot.</li>
            <li>She said that it dries so fast and her arm didn&#x27;t hurt using it...  </li>
            <li>There is really nothing about it that I like.  </li>
            <li>But expected more for the money.</li>
            <li>I admit I really did not believe all the hype.  </li>
            <li>Could a dryer really make my hair smoother.  </li>
            <li>(even when the hubby is trying to get ready too).</li>
            <li>B004DAYJU0 Fekkai Advanced Essential</li>
            <li>I like them so much that I just keep buying this brand.</li>
            <li>Have highly recommended to friends and family!</li>
            <li>$300 is way too much money</li>
            <li>It is a much thicker and sturdier cord than the T3 dryers for example.  </li>
            <li>I had a real problem with dryers over drying my scalp and face--so my skin would get very irritated from the blow dryers.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>My hair are really curly if I let them go and when I want to get them straighter with the Powerlight</li>
            <li>It dries my hair so fast</li>
            <li>Nice and light, you don&#x27;t get tired holding it.</li>
            <li>The dryer that I was using before the Bio Ionic was a very good one, and I had no complaints, but after reading the other reviews on the Bio Ionic, decided that maybe I was missing out by not trying it.  </li>
            <li>these have been $150+ on other sites, even $200 or more, so it was a bargain to buy it here.</li>
            <li>My small travel hair dryer from five years ago is far superior to this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a &#x27;mature&#x27; woman with shoulder length healthy, medium thickness, hair that fortunately hasn&#x27;t been over processed and hardly ever dyed.</li>
            <li>Light weight, long cord....</li>
            <li>Conair Anti Static Thermal Round Brush, Large, Colors</li>
            <li>So far so good and have been using it for at least a year.  </li>
            <li>Hot enough, but not so hot</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use any product, although I did do a quick deep condition this morning with a mix of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I make sure to use gentle, round boar bristle brushes with no plastic anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I like that the cool shot button stays on without me having to depress it for the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>No more fly always and frizzy blow dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Recommend this HIGHLY</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to women in their 40s and 50s to maintain the bounce softness and youthfulness of your hair.</li>
            <li>They gave me a price which I felt was incredibly high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>This may be ok for someone who uses it every other day, but abolutely not for a professional.</li>
            <li>It will take me a little more practice to get my hair looking just how I want it to</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit loud!!</li>
            <li>I paid the list price of $299 to my stylist for the first one before I got smart and found this, my second one, on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>but i love the way my hair comes out when it is blown dried at the hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>I have thick hair so drying it was not something I liked to do with my inexpensive dryers.</li>
            <li>I have thick but very fine and straight hair...</li>
            <li>I have had many kinds of blow dryers, the T3 (two or three of them and each one broke after a year of use!!), some inexpensive revlon dryers, random &#x27;ionic&#x27; dryers from TJ maxx ...  </li>
            <li>In less than a week the hair dryer began to blow just cool air - followed manufacturer&#x27;s instruction, checked filter which is (obviously) still clean,</li>
            <li>Was looking for a new hairdryer and wanted one with bio ionic features.</li>
            <li>so now I have a fancy new paperweight.</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a new hair dryer, but did not want to purchase anything \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>considering I would have to purchase a new hair dryer every 9 - 12 months.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the power light to replace my broken whisper light (after 3+ years of professional use!).  </li>
            <li>and I am curious to see what my mother with super high standards and over 50 years of hairstyling experience will say...</li>
            <li>I would recommend anyone trying this dryer first before spending the extra money.</li>
            <li>Finally, I got an extension cord and the breaker stopped going off, but when I went to unplug the blow dryer from the extension cord, I couldn&#x27;t because the plug was extremely hot.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to use my flat iron as much which really saves the hair .  </li>
            <li>The nozzle attachments really do force the air into a thin stream, so much so that for the most part, I do without them.</li>
            <li>This one is light and dries your hair in half the time.  </li>
            <li>so my styling time is very minimal due to these two amazing tools.)  </li>
            <li>cannot say enough positive things about</li>
            <li>This seems to work faster than my previous dryer and my hair seems soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Well I have never spent more than $30 on a hairdryer, and I cannot believe I&#x27;ve waited all these years, so many bad hair days and so much damage sustained when I could have been using this hairdryer all along.</li>
            <li>she was so excited when it arrived that my dad said she was jumping up and down...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to give off as much heat as my previous dryer, but it does dry my hair quickly so that&#x27;s a positive in my book as I&#x27;ve been worried about over-processing my hair</li>
            <li>Super fast just 10 min to dry my long hair!</li>
            <li>Only had this about a week, but so far, I&#x27;m really liking this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Not too loud.</li>
            <li>As for the quality of my hair, I can definitely tell it was much softer.</li>
            <li>how shiny and soft my hair comes out....</li>
            <li>i was using a 8-10 year old Chi dryer before this...</li>
            <li>My hair looks like my stylist fixed it...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Flash forward another 2 months:  My 80 year old grandma came to visit (the twins not my husband and I).  </li>
            <li>I never thought a blow dryer could leave your hair soft and shiny....</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair soft and seemingly not &#x27;brittle&#x27;, dare I say &#x27;moisturized&#x27;?</li>
            <li>those nano ionic whatever beads really &#x27;do&#x27; something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently visiting my mother (a retired Beautician)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on something cheap, you get what you pay for with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may be labeled for professional use, but who cares.</li>
            <li>If you want professional results use professional products.</li>
            <li>In addition, the smaller nozzle is very concentrated</li>
            <li>it is professional grade, my stylist said that her blow dryer has lasted for years.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and silky after using it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shine.</li>
            <li>and my hair feels so soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair past my shoulders and this allow me to dry it fast, smooth and not frizzy...</li>
            <li>2 months after my coworker&#x27;s dryer started sparking...) is an absolute deal breaker and deserving of a very poor review.</li>
            <li>but I can say it absolutely gave a fantastic result on my previously damaged and dry hair, destroyed by the revlon dryer</li>
            <li>I have kept my other cheap blow dryers for short trips though.  </li>
            <li>and it takes forever, but due to to Ioinic system and lightweightedness of the dryer, I am now able to dry my hair straight in about 20 minutes, even if my hair is semi dry.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, it felt much heavier than my Revlon hair dryer which surprised me and it took twice as long to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>just used a wide-tooth comb real quick then a round brush to dry it:</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it, but all-in-all, my hair looks so much healthier and not so dried out.</li>
            <li>The motor turned on, but never blew hot air no matter how long you left it on or</li>
            <li>This one is by far the most quiet, and gentle, but powerful enough to dry my very thick, long, curly, frizzy, split end hair.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the cool button because you don&#x27;t have to hold it down</li>
            <li>The product malfunction was not due to use, or wear and tear.  </li>
            <li>, I may try there&#x27;s again, but i&#x27;m going to look at other companies first.</li>
            <li>The air flow adjusts from slow to fast, just right for my styling needs.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer cuts hair drying time in half, takes out the frizz for wavy/curly hair, and with the right attachments can help curl your hair or straighten your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have short to medium length, thin, fine hair (some wavy, some straight).  </li>
            <li>Then I went home to my old dryer - and it just wasn&#x27;t the same!</li>
            <li>only ordered it because my Revlon is 10 years old and my hair seemed too frizzy after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>I will never go back to the old hair dyer.</li>
            <li>Many of my clients have long, thick hair and it used to take me between 25 - 30 minutes just&lt;</li>
            <li>I have had cheaper mass market hair dryers in the past and it is true if you haven&#x27;t heard--</li>
            <li>After calling the Go gorgeous customer service, I discovered that the cold shot button was on.  </li>
            <li>Since I dry my hair at least once a day (sometimes more if I need to restyle it)</li>
            <li>Blow is very lightweight only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when I blow dry hair sometimes it will like burnt hair.  </li>
            <li>I have had keratin treatments, normal dry time is 45 mins to an hour.</li>
            <li>and it dried my hair much faster than my old dryer.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a few months, so I am not able to comment personally on its reliability, But my stylist, who has been using it for almost a year on a daily basis for all of her clients, is very pleased with hers.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on hair dryers over the years that I wasn&#x27;t convinced until I finally gave in and bought it after my stylist urged me to check it out.  </li>
            <li>This is really not a big deal to me but the attachments are a LITTLE tricky to change so if you&#x27;re often wanting to switch them real quick while styling it might take a little getting used to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair takes twenty minutes to dry with cheap dryers and usually about 6 min with this dryer.</li>
            <li>When I saw this one I ordered the white and received the black one, that was the first problem.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, not only was it here but was selling for less than half what the salon priced it!  </li>
            <li>The one con I have is that the attachments get almost too hot to touch in just a few seconds.</li>
            <li>With products for continuous conditioning, I believe someone with mostly straight hair wouldn&#x27;t even need to use a straightener, and let&#x27;s face facts, anything that alters the nature of your hair will eventually break it down.</li>
            <li>As titled, it is &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; and it really does cut your drying time in half.</li>
            <li>I have short, thick hair that I like to wear smooth &amp; sleek; it took under 5 minutes to dry AND style my hair.  </li>
            <li>Low is a little lower than I am used to, and high seems a little higher.</li>

            <li> This one is a very good buy for the money and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>

            <li> This was priced low and works great!</li>
            <li> You can just tell it&#x27;s a better quality than the driers that you can buy at Target or CVS  </li>
            <li> I LOVE Bio Ionic tools; they leave hair shiny and feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> , how much better could it be?</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is what my hairdresser suggested and I am glad she did.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay put.....that would be ok if someone else was drying my hair</li>
            <li> Love the way it dries my hair..</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the results of the combination of brush and dryer.</li>
            <li> This is one of the top ones that are sold at the salon where she works.  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the purchase of this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> What I like most about it is how lightweight it is.  </li>
            <li> but like this one even better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have had probably 10 or more blow dryers in my lifetime....</li>
            <li> It will be the only one I buy from now on it is great!!</li>
            <li> I have been that person that refused to spend more than 40 dollars on a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I wish I had invested in a better dryer - but it is okay.  </li>
            <li> I love the nozzle selections, heat and speed settings.  </li>
            <li> and I am very picky considering I wear Great Lengths extensions.  </li>
            <li> This was a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Dries hair faster, kids and wife love it.  </li>
            <li> Every hair dresser that has touched my hair always has the comment that \\&quot;you have the most amount</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this hair dryer, it is just perfect.  </li>
            <li> My last one lasted over 3 years, which is awesome</li>
            <li> Love love love this dryer.</li>
            <li> I love...</li>
            <li> If it were more than $100, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.  </li>
            <li> I can see why stylists would love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Love the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> If you every wonder why your hair looks so much better when your stylist blow dries it for you, one reason is his/her tools.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I was glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> All the reviews I read where true (even though I was a bit sceptical by so many great ones wondering if they were indeed customers reviews); it is a fantastic hair dryer, leaving your hair smooth and shiny just like when you come out of your hairdresser.</li>
            <li> At first I was nervous to pay so much for a hair dryer but this is simply awesome.</li>
            <li> One of the things I like best is that it is lightweight and has a long cord.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine but still needs products to look smooth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my bio ionic power light dryer, as a professional hair stylist I always look for the best quality dryers that are quick and sufficient.</li>
            <li> They have amazing products, and they are worth the money.  </li>
            <li> These days most companies have moved to free shipping and returns.</li>
            <li> I am definitely looking forward now to styling my hair in the morning and getting a beautiful, sleek, frizz free result!  </li>
            <li> they are ALL TRUE!  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s lighweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It drys my hair very quickly and is light-weight.</li>
            <li> but this one is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I seem to be forever searching for the perfect dryer that offers the optimum combination of speed, lightness and minimal damage to my hair without a huge cost.  </li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> It is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel fried!</li>
            <li> Super light!  </li>
            <li> Hands down, the best products for a smooth blowout.</li>
            <li> It dries the hair very quickly, and the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button (that you can simply press and it stays until you &amp;#34;un&amp;#34; press it) is a great feature.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight and gets very hot!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this dryer and when I found it on Amazon, she was upset that she paid more for the exact model from her supplier as I did!  </li>
            <li> she liked mine so much.</li>
            <li> In my home I use the Whisper Light dryer and at my salon I use the Power Light.  </li>
            <li> This dryer fit the bill for all the requirements I had..</li>
            <li> My hair has never, ever been this shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy and the different heat settings are great.</li>
            <li> Instead of a bushy dandelion head this dryer leaves my hair smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li> Always before I&#x27;ve used whatever was available at the hotels, but now I just don&#x27;t think I could do without my Bio Ionic</li>
            <li> We cannot get the attachments to fit.</li>
            <li> Safes time and works fantastic.</li>
            <li> When I decide to let them curly the fast drying helps get a nice curl definition.</li>
            <li> When I was done my hair looked surprisingly shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a pretty good hair dryer but not for $120.  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer is fairly light to handle and very powerful.</li>
            <li> I love the balance and feel of the dryer, drying time is greatly reduced and my hair is sleeker and shinier than with other dryers,virtually no fussing afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful, so don&#x27;t just look at the wattage and think, like I did,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful, so it does take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly and fairly light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This dryer came with some great reviews so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of the lightest dryers that I&#x27;ve bought, which makes it easy to dry hair.</li>
            <li> The BioIonic Power Light was well worth the money!  </li>
            <li> Just tried out my new hair dryer, love it!</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s assume they have more than one client a day ;)</li>
            <li> It is TOTALLY worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the best out there</li>
            <li> I am worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money&#x27;!</li>
            <li> Shea Shea Butter Ultra Rich Mask 7oz]], but nothing for styling.</li>
            <li> The first lasted me about 12 years and lots of travel (and probably would have lasted me longer if I had remembered to clean the air filter more than once every 5 years).</li>
            <li> ( my mom also has very fine and straight</li>
            <li> but I wish I could use them because then I would be able to direct the air in a more controlled area.</li>
            <li> Light weight and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a great dryer - much faster than my old, heavier dryer.  </li>
            <li> Read the reviews for the Bio Ionic, bought it and couldn&#x27;t be more surprised and pleased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super light, so you don&#x27;t have to worry if you have CT.  </li>
            <li> I was all ready to purchase this dryer from my salon for a lot more money but decided to check amazon first and boy am i glad I did...</li>
            <li> This was something special.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line: this is a good investment, especially when I&#x27;ve heard some stylists have had this brand for years-</li>
            <li> it has a cool button that will stay pressed so you don&#x27;t have to hold it for cool finishing...</li>
            <li> I really think you will love it as well....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a portable Bio Ionic hair dryer, and two full size versions.</li>
            <li> Going to take extra good care of this dryer</li>
            <li> Professional, knowledgable and courteous.</li>
            <li> It is light, dries with amazing speed and does not dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, relatively quiet and has a nice cool button setting that you don&#x27;t have to keep your finger on to keep it on-</li>
            <li> but I am excited to try new things and have my hair looking so much better.</li>
            <li> quick too..</li>
            <li> but it looks a like better than my older dryers.</li>
            <li> dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> They also come with an awesome 5 year warranty, which I have used, and they replace any broken hair dryer for free</li>
            <li> I have tried many different dryers (Solano, Babyliss and more).  </li>
            <li> and so it is very easy to direct the air away from your face and scalp.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think that it gets very hot.</li>
            <li> I first saw this Bio Ionic Power Light Dryer at my hair salon.  </li>
            <li> in the meantime this is the best thing that has happened to my hair beside&lt;br /&gt;the flat iron I bought  recently</li>
            <li> Even though it is light it is very sturdy.great buy!</li>
            <li> Is everything I was expecting, light weight, hot, and makes my hair shine.  </li>
            <li> Dries quick, air is powerful, and the body is pretty light.</li>
            <li> I love my new hair dryer.</li>
            <li> gave it a try to save money the higher price one really do work better</li>
            <li> Lightweight and super powerful.</li>
            <li> It makes blowouts easy and so fast.</li>
            <li> after one week it wouldn&#x27;t get hot anymore!  </li>
            <li> I took it to a very large family camping event and all of my Aunt&#x27;s fell in love with how quickly they were able to dry their hair.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my hair feels soft and healthy after the very first use.</li>
            <li> so it would be good to let it cool before stacking or storing it with other hair products.</li>
            <li> It works really well, much quieter than the one I had been using, my hair is a lot less frizzy at the ends or fly away in appearance and gives me more of the look I have when I leave the salon.  </li>
            <li> It is such an amazing dryer, even&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> Light weight, drys fast and adds volume.  </li>
            <li> This hairdryer greatly reduced drying time and left hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a pricey dryer - but I&#x27;m worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a stylist and a coworker had the same model hairdryer and said she liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> My hair feels fresh and nourished when I use this dryer.  </li>
            <li> but it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I use it with a Bio Ionic brush and, WOW, I love what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li> but it is so worth the $$</li>
            <li> and I am convinced that the Bio Ionic products are worth the price.</li>
            <li> This dryer offers so much more, doing 5-9 blowouts a day, and having it for over a year now</li>
            <li> I would never have gotten it at over $200, but for the price here on Amazon it was worth the investment.</li>
            <li> my hair looks more professionally done than when I used the mass market one.  </li>
            <li> This blowdryer was pricey, but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> This blowdryer has all the settings I need and actually makes my hair kind of shiny.  </li>
            <li> Its pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought it on the recommendation of my hairstylist, as this is what my salon uses, and my hair finally feels as nice as when she styles it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> $110 is a lot of money, but it is well worth it for the performance and time savings.  </li>
            <li> The two nozzles are pretty cool, although I tend to use just one.</li>
            <li> I dries my hair fast and does leave it very soft, Very easy to handle.</li>
            <li> They make your hair feel great, and dry it faster than it normally does.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and pretty powerful, isn&#x27;t loud at all like some dryers are, I recommend if you want power and lightweight</li>
            <li> The old one still worked too, just didn&#x27;t get hot anymore, only slightly warm but after 3 years I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> It also has an extra long cord so you can plug it in at an outlet and still be able to reach a good distance to a mirror.  </li>
            <li> I then proceeded to get my ipad and order it from Amazon right away.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this dryer and he was so right.  </li>
            <li> Really helps cut down on fly away hair.</li>
            <li> This dryer works great, the hair dries fast, and leaves it soft, and effortlessly due to its light weight and power</li>
            <li> I purchased this blow dryer because the reviews said it was amazing, this dryer is clearly not for curly hair!</li>
            <li> I had been using a Chi Professional Low EMF Ceramic Hair Dryer and this one is superior.</li>
            <li> Also, Amazon has also been really easy as far as ordering and delivery.  </li>
            <li> am impressed by the extra long, professional grade power cord.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair very fast and is lightweight.  </li>
            <li> The dryer does not seem to get super hot, but it certainly gets the job done and my hair dries feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> So I just used this dryer yesterday for the first time</li>
            <li> I researched this extensively and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> but my hair is better now that I&#x27;ve upgraded from a lesser dryer that was frying my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavier than the Chi  Professional Low EMF Ceramic Hair Dryer, but is easier to handle and more comfortable to deal with.</li>
            <li> I continued to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my hair with this magical blowdryer and when I came out of the bathroom my husband actually said, &amp;#34;Your</li>
            <li> after blow-drying the dryer gets really hot</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li> My colorist first introduced me to Bio Ionic dryers about a year ago and now I refuse to use anything else.</li>
            <li> it is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer leaves my hair so soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> This dryer really delivers!  </li>
            <li> The first 2 T3&#x27;s died under warranty.  </li>
            <li> It cuts the drying time, is gentle because it offers so many different settings and it is easy to hold and handle.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too heavy and blows nice and hot to get my blow outs done quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain that the condition of my hair has improved since using it, as my hairdresser even commented on how healthy it is on my last visit to her.  </li>
            <li> Another benefit is that by using this dryer instead of the iron, my hair had about 100% more volume and didn&#x27;t go all flat and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Sure it is a bit pricey, but I have had the Bio Ionic OnePass flat iron now for over five years</li>
            <li> I do not have to use a flat iron unless I want a more sleek evening look.</li>
            <li> The dryer is a bit heavier than I had hoped, but overall I think it is good quality that will last.</li>
            <li> I tried to love this dryer and give it as much time as possible....</li>
            <li> This is the most I have ever spent on a dryer, but it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li> This new dryer has its own basket in my bathroom because I don&#x27;t want any issues with the power cord long term or getting knocked around in a drawer.  </li>
            <li> It is well made, light, quiet with just the right amount of heat.</li>
            <li> love the variety of settings and the long cord.....</li>
            <li> However, I was ready to return it after one use because it wasn&#x27;t blowing hot air.  </li>
            <li> Not that loud, drys hair quickly, and</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, sturdy and dries the hair twice as fast as&lt;br /&gt;ordinary dryers.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this one and am amazed how fast and non-damaging it dries my hair.</li>
            <li> It has an excellent cold shot option and varying settings to control the temp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine going back to my cheap, store bought hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li> The nozzle is narrow enough to fit the slot at my station, the dryer is light and powerful and the hot setting is really hot.</li>
            <li> She said that it dries so fast and her arm didn&#x27;t hurt using it...  </li>
            <li> There is really nothing about it that I like.  </li>
            <li> But expected more for the money.</li>
            <li> I admit I really did not believe all the hype.  </li>
            <li> Could a dryer really make my hair smoother.  </li>
            <li> (even when the hubby is trying to get ready too).</li>
            <li> B004DAYJU0 Fekkai Advanced Essential</li>
            <li> I like them so much that I just keep buying this brand.</li>
            <li> Have highly recommended to friends and family!</li>
            <li> $300 is way too much money</li>
            <li> It is a much thicker and sturdier cord than the T3 dryers for example.  </li>
            <li> I had a real problem with dryers over drying my scalp and face--so my skin would get very irritated from the blow dryers.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> My hair are really curly if I let them go and when I want to get them straighter with the Powerlight</li>
            <li> It dries my hair so fast</li>
            <li> Nice and light, you don&#x27;t get tired holding it.</li>
            <li> The dryer that I was using before the Bio Ionic was a very good one, and I had no complaints, but after reading the other reviews on the Bio Ionic, decided that maybe I was missing out by not trying it.  </li>
            <li> these have been $150+ on other sites, even $200 or more, so it was a bargain to buy it here.</li>
            <li> My small travel hair dryer from five years ago is far superior to this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a &#x27;mature&#x27; woman with shoulder length healthy, medium thickness, hair that fortunately hasn&#x27;t been over processed and hardly ever dyed.</li>
            <li> Light weight, long cord....</li>
            <li> Conair Anti Static Thermal Round Brush, Large, Colors</li>
            <li> So far so good and have been using it for at least a year.  </li>
            <li> Hot enough, but not so hot</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any product, although I did do a quick deep condition this morning with a mix of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I make sure to use gentle, round boar bristle brushes with no plastic anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I like that the cool shot button stays on without me having to depress it for the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> No more fly always and frizzy blow dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Recommend this HIGHLY</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to women in their 40s and 50s to maintain the bounce softness and youthfulness of your hair.</li>
            <li> They gave me a price which I felt was incredibly high</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This may be ok for someone who uses it every other day, but abolutely not for a professional.</li>
            <li> It will take me a little more practice to get my hair looking just how I want it to</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit loud!!</li>
            <li> I paid the list price of $299 to my stylist for the first one before I got smart and found this, my second one, on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> but i love the way my hair comes out when it is blown dried at the hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair so drying it was not something I liked to do with my inexpensive dryers.</li>
            <li> I have thick but very fine and straight hair...</li>
            <li> I have had many kinds of blow dryers, the T3 (two or three of them and each one broke after a year of use!!), some inexpensive revlon dryers, random &#x27;ionic&#x27; dryers from TJ maxx ...  </li>
            <li> In less than a week the hair dryer began to blow just cool air - followed manufacturer&#x27;s instruction, checked filter which is (obviously) still clean,</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new hairdryer and wanted one with bio ionic features.</li>
            <li> so now I have a fancy new paperweight.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new hair dryer, but did not want to purchase anything \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> considering I would have to purchase a new hair dryer every 9 - 12 months.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the power light to replace my broken whisper light (after 3+ years of professional use!).  </li>
            <li> and I am curious to see what my mother with super high standards and over 50 years of hairstyling experience will say...</li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone trying this dryer first before spending the extra money.</li>
            <li> Finally, I got an extension cord and the breaker stopped going off, but when I went to unplug the blow dryer from the extension cord, I couldn&#x27;t because the plug was extremely hot.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to use my flat iron as much which really saves the hair .  </li>
            <li> The nozzle attachments really do force the air into a thin stream, so much so that for the most part, I do without them.</li>
            <li> This one is light and dries your hair in half the time.  </li>
            <li> so my styling time is very minimal due to these two amazing tools.)  </li>
            <li> cannot say enough positive things about</li>
            <li> This seems to work faster than my previous dryer and my hair seems soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Well I have never spent more than $30 on a hairdryer, and I cannot believe I&#x27;ve waited all these years, so many bad hair days and so much damage sustained when I could have been using this hairdryer all along.</li>
            <li> she was so excited when it arrived that my dad said she was jumping up and down...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to give off as much heat as my previous dryer, but it does dry my hair quickly so that&#x27;s a positive in my book as I&#x27;ve been worried about over-processing my hair</li>
            <li> Super fast just 10 min to dry my long hair!</li>
            <li> Only had this about a week, but so far, I&#x27;m really liking this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Not too loud.</li>
            <li> As for the quality of my hair, I can definitely tell it was much softer.</li>
            <li> how shiny and soft my hair comes out....</li>
            <li> i was using a 8-10 year old Chi dryer before this...</li>
            <li> My hair looks like my stylist fixed it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Flash forward another 2 months:  My 80 year old grandma came to visit (the twins not my husband and I).  </li>
            <li> I never thought a blow dryer could leave your hair soft and shiny....</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair soft and seemingly not &#x27;brittle&#x27;, dare I say &#x27;moisturized&#x27;?</li>
            <li> those nano ionic whatever beads really &#x27;do&#x27; something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently visiting my mother (a retired Beautician)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on something cheap, you get what you pay for with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may be labeled for professional use, but who cares.</li>
            <li> If you want professional results use professional products.</li>
            <li> In addition, the smaller nozzle is very concentrated</li>
            <li> it is professional grade, my stylist said that her blow dryer has lasted for years.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and silky after using it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and shine.</li>
            <li> and my hair feels so soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair past my shoulders and this allow me to dry it fast, smooth and not frizzy...</li>
            <li> 2 months after my coworker&#x27;s dryer started sparking...) is an absolute deal breaker and deserving of a very poor review.</li>
            <li> but I can say it absolutely gave a fantastic result on my previously damaged and dry hair, destroyed by the revlon dryer</li>
            <li> I have kept my other cheap blow dryers for short trips though.  </li>
            <li> and it takes forever, but due to to Ioinic system and lightweightedness of the dryer, I am now able to dry my hair straight in about 20 minutes, even if my hair is semi dry.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, it felt much heavier than my Revlon hair dryer which surprised me and it took twice as long to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> just used a wide-tooth comb real quick then a round brush to dry it:</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it, but all-in-all, my hair looks so much healthier and not so dried out.</li>
            <li> The motor turned on, but never blew hot air no matter how long you left it on or</li>
            <li> This one is by far the most quiet, and gentle, but powerful enough to dry my very thick, long, curly, frizzy, split end hair.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the cool button because you don&#x27;t have to hold it down</li>
            <li> The product malfunction was not due to use, or wear and tear.  </li>
            <li> , I may try there&#x27;s again, but i&#x27;m going to look at other companies first.</li>
            <li> The air flow adjusts from slow to fast, just right for my styling needs.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer cuts hair drying time in half, takes out the frizz for wavy/curly hair, and with the right attachments can help curl your hair or straighten your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have short to medium length, thin, fine hair (some wavy, some straight).  </li>
            <li> Then I went home to my old dryer - and it just wasn&#x27;t the same!</li>
            <li> only ordered it because my Revlon is 10 years old and my hair seemed too frizzy after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> I will never go back to the old hair dyer.</li>
            <li> Many of my clients have long, thick hair and it used to take me between 25 - 30 minutes just&lt;</li>
            <li> I have had cheaper mass market hair dryers in the past and it is true if you haven&#x27;t heard--</li>
            <li> After calling the Go gorgeous customer service, I discovered that the cold shot button was on.  </li>
            <li> Since I dry my hair at least once a day (sometimes more if I need to restyle it)</li>
            <li> Blow is very lightweight only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when I blow dry hair sometimes it will like burnt hair.  </li>
            <li> I have had keratin treatments, normal dry time is 45 mins to an hour.</li>
            <li> and it dried my hair much faster than my old dryer.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few months, so I am not able to comment personally on its reliability, But my stylist, who has been using it for almost a year on a daily basis for all of her clients, is very pleased with hers.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on hair dryers over the years that I wasn&#x27;t convinced until I finally gave in and bought it after my stylist urged me to check it out.  </li>
            <li> This is really not a big deal to me but the attachments are a LITTLE tricky to change so if you&#x27;re often wanting to switch them real quick while styling it might take a little getting used to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair takes twenty minutes to dry with cheap dryers and usually about 6 min with this dryer.</li>
            <li> When I saw this one I ordered the white and received the black one, that was the first problem.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, not only was it here but was selling for less than half what the salon priced it!  </li>
            <li> The one con I have is that the attachments get almost too hot to touch in just a few seconds.</li>
            <li> With products for continuous conditioning, I believe someone with mostly straight hair wouldn&#x27;t even need to use a straightener, and let&#x27;s face facts, anything that alters the nature of your hair will eventually break it down.</li>
            <li> As titled, it is &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; and it really does cut your drying time in half.</li>
            <li> I have short, thick hair that I like to wear smooth &amp; sleek; it took under 5 minutes to dry AND style my hair.  </li>
            <li> Low is a little lower than I am used to, and high seems a little higher.</li>
            <li> Firstly, item was not as described and was very heavy.</li>
            <li> This dryer does the job in half the time with much sleeker resulted and far less frizz.  </li>
            <li> this blowdryer has not dried out my hair like several other brands have.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is small and more informative...</li>
            <li> and I thought her old Solano would suffice, but it wasn&#x27;t heating properly, would give me a teeny tiny shock occasionally, and would leave me with a sore arm because it is so darn heavy.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this dryer for people with curls, I mean yes it could be the products that I am using, BUT the heat blowing from it does not feel hot enough!</li>
            <li> It is light-weight, does not dry hair like an expensive dryer, but is quieter than the cheap ones.  </li>
            <li> The cord and unit feel well-built -- like it will last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> the salon i go to had this gift package with a defuser, hairbrush and flat iron for over $200 bucks</li>
            <li> I do have theirs flat iron from Bioionic  </li>
            <li> It has an extra long cord allowing me to use it wherever, nozzles for drying and styling and a removable filter.</li>
            <li> You will need to do some touch ups with a flat iron</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering the Bio Ionic flat iron as well.....</li>
            <li> and I also required a flat iron to get the sleekness that I prefer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for its durability yet, but I&#x27;m hoping it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is as straight as it can be, super black and very thin; thank God I have tons of hair.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it take forever to dry my hair, it also trips the bathroom breaker each time I use it!  </li>
            <li> I have used several other drugstore/big box brands and won&#x27;t be turning back anytime soon.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Bio Ionic OnePass flat iron for years to tame my wild hair.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Both come with a long warranty as well.  </li>
            <li> It definitely reduces the drying time, but it does not really help with frizziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really long cord too</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience .  </li>
            <li> It took to long</li>
            <li> Convinced that I was done with expensive dryers, I bought a $30 replacement Conair, which was a huge mistake because it took me over 15 minutes to dry my hair</li>
            <li> My grandma has thick curly hair so to have it dry her hair so fast is a blessing for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes about as long to dry your hair as it does for the company to send a replacement.</li>
            <li> It now takes me a/b 15 minutes flat!!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely lighter than other dryers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;to dry their hair.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d probably just keep it since it does dry faster than the Revlon did.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m talking about dry extensions as well...</li>
            <li> and it takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> But with this blow dryer, my skin did not feel dry at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> They use these at the blow dry bar chains and that is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using T3 dryers for the past few years, which I highly dislike because of their low reliability.  </li>
            <li> Working as a professional hair stylist for the past 10 years, I know a bit a/b blow dryers.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that it takes less time to dry, but I definitely would recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> So, I blow dried my hair in small parts with their large brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried turning the lights off while I blow dry my hair!</li>
            <li> It takes OVER 30 minutes to dry my hair with this blow dryer!  </li>
            <li> Lightweight is the key as it allows anyone with frizzy, curly hair to utilize for smoothing and straightening without holding a heavy dryer for long periods of time.  </li>
            <li> Totally professional with the really long thick cord that swivels and efficiency in which it dries with the 3 heat controls as well as 3 speed settings.</li>
            <li> The result: You get hair extremely frizzy or hair that took longer than expected to dry.</li>
            <li> I expected a salon quality dryer because of the price.  </li>
            <li> Between the correct round brush and blow dryer, drying my hair is finally painless on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> The buttons are rocker style on the inside of the handle, but they require a firm press so there is no worry of accidentally powering off in mid use.  </li>
            <li> It takes less time to dry the hair as well.  </li>
            <li> I tried this without anything and it took about half the time it takes to dry with an ionic dryer I bought at CVS for $50.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, hair and a blow out used to take me 30 minutes, but with the Bio it only takes me around 15.</li>
            <li> I have long, coarse, thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Certainly would make your arm tired after a 30 min blow dry if you have long thick hair like I do.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly the seller charges a 15% restocking fee</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair and using a conventional blow dryer left me with a puffy frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair that I straighten.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it actually dries quicker,(which is why the 4 stars)</li>
            <li> and i hope lasts a lot longer than some other dryer have.</li>
            <li> I hope to not have to buy another blow dryer for a very, very long time!!!  </li>
            <li> If fell out of the holder at the salon, and broke the case on the first fall - not a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;attachments are hard to clip on.</li>
            <li> I really thought something was wrong with me, even to contemplate buying a dryer over $100.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My hand would get tired from holding the old heavier dryer - but not this one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too high-end of a dryer to break down like that.  </li>
            <li> Helps keep down the frizz.</li>
            <li> and I hardly ever use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews where people say they have long, thick, hair,(like me), and when using this blow dryer, they are done in 15 minutes or less..  </li>
            <li> The BioIonic Complex used in these dryers and brushes make such a difference in the feel of the hair as it is being dried.  </li>
            <li> The heating element malfunctioned after less than 2 months.</li>
            <li> Dryer is lightweight and my hair dries smoother than with my previous hair dryer.</li>
            <li> That is the only complaint that I have because it&#x27;s not accurate to market the dryer as a \\&quot;Light\\&quot; model.  </li>
            <li> it seemed silly not to have a high end blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> My extensions are long and really thick....</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer a year a few months ago, and out of the blue, for no good reason, the plug just stopped working, and dryer stopped working.  </li>
            <li> It might be a little on the pricey side</li>
            <li> Give it a try, after a little practice...</li>
            <li> So I go on amazon.com and sent one to my mom as a little gift...  </li>
            <li> A little pricy, but has a 5 year warranty.</li>
            <li> After this third and last T3 that inexplicably died, I will never buy another.  </li>
            <li> It is not too heavy, produces a ton of air flow and the intensifier and diffuser work like a dream.</li>
            <li> i just ordered the square round brush and can&#x27;t wait to use that with it...</li>
            <li> So, didn&#x27;t go to the trouble of ordering another one.</li>
            <li> Was worried for price this may be trouble</li>
            <li> So far we do not know why it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> I currently owned some type of Conair purchased from Target for approximately $25...</li>
            <li> The list price is fairly expensive, I got it on sale which put it towards the bottom of the \\&quot;professional hair</li>
            <li> My wife likes it but heavy</li>
            <li> It is heavy duty in looks and feel, yet not in weight.</li>
            <li> The dryer isn&#x27;t heavy, but it&#x27;s not light either.  </li>
            <li> I can notice a difference when I use this blow dryer together with the Bio Ionic round brush.</li>
            <li> Both have long very thick hair &amp; swear by this dryer -</li>
            <li> In the past, I used dryers that wore out in 5 or&lt;</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, cutting my drying time from 20 minutes to 15, and my hair feels soft.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to replace my dryer at least once a year</li>
            <li> Anyhow she had a stroke and has rotator cuff injury so its hard for her to hold items up...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe that a blow dryer can achieve this, but take it from a skeptic,</li>
            <li> I got tired of waiting for my thick hair to dry before going out in the bitter cold this winter</li>
            <li> Sadly, the hair dryer is not all that I expected.</li>
            <li> I have bought several very expensive blow dryers.</li>
            <li> This is the same technology as the very expensive</li>
            <li> and I have definitely not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I also had an issue with it during the first year and their customer service was helpful though they do have a terrible replacement/return policy.</li>
            <li> I have medium length thick hair!</li>
            <li> Also, I have very thick shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> Very slowly, I might add.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. :-(</li>
            <li> sadly I need another blowdryer</li>
            <li> I know it is expensive</li>
            <li> I understand it is expensive</li>
            <li> I hate blowdrying my hair everyday, but I have no choice...</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I couldn&#x27;t be happier...</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry once you make this investment</li>
            <li> Very poor rating.</li>
            <li> I was having a miserable time with frizzy and overly dry hair with the revlon dryers.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, each has lasted about 4 years before going bad.</li>
            <li> Like the cold blast button.</li>
            <li> As soon as I deactivayed the cold shot button, the dryer heated as it should.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at paying around $100 for a hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Now the extension cord wire has MELTED at the plug where the blow dryer plugs into it, and I&#x27;m afraid to use it because it might start a fire!  </li>
            <li> You will not get disappointed by your purchase.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Solanos and they become worthless in no time.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s terrible  customer service.  </li>
            <li> This is the WORST blow dryer I have ever bought in my life.  </li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this crappy blow dryer to my worst enemy!</li>
            <li> extremely disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This hairdryer greatly reduced drying time and left hair feeling soft.  It&#x27;s no louder than the cheapo hairdryer it replaced.  The cord and unit feel well-built -- like it will last for a long time.  The only drawback -- no retractible power cord.</li>
            <li> Working as a professional hair stylist for the past 10 years, I know a bit a/b blow dryers. This Bio Ionic Power&lt;br /&gt;Light blow dryer is the best I have ever used. It is lightweight, sturdy and dries the hair twice as fast as&lt;br /&gt;ordinary dryers. Many of my clients have long, thick hair and it used to take me between 25 - 30 minutes just&lt;br /&gt;to dry their hair. It now takes me a/b 15 minutes flat!!!! In the past, I used dryers that wore out in 5 or&lt;br /&gt;6 months. I have had this dryer for over 6 months and it is still doing great. It is such an amazing dryer, even&lt;br /&gt;my clients are asking where they can purchase one. One of my co-workers got one b/c she liked mine so much. It&lt;br /&gt;also smooths the hair beautifully and diminishes frizzies. This is a GREAT dryer and WORTH EVERT PENNY!!!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has one of these and I borrowed it while visiting her. Then I went home to my old dryer - and it just wasn&#x27;t the same! So I purchased this one and am amazed how fast and non-damaging it dries my hair. Plus it&#x27;s lighweight and easy to handle. It has an excellent cold shot option and varying settings to control the temp.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied customer! They&#x27;re a pricey dryer - but I&#x27;m worth it (so are you)!</li>
            <li> I am the Sassy Hair Chick, a Creative Hair Consultant.  I have been using BioIonic products for years.  In my home I use the Whisper Light dryer and at my salon I use the Power Light.  Let me tell you how great this dryer is!  It is not too heavy, produces a ton of air flow and the intensifier and diffuser work like a dream. The BioIonic Complex used in these dryers and brushes make such a difference in the feel of the hair as it is being dried.  It takes less time to dry the hair as well.  Leaves the hair in better condition too.  I just can&#x27;t say enough great things about these products!</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer I ever purchased</li>
            <li> Softens your hair while drying! Nice and light, you don&#x27;t get tired holding it. Not too loud. I love this dryer!</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer it is the best one ever! I am a hair stylist and this blow dryer makes your hair feel amazing!</li>
            <li> What my hairdresser uses. Really helps cut down on fly away hair. My hair looks better and stays that way longer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, good packageing, arived on time, in a condition exactly as discribe, 100% satisfied I would buy off this company again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony P. Mozzo</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer.  Light weight, drys fast and adds volume.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this at my wife&#x27;s request for Christmas.  She researched hair dryers and settled on this one.  It was a bit pricey, but she loves it. If she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair feels soft and healthy after the very first use. I can&#x27;t imagine going back to my cheap, store bought hair dryer. Also, I have very thick shoulder length hair and it dried my hair much faster than my old dryer. I highly recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a stylist and a coworker had the same model hairdryer and said she liked it a lot. This dryer fit the bill for all the requirements I had..The nozzle is narrow enough to fit the slot at my station, the dryer is light and powerful and the hot setting is really hot. I like that the cool shot button stays on without me having to depress it for the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;But the fact that it started smelling like it was burning at 7 months (coincidentally (?) 2 months after my coworker&#x27;s dryer started sparking...) is an absolute deal breaker and deserving of a very poor review. This may be ok for someone who uses it every other day, but abolutely not for a professional.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go along with a line of straightening products, but used the dryer by itelf first, without any hair products and was impressed with the quality and speed! My hair is very fine but still needs products to look smooth. I tried this without anything and it took about half the time it takes to dry with an ionic dryer I bought at CVS for $50. As for the quality of my hair, I can definitely tell it was much softer. With products for continuous conditioning, I believe someone with mostly straight hair wouldn&#x27;t even need to use a straightener, and let&#x27;s face facts, anything that alters the nature of your hair will eventually break it down. (Article in Allure magazine, Feb/2012, check it out, it says basically the same thing.) Bottom line: this is a good investment, especially when I&#x27;ve heard some stylists have had this brand for years- let&#x27;s assume they have more than one client a day ;)</li>
            <li> Definitely lighter than other dryers I&#x27;ve used.  Comes with the diffuser.  Works well.  So far so good and have been using it for at least a year.  Like the white color with gray accessories too.</li>
            <li> Well I have never spent more than $30 on a hairdryer, and I cannot believe I&#x27;ve waited all these years, so many bad hair days and so much damage sustained when I could have been using this hairdryer all along. I was very skeptical at paying around $100 for a hairdryer. It is TOTALLY worth it! I have extremely curly hair that I straighten. It takes a lot of work to straighten my hair with the iron. So I just used this dryer yesterday for the first time and I DID NOT need my iron at all. This is to be considered a miracle! So, I blow dried my hair in small parts with their large brush. My hair has never, ever been this shiny and smooth. Unlike using my iron, then ends also looked good and not all hashed from the damaging iron heat. Another benefit is that by using this dryer instead of the iron, my hair had about 100% more volume and didn&#x27;t go all flat and lifeless. AND it seems to eliminate static issues. It will take me a little more practice to get my hair looking just how I want it to but I am excited to try new things and have my hair looking so much better. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> gave it a try to save money the higher price one really do work better</li>
            <li> I have bought several very expensive blow dryers. This was priced low and works great! It dries quickly and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel fried! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> The heating element malfunctioned after less than 2 months. It cannot be returned through amazon any longer, and the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty requires me to pay to ship it to them and include a check for $18.95 for them to send me a repaired unit AT THEIR DISCRETION. There isn&#x27;t even any guaranty that they will replace it. Totally unacceptable for a $100 appliance.</li>
            <li> The company replaced the one that quit turning on after 2 uses. Very slowly, I might add. I just don&#x27;t think that it gets very hot. It takes about as long to dry your hair as it does for the company to send a replacement.</li>
            <li> This is a great drier! One of the things I like best is that it is lightweight and has a long cord. My hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy and the different heat settings are great. It might be a little on the pricey side but well worth the extra money. You can just tell it&#x27;s a better quality than the driers that you can buy at Target or CVS  (I bought two before this one).</li>
            <li> My hair feels fresh and nourished when I use this dryer.  This is the same technology as the very expensive&lt;br /&gt;Buttercup&amp;#34; that the Drybar sells!!! I researched this extensively and I&#x27;m glad I did.  This is a great machine!</li>
            <li> I like this dryer. It seems to work well. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the best out there but my hair is better now that I&#x27;ve upgraded from a lesser dryer that was frying my hair. We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer a year a few months ago, and out of the blue, for no good reason, the plug just stopped working, and dryer stopped working.  It&#x27;s too high-end of a dryer to break down like that.  I contacted the company, and they want me to jump through hoops.  That&#x27;s terrible  customer service.  The product malfunction was not due to use, or wear and tear.  sadly I need another blowdryer, I may try there&#x27;s again, but i&#x27;m going to look at other companies first.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and super powerful. I purchased the power light to replace my broken whisper light (after 3+ years of professional use!).  I LOVE Bio Ionic tools; they leave hair shiny and feeling moisturized. Hands down, the best products for a smooth blowout.</li>
            <li> Bio Ionic is an awesome company. They have amazing products, and they are worth the money.  I adore everything I own of Bio Ionic.</li>
            <li> I really thought something was wrong with me, even to contemplate buying a dryer over $100. I was convinced that my &amp;#34;good ole&amp;#34; Revlon dryer of 2 years was just fine and a perfectly good dryer, until I purchased this one! My hairstylist uses this brand exclusively, so I thought that I should give it a try. It&#x27;s very powerful, so don&#x27;t just look at the wattage and think, like I did, oh, my Revlon dryer has the same number of watts, how much better could it be? This thing makes a world of difference in my hair! It&#x27;s very powerful, so it does take some getting used to. I will say that my hair is so shiny and even my color and highlights look different when using this dryer. I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it, but all-in-all, my hair looks so much healthier and not so dried out. Give it a try, after a little practice...you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Firstly, item was not as described and was very heavy. Certainly would make your arm tired after a 30 min blow dry if you have long thick hair like I do.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly the seller charges a 15% restocking fee and you have to pay for return shipping. These days most companies have moved to free shipping and returns. I buy a lot of stuff on the internet and I have never paid a restocking fee/ it defeats the purpose of buying on line. Will never purchase from this seller again</li>
            <li> My daughter just loved it. uses it all the time. I thought it was over priced, but she is thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer cuts hair drying time in half, takes out the frizz for wavy/curly hair, and with the right attachments can help curl your hair or straighten your hair.  I took it to a very large family camping event and all of my Aunt&#x27;s fell in love with how quickly they were able to dry their hair.  (I also have the Bio Ionic OnePass so my styling time is very minimal due to these two amazing tools.)  I know it is expensive but it is worth the money.  Both come with a long warranty as well.  (3 years for the Powerlight and 5 years for the OnePass.)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been years since i have bought a dryer but i love the way my hair comes out when it is blown dried at the hairdresser.  I was all ready to purchase this dryer from my salon for a lot more money but decided to check amazon first and boy am i glad I did...the salon i go to had this gift package with a defuser, hairbrush and flat iron for over $200 bucks and since i really only wanted the dryer i resisted...i found it on amazon, ordered it and received it the same week...cannot say enough positive things about how shiny and soft my hair comes out....I have straight hair past my shoulders and this allow me to dry it fast, smooth and not frizzy...i just ordered the square round brush and can&#x27;t wait to use that with it...i was using a 8-10 year old Chi dryer before this...this dryer will not disappoint....it has a cool button that will stay pressed so you don&#x27;t have to hold it for cool finishing...love the variety of settings and the long cord.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a stylist, and this is the best dryer I have ever used. LOVE!</li>
            <li> I decided to spend an hour or so investigating all of the &#x27;great&#x27; hairdryers out there. I decided on this one based on a review by a stylist. Sadly, the hair dryer is not all that I expected. It definitely reduces the drying time, but it does not really help with frizziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My $30 Revlon Tourmaline Ionic dryer works just as well as this dryer for $100. I would recommend anyone trying this dryer first before spending the extra money.</li>
            <li> Excellent dryer! Super fast just 10 min to dry my long hair! And have 5 years warranty! Light weight and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I dries my hair fast and does leave it very soft, Very easy to handle. My hairdresser had one which is why I searched amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Chi Professional Low EMF Ceramic Hair Dryer and this one is superior. Dries my hair in no time and adds volume. It is a bit heavier than the Chi  Professional Low EMF Ceramic Hair Dryer, but is easier to handle and more comfortable to deal with. I use it with a Bio Ionic brush and, WOW, I love what it does to my hair. Worth every penny and a great price at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Noisier than I thought for a blow dryer at that price. This was a gift for my daughter. She liked it okay, but didn&#x27;t love it. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used this blowdryer at my sisters house on a visit.... I knew within 30 seconds that this was not a standard &amp;#34;Walmart or Target&amp;#34; hairdryer that I had invested in many times over the years!  This was something special.  I continued to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my hair with this magical blowdryer and when I came out of the bathroom my husband actually said, &amp;#34;Your hair looks really good today&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m not kidding!  I then proceeded to get my ipad and order it from Amazon right away. I have thick but very fine and straight hair... it has eliminated the use of my flatiron and looks &amp;#34;salon fixed&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flash forward 2 months:  My mother came to stay with me for a week when I had my twins...  she used the blowdryer and came out of the bathroom and said something to this effect:  &amp;#34;Tell me the story on your hairdryer... it&#x27;s amazing!  My hair looks like my stylist fixed it... I want one!&amp;#34;  So I go on amazon.com and sent one to my mom as a little gift...  she was so excited when it arrived that my dad said she was jumping up and down... LOL ( my mom also has very fine and straight hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flash forward another 2 months:  My 80 year old grandma came to visit (the twins not my husband and I).  Anyhow she had a stroke and has rotator cuff injury so its hard for her to hold items up... she borrowed my blow dryer and came into my room and asked how she could get one!  She said that it dries so fast and her arm didn&#x27;t hurt using it...  Hence,  I got onto amazon.com and ordered her one also... It will be delivered this week.  My grandma has thick curly hair so to have it dry her hair so fast is a blessing for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as you can tell... I basically love this blowdryer and not think of it as a GAME CHANGER!  I understand it is expensive but it is so worth the $$</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  I expected a salon quality dryer because of the price.  It is over rated in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned and totally worth the investment! A little pricy, but has a 5 year warranty.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because I couldn&#x27;t give it ZERO stars!  I bought it from the seller \\&quot;InVanity\\&quot;.  This is the WORST blow dryer I have ever bought in my life.  Not only does it take forever to dry my hair, it also trips the bathroom breaker each time I use it!  I&#x27;ve even tried turning the lights off while I blow dry my hair! Finally, I got an extension cord and the breaker stopped going off, but when I went to unplug the blow dryer from the extension cord, I couldn&#x27;t because the plug was extremely hot.  Now the extension cord wire has MELTED at the plug where the blow dryer plugs into it, and I&#x27;m afraid to use it because it might start a fire!  I know it&#x27;s not the outlet because I&#x27;ve never had this problem before and I use that outlet on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only ordered it because my Revlon is 10 years old and my hair seemed too frizzy after blow drying.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews where people say they have long, thick, hair,(like me), and when using this blow dryer, they are done in 15 minutes or less..  It takes OVER 30 minutes to dry my hair with this blow dryer!  I don&#x27;t know what dryer they have but it&#x27;s not the same \\&quot;PowerLight\\&quot; that I have.  For the amount that I paid, I feel like I got ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the thing didn&#x27;t trip the breaker, and make me feel like using it was a fire hazard, I&#x27;d probably just keep it since it does dry faster than the Revlon did.  I&#x27;m in the process of trying to return it.  Save yourself the time and aggravation, just get a different brand.  I would NOT recommend this crappy blow dryer to my worst enemy!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this hair dryer. Dries my hair quickly and fairly light and easy to use. Like the cold blast button. Great price for what you get.</li>
            <li> My hair looks awesome. This dryer has changed the life of my hair. No more fly always and frizzy blow dry hair.  At first I was nervous to pay so much for a hair dryer but this is simply awesome. My only complaint is small and more informative...after blow-drying the dryer gets really hot so it would be good to let it cool before stacking or storing it with other hair products.</li>
            <li> This is the second Bio Ionic blow dryer I have owned. The first lasted me about 12 years and lots of travel (and probably would have lasted me longer if I had remembered to clean the air filter more than once every 5 years). It is well made, light, quiet with just the right amount of heat. I don&#x27;t even know why I considered getting a different brand. Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I like this bio ionic hair dryer.  The air flow adjusts from slow to fast, just right for my styling needs.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer should be $30.00 if that.  There is really nothing about it that I like.  My hair dries frizzy.  My small travel hair dryer from five years ago is far superior to this product.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the best hair dryer you can buy. Great flow and temperature control. It is salon quality</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is what my hairdresser suggested and I am glad she did.  It dries my hair very fast and is lightweight.  The only thing that I do not like about the dryer is that the attachments swivel.  They don&#x27;t stay put.....that would be ok if someone else was drying my hair but that is not the case.  When the attachments swivel I end up just taking it off but I wish I could use them because then I would be able to direct the air in a more controlled area.</li>
            <li> Light weight and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the way it dries my hair.. quick too.. Helps keep down the frizz. Recommend this HIGHLY</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair and using a conventional blow dryer left me with a puffy frizzy mess. I have used a Bio Ionic OnePass flat iron for years to tame my wild hair. I got tired of waiting for my thick hair to dry before going out in the bitter cold this winter so I decided to try this Bio Ionic dryer. I like the multiple settings for both the speed and the heat. Instead of a bushy dandelion head this dryer leaves my hair smooth and sleek. I bought the Bio Ionic square conditioning brush to use with it and I am pleased with the results of the combination of brush and dryer. Sure it is a bit pricey, but I have had the Bio Ionic OnePass flat iron now for over five years and I am convinced that the Bio Ionic products are worth the price.</li>
            <li> My mother loves it for her hair. Got the recommendation from her stylist before Xmas. I highly recommend it to women in their 40s and 50s to maintain the bounce softness and youthfulness of your hair.</li>
            <li> My wife dose hair for a living and this product is working well for her for now. hope it lasts a year.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new hairdryer and wanted one with bio ionic features. This one is a very good buy for the money and leaves my hair soft and shiny. Makes styling a breeze.</li>
            <li> Both have long very thick hair &amp; swear by this dryer - so good we had to get one for my niece for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my bio ionic power light dryer, as a professional hair stylist I always look for the best quality dryers that are quick and sufficient. This dryer offers so much more, doing 5-9 blowouts a day, and having it for over a year now, I haven&#x27;t had a problem with any settings or it burning out on me! Its very light and doesn&#x27;t strain my arm...Im in love with this dryer and would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Good.  But expected more for the money.</li>
            <li> My stylist used a Bio Ionic dryer and I loved it.  When I saw this one I ordered the white and received the black one, that was the first problem. When I first used it, it felt much heavier than my Revlon hair dryer which surprised me and it took twice as long to dry my hair. I showed the dryer to my stylist and she was surprise by the weight too.  Her dryer weighed 13 oz and this one weighed 1 pound 4 ounces.  She told me that there were a lot of knock off hair dryers and I think this is one of them.  Don&#x27;t waist your money.  I returned it for a refund.</li>
            <li> The WIFE loves it and saved $$$$$ buying it from Amazon..</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer. !!!  It&#x27;s my second one.  It&#x27;s amazing. Best in the market. Recomended to any one. I do have theirs flat iron from Bioionic  The best as well. Good price at amason.  Buy it !! You won&#x27;t regretted !!!!</li>
            <li> I admit I really did not believe all the hype.  Could a dryer really make my hair smoother.  The unquestionable answer is Yes.  I purchased after reading all the reviews and I have definitely not been disappointed.  My hair dries faster and I hardly ever use a flat iron. I&#x27;m now looking to purchase a travel size.  Always before I&#x27;ve used whatever was available at the hotels, but now I just don&#x27;t think I could do without my Bio Ionic</li>
            <li> lightweight, dries my hair quickly, awesome power. I just love it! Really long cord too, so this is a good one for hair professionals!</li>
            <li> for about $80, this is probably the best value I&#x27;ve gotten out of a hairdryer! Dries quick, air is powerful, and the body is pretty light. Hot enough, but not so hot it fries my ends. Get this!</li>
            <li> I was told by my hairdresser to get a really good blow dryer.  Given I invest in my hair from a styling point of view it seemed silly not to have a high end blow dryer.  This is one of the top ones that are sold at the salon where she works.  They gave me a price which I felt was incredibly high so I searched for it on Amazon.  Sure enough, not only was it here but was selling for less than half what the salon priced it!  It works really well, much quieter than the one I had been using, my hair is a lot less frizzy at the ends or fly away in appearance and gives me more of the look I have when I leave the salon.  All in all I like it a lot.  I would never have gotten it at over $200, but for the price here on Amazon it was worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the purchase of this hair dryer. It is light and easy to use. I love it!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is fairly light to handle and very powerful. My only complaint would be that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a bit loud!!</li>
            <li> Had to return product, as it did not work.  The motor turned on, but never blew hot air no matter how long you left it on or what setting you chose.  Since this came from a third party, Amazon didn&#x27;t offer a replacement service.  So, didn&#x27;t go to the trouble of ordering another one.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  I&#x27;m a stylist and I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of tools.  This dryer does the job in half the time with much sleeker resulted and far less frizz.  I love the warranty on it too!!  I usually have to replace my dryer at least once a year but this one is still going strong.  I HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li> I first saw this Bio Ionic Power Light Dryer at my hair salon.  The dryer was offered for sale at the salon for almost double what I paid for it through Amazon.  I was so glad I did the research before buying it at the salon!  It is a great dryer - much faster than my old, heavier dryer.  What I like most about it is how lightweight it is.  My hand would get tired from holding the old heavier dryer - but not this one.  It cuts the drying time, is gentle because it offers so many different settings and it is easy to hold and handle. It also has an extra long cord so you can plug it in at an outlet and still be able to reach a good distance to a mirror.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great dryer. Speedy and not noisy. Very happy with seller. Was worried for price this may be trouble but I have used it for several weeks and lived it. I had a Chi before which lasted 7 years. Was happy with Chi but like this one even better. My hair takes twenty minutes to dry with cheap dryers and usually about 6 min with this dryer. Plus this dryer is perfect for blowing out around a brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> The best blow dryer I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the dryer. It has an extra long cord allowing me to use it wherever, nozzles for drying and styling and a removable filter. I especially like the cool button because you don&#x27;t have to hold it down, it simply clicks on or off. The dryer is a bit heavier than I had hoped, but overall I think it is good quality that will last.</li>
            <li> Super light!  I have used this brand for the last 20+ years, I will never change.  My hair is as straight as it can be, super black and very thin; thank God I have tons of hair.  Basically my hair needs a lot of TLC and I spend hundreds of dollars in products to keep it healthy and bright.  This dryer is a great investment... I am worth it!</li>
            <li> I have had it for 20 months and its blown. I will now buy a Conair for $30.</li>
            <li> OMG.....I paid an extra $5.99 to get this blow driver immediately.....The smartest thing I have ever done regarding a big purchase....I LOVE IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have had probably 10 or more blow dryers in my lifetime....this is the best one&lt;br /&gt;I have ever purchased....believe the great reviews you have read before mine....they are ALL TRUE!  I never thought a blow dryer could leave your hair soft and shiny....and I&#x27;m talking about dry extensions as well...(need to change them)......in the meantime this is the best thing that has happened to my hair beside&lt;br /&gt;the flat iron I bought  recently (inquire if you like I will tell you which one ) I didn&#x27;t need to use my flat iron as much which really saves the hair .  My extensions are long and really thick....this hair dryer is amazing .  Only one issue is the buttons are where I hold the dryer so I kept switching the settings inadvertently but it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience .  I give this 5 STARS⭐️.....I really think you will love it as well....It&#x27;s worth the money&#x27;!</li>
            <li> I had been using the Solanos and they become worthless in no time. Read the reviews for the Bio Ionic, bought it and couldn&#x27;t be more surprised and pleased. I love the balance and feel of the dryer, drying time is greatly reduced and my hair is sleeker and shinier than with other dryers,virtually no fussing afterwards.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer after my stylist used hers on me at the salon.  Since I dry my hair at least once a day (sometimes more if I need to restyle it) I seem to be forever searching for the perfect dryer that offers the optimum combination of speed, lightness and minimal damage to my hair without a huge cost.  This is a really great dryer at any price, but the fact that you can get it on Amazon for under $100 makes it an even better option.  I have only been using it for a few months, so I am not able to comment personally on its reliability, But my stylist, who has been using it for almost a year on a daily basis for all of her clients, is very pleased with hers.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer! It is lightweight and gets very hot! Even though it is light it is very sturdy.great buy!</li>
            <li> So far we do not know why it is so expensive. We cannot get the attachments to fit.</li>
            <li> Was great while it lasted but it broke after 3 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and I can&#x27;t believe I paid over $100 for it.  It stopped working after 6 weeks of use and when I went to warranty the thing they wanted another $20 for me to send it back. I will never buy one of their products again and won&#x27;t recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is light, easy to operate, and makes my hair look amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas and this is what she says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best hair dryer ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have watched my stylist use this dryer on me for the last two years.  I have had cheaper mass market hair dryers in the past and it is true if you haven&#x27;t heard-- there is a difference.  This one is light and dries your hair in half the time.  I have only had it two weeks and it does make a difference-- my hair looks more professionally done than when I used the mass market one.  Buy with confidence when you get this one!</li>
            <li> Only had this about a week, but so far, I&#x27;m really liking this dryer.  I have fine hair but a lot of it and it takes forever to dry.  This seems to work faster than my previous dryer and my hair seems soft and smooth.  Amazon was the seller, and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This blowdryer was pricey, but worth every penny.  I have short to medium length, thin, fine hair (some wavy, some straight).  This blowdryer has all the settings I need and actually makes my hair kind of shiny.  I have used several other drugstore/big box brands and won&#x27;t be turning back anytime soon.  I hate blowdrying my hair everyday, but I have no choice...this blowdryer has not dried out my hair like several other brands have.  It&#x27;s super light, so you don&#x27;t have to worry if you have CT.  The cord is also a wonderful length so I can go anywhere in my bathroom (even when the hubby is trying to get ready too). I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> My Girl Friend Loved It !!!!</li>
            <li> Works well! Drys hair in minutes.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. :-(</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer! Light weight, long cord....</li>
            <li> Very poor rating. In less than a week the hair dryer began to blow just cool air - followed manufacturer&#x27;s instruction, checked filter which is (obviously) still clean, so now I have a fancy new paperweight.</li>
            <li> Blow dryer is excellent.. It will be the only one I buy from now on it is great!! I bought that one for my daughter and now I&#x27;m fixing to buy  one for myself!!!</li>
            <li> I have been that person that refused to spend more than 40 dollars on a blow dryer. The result: You get hair extremely frizzy or hair that took longer than expected to dry. I asked my stylist what she would recommend as a dryer in the 100-150 range. This brand was one of her recommendation. There is a hot/cold setting and three settings for each heat. I have thick hair so drying it was not something I liked to do with my inexpensive dryers. It took to long and it was just a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its different with this dryer. I can actually straighten my hair with the dryer. You will need to do some touch ups with a flat iron but it looks a like better than my older dryers.</li>
            <li> Dryer is lightweight and my hair dries smoother than with my previous hair dryer. Not sure if it actually dries quicker,(which is why the 4 stars) but the end result is what I was looking for. My hair dresser recommended this product and I am happy I followed through on his suggestion. I&#x27;m considering the Bio Ionic flat iron as well..... I would recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this dryer and he was so right.  It is light, dries with amazing speed and does not dry out my hair.  Would recommend this to a friend.  Its pricey but worth it and i hope lasts a lot longer than some other dryer have.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this dryer and when I found it on Amazon, she was upset that she paid more for the exact model from her supplier as I did!  Lightweight is the key as it allows anyone with frizzy, curly hair to utilize for smoothing and straightening without holding a heavy dryer for long periods of time.  I have very thick hair and it takes forever, but due to to Ioinic system and lightweightedness of the dryer, I am now able to dry my hair straight in about 20 minutes, even if my hair is semi dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, relatively quiet and has a nice cool button setting that you don&#x27;t have to keep your finger on to keep it on-just push it and it stays on.  Price is amazing.  My hairdresser wanted $300 for it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blow dryer because the reviews said it was amazing, this dryer is clearly not for curly hair! I tried to love this dryer and give it as much time as possible....but it&#x27;s like my crappy dryer when it comes to drying my curls with a diffuser. I even purchased the Bio Ionic diffuser attachment! it left my hair frizzy and limpy curls. I would not recommend this dryer for people with curls, I mean yes it could be the products that I am using, BUT the heat blowing from it does not feel hot enough! So I returned it.</li>
            <li> I wish I had invested in a better dryer - but it is okay.  It is light-weight, does not dry hair like an expensive dryer, but is quieter than the cheap ones.  If fell out of the holder at the salon, and broke the case on the first fall - not a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;attachments are hard to clip on.</li>
            <li> My colorist first introduced me to Bio Ionic dryers about a year ago and now I refuse to use anything else. As titled, it is &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; and it really does cut your drying time in half. I have long, thick, hair and a blow out used to take me 30 minutes, but with the Bio it only takes me around 15. It also leaves my hair soft and seemingly not &#x27;brittle&#x27;, dare I say &#x27;moisturized&#x27;? It&#x27;s hard to believe that a blow dryer can achieve this, but take it from a skeptic, those nano ionic whatever beads really &#x27;do&#x27; something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently visiting my mother (a retired Beautician) and I thought her old Solano would suffice, but it wasn&#x27;t heating properly, would give me a teeny tiny shock occasionally, and would leave me with a sore arm because it is so darn heavy. Thus, this is my second Bio blow dryer purchase and I am curious to see what my mother with super high standards and over 50 years of hairstyling experience will say... I paid the list price of $299 to my stylist for the first one before I got smart and found this, my second one, on Amazon. Needless to say, I couldn&#x27;t be happier... With BOTH of them.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new hair dryer, but did not want to purchase anything \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.  I currently owned some type of Conair purchased from Target for approximately $25... it was time to upgrade.  This brand of hair dryer was recommended by my hair stylist. The BioIonic Power Light was well worth the money!  This is the most I have ever spent on a dryer, but it was well worth it.  I love the nozzle selections, heat and speed settings.  The dryer does not seem to get super hot, but it certainly gets the job done and my hair dries feeling soft and smooth. I honestly feel like it is not damaging and I am very picky considering I wear Great Lengths extensions.  Also, Amazon has also been really easy as far as ordering and delivery.  This was a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li> Just tried out my new hair dryer, love it! Great temperature, great air flow, SUPER lightweight, good setting options. The one con I have is that the attachments get almost too hot to touch in just a few seconds. I used the diffuser for about a minute, then the speed-dry attachment, then the style attachment...I had to use a hand-towel to touch them! This is really not a big deal to me but the attachments are a LITTLE tricky to change so if you&#x27;re often wanting to switch them real quick while styling it might take a little getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used a wide-tooth comb real quick then a round brush to dry it: [[ASIN:B001T8M9VA Conair Anti Static Thermal Round Brush, Large, Colors May Vary]]. I didn&#x27;t use any product, although I did do a quick deep condition this morning with a mix of [[ASIN:B003X3S26U One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Restorative Mask]] and [[ASIN:B004DAYJU0 Fekkai Advanced Essential Shea Shea Butter Ultra Rich Mask 7oz]], but nothing for styling. The list price is fairly expensive, I got it on sale which put it towards the bottom of the \\&quot;professional hair dryer\\&quot; price rage. Don&#x27;t waste your money on something cheap, you get what you pay for with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Safes time and works fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best dryers I have used in a while. Very light weight and pretty powerful, isn&#x27;t loud at all like some dryers are, I recommend if you want power and lightweight</li>
            <li> My wife likes it but heavy</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hair stylist, best dryer ever</li>
            <li> great dryer.  hair feels great.  dries quickly.  love it.</li>
            <li> I am beyond picky when it comes to any hair product/ tools that I use. The dryer that I was using before the Bio Ionic was a very good one, and I had no complaints, but after reading the other reviews on the Bio Ionic, decided that maybe I was missing out by not trying it.  So glad that I did! It dries the hair very quickly, and the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button (that you can simply press and it stays until you &amp;#34;un&amp;#34; press it) is a great feature.  I&#x27;m certain that the condition of my hair has improved since using it, as my hairdresser even commented on how healthy it is on my last visit to her.  You won&#x27;t be sorry once you make this investment - it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a portable Bio Ionic hair dryer, and two full size versions. Unfortunately, each has lasted about 4 years before going bad. I like them so much that I just keep buying this brand. Hair turns out well, and range of fan power with heat settings gives all of the variation I might want. Not that loud, drys hair quickly, and it is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> Dries hair faster, kids and wife love it.  Works perfectly. It showed up on time in great condition. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I just bought this blow dryer on my hairdressers recommendation. This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned. I used the chi rocket prior to this dryer. I have had keratin treatments, normal dry time is 45 mins to an hour. Every hair dresser that has touched my hair always has the comment that \\&quot;you have the most amount I hair I have ever seen on a client\\&quot;. Please believe me when I say this dryer will save your life.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer leaves my hair so soft &amp; smooth. I bought it on the recommendation of my hairstylist, as this is what my salon uses, and my hair finally feels as nice as when she styles it. It never occurred to me before that her hair dryer was what made the difference. My hair feels like silk every day, not just on haircut days! I&#x27;m still getting used to the settings. Low is a little lower than I am used to, and high seems a little higher. I haven&#x27;t noticed that it takes less time to dry, but I definitely would recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned.  I will never go back to the old hair dyer.</li>
            <li> after one week it wouldn&#x27;t get hot anymore!  extremely disappointed!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this dryer!  Have highly recommended to friends and family!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a &#x27;mature&#x27; woman with shoulder length healthy, medium thickness, hair that fortunately hasn&#x27;t been over processed and hardly ever dyed. I use this dryer the 3 times a week I wash my hair. It is heavy duty in looks and feel, yet not in weight. Totally professional with the really long thick cord that swivels and efficiency in which it dries with the 3 heat controls as well as 3 speed settings. I know I will not harm my hair and that makes me very happy! Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this hair dryer, it is just perfect.  My last one lasted over 3 years, which is awesome considering I would have to purchase a new hair dryer every 9 - 12 months.  The old one still worked too, just didn&#x27;t get hot anymore, only slightly warm but after 3 years I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> this is my second bio ionic hair dryer. They make your hair feel great, and dry it faster than it normally does. They also come with an awesome 5 year warranty, which I have used, and they replace any broken hair dryer for free (I should mention that it has to be a manufacturing malfunction) but any company that utilizes this type of customer service must believe in their product, and so do I!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my Bio Ionic Power Light Dryer. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Purchased this dryer along with the One Pass Straightener for my daughter for Christmas. She loves them both and we would definitely recommend. I own them both too!</li>
            <li> Love love love this dryer. It may be labeled for professional use, but who cares. If you want professional results use professional products.</li>
            <li> I love...love...love..this hair dryer. I do not have to use a flat iron unless I want a more sleek evening look. This does what is stated in description would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this blow dryer to me.  I have had many kinds of blow dryers, the T3 (two or three of them and each one broke after a year of use!!), some inexpensive revlon dryers, random &#x27;ionic&#x27; dryers from TJ maxx ...  This one is by far the most quiet, and gentle, but powerful enough to dry my very thick, long, curly, frizzy, split end hair.  I was having a miserable time with frizzy and overly dry hair with the revlon dryers.  I have spent so much money on hair dryers over the years that I wasn&#x27;t convinced until I finally gave in and bought it after my stylist urged me to check it out.  If it were more than $100, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.  $300 is way too much money and I&#x27;m Very glad I found this deal on amazon! I remember spending $200 on the T3 once to only have it break in under two years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed by the extra long, professional grade power cord.  It is a much thicker and sturdier cord than the T3 dryers for example.  I had problems with the cords breaking on the T3 dryers.  Also, it is so lightweight and doesn&#x27;t hurt my arm or hand at all.  In fact, the way it is designed makes it rest on your forearm very easily.  I can see why stylists would love this dryer.  Of course all these perks are great but I can say it absolutely gave a fantastic result on my previously damaged and dry hair, destroyed by the revlon dryer might I add.  I am definitely looking forward now to styling my hair in the morning and getting a beautiful, sleek, frizz free result!  I make sure to use gentle, round boar bristle brushes with no plastic anywhere.  Between the correct round brush and blow dryer, drying my hair is finally painless on my scalp.  In addition, the smaller nozzle is very concentrated and so it is very easy to direct the air away from your face and scalp.  I had a real problem with dryers over drying my scalp and face--so my skin would get very irritated from the blow dryers.  But with this blow dryer, my skin did not feel dry at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is professional grade, my stylist said that her blow dryer has lasted for years.  I hope to not have to buy another blow dryer for a very, very long time!!!  I have kept my other cheap blow dryers for short trips though.  This new dryer has its own basket in my bathroom because I don&#x27;t want any issues with the power cord long term or getting knocked around in a drawer.  Going to take extra good care of this dryer and I may not even bring it on trips because I don&#x27;t want it getting damaged in any way.  It would be really great if it came with a protective travel case, just a thought. I may consider getting the bio ionic travel dryer if it is reasonably priced because I am impressed with the quality and results!</li>
            <li> It was a great  find &amp; I will be ordering &amp; telling all my clients from now on  !! Thank You !!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this hair dryer.  I have long, coarse, thick, curly hair.  I have tried many different dryers (Solano, Babyliss and more).  This one is exceptional.  It dries quickly, cutting my drying time from 20 minutes to 15, and my hair feels soft.  My hair stylist also uses this hair dryer on her clients and loves it.</li>
            <li> This dryer works great, the hair dries fast, and leaves it soft, and effortlessly due to its light weight and power</li>
            <li> This dryer really delivers!  I have short, thick hair that I like to wear smooth &amp; sleek; it took under 5 minutes to dry AND style my hair.  When I was done my hair looked surprisingly shiny and soft.  The dryer isn&#x27;t heavy, but it&#x27;s not light either.  That is the only complaint that I have because it&#x27;s not accurate to market the dryer as a \\&quot;Light\\&quot; model.  The buttons are rocker style on the inside of the handle, but they require a firm press so there is no worry of accidentally powering off in mid use.  It comes with 2 different concentrator attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say that this is the best dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I&#x27;ve been using T3 dryers for the past few years, which I highly dislike because of their low reliability.  After this third and last T3 that inexplicably died, I will never buy another.  The first 2 T3&#x27;s died under warranty.  Convinced that I was done with expensive dryers, I bought a $30 replacement Conair, which was a huge mistake because it took me over 15 minutes to dry my hair and I also required a flat iron to get the sleekness that I prefer. $110 is a lot of money, but it is well worth it for the performance and time savings.  I can&#x27;t speak for its durability yet, but I&#x27;m hoping it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair drying time by 3/4ths! I have medium length thick hair!</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a pretty good hair dryer but not for $120.  It did a good job blow drying my hair however it broke after 2 years which is not acceptable for a hair dryer in this price range.  I also had an issue with it during the first year and their customer service was helpful though they do have a terrible replacement/return policy.</li>
            <li> I love my new hair dryer. My hair feels soft and silky after using it. I would recommend it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Awesome blow dryer.  However, I was ready to return it after one use because it wasn&#x27;t blowing hot air.  After calling the Go gorgeous customer service, I discovered that the cold shot button was on.  As soon as I deactivayed the cold shot button, the dryer heated as it should.  The gentleman that answered the customer service line was great!  Professional, knowledgable and courteous.</li>
            <li> Love the hair dryer. It makes my hair soft and shine. Can&#x27;t use anything else but this . Thank u</li>
            <li> If you every wonder why your hair looks so much better when your stylist blow dries it for you, one reason is his/her tools. This is a  salon quality dryer. Noticeably different results at home. Make sure you have a good brush too!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this hair dryer deserves it. All the reviews I read where true (even though I was a bit sceptical by so many great ones wondering if they were indeed customers reviews); it is a fantastic hair dryer, leaving your hair smooth and shiny just like when you come out of your hairdresser. It makes blowouts easy and so fast. My hair are really curly if I let them go and when I want to get them straighter with the Powerlight I don&#x27;t need to use an iron anymore and it last couple of days. When I decide to let them curly the fast drying helps get a nice curl definition. You will not get disappointed by your purchase.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is amazing.  Works great and is so strong.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about ionic dryers and I decided to give one a try. The price on Amazon is among the best I&#x27;ve seen - these have been $150+ on other sites, even $200 or more, so it was a bargain to buy it here. This dryer came with some great reviews so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of the lightest dryers that I&#x27;ve bought, which makes it easy to dry hair. The nozzle attachments really do force the air into a thin stream, so much so that for the most part, I do without them. It doesn&#x27;t seem to give off as much heat as my previous dryer, but it does dry my hair quickly so that&#x27;s a positive in my book as I&#x27;ve been worried about over-processing my hair (considering that I do dye it and now I&#x27;m flat-ironing it).</li>
            <li> Blow is very lightweight only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when I blow dry hair sometimes it will like burnt hair.  But it does the job.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! It&#x27;s like a conditioner in a blowdryer! It dries my hair so fast and my hair feels so soft and conditioned. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought this blow dryer. It drys my hair very quickly and is light-weight. I can notice a difference when I use this blow dryer together with the Bio Ionic round brush. My hair appears smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li> Is everything I was expecting, light weight, hot, and makes my hair shine.  I was glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I switched to this dryer after using a Babyliss and an Elchim for years ( I am a hairdresser). It isn&#x27;t too heavy and blows nice and hot to get my blow outs done quick. The two nozzles are pretty cool, although I tend to use just one. They use these at the blow dry bar chains and that is why I bought it. I would highly reccommend this to anyone.</li>
