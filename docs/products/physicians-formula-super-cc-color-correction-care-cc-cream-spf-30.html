    <ol>
            <li>This is the BEST CC cream!</li>
            <li>It matches my skin tone perfectly and has not caused any break outs in the 2 weeks I have been using it.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair though, and I find I should use a lighter shade than Physicians Formula&#x27; s light/medium.</li>
            <li>It has great coverage without makin</li>
            <li>It has great coverage and does a great job of covering up blemishes and redness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Great coverage and matched my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>so this is great because it gives some coverage without feeling like I have anything on my face.  </li>
            <li>I also use the concealar from this line which is also amazing!</li>
            <li>and I feel it matches my skin fairly well.</li>
            <li>Feels good..</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have oily skin, this may be good for you.</li>
            <li>This is just as good.</li>
            <li>I love this for my foundation!</li>
            <li>This product is an amazing makeup.</li>
            <li>I will stay with this now for sure, and face looks good</li>
            <li>Nice smooth appearance, goes on well and stays along time.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a nice smooth, even tone</li>
            <li>So be sure to set with a translucent powder</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been hoping to find a drugstore foundation that performs as well as the Estee Lauder product, but was more within my budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She told me that the CC cream had better coverage, and meant to cover blemishes and redness.</li>
            <li>It is more like a foundation.</li>
            <li>Even better, it stays on all day and is sweatproof.</li>
            <li>This formula is much better than the tinted SPF 50 moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I really love this cream.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or like it&#x27;s sitting on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>No they wont disappear, but face looks better.</li>
            <li>The application of the product is most important.  </li>
            <li>but I really like this the best so far.  </li>
            <li>This may be fine for lots of people, but if you tend to have allergic reactions that cause puffy eyes, you might want to try something else.</li>
            <li>I bought this CC cream after wearing Maybelline Fit Me foundation.</li>
            <li>But it is super easy to use and blend.</li>
            <li>ok ladies, in early 70&#x27;s and fairly good skin BUT do have some lines and wrinkles, have tried several of the cc creams, some more $ than pf.</li>
            <li>One of my favorites right now!</li>
            <li>This product (IMO) is better than Smashbox and a whole lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>This is great for sun protection but its a little thicker than I prefer.</li>
            <li>Caution: use a light hand when applying, too much</li>
            <li>I have been using Estee Lauder Double Wear Light, which I love in terms of coverage, staying power, and color match.</li>
            <li>But in my opinion, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>It works great, and you also get 1.3 fl oz as opposed to the usual 1.0.</li>
            <li>and it LASTS all day, even in hot weather.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out even on hot steamy days.</li>
            <li>I love this product, however the one that was delivered to me does not react to my skin the same way as the one I purchased via CVS.</li>
            <li>Have used several wks now, covers better than rest but doesn&#x27;t look like you have a lot of makeup on.</li>
            <li>many hrs later in day.</li>
            <li>It did provide good coverage without feeling too heavy.</li>
            <li>She said the BB cream is much  more sheer and doesn&#x27;t have much coverage.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Plus, it doesn&#x27;t accentuate wrinkles or large pores.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much</li>
            <li>and it won&#x27;t blend very well and can look cakey.</li>
            <li>It is on the borderline of being light, come some I may have to get the next shade darker.</li>
            <li>Both alone or with the CC cream, it seemed to really do nothing at all.</li>
            <li>If I wear it and start to sweat, it gets very patchy and disappears.</li>
            <li>tried an Almay CC cream awhile ago, and really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>When you consider that when you include tax, Estee Lauder Double Wear Light is close to $40, this is a heck of bargain.</li>
            <li>I watched some YouTube videos about this CC cream, and it seemed promising.</li>
            <li>This cc cream works really well.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is light with yellow and neutral undertones.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and it was about 2 dollars less than at even wal mart.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it is older</li>
            <li>I use a stippling brush to apply (Urban Decay&#x27;s brush) especially to areas that need more coverage.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was pretty much expecting this CC cream to be the same thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter, creamier, and blends better without a heavy or greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>But then I saw the new CC cream.</li>
            <li>Skin is a little dry now and have also been using OLAY 7, which I bought at same time, together it makes my skin look very nice, and I don&#x27;t see any makeup in the wrinkles, and they do look softer.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and acne prone, but this does not break me out.</li>
            <li>Ive tried several other CC and BB creams, but this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Color was also pretty deep.</li>
            <li>But I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I have 40 yr old skin with lots of acne scars and redness.  </li>
            <li>The regular price at Ulta was $13.99, but Ulta frequently has coupons, and this is an eligible item.</li>
            <li>But when applied right, not only does it correct my dark spots</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do so well in covering an active breakout, doesn&#x27;t having the staying power a real concealer should have.</li>
            <li>It covers my post acne redness and dark circles really well.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It covers my post acne redness and dark circles really well.</li>
            <li> I even bought an extra tube a week later when it was on sale because I know I will be using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> This cc helps keep shine and and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> It looks really natural, not cakey or heavy.</li>
            <li> I noticed my face was getting dry</li>
            <li> I have a very oily t zone, and this only made it worse.</li>
            <li> This is definitely thicker than your typical CC cream.</li>
            <li> I expected that I would have to touch up my makeup, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> As a long time cystic acne suffer, I have quite a few hyper pigmentation spots and scars (which is why I purchased this).</li>
            <li> Color is too orangey and looks extremely caked on even with primer.</li>
            <li> My eye watered all day, even though I am very careful not to get products to close to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I went for a pretty long walk this morning, and was sweating like crazy.</li>
            <li> It was way too sheer and didn&#x27;t cover up hardly anything.</li>
            <li> I also bought the CC concealer for dark spots and under eyes.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Too dark for my skin tone..</li>
            <li> I use less concealer and powder with this cream.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was a little darker</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been a little confused about the difference between a BB cream and a CC cream.</li>
            <li> But the one thing I don&#x27;t like, is that for me at least, it&#x27;s not sweat-proof.</li>
            <li> but lately I have been trying to save some money and find beauty dupes.  </li>
            <li> so the makeup looked patchy and started to look to thick.</li>
            <li> It gives a light-medium coverage without looking too thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a little on the expensive side for a drugstore product.</li>
            <li> I apply a thin layer before I apply my foundation (colorstay 180 sand beige for reference).</li>
            <li> But unfortunately does wear well eith combination skin.</li>
            <li> also purchased the powdered version of this product which I was extremely disappointed in.</li>
            <li> I hate wearing foundation</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this for my foundation! It has great coverage without makin me look like I have caked on makeup. This cc helps keep shine and and lasts all day long. One of my favorites right now!</li>
            <li> Nice smooth appearance, goes on well and stays along time. I love it.</li>
            <li> This may be fine for lots of people, but if you tend to have allergic reactions that cause puffy eyes, you might want to try something else. My eye watered all day, even though I am very careful not to get products to close to my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST CC cream! Ive tried several other CC and BB creams, but this one is my favorite.  It covers my post acne redness and dark circles really well. It gives my skin a nice smooth, even tone and it LASTS all day, even in hot weather. My skin is very sensitive and acne prone, but this does not break me out. I also use the concealar from this line which is also amazing!</li>
            <li> I purchased the light/medium on a whim while waiting to find a tone corrector/ primer. I didn&#x27;t expect much but I&#x27;ve worn it for the last three days and keep getting showered by compliments. As a long time cystic acne suffer, I have quite a few hyper pigmentation spots and scars (which is why I purchased this). I hoped that it would help cover those spots as by concealer wasn&#x27;t working well enough. I apply a thin layer before I apply my foundation (colorstay 180 sand beige for reference). Caution: use a light hand when applying, too much and it won&#x27;t blend very well and can look cakey. But when applied right, not only does it correct my dark spots but it also brightens my overall complexion. It is on the borderline of being light, come some I may have to get the next shade darker. It doesn&#x27;t do so well in covering an active breakout, doesn&#x27;t having the staying power a real concealer should have. That and the fact that it does not stay matte are why I&#x27;ve docked it a star. So be sure to set with a translucent powder but overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the powdered version of this product which I was extremely disappointed in. Both alone or with the CC cream, it seemed to really do nothing at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using Estee Lauder Double Wear Light, which I love in terms of coverage, staying power, and color match. But the one thing I don&#x27;t like, is that for me at least, it&#x27;s not sweat-proof. If I wear it and start to sweat, it gets very patchy and disappears. It&#x27;s also a bit of a splurge for me pricewise. I have been hoping to find a drugstore foundation that performs as well as the Estee Lauder product, but was more within my budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some reward points to use at Ulta. I have been wanting to try the Physician&#x27;s Formula BB cream for awhile. But then I saw the new CC cream. I&#x27;ve also been a little confused about the difference between a BB cream and a CC cream. So I asked a sales associate. She told me that the CC cream had better coverage, and meant to cover blemishes and redness. She said the BB cream is much  more sheer and doesn&#x27;t have much coverage. So I ended up getting the CC cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried an Almay CC cream awhile ago, and really didn&#x27;t like it. It was way too sheer and didn&#x27;t cover up hardly anything. I was pretty much expecting this CC cream to be the same thing. But I was very pleasantly surprised. This is definitely thicker than your typical CC cream. It is more like a foundation. But it is super easy to use and blend. It has great coverage and does a great job of covering up blemishes and redness. It looks really natural, not cakey or heavy. You can even tell you have it on. It doesn&#x27;t like you have on a ton of makeup either. Even better, it stays on all day and is sweatproof. I went for a pretty long walk this morning, and was sweating like crazy. I expected that I would have to touch up my makeup, but I didn&#x27;t. It still looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a little on the expensive side for a drugstore product. The regular price at Ulta was $13.99, but Ulta frequently has coupons, and this is an eligible item. But in my opinion, it&#x27;s worth the price. It works great, and you also get 1.3 fl oz as opposed to the usual 1.0. When you consider that when you include tax, Estee Lauder Double Wear Light is close to $40, this is a heck of bargain. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This formula is much better than the tinted SPF 50 moisturizer.  It&#x27;s lighter, creamier, and blends better without a heavy or greasy feel.  It matches my skin tone perfectly and has not caused any break outs in the 2 weeks I have been using it.  I like knowing I am protecting my skin from sun damage.  I use less concealer and powder with this cream.  It makes my morning makeup routine a breeze!</li>
            <li> This is great for sun protection but its a little thicker than I prefer. Looks a bit pasty.</li>
            <li> I bought this CC cream after wearing Maybelline Fit Me foundation. I noticed my face was getting dry so the makeup looked patchy and started to look to thick. I watched some YouTube videos about this CC cream, and it seemed promising. I really love this cream. It gives a light-medium coverage without looking too thick. I also bought the CC concealer for dark spots and under eyes. I&#x27;m really happy with this product. I even bought an extra tube a week later when it was on sale because I know I will be using this for a long time. I wish there was  sunscreen in the product. That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it was about 2 dollars less than at even wal mart.  The make-up provides even coverage and helps protect my skin from the sun.  It doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out even on hot steamy days.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little darker</li>
            <li> This cc cream works really well. It has medium coverage and I feel it matches my skin fairly well. I don&#x27;t feel overly made up, either.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and matched my skin tone.  I really love this product.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or like it&#x27;s sitting on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> Too dark for my skin tone.. Sometimes its cakey...</li>
            <li> Feels good.. But unfortunately does wear well eith combination skin. I have a very oily t zone, and this only made it worse. It did provide good coverage without feeling too heavy. If you don&#x27;t have oily skin, this may be good for you. Color was also pretty deep.</li>
            <li> This product is an amazing makeup. It covers very well and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky. I am very fair though, and I find I should use a lighter shade than Physicians Formula&#x27; s light/medium. Maybe they will make just a &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; one for me!!! Lol</li>
            <li> I love this product, however the one that was delivered to me does not react to my skin the same way as the one I purchased via CVS. This one seems heavier on my face and is not blending well. Perhaps it is older product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not make me break out and I use it in place of foundation. I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Color is too orangey and looks extremely caked on even with primer.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I used to wear Smashbox all the time but lately I have been trying to save some money and find beauty dupes.  This product (IMO) is better than Smashbox and a whole lot cheaper.  I hate wearing foundation so this is great because it gives some coverage without feeling like I have anything on my face.  The application of the product is most important.  I use a stippling brush to apply (Urban Decay&#x27;s brush) especially to areas that need more coverage.  Very natural looking!</li>
            <li> ok ladies, in early 70&#x27;s and fairly good skin BUT do have some lines and wrinkles, have tried several of the cc creams, some more $ than pf. It may be me but I really like this the best so far.  Have used several wks now, covers better than rest but doesn&#x27;t look like you have a lot of makeup on. it did cover a lg pore also. Skin is a little dry now and have also been using OLAY 7, which I bought at same time, together it makes my skin look very nice, and I don&#x27;t see any makeup in the wrinkles, and they do look softer.  No they wont disappear, but face looks better. I will stay with this now for sure, and face looks good many hrs later in day.</li>
            <li> I have 40 yr old skin with lots of acne scars and redness.  My skin tone is light with yellow and neutral undertones.  This is a prefect match and it is buildable from a sheer to medium coverage.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t accentuate wrinkles or large pores.  I use a 45.00 $ bottle of name brand cc cream.  This is just as good.</li>
