            <li>I love this product and whipping was on time.</li>
            <li>It could not be healthy for your skin if it burns it.  </li>
            <li>Love the Olay products.</li>
            <li>I like this olay its give you smooth nice skin buy it today</li>
            <li>i am sure you will love it</li>
            <li>Sure, make me smell like a grandma.</li>
            <li>Love this, it feels lite and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I like this Olay product much better than the moisturizer that contains color.  </li>
            <li>I have a friend who spends hundreds of dollars on her beauty products and even she admits my skin&#x27;s appearance is better than hers...</li>
            <li>but she refuses to switch because she thinks the pricier products have to be better for her skin.  </li>
            <li>I will get more for me and my mom when I have the chance.</li>
            <li>My complexion just looks... better.</li>
            <li>Love the way it softens my skin.  </li>
            <li>Better price than Walmart too.</li>
            <li>This was the most I would invest - it costs $20.I</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer and have used it for many years.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Olay for such wonderful care you give in your products!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the scent is lovely and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to wear any sort of scented moisturizer for quite some time.</li>
            <li>more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>6 months of use:  still using this product, still love the way it feels.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful moisturizer for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is ultra-sensitive and I know this moisturizer would be more comfortable to use if there was no fragrance.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for us old farts.</li>
            <li>Many of the products I used in the States either weren&#x27;t available or the cost was prohibitive.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizer for mature skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really rate this product fairly since I&#x27;ve just started using it.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product, leaves skin soft, altho one review stated it was tinted and she liked it and could go out without makeup...</li>
            <li>The fragrance is so strong that it literally burned my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Love this Product and felt my skin improved right away!</li>
            <li>While this is nice, for the money other products are as good or better</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be your loyal devotee for life!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t lay all the blame on the product as I should have noticed the description did not state fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Why on earth would anyone want to put something on their face that smells like a cheap perfume and burns your eyes?  </li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s my plea to Olay: make this available in a fragrance-free version</li>
            <li>Oil of Olay products were available in almost all the countries I visited.  </li>
            <li>and I both one; and then came home to look to see if it was readily available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I loved Olay when I was a teen, and I still love it today.  </li>
            <li>I have a few freckles that I wanted lightened and I tried what was supposed to be the best of the best with very little results.</li>
            <li>It feels so rich when you&#x27;re smoothing it on, but not a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>I miss the original Oil of Olay smell, but for people who don&#x27;t like scented products, this is a winner.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Absorbed easily, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.</li>
            <li>To me, it seems more evident that the Oil of Olay products are better at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, I used so much of my mom&#x27;s, I had to go get her some more.</li>
            <li>The scent is too much for most people and I am surprised I am able to tolerate it.</li>
            <li>I normally use Olay products and this one should be the same great quality as the rest.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to control how much product is released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Total Effects Mature Therapy is excellent for mature skin.</li>
            <li>This feels light and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li>It was a complete surprise that I was able to wear this with no skin reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice facial cream and seems to keep my skin moist all day.  </li>
            <li>Soaks right</li>
            <li>It is softer; the skin tone is more even; and the fine lines are gone and deeper lines less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer the only one I will use</li>
            <li>I have used &#x27;Olay Regenerist&#x27; products for several years and love them.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at Target and had to return the first one because the pump did not work (pump, pump, pump - nothing).</li>
            <li>I exchanged it and first tried it out on the backs of my hands to get a feeling for the density of the lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry to have to edit this review, but I forgot to cite my real objection to the fragrance - gardenia!</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I immediately planned to return it to the store because of the amount of fragrance.</li>
            <li>With the first use, I noticed that my skin felt</li>
            <li>Love the feel, not overly heavy, but not too light</li>
            <li>This is truly a wonderfuyl product - so much so that I repurchased 8 more after using this product for only one week!  </li>
            <li>This product from Olay works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin tone has evened out and it is much, much softer.</li>
            <li>This is a downer for me as I don&#x27;t wear foundation very often (which does contain sunscreen)</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>But the fragrance is alittle to much.</li>
            <li>This worried me so much that I immediately bought her</li>
            <li>I apply Olay total effects once for sure in the morning and sometimes at night - seems to work so far.</li>
            <li>The new size of bottle is really nice and it seems to be a little thicker, so I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft, smooth, and comfortable, without the greasy, heavy feeling of most moisturizers meant for very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Little greasy but not a big deal and smells good</li>
            <li>I spent most of my adult life overseas.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Olay cream, and I will continue to purchase it from Amazon&#x27;s trusted seller, mujer320.  </li>
            <li>lotion get high marks.</li>
            <li>This is the only non-luxury brand I have found that contains it and frankly, it contains in pretty large amounts.</li>
            <li>It does dissipate pretty quickly and does not clash with any other products I use</li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer for as long as they make it!</li>
            <li>Anyone who is sensitive to fragrance may want to stay away from this particular item.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin hydrated but my wrinkles still look exactly the same.</li>
            <li>and I find that this has done more for my skin then the name brands that cost $50 plus for a small bottle of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Seems to work the same as the regular scent free formula not like its for mature skin .</li>
            <li>AS a 63 year old woman, i was looking for a reasonably priced facial moisturizer</li>
            <li>The reason for only 3 stars is the fact it contains a very obnoxious fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This product just melts into my skin and makes it feel so wonderfully soft.  </li>
            <li>When used regularly they really do what they say they will do.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin and never did, but as soon as I applied this product to my face my eyes started burning and watering and my skin burned.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;old lady smell\\&quot; of yore?</li>
            <li>We are both not so young anymore.</li>
            <li>Just be warned and purchase knowing you might have to return if you are sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>have sensitive combination skin and the drier areas of my face, tend to flake in winter.</li>
            <li>I forgot my face oil at home and asked my mom if she had a moisturizer that I could use for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After searching for a moisturizer, a line tamer, and an age spot reducer, I found all three in Olay Total Effects Cream for Mature Skin!  </li>
            <li>though I&#x27;ve been using Olay Total Effects Cream for Mature Skin for just a week, and I&#x27;m not sure what benefits I&#x27;ll see in the long run, I already have another in my shopping cart to be sure I don&#x27;t run</li>
            <li>Now that I am a &amp;#34;woman of a certain age&amp;#34; as the French would say; I have shifted from the basic moisturizer to the Total Effects moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>After three weeks, my facial lines have diminished, my age spots have faded considerably, and my skin is moisturized all day and night.  </li>
            <li>I bought this &#x27;Total Effects Moisturizer Plus Mature Therapy&#x27;...not part of the &#x27;Regenerist&#x27; line of products...for this purpose.</li>
            <li>I barely notice them at all</li>
            <li>A few weeks after starting to use the Oil of Olay products, both myself and the man in my life noticed a positive difference in my skin.  </li>

            <li> Total Effects Mature Therapy is excellent for mature skin.</li>
            <li> This feels light and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li> It was a complete surprise that I was able to wear this with no skin reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice facial cream and seems to keep my skin moist all day.  </li>
            <li> Soaks right</li>
            <li> It is softer; the skin tone is more even; and the fine lines are gone and deeper lines less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer the only one I will use</li>
            <li> I have used &#x27;Olay Regenerist&#x27; products for several years and love them.  </li>
            <li> I bought this at Target and had to return the first one because the pump did not work (pump, pump, pump - nothing).</li>
            <li> I exchanged it and first tried it out on the backs of my hands to get a feeling for the density of the lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry to have to edit this review, but I forgot to cite my real objection to the fragrance - gardenia!</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I immediately planned to return it to the store because of the amount of fragrance.</li>
            <li> With the first use, I noticed that my skin felt</li>
            <li> Love the feel, not overly heavy, but not too light</li>
            <li> This is truly a wonderfuyl product - so much so that I repurchased 8 more after using this product for only one week!  </li>
            <li> This product from Olay works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has evened out and it is much, much softer.</li>
            <li> This is a downer for me as I don&#x27;t wear foundation very often (which does contain sunscreen)</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> But the fragrance is alittle to much.</li>
            <li> This worried me so much that I immediately bought her</li>
            <li> I apply Olay total effects once for sure in the morning and sometimes at night - seems to work so far.</li>
            <li> The new size of bottle is really nice and it seems to be a little thicker, so I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft, smooth, and comfortable, without the greasy, heavy feeling of most moisturizers meant for very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little greasy but not a big deal and smells good</li>
            <li> I spent most of my adult life overseas.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Olay cream, and I will continue to purchase it from Amazon&#x27;s trusted seller, mujer320.  </li>
            <li> lotion get high marks.</li>
            <li> This is the only non-luxury brand I have found that contains it and frankly, it contains in pretty large amounts.</li>
            <li> It does dissipate pretty quickly and does not clash with any other products I use</li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer for as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> Anyone who is sensitive to fragrance may want to stay away from this particular item.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin hydrated but my wrinkles still look exactly the same.</li>
            <li> and I find that this has done more for my skin then the name brands that cost $50 plus for a small bottle of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Seems to work the same as the regular scent free formula not like its for mature skin .</li>
            <li> AS a 63 year old woman, i was looking for a reasonably priced facial moisturizer</li>
            <li> The reason for only 3 stars is the fact it contains a very obnoxious fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This product just melts into my skin and makes it feel so wonderfully soft.  </li>
            <li> When used regularly they really do what they say they will do.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and never did, but as soon as I applied this product to my face my eyes started burning and watering and my skin burned.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;old lady smell\\&quot; of yore?</li>
            <li> We are both not so young anymore.</li>
            <li> Just be warned and purchase knowing you might have to return if you are sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> have sensitive combination skin and the drier areas of my face, tend to flake in winter.</li>
            <li> I forgot my face oil at home and asked my mom if she had a moisturizer that I could use for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After searching for a moisturizer, a line tamer, and an age spot reducer, I found all three in Olay Total Effects Cream for Mature Skin!  </li>
            <li> though I&#x27;ve been using Olay Total Effects Cream for Mature Skin for just a week, and I&#x27;m not sure what benefits I&#x27;ll see in the long run, I already have another in my shopping cart to be sure I don&#x27;t run</li>
            <li> Now that I am a &amp;#34;woman of a certain age&amp;#34; as the French would say; I have shifted from the basic moisturizer to the Total Effects moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> After three weeks, my facial lines have diminished, my age spots have faded considerably, and my skin is moisturized all day and night.  </li>
            <li> I bought this &#x27;Total Effects Moisturizer Plus Mature Therapy&#x27;...not part of the &#x27;Regenerist&#x27; line of products...for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I barely notice them at all</li>
            <li> A few weeks after starting to use the Oil of Olay products, both myself and the man in my life noticed a positive difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have sensitive eyes and have found other brands to make my eyes water and this product never bothers them.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> It stings when I apply it in a way that my other Olay Total Effects products don&#x27;t, and the only possible cause can be the fragrance in this one, since I have the other formulas in a fragrance-free version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Despite the &amp;#34;Mature&amp;#34; moniker, it is not nearly as moisturizing as you might think.</li>
            <li> hope that Olay keeps making this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used for long yet</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find it less expensive on Amazon and promptly ordered another bottle</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> really like this and will continue to buy it because I have seen a dramatic difference in the appearance and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> worry about it clashing with any other scent I may want to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other brand I was looking at comes in at a whopping $110</li>
            <li> But I needed a less expensive everyday moisturizer to wear under makeup for times when I didn&#x27;t want to do a full makeup application.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe after a few minutes the odor and effects of the fragrance would die down.  </li>
            <li> also like that it&#x27;s designed for use both day and night because that&#x27;s one less container to have sitting on the counter!  </li>
            <li> was having a negative effect on my skin, even though I washed it off immediately after a show was over.  </li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> I notice my skin feels a bit tight and uncomfortable by mid-day.</li>
            <li> and sadly they do not make a unscented &amp;#34;Mature Skin&amp;#34; version.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not so expensive as others.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and it&#x27;s difficult to find things that work on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried very expensive brands</li>
            <li> it is NOT tinted and I was disappointed in that...obviously reviewed another product.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I truly thinks this product helps with wrinkles and it is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Little greasy but not a big deal and smells good</li>
            <li> the best product for my skin will not use anything else</li>
            <li> This product from Olay works very well on my skin. It feels great on my skin and I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a long time. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love the feel, not overly heavy, but not too light</li>
            <li> Total Effects Mature Therapy is excellent for mature skin. I was happy to find it on Amazon and ordering made it very easy for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over two years and I can see the difference in my skin (very nice) will continue to use until I find something I Like better.</li>
            <li> I have used this face cream many many times and I really love it.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer the only one I will use</li>
            <li> Very good product I can see the difference in using it in a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;This product does do what it says.</li>
            <li> Good product, but not any better than others I have used. It keeps my skin hydrated but my wrinkles still look exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for dry skin. Absorbed easily, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film. Pls keep this stocked always!</li>
            <li> Have been using this face cream for 2 years now. Works well for me</li>
            <li> The moisturizer itself is quite good. The reason for only 3 stars is the fact it contains a very obnoxious fragrance.  Can&#x27;t lay all the blame on the product as I should have noticed the description did not state fragrance free.  Anyone who is sensitive to fragrance may want to stay away from this particular item.  On the good side, it absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product and whipping was on time. I shared it with my mom and now she is trying to find it every time she shops. I told her to get it off of Amazon, lol. It really is a great product and I saw immediate change in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used on my face. Non greasy, smells good, convenient container, and my skin is looking great these days, since I started using it. Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, leaves skin soft, altho one review stated it was tinted and she liked it and could go out without makeup...it is NOT tinted and I was disappointed in that...obviously reviewed another product.  While this is nice, for the money other products are as good or better and I probably will not reorder.</li>
            <li> I loved Olay when I was a teen, and I still love it today.  It has always had wonderful moisturizers for the money.  This product just melts into my skin and makes it feel so wonderfully soft.  I use it all of the time and would stand it up to any costlier moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After searching for a moisturizer, a line tamer, and an age spot reducer, I found all three in Olay Total Effects Cream for Mature Skin!  After three weeks, my facial lines have diminished, my age spots have faded considerably, and my skin is moisturized all day and night.  This is truly a wonderfuyl product - so much so that I repurchased 8 more after using this product for only one week!  I highly recommend this Olay cream, and I will continue to purchase it from Amazon&#x27;s trusted seller, mujer320.  What a great price for a marvelous product!!!</li>
            <li> I have used &#x27;Olay Regenerist&#x27; products for several years and love them.  When used regularly they really do what they say they will do. But I needed a less expensive everyday moisturizer to wear under makeup for times when I didn&#x27;t want to do a full makeup application.  I bought this &#x27;Total Effects Moisturizer Plus Mature Therapy&#x27;...not part of the &#x27;Regenerist&#x27; line of products...for this purpose. I do not have sensitive skin and never did, but as soon as I applied this product to my face my eyes started burning and watering and my skin burned.  The fragrance is so strong that it literally burned my eyes.  I thought maybe after a few minutes the odor and effects of the fragrance would die down.  It didn&#x27;t.  Why on earth would anyone want to put something on their face that smells like a cheap perfume and burns your eyes?  It could not be healthy for your skin if it burns it.  It was also rather &#x27;sticky&#x27;.  Within 5 minutes I had to wash it off my face.  I would never buy this product again or recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the Olay products. I use this one every day before makeup.</li>
            <li> AS a 63 year old woman, i was looking for a reasonably priced facial moisturizer and I have found the product that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I like this olay its give you smooth nice skin buy it today i am sure you will love it</li>
            <li> moistureize face nice</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target and had to return the first one because the pump did not work (pump, pump, pump - nothing). I exchanged it and first tried it out on the backs of my hands to get a feeling for the density of the lotion. It felt wonderful, but the scent was overwhelming. I had doubts I could even use this on my face, but I gave it a try. It feels very nice. Soaks right in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worry about it clashing with any other scent I may want to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion get high marks. The scent needs to be dialed way back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to have to edit this review, but I forgot to cite my real objection to the fragrance - gardenia! Seriously? The \\&quot;old lady smell\\&quot; of yore? Sure, make me smell like a grandma. Yeesh.</li>
            <li> Love this, it feels lite and refreshing. I&#x27;ve tried very expensive brands and I find that this has done more for my skin then the name brands that cost $50 plus for a small bottle of moisturizer. I have a few freckles that I wanted lightened and I tried what was supposed to be the best of the best with very little results. But then Just thought I&#x27;d give Olay a try. It has faded the spots to the point I barely notice them at all and it doesn&#x27;t even indicate that it does that on the package. I also like the light ginger fragrance very pleasant. I will continue to purchase this item. Also, I have sensitive eyes and have found other brands to make my eyes water and this product never bothers them.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer for very dry skin. It makes my skin feel soft, smooth, and comfortable, without the greasy, heavy feeling of most moisturizers meant for very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the fragrance! My skin is ultra-sensitive and I know this moisturizer would be more comfortable to use if there was no fragrance. It stings when I apply it in a way that my other Olay Total Effects products don&#x27;t, and the only possible cause can be the fragrance in this one, since I have the other formulas in a fragrance-free version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there&#x27;s my plea to Olay: make this available in a fragrance-free version and I&#x27;ll be your loyal devotee for life!</li>
            <li> I like this Olay product much better than the moisturizer that contains color.  I don&#x27;t like to wear any type of foundation on my face, just pressed powder.  This feels light and absorbs very well.  It is a very good product that&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for us old farts. Feels really good after a shower on my face. I recommend it to any age.</li>
            <li> I started using Oil of Olay products out of necessity.  I spent most of my adult life overseas.  Many of the products I used in the States either weren&#x27;t available or the cost was prohibitive.  Oil of Olay products were available in almost all the countries I visited.  I was a broadcast journalist and the stage makeup I had to use was having a negative effect on my skin, even though I washed it off immediately after a show was over.  A few weeks after starting to use the Oil of Olay products, both myself and the man in my life noticed a positive difference in my skin.  It was softer and there were fewer breakouts.  Now that I am a &amp;#34;woman of a certain age&amp;#34; as the French would say; I have shifted from the basic moisturizer to the Total Effects moisturizer.  Again, I was amazed at the difference in my skin.  It is softer; the skin tone is more even; and the fine lines are gone and deeper lines less noticeable.  I have a friend who spends hundreds of dollars on her beauty products and even she admits my skin&#x27;s appearance is better than hers...but she refuses to switch because she thinks the pricier products have to be better for her skin.  To me, it seems more evident that the Oil of Olay products are better at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> I will get more for me and my mom when I have the chance. We are both not so young anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this Product and felt my skin improved right away!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a lot of research about niacinamide (vitamin b3) and its ability to fight aging. This is the only non-luxury brand I have found that contains it and frankly, it contains in pretty large amounts. The other brand I was looking at comes in at a whopping $110 so this is quite a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this and will continue to buy it because I have seen a dramatic difference in the appearance and feel of my skin. My skin tone has evened out and it is much, much softer. However, I do have a couple of notes about what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The scent is too much for most people and I am surprised I am able to tolerate it. When I first used it, I immediately planned to return it to the store because of the amount of fragrance. Strangely enough, it grew on me and now I look forward to the scent. It does dissipate pretty quickly and does not clash with any other products I use so there is that. Just be warned and purchase knowing you might have to return if you are sensitive to smells. Btw, I wrote to Olay to double check and sadly they do not make a unscented &amp;#34;Mature Skin&amp;#34; version.&lt;br /&gt;* It does not contain any sunscreen. This is a downer for me as I don&#x27;t wear foundation very often (which does contain sunscreen) so I have to use 2 separate products just to walk out the door. Boo.&lt;br /&gt;* Despite the &amp;#34;Mature&amp;#34; moniker, it is not nearly as moisturizing as you might think. I have very dry skin and it is not enough to resolve it. I notice my skin feels a bit tight and uncomfortable by mid-day. In the drier months, I use this a sort of serum under a moisturizing cream with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this stuff is amazing. Really. You cannot find these ingredients (especially vitamin B3) at this price point anywhere else and I saw results within a week or two. My complexion just looks... better. This is something I will always have in my arsenal from now on. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  Love the way it softens my skin.  I have really dry skin.  The new size of bottle is really nice and it seems to be a little thicker, so I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li> I like the way it hydrates my skin! Good for women over 40, like myself! Better price than Walmart too.</li>
            <li> Minimum time and maintenance person. This was the most I would invest - it costs $20.I have sensitive combination skin and the drier areas of my face, tend to flake in winter. I have used it for 2 weeks now- feels like its not a constant struggle to moisturize or grease up nowadays. I apply Olay total effects once for sure in the morning and sometimes at night - seems to work so far. I don&#x27;t know if it helps with aging only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Seems to work the same as the regular scent free formula not like its for mature skin . But the fragrance is alittle to much.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for mature skin.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and have used it for many years.  As things go, it has become more difficult to find at local merchants.  I am pleased to be able to order it online and have it delivered!</li>
            <li> Its very good, I like it ...................I would introduce to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Its very good compare with the price. So I like it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and the price is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great product, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Olay products are the only products I will use on my face and skin.  I am 59 years old and my skin is in wonderful condition.  I have no wrinkles and my face feels clean, fresh, and beautiful all the time.  Everyone compliments my skin especially since I have no wrinkles and they cannot believe my age.  What is most important is that my skin is healthy and light and it makes me feel pretty and happy!  Thank you Olay for such wonderful care you give in your products!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for my mature skin, and I found this one one of the best. Not so expensive as others.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this product. It happened quite by accident while traveling. I forgot my face oil at home and asked my mom if she had a moisturizer that I could use for my sensitive skin. I have rosacea and it&#x27;s difficult to find things that work on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the scent is lovely and not overpowering. I haven&#x27;t been able to wear any sort of scented moisturizer for quite some time. It was a complete surprise that I was able to wear this with no skin reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I used so much of my mom&#x27;s, I had to go get her some more. I drove practically everywhere in her town, but could not find it. I finally found it in another town. This worried me so much that I immediately bought her and I both one; and then came home to look to see if it was readily available through Amazon. I was pleased to find it less expensive on Amazon and promptly ordered another bottle so I wouldn&#x27;t run out anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that Olay keeps making this product for a long time. I am a loyal customer for as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> I normally use Olay products and this one should be the same great quality as the rest. Haven&#x27;t used for long yet though so I&#x27;ll update later.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve ever used a face lotion that I liked as well as this one.  It feels so rich when you&#x27;re smoothing it on, but not a bit greasy.  With the first use, I noticed that my skin felt more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it&#x27;s designed for use both day and night because that&#x27;s one less container to have sitting on the counter!  The pump works well, it&#x27;s easy to control how much product is released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I&#x27;ve been using Olay Total Effects Cream for Mature Skin for just a week, and I&#x27;m not sure what benefits I&#x27;ll see in the long run, I already have another in my shopping cart to be sure I don&#x27;t run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT ... 6 months of use:  still using this product, still love the way it feels.  It does seem to have improved the appearance of my skin, which I believe is a bit firmer and definitely looks healthier.  I continue to use it both morning and night.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really rate this product fairly since I&#x27;ve just started using it.  I miss the original Oil of Olay smell, but for people who don&#x27;t like scented products, this is a winner.  It&#x27;s a nice facial cream and seems to keep my skin moist all day.  As I said, though, the jury is still out on this one.</li>
