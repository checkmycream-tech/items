            <li>It smells like roses, but not too overwhelming...</li>
            <li>Chloe is my favorite perfume, but this is either made by someone else, expired, or something.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s such a beautiful scent and bottle...</li>
            <li>The scent smells really cheap.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something about this smell, like honeyed-rose, that is so unique.</li>

            <li>may have gotten an old batch.</li>
            <li>maybe the ingredients reacted for some reason, even though it wasn&#x27;t in direct heat.</li>
            <li>The box and packaging all look authentic, so I&#x27;m not sure why it smells so different.  </li>
            <li>I wear it pretty much daily &amp; get quite a few compliments on it.</li>
