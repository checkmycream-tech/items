    <ol>
            <li>This stuff works very good.</li>
            <li>Good stuff!</li>
            <li>Yes, my happy hair has returned.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why Nioxin worked so great</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve experienced any regrowth, but my hair does seem healthier.</li>
            <li>This nay be a good product</li>
            <li>Even my hairdresser noticed the amazing improvement.  </li>
            <li>When I use both together the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is an honest review.</li>
            <li>It is so very strong and does not dissipate with a shampoo either.</li>
            <li>This eventually turned darker and thicker and more hairs grew in.  </li>
            <li>I have used tricomin and the quality is better and does not cause irritation.</li>
            <li>cheaper is not always better.</li>
            <li>Might be worth a try, and good luck.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff along with minoxidil and with a healthy scalp shampoo.</li>
            <li>but it is much better.</li>
            <li>I found better results with using the 5% solution compared to using the 2% Minoxidil.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell, but it&#x27;s tolerable contrary to many of the reviews I read before purchasing it.</li>
            <li>, it is thicker and my scalp has filled in.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not even sure if I&#x27;m using the product right</li>
            <li>I originally tried this spray as a hair-regrowth solution.  </li>
            <li>I would clean the wound with some alcohol, dab some neosporin (or equivalent), spray the padded part of a band-aid with the Folligen, and then stick on the band-aid.  </li>
            <li>You have to stay with it for at least 3 months and it works best when used twice a day.  </li>
            <li>(1) make sure you get plenty of protein and healthy oils (such as olive oil).  </li>

            <li>If it only were to keep me from losing more hair over time, it would be worthwhile.</li>
            <li>My bangs have tons of new growth all across the top of my forhed.</li>
            <li>I bought this as the kind of last option for my hair fall.</li>
            <li>Also, this product does have a distinct coppery odor when you first apply it that does go away once it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I am 50 y/o male with male pattern balding ---been using Minoxidil for years, which has slowed the rate of loss a great deal.</li>
            <li>starting it I experienced tons of hair coming out which was obviously anxiety provoking.</li>
            <li>I did discover that it is very effective at reducing scars for small- to medium-sized wounds.  </li>
            <li>stopped using it after two or three times as the pain was very much</li>
            <li>plus Folligen is exactly what my hair needed.  </li>
            <li>I be sure to treat the edge of my hairline and the top/back of my scalp (the areas that are prone to extra hair loss).  </li>
            <li>I be sure to treat the edge of my hairline and the top/back of my scalp (the areas that are prone to extra hair loss).  </li>
            <li>Seemed okay, just needed to cut bottom of inner straw</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also made the switch to generic minoxidil foam to save money and because it looks better in my hair than the Lipogaine did (I think I&#x27;m probably getting too much of it in my hair rather than my scalp, actually).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Evidently this does not work as well for everyone, but sometimes it works really well, as it has in my case.  </li>
            <li>If you have scalp irritation from something other than an open wound--such as wearing wigs--Folligen would be a great supplement to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been suffering from telogen effluvium and a large amount of my hair has fallen out.</li>
            <li>cons are that besides relieving my itching, it didn&#x27;t really do anything else for me.  </li>
            <li>I imagine it would be very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I really wonder what would be in the bottle if it were tested.</li>
            <li>I am going to strat spraying on whole head.</li>
            <li>and it works very well to increase hair growth/fullness and to stop hair loss.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care about any of that.</li>
            <li>All in all, this product has definitely been worth it for me!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this back in 2001 and the company has changed the formula a bit</li>
            <li>what hair I did have left wasn&#x27;t worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>I continue making parts over my head (about 3 or 4 on the left and then on the right)</li>
            <li>I continue making parts over my head (about 3 or 4 on the left and then on the right)</li>
            <li>It could just be the volumizing effect of the minoxidil foam (which, once again, should probably be avoided as much as possible if you want it to work right --</li>
            <li>(3) massage your scalp lightly with your fingertips when washing your hair, 10 seconds in the front, 10 seconds in the middle section and 10 seconds in the back to stimulate hair growth, (4) minimize hair coloringcenter and do the 3 squirts and rubbing with fingertips.  </li>

            <li>Wish it came in clear</li>
            <li>I have been using Folligen spray for 2 months now (once a day) in addition to Minoxidil, and I have noticed a marked improvement in my hair&#x27;s health.  </li>
            <li>I can definitely recommend this for anyone who is in the early stages of hair loss or anyone who wants to help reduce scarring in general.</li>
            <li>However, I am a bit excited to actually see a little new growth (which my wife also noticed without prompting).     </li>
            <li>Any time I had irritation or itching, I would spray a few squirts around my scalp, massage it in, and be treated to a cool, soothing end to the itching almost instantaneously.  </li>
            <li>It also has a very strong coppery smell that is not pleasant (and is strong enough that other people will notice it), and the blue liquid is runny and will tinge your hair / scalp blue until washed off.  </li>
            <li>front to back, first down the middle and do 3 or 4 quick squirts front to back and rub it in with my fingertips</li>
            <li>After several weeks using Folligen I noticed some new wispy growth.  </li>
            <li>For the past two years especially, my hair had been so brittle that running my fingers through it would break strands, and my scalp was easily visible.  </li>
            <li>I have dark hair, and so it&#x27;s not so much of an issue for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair was getting thinner, and I was tired of wearing wigs mostly due to my own carelessness.</li>
            <li>; then I make a new part about one inch away  from the one in the center and do the 3 squirts and rubbing with fingertips.  </li>
            <li>I had been struggling with thinning hair on the top back of my head, on both right and left side and a badly receding hairline.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot of product, so a spray bottle that sprays just a small amount of liquid is better than  one that wastes</li>

            <li> and now I use it regularly for any minor wounds.  </li>
            <li> If you see any new little hairs, then keep it up to see if they thicken and become what you want.  </li>
            <li> But afyer few days I started to notice tons of new hair shagtd coming on my head.</li>
            <li> Every other day I spray it  on my entire head by doing the following --  </li>
            <li> I was desperately trying to find a solution and a sympathetic hairdresser said,</li>
            <li> I have dark hair, so it wasn&#x27;t too obvious, but if you are blonde</li>
            <li> had already been using Minoxidil (5% solution) alone for several years, with minimal results.  </li>
            <li> My hair always grew long but it was not getting fuller.  </li>
            <li> comment on it&#x27;s long term effect</li>
            <li> (I could definitely see an improvement), but I decided it was too messy to use on a regular basis and</li>
            <li> And it sometimes runs down my face briefly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I started all these at or around the same time, it&#x27;s pretty difficult to determine what, if anything, is working.</li>
            <li> It is no miracle cure, but I have to believe it works at least modestly well.</li>
            <li> This product may be useful but with no directions and unable to administer there is no way to say if product meets what it claims.</li>
            <li> I had already been using Nioxin for a few years and had seen some improvement, but not enough.  </li>
            <li> word of caution:  If you are blonde, this product will tinge your hair and scalp slightly green.  </li>
            <li> It gave my blond hair a blue green cast and it smelled funky.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later, those hairs seem to be maturing into darker hair, and  I think I see some additional vellus hair beginning to grow as well.     </li>
            <li> One or the other might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> have since also added other things to my regimen that you might look at including</li>
            <li> I have since also added other things to my regimen that you might look at including</li>
            <li> i used folligen hair spray and it caused extreme scalp irritation.</li>
            <li> After about 5-6 weeks, I could see small, blond vellus hair beginning to grow around my current hairline.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Folligen did not help me regrow any hair, but it did soothe the itching extremely well.  </li>
            <li> One other point,</li>
            <li> (every other day at nigh, after application of rogaine).</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon mention of this product in a hair loss forum, and figured what the heck, with all the other money I have wasted through the years.     </li>
            <li> It is much less brittle than it used to be, much less frizzy, and feels noticeably thicker.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed that I shed much less hair when I take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used about half the bottle.</li>
            <li> My hair has continued to recede, but I expected that given that it takes 4 months usually for minoxidil to work.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of Folligen after noticing an excessive amount of hair fall in the shower for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, I&#x27;m not exactly sure how to get around</li>
            <li> I found some useful information on this link: [...]  </li>
            <li> This excessive shed was also causing quite a bit of itching and discomfort, probably from an inflamed scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But in the first two weeks of using this my hair loss seemed to increase :(</li>
            <li> A bit hard to press.</li>
            <li> If you try  this, I recommend that you determine to use it for at least a month.  </li>
            <li> I had seriously been considering just shaving my head and being done with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The recession appears to have slowed and may actually have stopped at this point, but it&#x27;s impossible to tell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I gave the Folligen five stars because it&#x27;s really not that bad to deal with.</li>
            <li> I should add that I did stop using Folligen for a period of time and noticed a dramatic change for the worse in the decreasing number and thickness of my hairs.  </li>
            <li> I used it all the way up, just because it was expensive.</li>
            <li> Its weird there are no directions or ingredients.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, it has turned some of my white t-shirts which I place over my pillow</li>
            <li> Folligen works but its depressing in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> I went through a bad time where not even this worked and the thinning returned along with the receding hairline.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I applied this spray it started irritation on my head which becomes painful after some minutes</li>
            <li> stinks!</li>
            <li> It helped me get rid of a really nasty burn scar from the oven</li>
            <li> an awful greenish-yellow in spots.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Product came with no directions.  Spray cap defective.  This product may be useful but with no directions and unable to administer there is no way to say if product meets what it claims.</li>
            <li> I am a 50+ woman who has  now used Folligen for over 5 years.  I had been struggling with thinning hair on the top back of my head, on both right and left side and a badly receding hairline. I had already been using Nioxin for a few years and had seen some improvement, but not enough.  Then I tried Folligen.  After several weeks using Folligen I noticed some new wispy growth.  This eventually turned darker and thicker and more hairs grew in.  Even my hairdresser noticed the amazing improvement.  My receding hairline disappeared and the thinning in top/back was no longer noticeable.  This worked for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went through a bad time where not even this worked and the thinning returned along with the receding hairline.  I was desperately trying to find a solution and a sympathetic hairdresser said, \\&quot;Does anyone in your family have to wear a wig?\\&quot;.  Hmmm... that was not a reassuring answer to my pleas for help.  After experimentation, I found that Invati hair products(Aveda) plus Folligen is exactly what my hair needed.  Yes, my happy hair has returned.  The receding hairline and balding/thinning spots are gone.  Evidently this does not work as well for everyone, but sometimes it works really well, as it has in my case.  I should add that I did stop using Folligen for a period of time and noticed a dramatic change for the worse in the decreasing number and thickness of my hairs.  If you try  this, I recommend that you determine to use it for at least a month.  If you see any new little hairs, then keep it up to see if they thicken and become what you want.  I don&#x27;t understand why Nioxin worked so great and then I had to change to Invati.  One or the other might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it .  Every other day I spray it  on my entire head by doing the following --  I part my hair front to back, first down the middle and do 3 or 4 quick squirts front to back and rub it in with my fingertips; then I make a new part about one inch away  from the one in the center and do the 3 squirts and rubbing with fingertips.  I continue making parts over my head (about 3 or 4 on the left and then on the right) I also do a part around the back of my head.  I be sure to treat the edge of my hairline and the top/back of my scalp (the areas that are prone to extra hair loss).  On the in-between days I treat just my (once receding) hairline and top/back of my scalp.  I have experimented with different spray bottles.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of product, so a spray bottle that sprays just a small amount of liquid is better than  one that wastes product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since also added other things to my regimen that you might look at including (1) make sure you get plenty of protein and healthy oils (such as olive oil).  Dieting can cause hair loss (2) check out tocotrienols such as tocosorb since studies show it helps hair growth, (3) massage your scalp lightly with your fingertips when washing your hair, 10 seconds in the front, 10 seconds in the middle section and 10 seconds in the back to stimulate hair growth, (4) minimize hair coloringcenter and do the 3 squirts and rubbing with fingertips.

            <li> I originally tried this spray as a hair-regrowth solution.  It worked moderately well (I could definitely see an improvement), but I decided it was too messy to use on a regular basis and what hair I did have left wasn&#x27;t worth the effort.  I did discover that it is very effective at reducing scars for small- to medium-sized wounds.  I would clean the wound with some alcohol, dab some neosporin (or equivalent), spray the padded part of a band-aid with the Folligen, and then stick on the band-aid.  It helped me get rid of a really nasty burn scar from the oven and now I use it regularly for any minor wounds.  I can definitely recommend this for anyone who is in the early stages of hair loss or anyone who wants to help reduce scarring in general.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman in my mid-30s experiencing genetically-linked thinning hair.  For the past two years especially, my hair had been so brittle that running my fingers through it would break strands, and my scalp was easily visible.  I had seriously been considering just shaving my head and being done with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had already been using Minoxidil (5% solution) alone for several years, with minimal results.  I have been using Folligen spray for 2 months now (once a day) in addition to Minoxidil, and I have noticed a marked improvement in my hair&#x27;s health.  It is much less brittle than it used to be, much less frizzy, and feels noticeably thicker.  I have also noticed that I shed much less hair when I take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution:  If you are blonde, this product will tinge your hair and scalp slightly green.  I have dark hair, and so it&#x27;s not so much of an issue for me.  Also, this product does have a distinct coppery odor when you first apply it that does go away once it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle, if used once a day, seems to last about 2 months.  All in all, this product has definitely been worth it for me!</li>
            <li> Hair loss has too parts, DHT accumulation and inflammation. This spray is soothing and proven by science to take care of the later problem.</li>
            <li> i used folligen hair spray and it caused extreme scalp irritation. I have used tricomin and the quality is better and does not cause irritation. cheaper is not always better. avoid folligen.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the suggestion of the girl at the spa who waxes my eyebrows, My eyebrows have become scanty looking and need alot of filling in , after a month of applying folligen with a q tip to my eyebrows, I am noticing a difference, I also spray it in my hair after showering and comb through, I even feel my hair is thicker and shinier</li>
            <li> This nay be a good product but I could not give it enough time to tell. It gave my blond hair a blue green cast and it smelled funky.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product about 2 months ago with low expectations. I am 50 y/o male with male pattern balding ---been using Minoxidil for years, which has slowed the rate of loss a great deal. I stumbled upon mention of this product in a hair loss forum, and figured what the heck, with all the other money I have wasted through the years.     I have been using the product once a day for about 2 months. After about 5-6 weeks, I could see small, blond vellus hair beginning to grow around my current hairline. A few weeks later, those hairs seem to be maturing into darker hair, and  I think I see some additional vellus hair beginning to grow as well.     It is no miracle cure, but I have to believe it works at least modestly well. If it only were to keep me from losing more hair over time, it would be worthwhile. However, I am a bit excited to actually see a little new growth (which my wife also noticed without prompting).     Might be worth a try, and good luck.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of Folligen after noticing an excessive amount of hair fall in the shower for a few weeks.  This excessive shed was also causing quite a bit of itching and discomfort, probably from an inflamed scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folligen did not help me regrow any hair, but it did soothe the itching extremely well.  Any time I had irritation or itching, I would spray a few squirts around my scalp, massage it in, and be treated to a cool, soothing end to the itching almost instantaneously.  If you have scalp irritation from something other than an open wound--such as wearing wigs--Folligen would be a great supplement to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are that besides relieving my itching, it didn&#x27;t really do anything else for me.  It also has a very strong coppery smell that is not pleasant (and is strong enough that other people will notice it), and the blue liquid is runny and will tinge your hair / scalp blue until washed off.  I have dark hair, so it wasn&#x27;t too obvious, but if you are blonde I imagine it would be very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get around the smell. It is so very strong and does not dissipate with a shampoo either. Since I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, I&#x27;m not exactly sure how to get around this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stinks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a different immitation Therapro follicle stimulator, and decided to try this. It did not work at all. May as well have been water. I really wonder what would be in the bottle if it were tested. I used it all the way up, just because it was expensive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works. It stains my hair blue and it doesn&#x27;t wash out. Blue stain only comes out when I re-color my hair. Wish it came in clear but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s even possible with a copper product.</li>
            <li> I have used about half the bottle. My bangs have tons of new growth all across the top of my forhed. I am going to strat spraying on whole head. Its weird there are no directions or ingredients.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very good. It helps to re-grow my hair and after about one month, it is thicker and my scalp has filled in. I use this stuff along with minoxidil and with a healthy scalp shampoo. I originally purchased this back in 2001 and the company has changed the formula a bit but it is much better. It is not as thick and has a less pungent smell and it does not discolor my scalp as much as with my first order also. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Seemed okay, just needed to cut bottom of inner straw so it wouldn&#x27;t get pressed against the bottle. A bit hard to press.</li>
            <li> Using the spray will make your hair grow 1.5 times faster and you will notice hair growing in the areas where it did not grow before.&lt;br /&gt;The cons of using this product are the blue tint the spray leaves on your scalp and the copper smell.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it. This is an honest review.</li>
            <li> My hair was getting thinner, and I was tired of wearing wigs mostly due to my own carelessness. My hair always grew long but it was not getting fuller.  So I bought this product to use 7 months ago in conjunction with Rogaine 5% foam and it works very well to increase hair growth/fullness and to stop hair loss.  I found better results with using the 5% solution compared to using the 2% Minoxidil.  When I use both together the results are amazing.  You have to stay with it for at least 3 months and it works best when used twice a day.  One other point, although the label says this is for men, women can use this as well.  I found some useful information on this link: [...]  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I started a regimen in June which included Lipogaine, emu oil, Folligen copper peptide spray and sometimes Regenepure DR and NT shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve since added generic finasteride to the mix and am currently using the Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo/Conditioner. I&#x27;ve also made the switch to generic minoxidil foam to save money and because it looks better in my hair than the Lipogaine did (I think I&#x27;m probably getting too much of it in my hair rather than my scalp, actually).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I started all these at or around the same time, it&#x27;s pretty difficult to determine what, if anything, is working. My hair has continued to recede, but I expected that given that it takes 4 months usually for minoxidil to work. The recession appears to have slowed and may actually have stopped at this point, but it&#x27;s impossible to tell. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve experienced any regrowth, but my hair does seem healthier. It could just be the volumizing effect of the minoxidil foam (which, once again, should probably be avoided as much as possible if you want it to work right -- I guess I&#x27;m just too vain!). And the Lipogaine shampoo definitely helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I gave the Folligen five stars because it&#x27;s really not that bad to deal with. Yes, it smells like copper, but only if you put a lot on (which I do now). I don&#x27;t like the smell, but it&#x27;s tolerable contrary to many of the reviews I read before purchasing it. And it sometimes runs down my face briefly. Worst of all, it has turned some of my white t-shirts which I place over my pillow an awful greenish-yellow in spots. I really don&#x27;t care about any of that. If it works, that&#x27;s all that matters to me. If I get a girlfriend, that may be a different matter. She probably won&#x27;t appreciate the smell and will tell me that she likes me just the way I am. Until the rest of my hair falls out and she leaves.</li>
            <li> I bought this as the kind of last option for my hair fall. Whenever I applied this spray it started irritation on my head which becomes painful after some minutes and you need to wash your head again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it after two or three times as the pain was very much&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s long term effect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from telogen effluvium and a large amount of my hair has fallen out. I&#x27;m using rogaine to try to promote regrowth, and I thought why not add this too. But in the first two weeks of using this my hair loss seemed to increase :( I&#x27;m going to save it for maybe when my hair loss has stabilized more, but for now I&#x27;m not impressed. The bottle came with no instructions for use so I&#x27;m not even sure if I&#x27;m using the product right (every other day at nigh, after application of rogaine).</li>
            <li> Folligen works but its depressing in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;After starting it I experienced tons of hair coming out which was obviously anxiety provoking. But afyer few days I started to notice tons of new hair shagtd coming on my head. But I cant say it thickened my hair. I am jusy crossing my fingers and continue to use it  but in moderatipn like twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;Iwill update the review acc to findings.</li>
