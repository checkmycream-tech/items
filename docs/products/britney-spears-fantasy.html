            <li>It smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>Bought \\&quot;Curious\\&quot; loved that...</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve fallen in love with it!</li>
            <li>I love combining the body lotion that came with it and the perfume!</li>
            <li>I tried some of this perfume since I liked \\&quot;Curious\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>a one of a kind scent.</li>
            <li>only downside of the Fantasy set is that the lipgloss (which smells delicious), doesn&#x27;t taste all that great - kind of plasticky.</li>
            <li>Kind of makes you think someone must have too much free time on his or her hands, huh?</li>
            <li>It is an interesting mix and it works well.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Many of them smelled like hairspray to me...</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments that I went out and bought the 3.3 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li>It is like nothing I have ever smelled before, and my husband likes this one better.  </li>
            <li>This smell is wonderful, I don&#x27;t like BS personally</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li>The cupcake-y scent was what attracted me the most, and it is not too overpowering,or too light!</li>
            <li>is fantastic!</li>
            <li>and it truly becomes better over time.</li>
            <li>sounds like it might be pretty good.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it if you like sweet fragrances!</li>
            <li>This is such a light and sweet scent; Your skin is pampered when it abosrbs this delicious perfume</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light and sweet scent, playful and sensual.</li>
            <li>I absolutly love it, and it made a great Christmas present for everyone I know.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not going to be too strong, I suggest sampling this.</li>
            <li>it was too sweet and overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It has a light sweet scent that lasts throughout the day!</li>
            <li>I used one quick squirt in the morning, and the scent lasted over a day!  </li>
            <li>It filled my room with</li>
            <li>Enjoy ~</li>
            <li>The bottle is beautiful, and I plan to keep it long after my perfume is out.</li>
            <li>If you like things that smell sweet and if you have a sweet tooth like I do, then you will love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>But Fantasy is unique.</li>
            <li>I \\&quot;sampled\\&quot; this in a local Dept., store, and really liked it alot!</li>
            <li>It has a sweet smell but doesn&#x27;t smell cheap at all.</li>
            <li>If you like something sweet</li>
            <li>Most of the perfumes out nowadays smell so much alike</li>
            <li>I had heard so much hype about Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s Lovely that I had to go smell it...</li>
            <li>I smelled most of the newer perfumes in fact, and they all had to really tart, overpowering smell.  </li>
            <li>Most scents do not truly satisfy me as I&#x27;m very picky.</li>
            <li>it fixated really well too, stays the whole day AND the package is so cute!</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly for people who enjoy a beautiful, feminine scent that will not weigh you down.</li>
            <li>But later, I smelled it again in a dept store and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>I first had a sniff in the Macy&#x27;s department and I just had to have it!  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>this is pretty cool...</li>
            <li>Fantasy is my favorite fragrance so far.</li>
            <li>and I was very taken by it because it was so unique...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saving up for it right now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasantly sweet and absolutely yummy.</li>
            <li>It feels like a warm scent that lasts a long time but never overpowers.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, it&#x27;s not to heavy or overbearing and smells great all day long!</li>
            <li>bottle is absolutely gorgeous with the little jewels on it.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a fan of Brit, but i didn&#x27;t like the first fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this as a sample.  </li>
            <li>I think you have to remember,  Brittany didn&#x27;t actually create this perfume she APPROVED it after smelling many sample scents.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>First of all the bottle is soooo girly and its covered in Swarovski crystals.</li>
            <li>It is a very \\&quot;girly\\&quot;,ultra-feminine perfume.....perfect for teens, or Grandmas!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend went krazy and that was a first.</li>
            <li>The base note of vanilla lingers throughout making FANTASY a truly delicious classic in the making - Angel light!!</li>
            <li>It is an amazingly soft, sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t heavy at all and continously keeps you feeling luscious, lovely and lightly sweet.</li>
            <li>This fragrance has a very upbeat, feminine smell, without being overbering.  </li>
            <li>i have the whole set...</li>
            <li>I myself am very picky about which fragrances that I like to try.</li>
            <li>After enjoying Curious and smelling Fantasy in a magazine ad, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a high end job interview, but for a night on the town or to sweeten up your day, I say try it out!</li>
            <li>Long story short, if you liked Curious, you will LOVE this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique without being too strong and it seems to be lasting long.</li>
            <li>The scent really lasts a long time and the pink bottle it comes in is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>This will be my new scent for a lonnnnnnngggggg time</li>
            <li>but then she came out with this new one \\&quot;Fantasy\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>I first saw this in a commercial and I thought hmmm...</li>
            <li>After wearing it for a few hours I went back and purchased my own early Christmas present!</li>
            <li>I loved this fragrance ever since I sampled it in the mall by random chance.</li>
            <li>Obviously, liking the smell of a purfume is pure personal preference, so I wouldn&#x27;t advise anyone to just buy one off the internet without actually smelling it first.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t like her first perfume Curious.</li>
            <li>Try to put the name Brittany Spears aside and give this a chance, Apparently reviewer Nicholas couldn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>I really like Curious, and my husband does too.  </li>
            <li>What I really like about it is that it does not really have any alcohol smell, even when being sprayed.  A+++</li>
            <li>I felt a little silly when buying this because I am 24 years old, but man am I glad I did!!</li>
            <li>My Husband later surprised me with a bottle, and  I use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>First off,I am not a huge fan of Britney Spears</li>

            <li> First off,I am not a huge fan of Britney Spears</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing this on the [...] website &amp; counting down the days until my holiday to New York - the fact that it has chocolate essence made me want it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get tired of very powerful bland smelling scents.</li>
            <li> I hate contribute to her financially, but this perfume (and midnight fantasy) is amazing, and I don&#x27;t even consider myself a \\&quot;perfume person\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> A major plus of this perfume is the lasting time--it seriously lasts all day, unlike the Paris Hilton perfumes, which linger only a couple hours tops.</li>
            <li> Naturally, when this came out I wanted to at least smell it.  </li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t like Curious.</li>
            <li> are a few of the notes and I get compliments on it constantly</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pink with crystals all around, and the box that wraps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers say that it smells trashy</li>
            <li> admit I was a little wary - I suffer from migraines so can&#x27;t wear a lot of my favourites; including Angel by Thierry Mugler.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend goes crazy every time I wear Fantasy.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is by far my favorite fragrance.  I also like Curve Crush, which is very different from this.  Obviously, liking the smell of a purfume is pure personal preference, so I wouldn&#x27;t advise anyone to just buy one off the internet without actually smelling it first.  This fragrance has a very upbeat, feminine smell, without being overbering.  On another note, why would someone who doesn&#x27;t like this product and probably never even smelled it, write a review for it?  Kind of makes you think someone must have too much free time on his or her hands, huh?</li>
            <li> My boyfriend goes crazy every time I wear Fantasy.  He will start to kiss my neck and tells me that this is the best thing Brittney has ever made and now believes that she is good for somthing. &lt;br /&gt; This will be my new scent for a lonnnnnnngggggg time</li>
            <li> This perfume should be worn by ALL women, IT is just BREATHTAKING! I absolutly love it, and it made a great Christmas present for everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I bought this scent today after trying it on several days ago. I bought a fragrance set that has a terry cloth tote,a makeup set, the body souffle and the perfume. I&#x27;ve fallen in love with it! It smells absolutely delicious. It filled my room with it&#x27;s wonderful scent. It&#x27;s unique without being too strong and it seems to be lasting long. The bottle is beautiful, and I plan to keep it long after my perfume is out. I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll buy this perfume once I run out. If you like something sweet that&#x27;s not going to be too strong, I suggest sampling this. A delicious,unique, and beautiful selection!</li>
            <li> First off,I am not a huge fan of Britney Spears and I didn&#x27;t like her first perfume Curious.But Fantasy is unique.Most of the perfumes out nowadays smell so much alike but this one stands out.It smells like vanilla cupcakes laced with a fruity and creamy musk scent. It is an interesting mix and it works well.The scent really lasts a long time and the pink bottle it comes in is gorgeous.I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I tried some of this perfume since I liked \\&quot;Curious\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my chemistry but the stuff smells like Electric Youth from the 80&#x27;s after wearing it awhile. It&#x27;s a no go for me.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t like Curious. it was too sweet and overwhelming. i&#x27;m a fan of Brit, but i didn&#x27;t like the first fragrance.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;but with FANTASY, oh my goodness it&#x27;s wonderful! i have the whole set... the perfume, the souffle, and the lipgloss! my boyfriend loves it on me, too &#x3D;) it a one of a kind scent. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;the only downside of the Fantasy set is that the lipgloss (which smells delicious), doesn&#x27;t taste all that great - kind of plasticky. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ENJOY!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually bought this perfume yet, but i got a sample at the store.  I used one quick squirt in the morning, and the scent lasted over a day!  It smells amazing!  I love it. I&#x27;m saving up for it right now.</li>
            <li> I hate Britney Spears, but boy does she make great fragrances.  I hate contribute to her financially, but this perfume (and midnight fantasy) is amazing, and I don&#x27;t even consider myself a \\&quot;perfume person\\&quot;.  If you like things that smell sweet and if you have a sweet tooth like I do, then you will love this stuff.  The scent last quite a while too.</li>
            <li> I had heard so much hype about Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s Lovely that I had to go smell it...well, I did, and it was too musky for me.  I smelled most of the newer perfumes in fact, and they all had to really tart, overpowering smell.  Many of them smelled like hairspray to me...then I smelled Fantasy.  I immediately put some on and went on with my shopping, but I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it! It is an amazingly soft, sweet smell.  It feels like a warm scent that lasts a long time but never overpowers. After wearing it for a few hours I went back and purchased my own early Christmas present!</li>
            <li> Bought \\&quot;Curious\\&quot; loved that...but then she came out with this new one \\&quot;Fantasy\\&quot;...I first saw this in a commercial and I thought hmmm... sounds like it might be pretty good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I sampled it at my local department store...sprayed it on my wrist...and I was very taken by it because it was so unique...it was like this cupcake/flower combo thing...I was like this is pretty cool...So I bought it and I am impressed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bottle is absolutely gorgeous with the little jewels on it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who likes to smell like desserts.</li>
            <li> I first tried this as a sample.  I received so many compliments that I went out and bought the 3.3 oz bottle.  This perfume smells so wonderful.  It lasts all day!  I love it!!!! I think you have to remember,  Brittany didn&#x27;t actually create this perfume she APPROVED it after smelling many sample scents.  Try to put the name Brittany Spears aside and give this a chance, Apparently reviewer Nicholas couldn&#x27;t do that. ;)</li>
            <li> I really like Curious, and my husband does too.  Naturally, when this came out I wanted to at least smell it.  Long story short, if you liked Curious, you will LOVE this fragrance.  It is like nothing I have ever smelled before, and my husband likes this one better.  What I really like about it is that it does not really have any alcohol smell, even when being sprayed.  A+++</li>
            <li> This smell is wonderful, I don&#x27;t like BS personally but I love the perfume!! Kinda vanilla smelling, and it lasts a while! I have gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I myself am very picky about which fragrances that I like to try. I get tired of very powerful bland smelling scents. After enjoying Curious and smelling Fantasy in a magazine ad, I decided to try it. It&#x27;s a very light and sweet scent, playful and sensual. I would recommend it if you like sweet fragrances! I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers say that it smells trashy but I disagree with that. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a high end job interview, but for a night on the town or to sweeten up your day, I say try it out!</li>
            <li> I felt a little silly when buying this because I am 24 years old, but man am I glad I did!! First of all the bottle is soooo girly and its covered in Swarovski crystals. It smells awesome, kiwi, musk, jasmine, woods,and cupcakes are a few of the notes and I get compliments on it constantly, I recommend this to all ages!</li>
            <li> I \\&quot;sampled\\&quot; this in a local Dept., store, and really liked it alot! My Husband later surprised me with a bottle, and  I use it on a regular basis. The cupcake-y scent was what attracted me the most, and it is not too overpowering,or too light! It is a very \\&quot;girly\\&quot;,ultra-feminine perfume.....perfect for teens, or Grandmas!</li>
            <li> I actually initially did not like this fragrance after smelling it in a magazine ad. But later, I smelled it again in a dept store and fell in love with it! A major plus of this perfume is the lasting time--it seriously lasts all day, unlike the Paris Hilton perfumes, which linger only a couple hours tops. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on it during class. It&#x27;s pleasantly sweet and absolutely yummy.</li>
            <li> I may not like Britney Spears but this perfume of hers is fantastic! I first had a sniff in the Macy&#x27;s department and I just had to have it!  My bf got mr the 3 piece set for christmas and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since! It has a light sweet scent that lasts throughout the day! I love combining the body lotion that came with it and the perfume! The lip gloss is great too!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best women perfume out there. &lt;br /&gt;It smells awesome.It has a sweet smell but doesn&#x27;t smell cheap at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing this on the [...] website &amp; counting down the days until my holiday to New York - the fact that it has chocolate essence made me want it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I was a little wary - I suffer from migraines so can&#x27;t wear a lot of my favourites; including Angel by Thierry Mugler. Not so with FANTASY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This opens with the sweetness of chocolate and cupcake, before settling with fruity scents of lychee, quince and kiwi. The base note of vanilla lingers throughout making FANTASY a truly delicious classic in the making - Angel light!! (I bought the 100ml bottle).</li>
            <li> I love this scent, it&#x27;s not to heavy or overbearing and smells great all day long!</li>
            <li> Fantasy is my favorite fragrance so far. I loved this fragrance ever since I sampled it in the mall by random chance. My boyfriend went krazy and that was a first. I would spend my last for a bottle. That&#x27;s how good it smells.</li>
            <li> Most scents do not truly satisfy me as I&#x27;m very picky. This was totally opposite! This is such a light and sweet scent; Your skin is pampered when it abosrbs this delicious perfume and it truly becomes better over time. It isn&#x27;t heavy at all and continously keeps you feeling luscious, lovely and lightly sweet. I recommend it highly for people who enjoy a beautiful, feminine scent that will not weigh you down. Enjoy ~</li>
            <li> this is the best perfume I,ve ever used! the smell is delicious, it smelled really good on my skin. it fixated really well too, stays the whole day AND the package is so cute! it&#x27;s pink with crystals all around, and the box that wraps it is all colorful, beautiful! I would definetly buy it again!</li>
