            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The lamp works perfectly: all my fingers fit in it with room to spread them out and the timer makes it so easy.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute BEST purchase I think I have ever made on Amazon yet.</li>
            <li>That said, the timer control and readout are all facing away from you when you do your own nails.  </li>
            <li>easy to use!</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use!</li>

            <li>Glad I purchased the UV Cure Light.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY Light I will ever use.... Amazing!!</li>
            <li>So easy to use and very quick</li>
            <li>Our old one broke and this one was the exact replacement and works great.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll worth the money!</li>
            <li>This machine is worth buying !</li>
            <li>So the investment in purchasing my own UV/LED lamp totally makes the cost worth it.</li>
            <li>So worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>My nail salon uses this exact model and brand.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Makes the learning curve for doing my own nails WAY less</li>
            <li>I love how I can do my nails under 5 minutes (30 seconds per coat to dry) and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Fast well made machine.</li>
            <li>This is the same light my salon was using.</li>
            <li>, although not the primary user of this product, only have one gripe.  </li>
            <li>stay a little away from the sides also make sure before you cure them</li>
            <li>It is not hard to paint your nails</li>
            <li>price is pretty steep, but I bought it for $180 here while Walmart sold the same one for $240.</li>
            <li>While OPI one is a bit more expensive than others on the market, the LED bulbs, timers and ability of it rise to do a pedicure, make it worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>I never did my own nails because I would mess them up before they dried.</li>
            <li>I have done my nails a few times now and that alone has paid this baby off in full.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the same lamp that the ladies in the salon I used to frequent use, so I knew how it worked when I got</li>
            <li>I received it as stated and that was not very long.</li>

            <li> Just like at the Salon.  Cures nails perfectly with OPI gel nail polish.  Solidly built and&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use! We&#x27;ll worth the money!</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected, and was packed well and works well.</li>
            <li> This Lamp is expensive but worth it.  You can truly cure your nails in 30-45 Sec.  I have tried several others and was not satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I never did my own nails because I would mess them up before they dried. I love how I can do my nails under 5 minutes (30 seconds per coat to dry) and ready to go.  Plus lasts for weeks without chipping.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this lamp. The manicures I give myself at home last as long as the gel manicures I get at the salon. Salon manicures cost about $35 in my area. I only need to give myself 4 manicures and the lamp pays for itself! The lamp works perfectly: all my fingers fit in it with room to spread them out and the timer makes it so easy. I love it!</li>
            <li> I  love going to the salon for no chip manicures but it gets expensive. So the investment in purchasing my own UV/LED lamp totally makes the cost worth it. While OPI one is a bit more expensive than others on the market, the LED bulbs, timers and ability of it rise to do a pedicure, make it worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Love that it has &amp;#34;kick-stands&amp;#34; for doing toes and there is a side compotent to rest your thumb.</li>
            <li> Perfect every time. Just 30 seconds each time and your are done. I would pay $35 in my area also that is why I bought after 4 times it is payed four. As one of the reviews wrote I agree.  It is not hard to paint your nails just dont get it on your cuticles stay a little away from the sides also make sure before you cure them it is not on your skin. Fast well made machine. Does the job with the Opi  gel polish stays on.</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great product! Great price! Local beauty supply cannot get this at this price.</li>
            <li> Best product for the money!  So worth it.</li>
            <li> Love it.. Well worth the money</li>
            <li> I use this lamp private but I&#x27;m happy that I got this one! So easy to use and very quick you have beautiful nails on hands and feet!</li>
            <li> Our old one broke and this one was the exact replacement and works great. Would buy this product again if needed.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute BEST purchase I think I have ever made on Amazon yet. I have done my nails a few times now and that alone has paid this baby off in full. My nails are stronger, &amp; my manicures last longer than when I was using the smaller, 4 finger LED lights you can find at say Ulta or Target. This is the same light my salon was using. Well worth the price and now I even gel my toes, so my pedicures are lasting longer.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use! I&#x27;ve used it to speed up drying time for nail polish and curing a variety of &amp;#34;light cured&amp;#34; gels and shellacs. This is the ONLY Light I will ever use.... Amazing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lamp for a couple months now and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the same lamp that the ladies in the salon I used to frequent use, so I knew how it worked when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;Makes the learning curve for doing my own nails WAY less intense.&lt;br /&gt;The price is pretty steep, but I bought it for $180 here while Walmart sold the same one for $240. Not too shabby.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it? Yes.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied.  I love it.  I received it as stated and that was not very long.</li>
            <li> My nail salon uses this exact model and brand. 100% perfect!</li>
            <li> This machine is worth buying ! I love it !!!  It works well with all brands of polishes and does the work literally in 30 seconds..  I recommend it ! Don&#x27;t even think about it twice it&#x27;s simply the best I love my nails &amp;#60;3 also it came in on time soo no need to worry about anything 5 big stars for this lamp and service</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife as an anniversary present.  She loves it.  It seems to do the job exactly as expected.  She loves that she can also do her feet with the little legs that prop it up.  Before purchasing I asked on Amazon if this product was plastic or metal.  Everyone said it was a heavy plastic.  That almost turned me off but I really felt like this was as good as it was going to get quality wise.  Turns out the housing it metal after all.  I don&#x27;t know why people thought otherwise.  It is very solidly built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, although not the primary user of this product, only have one gripe.  It was obviously built for salon use, that is someone else doing your nails.  That said, the timer control and readout are all facing away from you when you do your own nails.  Not a super big deal, you just have to read it all upside down.  I would probably get irritated at that if i used it every week.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased the UV Cure Light.  Very easy to use and a great product!</li>
