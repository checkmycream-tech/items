            <li>They seem to hold great on the top denture, but the bottom is the one that is always popping off.</li>

            <li>but that&#x27;s good enough!  </li>
            <li>many thanks</li>
            <li>I tried them for the first time yesterday and could feel the difference in my bite right away, and not for the better.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Super Poligrip Denture Adhesive Strips for about 3 years.  </li>
            <li>I have no gripes with Super Poligrip.</li>
            <li>After using Super Poligrip Adhensive Strips for many months, I have decided that I will continue to use this product.to secure my dentures, upper and lower.</li>
            <li>I have found these useful for as a cushioning agent.</li>
            <li>Great Hold without the oozing, gooey mess of paste!</li>
            <li>They hold nice and tight, and are so comfortable......</li>
            <li>I really like Poligrip strips because it is the only adhesive I&#x27;ve found that holds cleanly and securely without all the goop!</li>
            <li>These strips are easy to use and prevent chafing of soft tissue/gums.</li>
            <li>No goo, no mess, in and out easily, lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I have used them for years like very much.</li>
            <li>The exact product that my mother needs at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The product is okay the same as I coulde have gotten at the store</li>
            <li>but so much easier to use...!  </li>
            <li>find this ideal for my upper denture as the strip holds quite firm thru the day.</li>
            <li>To secure my upper denture I take one strip and cut it into 3 smaller strips; and I apply 1 each at the top and 1 each on each side.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove after daily use.</li>
            <li>they are so easy to put in just the right place where my lower plate is loose, so I no longer get food boulders under my plate.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast ship...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving Poligrip strips a try!</li>
            <li>This is so much easier than the cream for my husband to put his teeth in.  </li>
            <li>Holds fast for maybe 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>Very dissappointed.  </li>
            <li>For the price i expected a lot more.</li>
            <li>This really works for me.</li>
            <li>but if you want a product that REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li>They work very well when applied correctly.  </li>
            <li>Not so good for uppers, at least not for me.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to polident original...</li>
            <li>You can very easy carry a few strips in your wallet ....</li>
            <li>At night rinse mouth with warm water and the little bit of glue left in my mouth using a tooth brush ,and it comes right out.</li>
            <li>Hope Poligrip are bringing out a new lot!</li>
            <li>I have used the poligrip strips many times in the past and it just happens to be a product i like very much.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them to all denture wearers.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to denture wearers.</li>
            <li>Just the price, I find it a bit too high.</li>
            <li>The poligrip powder which they have stopped making temporarily, I like the best mainly because nothing is left behind on my gums when i remove it, but it only holds for one meal as well.</li>
            <li>normally cut 2 strips in 4 halves and put it on all four sides of the denture.</li>
            <li>There are only 40 in each box, thats 4 days worth.</li>
            <li>They are a good product for people with false teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very reliable, strong, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Not that easy to use; the strips leave a residue on the roof of your mouth; and the denture held for about 10 minutes before dropping down.  </li>
            <li>Mom is getting old (she likes to say \\&quot;Older than dirt\\&quot;) and the bone has receded (normal) in her jaw.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no gooy mess.</li>
            <li>First of all I cut these strips in half and as long as you wet them before applying and push your denture tight like your dentist would they work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This is the only denture adhesive product that you can carry in your wallet, and for me, it works better than any other product.</li>
            <li>This was the first denture adhesive that I tried that actually lived up to my standards.  </li>
            <li>I do not usually write reviews, but I felt I had to on this product.</li>
            <li>there IS goo, the cushion effect is lovely,  wears out too soon but worth the extra trouble of replacing it.........perfect for me!!</li>
            <li>It sure beats the mess with tube adhesives and seem to last longer throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s never any chance of applying too much because the strips are always the same size.</li>
            <li>They boast &#x27;no messy ooze&#x27; on the package front...</li>
            <li>My mother who wears dentures loves this product as it creates soft cushiony beds for her gums within the dentures.</li>
            <li>This is by far the yuckiest stuff I have seen.</li>
            <li>91 yrs young  mother-in-law  </li>
            <li>There is still some adhesive that requires a little sticky residue to clean.</li>
            <li>As it says on the box, &#x27;there&#x27;s no mess, no ooze&#x27;.</li>
            <li>getting use to wearing partial dentures this product surely beats any other adhesive for dentures!</li>
            <li>Husband had such high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the thing I like about this is that they are easily hidden in a pocket, so I can be out in public and if my denture pops loose, go to the bathroom and easily replace the adhesive without having to carry around a thing of powder or the glue adhesive.</li>
            <li>I tried the paste and the wafers from several manufacturers and none held as firmly as the Super Poligrip Strips.  </li>
            <li>Very little mess and easy to remove.</li>

            <li> normally cut 2 strips in 4 halves and put it on all four sides of the denture.</li>
            <li> There are only 40 in each box, thats 4 days worth.</li>
            <li> They are a good product for people with false teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very reliable, strong, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Not that easy to use; the strips leave a residue on the roof of your mouth; and the denture held for about 10 minutes before dropping down.  </li>
            <li> Mom is getting old (she likes to say \\&quot;Older than dirt\\&quot;) and the bone has receded (normal) in her jaw.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no gooy mess.</li>
            <li> First of all I cut these strips in half and as long as you wet them before applying and push your denture tight like your dentist would they work perfectly.  </li>
            <li> This is the only denture adhesive product that you can carry in your wallet, and for me, it works better than any other product.</li>
            <li> This was the first denture adhesive that I tried that actually lived up to my standards.  </li>
            <li> I do not usually write reviews, but I felt I had to on this product.</li>
            <li> there IS goo, the cushion effect is lovely,  wears out too soon but worth the extra trouble of replacing it.........perfect for me!!</li>
            <li> It sure beats the mess with tube adhesives and seem to last longer throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s never any chance of applying too much because the strips are always the same size.</li>
            <li> They boast &#x27;no messy ooze&#x27; on the package front...</li>
            <li> My mother who wears dentures loves this product as it creates soft cushiony beds for her gums within the dentures.</li>
            <li> This is by far the yuckiest stuff I have seen.</li>
            <li> 91 yrs young  mother-in-law  </li>
            <li> There is still some adhesive that requires a little sticky residue to clean.</li>
            <li> As it says on the box, &#x27;there&#x27;s no mess, no ooze&#x27;.</li>
            <li> getting use to wearing partial dentures this product surely beats any other adhesive for dentures!</li>
            <li> Husband had such high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the thing I like about this is that they are easily hidden in a pocket, so I can be out in public and if my denture pops loose, go to the bathroom and easily replace the adhesive without having to carry around a thing of powder or the glue adhesive.</li>
            <li> I tried the paste and the wafers from several manufacturers and none held as firmly as the Super Poligrip Strips.  </li>
            <li> Very little mess and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I use less than half a strip for each side of my lower partial and can confidently enjoy a meal out.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous pastes and powders and none last long or give me the hold I prefer.</li>
            <li> these strips are amazing, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to find them in the brick-and-mortar stores.  </li>
            <li> The gel kinda, rips apart my gums when I try to remove it, yet can typically hold all day and that includes at least eating one full meal without it falling apart.</li>
            <li> We no longer have to run to the dentist for a little grind which never seems to take care of the on and off problem that happens even when soft liners have been installed.</li>
            <li> They do say no messy cream but nothing about heavy goo.  </li>
            <li> Applying these strips too 3x as long as applying powder and was 99% neater in the bathroom and on my fingers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty poor situation when you have to buy from the US something as simple as denture adhesive strips.  </li>
            <li> The feel of my denture being a slight bit lower threw off my bite enough for me to remove them and go back to a powder.</li>
            <li> your product was not displayed by other such products....happened to see it with whitening products....</li>
            <li> I have been using poligrip strips for a very long period of time.  </li>
            <li> Anyone with a lower denture or as in my case a lower partial denture knows that it can be difficult to get a secure bond.</li>
            <li> It solved the problem of loose dentures for my elderly mother in law..</li>
            <li> The upper denture is in place all day and at the end of the day I have to apply a little force to pry it loose.</li>
            <li> There is much less residue left on the roof of my mouth at the end of the day that I have to scrape off than with other product.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before as I have a partial.</li>
            <li> The reason I ordered them is because I was having trouble finding them in the local stores.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I just wet the plate, trim the pack the strips come in and press them on to the plate.  </li>
            <li> The center strip was firmly planted on the back end of the roof of my mouth and did not want to budge.</li>
            <li> With other adhesives I would be halfway through the meal and the denture would begin popping up.</li>
            <li> I recommend them to anyone who is not completely satisfied with their current denture adhesive.</li>
            <li> I agree with one of the other reviewers, this product is a horror to remove.</li>
            <li> I have used other adhesive products for my dentures, but not to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> The poligrip comfort seal strips is all he ever uses, none of the other products work for Dad.</li>
            <li> Was a disgusting mess to try to clean from your mouth, especially if you have a high gag reflex...</li>
            <li> The little strips are hard to use, they stick to your fingers and they only last a few hours.</li>
            <li> I cut the strips in half and apply them to these areas then follow up with fixodent.  </li>
            <li> but because of the mess I will not these again.</li>
            <li> By cutting the strips you can get the product to go exactly where needed.</li>
            <li> strips don&#x27;t hold long enough and are uncomfortable in my mouth compared with poligrip paste in tube.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who tries this will never use anything else again!!!  </li>
            <li> just awful - did not try it long enough - but it is way too gummy and way too hard to remove - leaves way to much goo in mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth the time and effort!!</li>
            <li> So, as usual, Amazon have come to the rescue.  </li>
            <li> Extremely hard to remove strips from film packaging .&lt;br</li>
            <li> they just hold my dentures in place, without that icky feeling that I get from a paste.  </li>
            <li> time consuming &amp; frustrating if fingernails are close .</li>
            <li> I can not get strip from wrapping without using scissors to remove strip thereby making it too difficult for morning usage.</li>
            <li> Residue is difficult to remove,from dentures.  </li>
            <li> They could get a bit expensive for some</li>
            <li> Had used poligrip for years, but this was just so disappointing.  </li>
            <li> And with Fixodent and pollygrip I went crazy y&#x3D;trying to get all the glue out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> No worrying about excess goo oozing out or bad taste.</li>
            <li> Getting food caught under your denture can be painful and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> disappointed since I thought this product would be easier to carry with me</li>
            <li> This grips alright and leaves this stringy crap in your mouth that you have to work on at getting out!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The product is okay the same as I coulde have gotten at the store but I said to send another supply is 6 months but I want to canel that order and don&#x27;t know how to do it.  Please help me.</li>
            <li> My husband has tried so many products that have failed for one reason or another, but not the strips. They hold nice and tight, and are so comfortable......</li>
            <li> I use this product every day and I&#x27;m very happy with it .I tried others and did not like them so I use it always every day</li>
            <li> Mom is getting old (she likes to say \\&quot;Older than dirt\\&quot;) and the bone has receded (normal) in her jaw. She was always having fit problems and came up with sore spots. I cut the strips in half and apply them to these areas then follow up with fixodent.  We no longer have to run to the dentist for a little grind which never seems to take care of the on and off problem that happens even when soft liners have been installed. The Poligrip strips are great for this type of problem even though they dissolve to fast.</li>
            <li> Excellent hold on partials. This is a money-saving deal. Easy to use and long-lasting. Easy to remove after daily use.</li>
            <li> I have been using poligrip strips for a very long period of time.  When I went to our local pharmacy today I was told they are no longer in stock - and, upon investigation on the interenet. I discover they don&#x27;t seem to be making them any more!!  WHY???  So, as usual, Amazon have come to the rescue.  Thank you.  The strips are great - no mess from \\&quot;gooey\\&quot; tubes of fixitive!!  Hope Poligrip are bringing out a new lot!</li>
            <li> Found Poligrip Strips...accidentally....when unsatisfied by product I was using...which had to be cut to size each day.the problem was that at Walgreens and CVS your product was not displayed by other such products....happened to see it with whitening products....I was delighted!!!  It is more expensive...but so much easier to use...!  I wear both uppers and lowers..this product is perfect for me.  Thank you!  Love,c.  Have to agree with others...there IS goo, the cushion effect is lovely,  wears out too soon but worth the extra trouble of replacing it.........perfect for me!!</li>
            <li> I have lower partials, and these strips do a better job than anything else. They hold good and they stop the sore spots that creams don&#x27;t prevent. Uppers? Not so good for uppers, at least not for me.    Unfortunately, they cost more than they should.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast ship...Poligrip has the best hold...</li>
            <li> strips don&#x27;t hold long enough and are uncomfortable in my mouth compared with poligrip paste in tube.  will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have used them for years like very much.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly but when I removed my denture there was more goo than had I used the cream.  They do say no messy cream but nothing about heavy goo.  It is easy to use and holds but because of the mess I will not these again.</li>
            <li> buy a lot of these, great</li>
            <li> Anyone with a lower denture or as in my case a lower partial denture knows that it can be difficult to get a secure bond. I have tried numerous pastes and powders and none last long or give me the hold I prefer. These strips are perfect. I use less than half a strip for each side of my lower partial and can confidently enjoy a meal out. With other adhesives I would be halfway through the meal and the denture would begin popping up. Getting food caught under your denture can be painful and embarrassing. I highly recommend giving Poligrip strips a try!</li>
            <li> They are a good product for people with false teeth.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  The only problem I have found is that by evening they are starting to let go of my dentures.  Otherwise they are very useful.</li>
            <li> I really like Poligrip strips because it is the only adhesive I&#x27;ve found that holds cleanly and securely without all the goop! There&#x27;s never any chance of applying too much because the strips are always the same size. Great product!</li>
            <li> My mother says it holds great.  She had lost weight and her dentures didn&#x27;t stay in good but this sure held them in for her.</li>
            <li> Great product I have used for years.  It is gummy or gooey like most denture adhesives. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not this product is no longer available in Australia.  It&#x27;s a pretty poor situation when you have to buy from the US something as simple as denture adhesive strips.  These are great (or so my brother tells me) no taste minimum mucking about putting them in and hours of holding power.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before as I have a partial. By cutting the strips you can get the product to go exactly where needed. Very little mess and easy to remove. At Walgreen&#x27;s they are hit and miss as when they have them. I am tempted to put this product on subscribe and save, for the extra savings I would get through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely one to leave on the grocery store shelf!  They boast &#x27;no messy ooze&#x27; on the package front...it should state &#x27;try not to puke when removing the residue&#x27; left on the roof of your mouth.  Was a disgusting mess to try to clean from your mouth, especially if you have a high gag reflex...Move on to another product...SeaBond is a much better alternative!!</li>
            <li> This is so much easier than the cream for my husband to put his teeth in.  He has never been so happy about eating now that he has these strips.</li>
            <li> I can not get strip from wrapping without using scissors to remove strip thereby making it too difficult for morning usage.</li>
            <li> these strips are amazing, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to find them in the brick-and-mortar stores.  they do not have any cloth or paper in them, so they do not bunch up or wrinkle.  they just hold my dentures in place, without that icky feeling that I get from a paste.  I love these strips!  they are so easy to put in just the right place where my lower plate is loose, so I no longer get food boulders under my plate.  can&#x27;t say enough good things</li>
            <li> Product does not do as advertised.  Holds fast for maybe 2 hours.  Residue is difficult to remove,from dentures.  Also leaves residue inside your mouth, even more difficult to remove the residue.  Very dissappointed.  Do not buy, move on.  Not worth the time and effort!!</li>
            <li> Am familiar with product - satisfactory - would recommend</li>
            <li> I have been using Poligrip Strips ever since they came out on the market,.  It sure beats the mess with tube adhesives and seem to last longer throughout the day.  The reason I ordered them is because I was having trouble finding them in the local stores.  I would highly recommend them to all denture wearers.</li>
            <li> glad to be able to get this through Amazon.  My pharmacy does not carry this product.  This is the only denture adhesive product that you can carry in your wallet, and for me, it works better than any other product.</li>
            <li> Good and very handy to keep in your wallet just in case.  Lots more convenient to keep handy when out of the house than a tube of adhesive.</li>
            <li> find this ideal for my upper denture as the strip holds quite firm thru the day. normally cut 2 strips in 4 halves and put it on all four sides of the denture.</li>
            <li> This helps keep dentures in place without the glue like stuff.  I would highly recommend this product to denture wearers.</li>
            <li> My mother who wears dentures loves this product as it creates soft cushiony beds for her gums within the dentures.</li>
            <li> This is the only denture adhesive my husband will use. It&#x27;s very reliable, strong, and long lasting. No worrying about excess goo oozing out or bad taste.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Super Poligrip Denture Adhesive Strips for about 3 years.  This was the first denture adhesive that I tried that actually lived up to my standards.  It is the best holding denture adhesive That I have encountered.  I tried the paste and the wafers from several manufacturers and none held as firmly as the Super Poligrip Strips.  I can actually eat corn on the cob or an apple with confidence that my dentures will hold in place.  I recommend them to anyone who is not completely satisfied with their current denture adhesive.</li>
            <li> I agree with one of the other reviewers, this product is a horror to remove. I tried them for the first time yesterday and could feel the difference in my bite right away, and not for the better. The feel of my denture being a slight bit lower threw off my bite enough for me to remove them and go back to a powder. The fun began at this point! The center strip was firmly planted on the back end of the roof of my mouth and did not want to budge. Several swirls of mouthwash and a toothbrush finally freed it enough to be removed. These strips stuck to everything except my mouth(I know what I said about the roof of my mouth but the denture was not stuck to the strip), and I followed the instructions to the letter. The two side strips stayed on the denture and came off easily the third didn&#x27;t stick to the denture at all. Why Poligrip removed their powder from the market is a mystery to me as it was the only product that worked 100% of the time with no removal issues. This package I bought is currently in the barrel where it will stay until the next trash pickup! Applying these strips too 3x as long as applying powder and was 99% neater in the bathroom and on my fingers.</li>
            <li> getting use to wearing partial dentures this product surely beats any other adhesive for dentures! Easy to use, no gooy mess. Just the price, I find it a bit too high.</li>
            <li> This grips alright and leaves this stringy crap in your mouth that you have to work on at getting out! This is by far the yuckiest stuff I have seen. If you don&#x27;t mind stretchy gunk that stretches further than a glue would, and you don&#x27;t mind chiseling it off your gums this is for you !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am so happy I can order this on Amozon.  The best I found that works for me and a lot of places just don&#x27;t have it.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I have found these useful for as a cushioning agent. if you have a rough edge on the denture or have sensitive gums these provide comfort.</li>
            <li> Husband had such high hopes for this product.  Had used poligrip for years, but this was just so disappointing.  Not that easy to use; the strips leave a residue on the roof of your mouth; and the denture held for about 10 minutes before dropping down.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am in transition of having my dentures attached to the gums and the Poligrip helps hold them in place in the meantime.</li>
            <li> Works great ! And without the mouth full of paste and goo. You can very easy carry a few strips in your wallet .... just in case.</li>
            <li> they are making them thinner and I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Love Subscribe and Save!  This is a great savings and a great convenience since we are getting these for others, saves us time!</li>
            <li> just awful - did not try it long enough - but it is way too gummy and way too hard to remove - leaves way to much goo in mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to polident original...disappointed since I thought this product would be easier to carry with me</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, perfect.  I&#x27;m embarrased to go to the drug store to puchse denture items so comes in handy</li>
            <li> Better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> The little strips are hard to use, they stick to your fingers and they only last a few hours. For the price i expected a lot more. For your top and bottom you need 5 strips, I had to redo it after lunch so that&#x27;s 10 a day. There are only 40 in each box, thats 4 days worth.</li>
            <li> i can not get them here in my town,so i order them this way because i love them..</li>
            <li> Great product helps hold the teeth in place the whole day.</li>
            <li> Good for 8-12 hours -- but that&#x27;s good enough!  Better than the \\&quot;goo\\&quot; and easier to apply.  I just wet the plate, trim the pack the strips come in and press them on to the plate.  Easy!</li>
            <li> As it says on the box, &#x27;there&#x27;s no mess, no ooze&#x27;. These strips are easy to use and prevent chafing of soft tissue/gums.</li>
            <li> Way overpriced. Bottoms only last 2-3 hours before discinagrating. Wouldn&#x27;t get it again-even for free! Stick with Sea Bond.</li>
            <li> I have used other adhesive products for my dentures, but not to my satisfaction. After using Super Poligrip Adhensive Strips for many months, I have decided that I will continue to use this product.to secure my dentures, upper and lower. To secure my upper denture I take one strip and cut it into 3 smaller strips; and I apply 1 each at the top and 1 each on each side. This really works for me. The upper denture is in place all day and at the end of the day I have to apply a little force to pry it loose. There is still some adhesive that requires a little sticky residue to clean. But considering cost, benefits, and features, they are all pluses for me. I have no gripes with Super Poligrip.</li>
            <li> all were great and as expected...I had used them all before so would probably order them all again. many thanks</li>
            <li> Great, right on time!</li>
            <li> Heres the thing, no denture adhesive ever is perfect. The gel kinda, rips apart my gums when I try to remove it, yet can typically hold all day and that includes at least eating one full meal without it falling apart. The poligrip powder which they have stopped making temporarily, I like the best mainly because nothing is left behind on my gums when i remove it, but it only holds for one meal as well. These Poligrip Stips, while they could get quite expensive since you have to use 3 for the top denture, 2 for the bottom, they hold about the same as the powder. They seem to hold great on the top denture, but the bottom is the one that is always popping off. It holds semi good on the bottom, not as good as the adhesive but better than the powder.. But I&#x27;ve never found any denture adhesive that works that great on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the thing I like about this is that they are easily hidden in a pocket, so I can be out in public and if my denture pops loose, go to the bathroom and easily replace the adhesive without having to carry around a thing of powder or the glue adhesive.</li>
            <li> I love this product.. can&#x27;t get it at CVS or Wallgreens anymore....</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Makes life simpler to be able to subscribe and save, and not worry if it&#x27;s in stock at the grocery stores. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Extremely hard to remove strips from film packaging .&lt;br /&gt;Very time consuming &amp; frustrating if fingernails are close .</li>
            <li> the  only  strips  my  91 yrs young  mother-in-law  will  use.&lt;br /&gt;great  product  losing  shelf space  in  stores  but  always  available  at  Amazon.</li>
            <li> I do not usually write reviews, but I felt I had to on this product. I have tried everything I could find on my dentures and I just could not keep my dentures in place. And with Fixodent and pollygrip I went crazy y&#x3D;trying to get all the glue out of my mouth. This product from Poligrip is GREAT.I do not say GREATwithout meaning it, Three strips on upper dentures and two strips on lower dentures and my dentures are in for the day. I can eat and chew my food and Its been a longtime for me to do this. At night rinse mouth with warm water and the little bit of glue left in my mouth using a tooth brush ,and it comes right out. They could get a bit expensive for some but if you want a product that REALLY WORKS this is the one to buy..</li>
            <li> awesome thank you very much</li>
            <li> Item as described, exactly what I want, come it fast and package is good</li>
            <li> extrement satisfaite de la rapidite et de l&#x27;envoi de mon paquet..je recommencerai mes commandes.&lt;br /&gt;que vous dire de plus. satisfaction</li>
            <li> They work very well when applied correctly.  It solved the problem of loose dentures for my elderly mother in law..</li>
            <li> My Dad has Dentures upper and lower plates. The poligrip comfort seal strips is all he ever uses, none of the other products work for Dad.</li>
            <li> Anyone who tries this will never use anything else again!!!  No goo, no mess, in and out easily, lasts all day.  The stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> excellect product my mother is very happy with it</li>
            <li> Love to Use these, alone or in combination with adhesive powder.  Great Hold without the oozing, gooey mess of paste!</li>
            <li> great product, feel very safe in using them, price is right and i can buy as many as i want to at one time</li>
            <li> First of all I cut these strips in half and as long as you wet them before applying and push your denture tight like your dentist would they work perfectly.  There is much less residue left on the roof of my mouth at the end of the day that I have to scrape off than with other product. For some reason my local grocery stores are no longer carrying these.  Thank goodness I can get them here.</li>
            <li> The exact product that my mother needs at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have used the poligrip strips many times in the past and it just happens to be a product i like very much.</li>
