            <li>Great product, i feel alot more safe now that i have purchased this item....</li>
            <li>IT LOOKS NICE ON THE COUNTER</li>
            <li>Its nice to have it because you don&#x27;t need to buy a toothbrush holder</li>
            <li>Nice concept</li>
            <li>It is well worth it!!!</li>
            <li>requires cleaning monthly, should have a better design but light works great for toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s very easy to use, keeps the toothbrushes</li>
            <li>This sanitizer seemed too be great at first.</li>
            <li>I purchased this sanitizer for my family in the hopes of not buying as many toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I never touched the light, and its not supposed to need replacing!</li>
            <li>Makes me feel much better about my toothbrush being kept sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Thinking of buying more soon.</li>
            <li>Very sleek looking and great design</li>
            <li>well ok</li>
            <li>I love that my tooth brush is alway germ free every time I use it!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using the toothbrush sanitizer until it died after a year.</li>
            <li>Counter top, plug in, and holds four toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much more satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>so I feel very clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of tricky to clean and doesn&#x27;t fit all size toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The UV light works, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li>I learned that I have to be sure the door is snapped shut for the UV light to come on.  </li>
            <li>And even with the door shut, I sometimes have to tap the top of the unit to get the light to come on.</li>
            <li>I feel sooo much better knowing that what my children and myself put in our mouths to clean is clean itself!</li>
            <li>Easy to use     </li>
            <li>So easy to use, my kids take care of their toothbrushes themselves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1. DOOR DOESN&#x27;T CLOSE EASILY.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
            <li>Works fine, priced right, light comes on when you close the door and the door doesn&#x27;t shut and latch very easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s a huge plus that I can plug this model in and don&#x60;t need to use batteries.</li>
            <li>One problem....have problems getting the door to shut for the light on.</li>
            <li>But with this sanitizer, I don&#x27;t have to do that and its economically and environmentally better.  </li>
            <li>Within 1 week, the door wouldn&#x27;t always trigger the light.</li>
            <li>Then the light just quit altogether.</li>
            <li>After receiving this product, I discovered that the UV light would not turn on.  </li>
            <li>THIS ITEM WAS EXTREMELY CHEAP.  </li>
            <li>use it every day,  easy to clean and does its job</li>
            <li>uv light would not come on.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t the light doesn&#x27;t go on.</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have used it for full size and the smaller brush heads that go to my powered toothbrush with great results.</li>
            <li>The little sliding door is great, it blocks most of the germs that float around in a bathroom.</li>
            <li>It is nice not having to throw away a new toothbrush every week during flu season.</li>
            <li>To clean that part you have to take the bottom off the device and scrub it</li>
            <li>AND KEEPS THEM CLEAN</li>
            <li>I could not get it clean.</li>
            <li>This way you know they are clean when you use them.</li>
            <li>You can smell how clean your brush is as soon as you remove it.</li>
            <li>I am older, and hard to please, so I&#x27;m  delighted to tell you skeptic&#x27;s this one is great.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product that only requires an external switch ...</li>
            <li>Relatively quick cycle&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>The light doesn&#x27;t always come on the first time I close the door.</li>
            <li>Only thing I did not like was the bulb was kind of bent.</li>
            <li>I liked this &#x27;cause it has 4 slots to put multiple brushes.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s worth my effort to return them</li>
            <li>This is a nice product but it only worked once and not again.  </li>
            <li>Be prepared to wait though, takes awhile to get it, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Since it plugs in, it&#x27;s economical to use.</li>
            <li>Other wise I like it.</li>
            <li>Right now its holding my toothbrush, orabrush, and floss brush.</li>
            <li>AND I LIKED THE EXTRA LARGE SLOTS INSIDE</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how lightweight it was and concerned about it breaking easily.</li>
            <li>I just bought this for the same price at the drug store and it&#x27;s a great idea and design, but it won&#x27;t hold different brush types.  </li>
            <li>makes an electric sanitizer a bit of a challenge,  Since my outlet is connected directly to the switch I have to make sure the sanitizer door is slightly open so as not to turn on each time someone flicks the light switch.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>None of the kids brushes would fit and the adult ones were a battle to get in and out.  </li>
            <li>The Sunbeam #SBUV102 UV Counter Top Unit Sanitizer fits my electric toothbrush head, regular toothbrush, flosser pic and scraper.</li>
            <li>first I had to get a replacement for the first because the bulb broke in shipment</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s held up pretty well to weekly cleanings.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Its simple to use and does a better job.</li>
            <li>you can pretty much put whatever you want in there</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this sanitizer for a couple of years I&#x27;m less enthusiastic.</li>
            <li>It really only holds the normal skinny handle brushes and most people don&#x27;t use those anymore.  </li>
            <li>Some of the reviews we read said you cannot insert a toothbrush with a large handle.  </li>
            <li>but I certainly will not give them to anyone.  </li>
            <li>The last time I did it, the light quit working.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really use it that often.</li>
            <li>but since they all use UV light to kill the germs, I&#x27;m guessing they would all have similar results.</li>
            <li>I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT IT IS ON SUFFICIENTLY ENOUGH TO STERILIZER THE BRUSHES</li>
            <li>: \\&quot;The UV light doesn&#x27;t come on every time I shut the door to the unit, so I don&#x27;t know if it is working later</li>
            <li>These gizmos are absolutely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the UV light comes on after the acrylic door is slid shut, but you have to force the door the last 1/4 inch to activate the switch.</li>
            <li>THIS UNIT WORKS VERY</li>
            <li>I had really hoped this would work longer/better.</li>
            <li>and you can not replace just the bulb you have to replace the whole unit.</li>
            <li>Twenty dollars or so is reasonable for 2 years&#x27; use, I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>however after owning for a couple of years you really have to slam the door to get it to turn on.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you get one!</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t tell if it worked are not when it did.</li>
            <li>it stays very well</li>
            <li>We like it and figure if it works for at least a year then we will have made a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I originally posted the following review</li>
            <li>I would clean it out and no big deal.</li>
            <li>If someone wants an affordable sanitizer and you don&#x27;t mind your brushes smelling a little burnt its an ok product.</li>
            <li>I see the light come on when I close the door, but the toothbrushes don&#x27;t get dry.  </li>
            <li>This is my main problem.</li>
            <li>This product clearly states that using this product over time may lead to Lead Exposure,and to wash your hands after using this product!!     </li>
            <li>It is hard to clean and accumulates mold in crevices I can&#x27;t reach to clean.</li>
            <li>We would all have to have new toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The UV light should be hot enough to dry the toothbrushes by the next day - but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>light didnot last very long</li>
            <li>However, the holes for the toothbrush handles are barely large enough for toothbrushes with fatter handles.</li>
            <li>The bottom comes off so if any water drips down I can easily clean it.</li>
            <li>I have had this product since Xmas and it has since developed mold on the bottom where the UV does not shine.</li>
            <li>The old one was still working</li>
            <li>Took the old one apart and ran everything but the electronics through the dishwasher and kept it as a spare, not because I think I will need it but because with my luck, in five or six years they will stop making this and I will be SOL for a replacement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Who would actually think such a gizmo is even useful if it DID do what it claims?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only complaint is that the door doesnt close very easily it sort of drags, but is still useable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple hanging UV sanitizers in the past and this one seems MUCH better.  </li>
            <li>The item was difficult to find but when I finally did, I loved it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if the UV light really never burns out.  </li>
            <li>WILL KEEP THE SANITIZER CLEAN AND DRY.I CAN&#x27;T SPEAK TO HOW LONG THE BULB WILL LAST,BUT THE COST OF THIS STERILIZER MAKES THAT NOT VERY IMPORTANT.</li>
            <li>Hard to get the light to come on.  </li>
            <li>keep them as far to the left as you can.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Given all that, it seems your money would be better spent betting \\&quot;Hard 8\\&quot; at the Craps table in Vegas.</li>

            <li> I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT IT IS ON SUFFICIENTLY ENOUGH TO STERILIZER THE BRUSHES</li>
            <li> : \\&quot;The UV light doesn&#x27;t come on every time I shut the door to the unit, so I don&#x27;t know if it is working later</li>
            <li> These gizmos are absolutely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the UV light comes on after the acrylic door is slid shut, but you have to force the door the last 1/4 inch to activate the switch.</li>
            <li> THIS UNIT WORKS VERY</li>
            <li> I had really hoped this would work longer/better.</li>
            <li> and you can not replace just the bulb you have to replace the whole unit.</li>
            <li> Twenty dollars or so is reasonable for 2 years&#x27; use, I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> however after owning for a couple of years you really have to slam the door to get it to turn on.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you get one!</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell if it worked are not when it did.</li>
            <li> it stays very well</li>
            <li> We like it and figure if it works for at least a year then we will have made a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I originally posted the following review</li>
            <li> I would clean it out and no big deal.</li>
            <li> If someone wants an affordable sanitizer and you don&#x27;t mind your brushes smelling a little burnt its an ok product.</li>
            <li> I see the light come on when I close the door, but the toothbrushes don&#x27;t get dry.  </li>
            <li> This is my main problem.</li>
            <li> This product clearly states that using this product over time may lead to Lead Exposure,and to wash your hands after using this product!!     </li>
            <li> It is hard to clean and accumulates mold in crevices I can&#x27;t reach to clean.</li>
            <li> We would all have to have new toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The UV light should be hot enough to dry the toothbrushes by the next day - but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> light didnot last very long</li>
            <li> However, the holes for the toothbrush handles are barely large enough for toothbrushes with fatter handles.</li>
            <li> The bottom comes off so if any water drips down I can easily clean it.</li>
            <li> I have had this product since Xmas and it has since developed mold on the bottom where the UV does not shine.</li>
            <li> The old one was still working</li>
            <li> Took the old one apart and ran everything but the electronics through the dishwasher and kept it as a spare, not because I think I will need it but because with my luck, in five or six years they will stop making this and I will be SOL for a replacement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Who would actually think such a gizmo is even useful if it DID do what it claims?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the door doesnt close very easily it sort of drags, but is still useable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple hanging UV sanitizers in the past and this one seems MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> The item was difficult to find but when I finally did, I loved it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if the UV light really never burns out.  </li>
            <li> WILL KEEP THE SANITIZER CLEAN AND DRY.I CAN&#x27;T SPEAK TO HOW LONG THE BULB WILL LAST,BUT THE COST OF THIS STERILIZER MAKES THAT NOT VERY IMPORTANT.</li>
            <li> Hard to get the light to come on.  </li>
            <li> keep them as far to the left as you can.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given all that, it seems your money would be better spent betting \\&quot;Hard 8\\&quot; at the Craps table in Vegas.</li>
            <li> Love the fact I do not have to buy new toothbrushes every time we are sick, really keeps germ spread down.</li>
            <li> Same principle as other UV sanitizers but considerably cheaper.</li>
            <li> We have had our unit for only a couple of weeks and wonder how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> Bulb lasts a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does the same thing for a fraction of the price of other appliances.    </li>
            <li> RECOMMEND LETTING THE BRUSHES AIR DRY OVERNIGHT AND STERILIZING THEM IN THE MORNING.THIS</li>
            <li> At first, I was afraid the door would crack, but it&#x27;s held up so far.</li>
            <li> It closes almost all the way, then I have to grasp it and force it the last little bit.</li>

            <li> (razor blades, tweezers, other grooming tools)</li>
            <li> You are sitting a wet toothbrush head upside down in this gizmo.</li>
            <li> If you have a very wide bottomed toothbrush, it won&#x27;t fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only negative comment we have is the alignment of the plastic door.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s possible because the hanging ones always burned out after a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v had the wall mounted one and didn&#x27;t like the cord hanging down the wall.  </li>
            <li> However, less than 2 months after receiving it, the unit no longer works, at all.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I have to say on the subject.  </li>
            <li> So, if you have less than 4 toothbrushes in the holder, that&#x27;s my tip...</li>
            <li> The prongs in the receptacle are tight, but by turning and using pressure it can be done if you have the strength.  </li>
            <li> Some times I have a little problem with door.</li>
            <li> It has held up with little hands opening and closing it.</li>
            <li> Ours shuts hard with a pop and will not turn on until properly closed.  </li>
            <li> It does collect water at the bottom of the unit, and grow funky green stuff at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> MY PHILLIPS TOOTH BRUSH HEADS WOULD NOT FIT.  </li>
            <li> Then after owning it for a few months it was time to replace toothbrushes for my kids and the bottom inside of unit was covered with mold.</li>
            <li> Came broken... sent back</li>
            <li> The germs from catching cold stays in mouth and not easy to get over the cold because my toothbrush keeps the germ.</li>
            <li> The device seems to work fine; my only complaint is that the liquid draining off the toothbrushes collects in the bottom of the device and becomes moldy and nasty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure if this does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> PROBABLY NOT SUNBEAM NEEDS TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT THIS ONE</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and the Sunbeam Toothbrush Sanitizer SBUV 102 was the least expensive.  </li>
            <li> For example, I used to change a toothbrush after I catch cold.  </li>
            <li> Lame!  </li>
            <li> They slide in to the holes but when you go to remove them they are very difficult to get out.</li>
            <li> If I have one toothbrush in the right-most slot, it&#x27;s almost impossible to get the door to close.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> It is working as expected but the set up I have in my bathroom where the lights and a radio go on and off with the flick of a switch makes an electric sanitizer a bit of a challenge,  Since my outlet is connected directly to the switch I have to make sure the sanitizer door is slightly open so as not to turn on each time someone flicks the light switch.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sanitizer for my family in the hopes of not buying as many toothbrushes. It seems as if one of my children was always getting strep-throat.  We would all have to have new toothbrushes. This sanitizer seemed too be great at first. It does collect water at the bottom of the unit, and grow funky green stuff at the bottom. This funk can still reach the handles of tooth brushes--yuck! I would clean it out and no big deal. The last time I did it, the light quit working. I never touched the light, and its not supposed to need replacing! I have not had it a year! Lame!  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV3G9Q/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_img</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and the Sunbeam Toothbrush Sanitizer SBUV 102 was the least expensive.  It does the same thing for a fraction of the price of other appliances.    Some of the reviews we read said you cannot insert a toothbrush with a large handle.  The prongs in the receptacle are tight, but by turning and using pressure it can be done if you have the strength.  The only negative comment we have is the alignment of the plastic door.  Ours shuts hard with a pop and will not turn on until properly closed.  We have had our unit for only a couple of weeks and wonder how long it will last.  We like it and figure if it works for at least a year then we will have made a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Good product. Only thing I did not like was the bulb was kind of bent. Everytime I use it I have to wiggle the bulb to make it work. Other wise I like it.</li>
            <li> Great product, i feel alot more safe now that i have purchased this item.... only complaint is that the door doesnt close very easily it sort of drags, but is still useable.</li>
            <li> I liked this &#x27;cause it has 4 slots to put multiple brushes. Right now its holding my toothbrush, orabrush, and floss brush. The little sliding door is great, it blocks most of the germs that float around in a bathroom. The bottom comes off so if any water drips down I can easily clean it. The UV light works, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job and it doesn&#x27;t melt by brushes, but it leaves them smelling kinda burnt so I don&#x27;t really use it that often. It was at a good price so I&#x27;m fine with it. If someone wants an affordable sanitizer and you don&#x27;t mind your brushes smelling a little burnt its an ok product. I haven&#x27;t tried other sanitizers but since they all use UV light to kill the germs, I&#x27;m guessing they would all have similar results.</li>
            <li> I have had this product since Xmas and it has since developed mold on the bottom where the UV does not shine. requires cleaning monthly, should have a better design but light works great for toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure if this does what it is supposed to do.  I see the light come on when I close the door, but the toothbrushes don&#x27;t get dry.  The UV light should be hot enough to dry the toothbrushes by the next day - but it doesn&#x27;t.  So, is it working as it should?  I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> IT LOOKS NICE ON THE COUNTER AND I LIKED THE EXTRA LARGE SLOTS INSIDE BECAUSE IT WILL ACCOMMODATE THE LARGER HANDLED TOOTH BRUSHES FOR CHILDREN HOWEVER, I DO NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT IT ONLY COMES ON WHEN EVER THE DOOR IS OPENED OR SHUT. I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT IT IS ON SUFFICIENTLY ENOUGH TO STERILIZER THE BRUSHES AS I HAVE ANOTHER BRAND THAT COMES OFF AND ON PERIODICALLY THROUGH OUT THE DAY. BUT AFTER READING THE OWNERS MANUAL IT SAYS THAT IS HOW IT IS CONSTRUCTED SO WOULD I BUY ANOTHER ONE? PROBABLY NOT SUNBEAM NEEDS TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT THIS ONE</li>
            <li> I originally posted the following review: \\&quot;The UV light doesn&#x27;t come on every time I shut the door to the unit, so I don&#x27;t know if it is working later or if it is defective. It&#x27;s conveniently designed.\\&quot;  I learned that I have to be sure the door is snapped shut for the UV light to come on.  The device seems to work fine; my only complaint is that the liquid draining off the toothbrushes collects in the bottom of the device and becomes moldy and nasty. To clean that part you have to take the bottom off the device and scrub it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this sanitizer for a couple of years I&#x27;m less enthusiastic. It is hard to clean and accumulates mold in crevices I can&#x27;t reach to clean. I will probably throw it out soon because the mold worries me.</li>
            <li> Think about it for a minute. These gizmos are absolutely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who would actually think such a gizmo is even useful if it DID do what it claims?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Anything that gets on your toothbrush head was ALREADY in your mouth. Unless you think your houseguests are cleaning their shoe soles with your toothbrush while you aren&#x27;t looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) You are sitting a wet toothbrush head upside down in this gizmo. Which means it is sitting in a puddle of water that is likely to mold/mildew. So you can put mold/mildew INTO your mouth (that was NOT in your mouth before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) The puddle of water is likely to (a) rust out the innards of this gizmo and (b) short-circuit the gizmo&#x27;s electronics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) The American Dental Association says these gizmos have no proven beneficial health benefits:&lt;br /&gt;  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given all that, it seems your money would be better spent betting \\&quot;Hard 8\\&quot; at the Craps table in Vegas.</li>
            <li> The Sunbeam toothbrush sanitizer is probably the best value on the market. However, the holes for the toothbrush handles are barely large enough for toothbrushes with fatter handles. Also, the UV light comes on after the acrylic door is slid shut, but you have to force the door the last 1/4 inch to activate the switch. At first, I was afraid the door would crack, but it&#x27;s held up so far. And even with the door shut, I sometimes have to tap the top of the unit to get the light to come on.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes me feel much better about my toothbrush being kept sanitizer. One problem....have problems getting the door to shut for the light on. Hard to get the light to come on.  Also, I moved my sanitizer and toothbrushes OUT of the bathroom and moved them into the kitchen. I got to thinking about how UNSANITARY it is to brush my teeth where there is a commode that is used a lot during the day and night. Can&#x27;t deal with that anymore. Just something that works for me. I like knowing that my toothbrush has been sanitized. Product is great! Delivery time was great! Loved it! Thinking of buying more soon. Probably will. Thanks! God is good.&lt;br /&gt;Martha in TN</li>
            <li> THIS UNIT WORKS VERY WELL.IT STERILIZES THE TOOTHBRUSHES [AND ANY OTHER ORAL APPLIANCE THAT FITS]QUICKLY AND KEEPS THEM CLEAN DUE TO THE SLIDING DOOR.I RECOMMEND LETTING THE BRUSHES AIR DRY OVERNIGHT AND STERILIZING THEM IN THE MORNING.THIS WILL KEEP THE SANITIZER CLEAN AND DRY.I CAN&#x27;T SPEAK TO HOW LONG THE BULB WILL LAST,BUT THE COST OF THIS STERILIZER MAKES THAT NOT VERY IMPORTANT.</li>
            <li> Works well and efficient  , everyone should use something like this. Easy to use     I use it everytime I use me toothbrush. Some times I have a little problem with door.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 of these as Christmas gifts.  Don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s worth my effort to return them but I certainly will not give them to anyone.  I contacted Sunbeam because the one I opened did not work and their response was basically - nothing they could do about it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Its nice to have it because you don&#x27;t need to buy a toothbrush holder and it sanitaizes the toothbrush everytime I use so I feel very clean and I don&#x27;t have to change toothbrush often compared to what I used to.  For example, I used to change a toothbrush after I catch cold.  The germs from catching cold stays in mouth and not easy to get over the cold because my toothbrush keeps the germ. But with this sanitizer, I don&#x27;t have to do that and its economically and environmentally better.  Its a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product but it only worked once and not again.  Nice concept but just did not work.  They took it back with no problems.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, my kids take care of their toothbrushes themselves. Love the fact I do not have to buy new toothbrushes every time we are sick, really keeps germ spread down.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! I am older, and hard to please, so I&#x27;m  delighted to tell you skeptic&#x27;s this one is great. Plug it  in, put your bush in slide the door closed, and the cleanin&#x27; begins! Execellent price, works with electric brushes, and simple to use...what else could you ask for?  Be prepared to wait though, takes awhile to get it, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple hanging UV sanitizers in the past and this one seems MUCH better.  you can pretty much put whatever you want in there (razor blades, tweezers, other grooming tools) and it plugs in, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries!  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if the UV light really never burns out.  I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s possible because the hanging ones always burned out after a few months.</li>
            <li> I bought this for use with mine and my 3 oldest children. I was surprised at how lightweight it was and concerned about it breaking easily. It has held up with little hands opening and closing it. However, less than 2 months after receiving it, the unit no longer works, at all. Within 1 week, the door wouldn&#x27;t always trigger the light. Then the light just quit altogether. Very disappointed. I had really hoped this would work longer/better.</li>
            <li> Works fine, priced right, light comes on when you close the door and the door doesn&#x27;t shut and latch very easy. I have to fiddle with it everytime, had it a month and still haven&#x27;t figured it out. Besides that it preforms as expected.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that only requires an external switch ... So you can open and close the door, without ever having to turn the unit ON...    BTW, I would like to get Spare UV Bulbs for this SBUV102 Sanitizer...    Does someone here knows the price and where to get Replacement UV Bulbs for this Sunbeam SBUV102?</li>
            <li> After receiving this product, I discovered that the UV light would not turn on.  I tried calling the Customer Service number listed on the owners manual, and was directed to a phone sex site.  I found another number for Sunbeam off the web, and they told me that the company that produced this product for them, went out of business several years ago.  Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> Same principle as other UV sanitizers but considerably cheaper. This is a replacement for an identical one I had. The old one was still working but so grubby I could not get it clean. (Did you know the bottom twists off for cleaning?) Took the old one apart and ran everything but the electronics through the dishwasher and kept it as a spare, not because I think I will need it but because with my luck, in five or six years they will stop making this and I will be SOL for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I love it because it&#x27;s very easy to use, keeps the toothbrushes all closed in.  This way you know they are clean when you use them.</li>
            <li> I just bought this for the same price at the drug store and it&#x27;s a great idea and design, but it won&#x27;t hold different brush types.  It really only holds the normal skinny handle brushes and most people don&#x27;t use those anymore.  None of the kids brushes would fit and the adult ones were a battle to get in and out.  I&#x27;ll be taking it back and maybe looking for a cup version.  Very sleek looking and great design though if you only use skinny brushes.</li>
            <li> The Sunbeam #SBUV102 UV Counter Top Unit Sanitizer fits my electric toothbrush head, regular toothbrush, flosser pic and scraper. It&#x60;s a huge plus that I can plug this model in and don&#x60;t need to use batteries. It&#x60;s quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  I feel sooo much better knowing that what my children and myself put in our mouths to clean is clean itself! I keep the door closed so I know nothing is going to contaminate them!  It is well worth it!!!</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM WAS EXTREMELY CHEAP.  MY PHILLIPS TOOTH BRUSH HEADS WOULD NOT FIT.  IF YOU JUST USE A REGULAR BRUSH PROBABLY WOULD WORK GIVE IT TO MY FATHER!</li>
            <li> works well  and  is holding up well  use it every day,  easy to clean and does its job well ok</li>
            <li> item arrived defective.  uv light would not come on. I returned item -- it cost me 15.84 to return at post office!!  I am out return shipping for a defective item.</li>
            <li> first I had to get a replacement for the first because the bulb broke in shipment and you can not replace just the bulb you have to replace the whole unit. Then after owning it for a few months it was time to replace toothbrushes for my kids and the bottom inside of unit was covered with mold.</li>
            <li> Lo compré hace como dos años y a la fecha funciona muy bien. Decidí comprar éste en lugar de otros, por la buena referencia que tenía con respecto a la vida útil de su bombilla y su relativa facilidad para obtener su repuesto, pues para otros aparatos las críticas decían que la luz les duró poco o que les resultaba muy difícil encontrar el repuesto, y no me equivoqué, 2 años después el bombillo funciona sin problema. El único \\&quot;lunar\\&quot; es que a veces hay que abrir y cerrar repetidamente el aparato para que encienda la luz, pues el interruptor es la misma venta corrediza que encierra los cepillos (no un botón extra), pero no es mayor contratiempo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Sunbeam sanitizer for 2 years now and I&#x27;ve loved it. It isn&#x27;t perfect - what is? It&#x27;s kind of tricky to clean and doesn&#x27;t fit all size toothbrushes. But it does do what it claims to do.  Since it plugs in, it&#x27;s economical to use. I&#x27;ve had fewer colds since getting it and it&#x27;s held up pretty well to weekly cleanings. It&#x27;s starting to wear out now. The light doesn&#x27;t always come on the first time I close the door. I&#x27;d recommend it and I&#x27;ll buy another one just like it when this one wears out. Twenty dollars or so is reasonable for 2 years&#x27; use, I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> The item was difficult to find but when I finally did, I loved it. Met all expectations and I am using it today.</li>
            <li> Works well and does the job...however after owning for a couple of years you really have to slam the door to get it to turn on.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I love that my tooth brush is alway germ free every time I use it! I highly recommend you get one!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using the toothbrush sanitizer until it died after a year. I really couldn&#x27;t tell if it worked are not when it did.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Counter top, plug in, and holds four toothbrushes.  I&#x27;v had the battery powered one and was constantly replacing the batteries.  I&#x27;v had the wall mounted one and didn&#x27;t like the cord hanging down the wall.  This one is perfect and the price is great!</li>
            <li> As with the review done by \\&quot;S. Trenn \\&quot;Rainsgold\\&quot; (Harrisburg,PA)\\&quot;    This product clearly states that using this product over time may lead to Lead Exposure,and to wash your hands after using this product!!     If anything has the \\&quot;Made In China\\&quot; label on it,basically you know its garbage and will eventually poison you over time. Or just downright kill you!    Stay away from this garbage!</li>
            <li> I believe it does a good job.  That&#x27;s all I have to say on the subject.  Done done done done</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a germ a phob like me.  I recevied it in great condition.  I use it in my kids bathroom, and it works like a champ</li>
            <li> After owning another brand that used steam I&#x27;m much more satisfied with this product.Its simple to use and does a better job.You can smell how clean your brush is as soon as you remove it.</li>
            <li> It has been on the counter in our Guest bathroom&lt;br /&gt;It works great and it has the suck cups e bottom of this unit - it stays very well</li>
            <li> This is a great for removing germs from toothbrushes. It sanitizes and offers closed storage to protect toothbrushes left in the bathroom between use. I have used it for full size and the smaller brush heads that go to my powered toothbrush with great results. It is nice not having to throw away a new toothbrush every week during flu season.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this unit runs off electricity instead of batteries. The problem I have is that the holes that the brushes go in are not designed for fat handled toothbrushes. 90% of all brushes such as oral B have fat handles. They slide in to the holes but when you go to remove them they are very difficult to get out.</li>
            <li> this product was defective.</li>
            <li> light didnot last very long</li>
            <li> Came broken... sent back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for several years.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. It holds multiple toothbrushes at a time.&lt;br /&gt;2. Relatively quick cycle&lt;br /&gt;3. Upright position of toothbrush means that the bristles aren&#x27;t lying in gunk&lt;br /&gt;4. seems to work&lt;br /&gt;5. Bulb lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;6. Suction cups on bottom keep the item in place.&lt;br /&gt;7. Plugs in to standard plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. DOOR DOESN&#x27;T CLOSE EASILY. This is my main problem. It closes almost all the way, then I have to grasp it and force it the last little bit. If I don&#x27;t the light doesn&#x27;t go on. It&#x27;s such an annoyance that I&#x27;m considering buying a different brand, even though it technically still works.&lt;br /&gt;2. space for toothbrush is standard/narrow. If you have a very wide bottomed toothbrush, it won&#x27;t fit.&lt;br /&gt;3. While the bottom comes off for cleaning, it&#x27;s not easy to put back on.&lt;br /&gt;4. Even though the suction cups hold the unit in place, I always have to unstick it in order to close the door, and then restick it back to the countertop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED TO ADD: I have found that if I keep my brushes all the way to the left, it&#x27;s easier to close the door. If I have one toothbrush in the right-most slot, it&#x27;s almost impossible to get the door to close.  So, if you have less than 4 toothbrushes in the holder, that&#x27;s my tip...keep them as far to the left as you can.</li>
