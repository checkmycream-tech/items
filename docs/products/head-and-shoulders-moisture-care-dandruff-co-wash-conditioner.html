            <li>But I am glad I tried this!</li>
            <li>scalp feels and looks so much better!</li>
            <li>Because of my hair&#x27;s kinky texture, moisture is easily stripped from it, so I was happy when I was sent a co-wash as well as a shampoo, so that I could keep with my regimen.</li>
            <li>I was really pleased and it also had a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>This Head and Shoulder co wash is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing on my hair</li>
            <li>it is amazing.</li>
            <li>and they too are equally amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing product</li>
            <li>But, what you want and need to know is that the Co-Wash works amazingly at eliminating flakes and dandruff.</li>
            <li>it has amazing slip.</li>
            <li>I did not expect for this product to be so amazing.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I decided to try it on my own hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sold on the dandruff aspect of it, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in that department, but it&#x27;s a great, affordable co-wash either way!</li>
            <li>Nice to know</li>
            <li>I can use my own shampoo and conditioner them use the co-wash and still have the benefit of having the moisture from the head and shoulders moisture care.  </li>
            <li>I liked it bit</li>
            <li>i received this product as part of a promotion for a brand, however, all opinions are solely based on my own review.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say....</li>
            <li>*Please note the opinions and views in this review are solely my own, I was given the product as a promotion from the company BZZagent.</li>
            <li>rather I was asked to provide my honest review and the opinions are solely my own honest feedback and opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>I would have never tried this on my own</li>
            <li>Its a creamy cleanser with no lather and smells really nice.  </li>
            <li>It smells heavenly, and leaves your hair with a nice coconut tropical fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand, but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>This has a warm soothing smell that is pleasing to the nose.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell also</li>
            <li>but it wasnt effective as the Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>HONESTLY, I DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND IT&#x27;S PURPOSE.  </li>
            <li>but if you just need a conditioner this is a nice one to try.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I do kind of like it.</li>
            <li>And my curls were nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>I tried the co-wash in return for honest feedback, through bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>now have my own head and shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>it has nice oils in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Thanks for these wonderful product keep them coming!!</li>
            <li>Thanks bzzagent for allowing me to try this for free!!!!</li>

            <li>but the set of the new head and shoulder 2 in 1 shampoo and this product is great together.</li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders, having always been marketed as helping to relieve the discomfort of a dry and flaky scalp, seemed like the perfect product for me to try.</li>

            <li>, the scent of this line is incredible and leaves my long hair looking healthy and shiny throughout the day.  </li>

            <li>I  was able to try this product for free through BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>But it really is just as good.</li>
            <li>I loved that this new line of Head and Shoulders products are formulated with vitamin E–rich almond oil and coconut essence - unlike most anti-dandruff products that smell like medicine</li>
            <li>With this 2 in 1 Co Wash after thr shower my hair was easy to comb through felt soft and moisturized and smelled great.</li>

            <li>I really loved that the scent wasn’t the typical medicated scent as with many anti-dandruff products, it had a really pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I left it in a good 10 minutes before rinsing and did not have to use any additional product in my hair!</li>
            <li>Other than that this is an awesome product.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I could run my fingers through it quite easily to detangle it.</li>
            <li>i would say if your hair is pron to dryness already, or it brakes off easily, don&#x27;t use this line alone.</li>
            <li>Gravity helps in getting it out of the bottle easily.</li>
            <li>My curly hair doesn&#x27;t like most shampoos and after using Head and Shoulders before (it was so drying and had my hair feeling squeaky clean</li>

            <li>It was easy to put on my hair and easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>This co wash is an amazing cleansing conditioner which is gently scented and I love its consistency.</li>
            <li>This has a really nice smell and my hair felt nice and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it could possibly be as good as my high end, holy grail, co-wash products like DevaCurl or Wen.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it contains almond oil and is specially formulated for textured hair.</li>
            <li>This was first given to me by Head and Shoulders company and bzzagent to try and get my honest opinion.</li>

            <li>As I said in my review of the shampoo, I haven&#x27;t had the best experience with Head &amp; Shoulders products in the past.</li>
            <li>The conditioners that come with hair dye have been the best, (most conditioning), for my thick, unruly hair, but I&#x27;ve yet to encounter any non-hair dye conditioner that beats this Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Co-Wash!</li>
            <li>I was excited to join the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection for 2 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a free, full size bottle of the Co-Wash from BzzAgent over a month ago.</li>
            <li>But I was really excited to try it out when I was sent this product to reveiw.</li>
            <li>Its worth it!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super manageable/tangle free.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels clean AND moisturized, but not greasy or clogged.</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got to try it free from a promotion, Thanks Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair hydrated and clean.</li>
            <li>More importantly, I have had no burning or intense itching.</li>
            <li>My scalp also felt nice and it left my strands looking healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>It rinsed thoroughly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>And the scent is pleasant, but not-overpowering as to attract bees to your hair outside.</li>
            <li>I honestly was truly surprised by the results!</li>
            <li>It smells good and is super thick as to where I didn&#x27;t feel that I needed to use a lot to get a good wash.</li>
            <li>Since using this product, I have found my hair to be full of moisture (in a good way!), smooth and easier to tame.  </li>
            <li>Oh.. I don&#x27;t want to forget the smell is amazing and not harsh.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free from buzz agent, and normally I don&#x27;t like many hair care products that go together</li>
            <li>It gave me good overall moisture and helped with the detangling process as well.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was moisturizing, cleansing and provided good volume.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find how nicely this worked.</li>
            <li>Co-Wash was my absolute favorite in the line.  </li>
            <li>Go check out my full review on my youtube channel at Lifeintheskye.</li>
            <li>my curly hair doesn&#x27;t like the way 2 in one shampoos and conditioners which head and shoulders was famous for, because they don&#x27;t provide as much moisture.</li>
            <li>along with my 2 sister who have also purchased this product in full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Head &amp; Shoulders for the free sample!</li>
            <li>I also love that it is pH balanced and gentle on chemically treated hair.  </li>
            <li>and it really looks and feels healthy.</li>
            <li>so thanks to bzz agent i was able to try out the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture care collection.</li>

            <li>I got this entire line free from Head and Shoulders to try out and of all the products this was my favorite hands down surprisingly!!</li>
            <li>It was so easy to style after and after about a month i am almost completely flake free!</li>
            <li>I am really loving this product because it is not expensive like many companies (SheaMoisture, etc) that are especially made for the curly- ladies.</li>
            <li>I’m constantly looking for the next best thing when it comes to moisture.</li>
            <li>more dandruff and made my hair soft and itch free.</li>
            <li>As pictured my curls were popping everywhere and my hair was super moisturized.</li>
            <li>did it make my scalp feel better, it didn&#x27;t tagnle my hair at all &amp; left it really smooth!</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild psoriasis of the scalp.</li>
            <li>I think this was great conditioner, it was moisturizing but not heavy and had I no trouble rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the most success with the co-wash but not as a replacement but more of a mid week wash.</li>
            <li>I got this product free from head&amp; shoulders and the first time I use it, I like the way it made my curls like.  </li>
            <li>I got this free to try from bzz.com at first</li>
            <li>my hair and scalp felt like it was given a new life to be able breathe</li>
            <li>However, the new Head and Shoulders Moisture line has made an improvement on it&#x27;s scent, which I have really enjoyed.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft and the end of my hair was left beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best co-washes I have used because it left my hair feeling moisturized and not completely stripped of oils.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased!  </li>
            <li>I got this product , plus 2 other full sized products or free to review from Bzz Agent and will be using the included coupon to buy more!</li>

            <li>It is a good detangler is the only positive I have to say about this product.  </li>
            <li>It smelled amazing which is a big deal for me when it comes to hair care products.</li>
            <li>Not only does this smell amazing</li>
            <li>It is on the heavy side which is great for my hair.</li>
            <li>Some shampoos can be very stripping, so I have been co-washing or using sulfate free shampoos.</li>
            <li>I got this product free from bzzagent, to try for myself and out of the whole collection</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bzzagent and head and shoulders for this free product.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample from BzzAgent and after using the Moisture Care co-wash, I realized that I really didn&#x27;t need it after using the 2in1.</li>
            <li>This product left my hair feeling moisturized and soft, plus it has a great smell.</li>
            <li>but it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I gave it another try because it leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Co-Wash was my absolute favorite in the line,  What I wanted to know was does this really moisturize my hair and take care of dandruff.  </li>
            <li>The awesomeness of the product made the having to pick the bottle up off of the shower floor worth it.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest and say i have very mixed feeling on this product.</li>
            <li>For those that don&#x27;t have my kind of dandruff this should work for you as a regular co-washing alternative.</li>
            <li>I received the product free from BzzAgent, but would definitely pay to get more.</li>
            <li>trust me its worth a try.</li>
            <li>Bzzagent was nice enough to send me the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture care system.</li>
            <li>I would repurchase, the relief it gives my itchy scalp is worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a product line especially made for AA hair textures that you can buy in any store.</li>
            <li>more than 1-2x a week it gets dried out and really kind of brittle looking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People please get this product it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>my hair was really soft after my wash, I used this product multiple times already and its great.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how soft and manageable it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and shiny it made my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and clean!</li>
            <li>If your hesitant on trying it don&#x27;t be its is one of the best product for hair in my opinion because I was skeptical too when i first got it not knowing how much it changed my hair for the better.</li>
            <li>OMG my hair is SUPER soft, easy to manage, shiny, and smells fantastic.you</li>
            <li>It also provided just the right amount of moisture to help seal my hair and maintain the moisture.</li>
            <li>You can feel your hair just lock in the moisture right after you apply it.</li>
            <li>I am always scared to try new products on my easily damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this new line and will definitely make sure this becomes a staple in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>My hair is manageable, shiny, moisturized and for the first time in forever completely flake free!</li>
            <li>Left my dry hair and scalp very moisturized and smells great!</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling clean and super soft with amazing shine.  </li>
            <li>I love to co wash because the less steps the better for my hair type.  </li>
            <li>After being less than impressed by the scalp soother spray, I had very low expectations for this product.</li>
            <li>Just SUPER smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>so quick and just a few washes with this and my hair was clean and smelled nice.</li>
            <li>It is super quick and easy to use during my mid week wash.</li>
            <li>butyou have made me a loyal customer for LIFE with this new line!!</li>
            <li>My husbands hair is slightly more thick and coarse than mine, he loved it!</li>
            <li>I received the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-Wash for free from a Head &amp; Shoulders Campaign with BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>I received the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-wash Conditioner for free from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I continue to use my regular dandruff shampoo and have found that if I supplement the co-wash during the week I get a good dose of moisture to my locks, they feel soft and manageable (and</li>
            <li>Loving this as a second day hair cleanse without stripping my hair too much.  </li>
            <li>But the New Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Co-wash is EVERYTHING!!!</li>
            <li>my curls were amazing but after continual use its pretty much the same as if I weren&#x27;t using this product and using another.</li>
            <li>This gives your hair just the right moisture you need and aides in getting your hair back to that healthy state that we all want.</li>
            <li>That being said, I really liked the way it left my hair super soft, silky and manageable.</li>
            <li>I loved how rich and thick it was.</li>
            <li>I also loved that I was able to keep my hair in its most natural state for a few days &amp; it didn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>Often, with so many tangles, I break off a ton of hair but definitely saw a noticable difference in the breakage when brushing after this product.</li>
            <li>As a natural, slippage is the most important thing, as the only time I detangle is when I am in the shower washing my hair and I am finger detangling.</li>
            <li>I used the moisture care first</li>
            <li>My hair can be coarse at times, However I was able to run my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li>I was skeptic at first</li>
            <li>the next day after i run mu hands through it :)</li>
            <li>my hair is soft and flake free</li>
            <li>It not only softens the hair, but makes it more manageable than I could have ever asked for.</li>
            <li>This really locks in the moisture!</li>
            <li>My scalp can act really funny some times, but it didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp AT ALL.</li>
            <li>I use for first time</li>
            <li>and I will be recommending this product in this line because after 3 uses within 2 weeks it made my hair feel exactly like I would like it</li>
            <li>I would most definitely purchase this produce.</li>
            <li>Anyone interested in the Scalp Soother I have to say it&#x27;s one of my favorites in this line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried head and shoulders before and I am not particularly a big fan but that has nothing specifically to do with the product and more to do with the type of dandruff I have.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more soon.   </li>
            <li>It has a toothpaste consistency, which weirded me out at first</li>
            <li>I intend to keep using the product and supporting the brand.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite, its thick perfect for my relaxed thick hair to penetrate and coat each strand, after rinsing it make my hair so soft i love this product</li>
            <li>First off, I have never tried a co-wash before.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>The bigger bonus was I got to try this product for free from Buzz Agent!</li>
            <li>It actually appears as a lotion more than a co-wash.</li>
            <li>This product did exactly that.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this works better when used as part of Head Shoulders hair care only.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this collection :-)</li>
            <li>this helps ;)</li>
            <li>All three products worked actually and I will be getting more of this once it is gone.</li>
            <li>However -- after I detangled with my rinse out conditioner, I was able to get enough slip to run my brush through my hair without pulling any out or pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great thing about that is my daughter has coarse superthick dry hair.</li>
            <li>Care Co-Wash works great and is the only line in your brand to eliminate dry scalp and embarrassing flakes for my bi-racial family.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try out this product, since I have been searching for products that work well with my natural hair and a product that will keep my hair moisturized,and I have found it.  </li>
            <li>I recently discovered co washing, so when I got ahold of this I was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li>She has been using the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection for almost a week now and it seems to be helping tremendously.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing cow ash.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos and moisturizers and nothing has really worked.</li>
            <li>, this is about the best you can get, (especially for those who have thick, textured hair).</li>
            <li>I really have been noticing a big difference to the texture and enjoying the smoothness of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really am so grateful to be able to finally have manageable hair.  </li>
            <li>Felt normal for the first time in months!</li>
            <li>My little one who is trying to be more independent by washing her hair on her own didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>The way it leaves your hair feeling silky, soft, and with less frizz is amazing!</li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair super soft and moisturized (bye-bye flakes).</li>
            <li>I was kind of nervous at first because my extensions are expensive and I need to use the best care when treating them if I want them to last me a long time.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t super soft, but I didn&#x27;t have to give in to dryness and add another product.</li>
            <li>My hair natural hair was super moisturized</li>
            <li>and i also love how it gets rid of dry scalp</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular about what hair care products we use, but this receives my stamp of approval.</li>
            <li>Soothes a dry scalp with a lovely cooling feeling and it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li>I left it on my hair for the remainder of my shower, as I normally do, and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>My hair felt amazingly nourished and soft, even in the dry</li>
            <li>My hair type is wavy, frizzy, fine to medium strands, to lower back.</li>
            <li>It is nice and thick, and allows me to detangle my hair (which i keep in a natural Afro state) easily in the shower.</li>
            <li>it is a product you want to try because it really does work</li>
            <li>It was better than expected</li>
            <li>Thanks to buzz agent for testing of this product.</li>
            <li>and it takes a lot of product to really get everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I have very &amp;#34;thirtsy&amp;#34; hair so even with a pre-poo</li>
            <li>Moisturizer really well.</li>
            <li>It was creamy; it felt smooth on contact and also left my hair feeling softer.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for fast wash and go styles.</li>
            <li>and I really do like them.</li>
            <li>Im very picky when it comes to comes to using Conditioners.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and my hair</li>
            <li>I am stuck between this product being &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; and me really liking it.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in this product really work for dandruff hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scalp soother (spray) burns more if you use it after shampooing, because your scalp&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for my dandruff and the scalp soother ruined my hairstyle.</li>
            <li>My hair is very moisturized when washed with this even if I do to follow with a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My scalp is prone to dandruff and to become very itchy.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling smooth</li>
            <li>So it works really well to detangle.</li>
            <li>I could readily tell from the package that the contents were made for textured</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have an issue with flakes, but I did with itching</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing it!</li>
            <li>I never knew what to do about the flakes until now, thanks to Moisture Care</li>
            <li>Thanks BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>but I find that this makes it really stick to my hair</li>
            <li>Thanks to bzzagent</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use much of the product, as it spreads nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning and leave it on until I get ready to leave for work.</li>
            <li>Thanks to head and shoulders</li>
            <li>it worked immediately and not only was I flake free</li>
            <li>The Moisture Care Co-Wash really did the job</li>
            <li>My hair became very tangled.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and co-wash worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get what the point of a co-wash is when you are already using a shampoo/conditioner in one.</li>
            <li>I DID NOT NOTICE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent, I was chosen to try the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care line, and the Co-Wash was among them.</li>
            <li>I slathered it on my hair and used a wide tooth comb to make sure it was evenly distributed throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>My son has my hair type and he really likes this product too.</li>
            <li>I really like the co wash because it has coconut oil in it</li>
            <li>and I really like that.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this product..</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I was sent this Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture care dandruff co-wash to try as part of promotion from the brand and really like it.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do anything for  my hair.</li>
            <li>I must say this product really does what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li>It added so much moisture to my hair...</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to manage their hair and to style it that I don&#x27;t think we will ever be using another shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This co-wash by Head &amp; Shoulders moisture care line really does wonders for my curls.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for textured hair!</li>
            <li>Has some slip but not too much.</li>
            <li>and I noticed after using this that I didn&#x27;t get itchy as fast</li>
            <li>It had so much slip</li>
            <li>I knew that I really something that would help my hair with the itching, dandruff and hives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product left my hair soft and my scalp felt so much better after using this.   </li>
            <li>This cowash did a good job of cleaning my thick hair and my scalp.</li>
            <li>The cowash is amazingly thick and smells so good.</li>
            <li>I got to try my new holy grail cowash, for anyone looking for a great cowash especially for girls with dry damaged and natural hair</li>
            <li>Because for me its not really anything special, at first I thought it was because after the first use (which I wrote about on bzzagent)</li>
            <li>The product burned but I was able to see a difference even while wet!</li>
            <li>I use the regular Head&amp;Shoulders to help manage my dandruff and was excited to see they had a line to help with my issue and help keep my and my daughters moisturized.</li>
            <li>So many people think Head and Shoulders products are for individuals who suffer with dandruff or other scalp conditions.</li>
            <li>I was a bit unsure at first as I don’t really suffer from a flaky scalp but was pleasantly surprised at how silky and moisturized my hair felt.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, curly, color treated/ bleached hair and these products provided just the right amount of moisture without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>it was soft and very very manageable</li>
            <li>Nothing special, I ended up mixing it into my regular conditioner to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>It really coated and my hair, helping to provide more moisture, without wasting half the bottle.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect much from it, but was definitely pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>However, I was pretty surprised at how well it moisturized mine and my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>I normally use Cantu and Jane Carter products, but I could really see myself adding this to my product list.</li>
            <li>Being that I am a natural girl, I prefer to cowash more than regular shampoo to preserve the natural oils in my hair.</li>
            <li>First it has a natural coconut scent that isn&#x27;t overbearing.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, no other products needed after using it.  </li>
            <li>I think I have found a new product for my hair!</li>
            <li>It leaves my scalp feeling great and I have noticed less breakage and tangling due to the added moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick and rich cleansing conditioner that has completely replaced shampoo for me and my hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick and rich cleansing conditioner that has completely replaced shampoo for me and my hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li>After using the co-wash treatment my scalp was less irritated and my hair is more manageable and smoother.</li>
            <li>After using the co-wash treatment my scalp was less irritated and my hair is more manageable and smoother.</li>
            <li>It is better than the previous co washes that I have done</li>
            <li>I also noticed that this particular co-wash, gave my hair some noticeable volume.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the product but wouldn’t recommend it if you’re not looking for extra volume, which I personally am not.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, but what really got me was how thick this product was.</li>
            <li>but it left my hair feeling soft, and tangle free</li>
            <li>The nature of this product also helps make showering faster and easier, which is important in my busy work day, with its ability to deeply moisturize scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick, it&#x27;s a paste really.</li>
            <li>I was wrong, this co-wash had a wonderful creamy texture and was actually moisturizing for me.</li>
            <li>I actually had more flakes in the days following use of this product than I started with!</li>
            <li>my hair is very soft and feels like my hair really soaked in the moisture from co-washing it.  </li>
            <li>My husband, who is African American, and my daughter and I, who are Hispanic and African American, have been very pleased with how soft, shiny and flake free our hair and scalp have been since using this product.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t put my hopes too high.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product after washing with the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This will become one of my newest staples, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>However, I was not offered additional incentives or monetary rewards in exchange for a high status review</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for textured hair girls..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for all textured hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for textured hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for textured hair.</li>
            <li>so it takes a little more effort to rinse it all out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used more expensive products in the past and didn&#x27;t have results as good as this!</li>
            <li>It could provide a little more slip as i work it thru my hair.</li>
            <li>The co-wash from Head and Shoulders left their hair clean and did not strip it from all its natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, AfroCaribbean hair, and live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any strong smells, so it mixes well with other products you would apply to your hair.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be very drying to my natural 4a hair.</li>
            <li>Really like this conditioner it makes my hair feel soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>I know Head &amp; Shoulders as a brand doesn&#x27;t really make products for textured hair, but I was surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>It really moisturized my hair as well as my sisters who is completely natural.</li>
            <li>I will try the Head and Shoulders 2-in1 with the co-wash a few more times to see if it helps my dandruff, but I will keep the co-wash even if it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This don&#x27;t have the normal conditioner feel</li>
            <li>Surely it won&#x27;t be as harsh on my scalp as the shampoo was :)&#x27;</li>
            <li>Coconut and almond oil really made me willing to give it a try since I use coconut oil almost daily.</li>
            <li>I did need about a palm full to cover all of my long hair.</li>
            <li>This is a thick co-wash and it can be used to wash your hair just on its own.</li>
            <li>My scalp is sensitive, gets irritated easily and is very dry.</li>
            <li>It tingles when it hits the scalp, you can feel the dry patches in your hair feel better instantly.</li>
            <li>It left my curls defined, my hair was super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Love that I didn&#x27;t have to use shampoo because my hair is dry enough.</li>
            <li>The product itself doesn&#x27;t seem a whole lot different from the original Head and Shoulders, but the change in smell alone has convinced me to buy the new stuff next winter.</li>
            <li>The shampoo offers more fragrance than the shampoo and the &amp;#34;Scalp Soother Treatment&amp;#34; smells a little like medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new head &amp; shoulders moisture</li>
            <li>I received the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-wash Conditioner as a promotional offer from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>This my new go to co wash.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found my new co-wash for my wash and go&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Anyhow I didn&#x27;t plan on adding this to that regimen but it never hurts to try something new.</li>
            <li>I received the NEW Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection as a part of a promotion.</li>
            <li>I received the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-wash Conditioner as a promotional offer from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I use it in between my shampoo days, or when I just need to fully refresh my hair for a new style and don&#x27;t feel as if a shampoo is needed.</li>
            <li>I was also new to the Head &amp; Shoulders brand too.</li>
            <li>I received the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care</li>
            <li>I received the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-wash Conditioner as a promotional offer from Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve told some of my friends who live by H&amp;S products and</li>
            <li>However, since I have been using the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-Wash</li>
            <li>I tried the new head and shoulders</li>
            <li>My hair felt so soft, smelled great and didn&#x27;t look dry or dull.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t LOVE it because it&#x27;s not doing anything different to my hair than other decent products.</li>
            <li>After using the product after shampooing for several weeks I did notice some difference, my scalp was less irritated and my hair much softer and more managable.</li>
            <li>I believe you will really enjoy using this co-wash, especially as a regular conditioner or deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>However, for whatever reason, I expected the co-wash to preform better, because &#x27;hey, it&#x27;s basically only a conditioner.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair super moisturized, thick and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>She has curly hair and it often times can dry out quickly and get frizzy and this product just made it melt like butter.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for fine hair as it will probably weigh it down.</li>
            <li>My hair felt really clean and free of product build up, but my scalp was tight and dry.</li>
            <li>It was very soft.</li>
            <li>So I was very surprised when i tried the head and shoulders</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m african-american and my hair is transitioning to natural hair and this product added all the moisture right back in!</li>
            <li>No more itching and sore scalp from itching and my hair feel so healthy.</li>
            <li>This is the second Co-wash product on the market I&#x27;ve ever tried and I was pleasantly surprised at the results of this product which is only a fraction of the cost of what I&#x27;ve been using, and with the benefit of specifically helping to stay flake free.</li>
            <li>I got home, disappointed, but still tried it out and LOVED IT!!!</li>
            <li>This is the first co-wash (specific) conditioner I used.</li>
            <li>Moisturized curls/scalp without the feeling of being weighed down and free of  flakes and build up</li>
            <li>My scalp feels clean and refreshed as well, and we all know that can be an issue when using other co-washes on your hair.</li>
            <li>But I must make it clear that just because my experience with Head &amp; Shoulders proved to be a complete disaster, it does not mean that yours will be too.</li>
            <li>I have used other conditioners as a co-wash for many years and I must say that the Head &amp; Shoulders by far left my hair moisturized.  </li>
            <li>first time I tired the product I thought it was OK.</li>
            <li>I received a product sample, coupon, collateral or other special premium from BzzAgent or the brand.</li>
            <li>I can not tell you how must more moisture my hair has, not to mention the feel of my hair, both when it is wet and when it is dry.</li>
            <li>Overall I felt the product did a good job at moisturizing and leaving my scalp less irritated and would definitely buy this product in the future and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I EVEN HAD TO APPLY MY REGULAR HAIR CONDITIONER TO GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE SLIP.  </li>
            <li>After using this in conjunction with the 2-n-1, my hair is soft and flowy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 3 years</li>
            <li>For textured hair; this co-wash works with your hair regimen to deeply moisturize scalp and hair Formulated with vitamin Erich almond oil and coconut essence pH balanced and gentle on chemically treated hair</li>
            <li>I was very apprehensive of this product, ESPECIALLY since it combines the shampoo and conditioner in one.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and moisturized after the cowash.</li>
            <li>It allows me to de-tangle my curly, coily natural hair in no time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cleansing yet very moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li>Having natural curly hair, I have tried product out there.</li>
            <li>My curls are moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>I am natural</li>
            <li>This Head &amp; Shoulders Co-Wash surprised me.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and the way that it left my hair feeling.</li>
            <li>how soft it is after a rinse.</li>
            <li>This product have lessen both of these issues while not drying out my natural 3c-4a</li>
            <li>After using this product, my hair became instantly soft and the detangling process was a breeze.</li>
            <li>When kept with the 2-in 1 bottle of the same collection its looks very neat on the shower rack.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My experience with the co-wash was much the same as the shampoo</li>
            <li>As far as &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; conditioners go, (and that&#x27;s basically what Head &amp; Shoulders Co-Wash is)</li>
            <li>my hair was soft, not dryness</li>
            <li>I can say that it had my hair soft just like the 2n1 Shampoo and Conditioner..</li>
            <li>I can comb through my natural hair without my hair falling out from being tangled.</li>
            <li>When I went natural</li>
            <li>but hair felt so hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>and it has also added some moisture to my natural hair</li>
            <li>This product cleans the hair and scalp without stripping the natural oils and weakening the hair.</li>
            <li>I think every person with natural hair to give it a go.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and bouncy as well as getting and help fight any dandruff I have.</li>
            <li>The co-wash leaves my hair soft and even takes away a lot of the frizz.</li>
            <li>It also helped my style stay in place while irritation and dandruff stayed far away.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft yet my curls are defined.</li>
            <li>I am a natural girl and was concerned.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Additionally, if you color your hair with semi permanent hair color, this product will strip the color completely.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to learn that they have a co-wash.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, definitely works for my itching and dryness</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my routine much easier in the shower, as I am only using the one product in the shower routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling rather soft as well.  </li>
            <li>with me being a natural</li>
            <li>it was so soft.</li>
            <li>Unlike most Caucasian hair that is straight, textured hair is so tightly coiled that the oils cannot travel down the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>After using the co-wash treatment my scalp was less irritated, dry and itchy and my hair is more manageable and smoother.</li>
            <li>texture is nice &amp; thick, a lil goes a long way.</li>
            <li>For anyone with dry scalp, and naturally textured hair, I certainly think you should give this Co-Wash</li>
            <li>I would use this product line again and would highly recommend this product to others who are looking for the same relief</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to others who are looking for the same relief</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for my 2yr old and it left his hair as soft as mine.</li>
            <li>I would defnetly be using this product line again and would highly recommend this product to others who are looking for the same relief</li>
            <li>The only reason I can&#x27;t give it a 5 is because their coconut oil isn&#x27;t as high on the ingredients list as I&#x27;d like it</li>
            <li>I am currently using the new product line from Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li>I have a very itchy &amp; dry scalp.</li>
            <li>This really relieves my dry course hair.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling smooth after I dried it</li>
            <li>With that said I think head &amp; shoulders should try and make a product that&#x27;s all natural because that would reach a wider african-American community who only use natural products on their hair.</li>
            <li>It left my hair manageable and soft and didn&#x27;t strip my hair of my natural oils.  </li>
            <li>After all, if things went south like last time, I could always just gift everything to my sister, who is even more of a hair-care fanatic than I am.  </li>
            <li>Although the product was thick it came out of the bottle easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super thick and feels like a high end hair mask.</li>
            <li>My daughter who has extremely dry, thick, long hair experienced the same results as I did and that&#x27;s not an often occurrence considering that our different hair types.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I made a point to not put any other product on my hair for 2 days.</li>
            <li>we natural hair sisters usually just do a co-wash to our hair and it helps hold in the moisture very well while your hair is still very manageable.</li>
            <li>So I will review them all here in case anyone is interested in trying the other products mentioned in this line.</li>
            <li>However, as I stated earlier in my review, any hopes I had for this brand where quickly shot down.  </li>
            <li>I recently went natural and my new growth is very coarse.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is very thick, smells clean and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  thick and rich cleansing and maybe that has completely replaced shampoo for me..</li>
            <li>I would have to water my hair down to work up a good lather because it was so thick!</li>
            <li>After using a hair conditioner that caused a severe allergic reaction which included: blistering hives from my scalp to legs, severe dandruff, rawness and general itchiness.</li>
            <li>But, having course, natural African American hair, we need a creamy moisturizer  to complete the job.</li>
            <li>Every co-wash I have tried never left my hair moisturized or soft.</li>
            <li>I like it because on non-shampoo days I still rinse my hair in the shower and this helps to put moisture back into my tresses and keep them soft.</li>
            <li>Since I have gone natural I only wash my hair 2 times a month</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be continuing to use this product to completely help control it.</li>
            <li>I actually used this product to test two styles,my natural fro and straighten.</li>
            <li>and it left my hair feeling soft and untangled.</li>
            <li>and it definitely didn&#x27;t make it soft..</li>
            <li>The scalp treatment is to be applied directly to the scalp where itching/flaking is present, yet I haven&#x27;t had to use it.</li>
            <li>After using it my curls felt a lot more bouncy and its not so heavy as to way it down either.</li>
            <li>My hair is very manageable and not dried out when I air dry or blow dry.</li>
            <li>I had noticeably less dandruff and flakes and almost no itching after the first use.</li>
            <li>I really thought it was going to be like other co-washes I have used.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not pretty much coming out as soon as I rub it in.</li>
            <li>I now use every other day and it makes me so much happier with my hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s missing a little something, maybe a tinge more moisturizer</li>
            <li>The product was thick, rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>I used this with the 2-in-1 shampoo that left my hair soft after washing, but when I followed up with this conditioner it took the softness to the next level.</li>
            <li>I am African American with natural hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair came out so soft that I actually didn&#x27;t put any oil in it till the second day because I forgot!</li>
            <li>My hair is think a curly and most products say they can help, but only make it worse.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I have found other than at a salon that actually moisturizes my hair and scalp while conditioning at the same time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent lots on high end hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally suffer from dandruff since I have been natural but after getting a silk press in April I have had slight dandruff every since even though my hair has been washed weekly.  </li>
            <li>I have mixed (black and white) hair that I wear natural and straight.</li>
            <li>I received the co-wash along with a few other of their products free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I was a little confused because most &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34; products are meat to take the place of shampoo / condition that you would normally do.</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly, dry shoulder length hair and moisture is extremely important for my hair type.</li>
            <li>The co-wash, along with the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Shampoo, helps to additionally cleanse the daily summer residue that my hair tends to build up, fight dry heat flakes and leaves my hair easy to style without the use of any other heavy or harmful products.  </li>
            <li>Just tried my new Head and Shoulders Moisture care collection from my Bzz Agent Promotion the other day</li>
            <li>which is huge when you have thin hair.</li>

            <li> I am a bzzagent and was sent this product to use and review, and I am so glad that I did!</li>
            <li> I truly love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer I had the pleasure of using this for my hair and my sons hair and it works amazing</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love the Co-Wash!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> But I am glad I tried this!</li>
            <li> scalp feels and looks so much better!</li>
            <li> Because of my hair&#x27;s kinky texture, moisture is easily stripped from it, so I was happy when I was sent a co-wash as well as a shampoo, so that I could keep with my regimen.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased and it also had a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This Head and Shoulder co wash is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing on my hair</li>
            <li> it is amazing.</li>
            <li> and they too are equally amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing product</li>
            <li> But, what you want and need to know is that the Co-Wash works amazingly at eliminating flakes and dandruff.</li>
            <li> it has amazing slip.</li>
            <li> I did not expect for this product to be so amazing.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I decided to try it on my own hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sold on the dandruff aspect of it, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in that department, but it&#x27;s a great, affordable co-wash either way!</li>
            <li> Nice to know</li>
            <li> I can use my own shampoo and conditioner them use the co-wash and still have the benefit of having the moisture from the head and shoulders moisture care.  </li>
            <li> I liked it bit</li>
            <li> i received this product as part of a promotion for a brand, however, all opinions are solely based on my own review.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say....</li>
            <li> *Please note the opinions and views in this review are solely my own, I was given the product as a promotion from the company BZZagent.</li>
            <li> rather I was asked to provide my honest review and the opinions are solely my own honest feedback and opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> I would have never tried this on my own</li>
            <li> Its a creamy cleanser with no lather and smells really nice.  </li>
            <li> It smells heavenly, and leaves your hair with a nice coconut tropical fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand, but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> This has a warm soothing smell that is pleasing to the nose.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell also</li>
            <li> but it wasnt effective as the Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> HONESTLY, I DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND IT&#x27;S PURPOSE.  </li>
            <li> but if you just need a conditioner this is a nice one to try.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I do kind of like it.</li>
            <li> And my curls were nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really liked it.</li>
            <li> I tried the co-wash in return for honest feedback, through bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> now have my own head and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> it has nice oils in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Thanks for these wonderful product keep them coming!!</li>
            <li> Thanks bzzagent for allowing me to try this for free!!!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to hair products so for me to like a product, it&#x27;s got to be a good one.</li>
            <li> but the set of the new head and shoulder 2 in 1 shampoo and this product is great together.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders, having always been marketed as helping to relieve the discomfort of a dry and flaky scalp, seemed like the perfect product for me to try.</li>

            <li> product know that this is a great addition to my  Natural hair regimen.</li>
            <li> The most important aspect of a co wash is it moisture infusing abilities.</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky hair and the cowash conditioner provided great slip needed to detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> , the scent of this line is incredible and leaves my long hair looking healthy and shiny throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I am a member of BzzAgent and was able to try this product for free.</li>

            <li> After using this product that I received as a promotional product, I like the way it moisturized my curly hair and made it feel soft and moisturized it worked great for my hair texture  </li>
            <li> and it is best for textured /curly hair when applying the product it was to wet hair.</li>
            <li> I  was able to try this product for free through BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> But it really is just as good.</li>
            <li> I loved that this new line of Head and Shoulders products are formulated with vitamin E–rich almond oil and coconut essence - unlike most anti-dandruff products that smell like medicine</li>
            <li> With this 2 in 1 Co Wash after thr shower my hair was easy to comb through felt soft and moisturized and smelled great.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product to try j am really glad head and shoulders made a product for black women.</li>
            <li> I really loved that the scent wasn’t the typical medicated scent as with many anti-dandruff products, it had a really pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I left it in a good 10 minutes before rinsing and did not have to use any additional product in my hair!</li>
            <li> Other than that this is an awesome product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smelling great, shiny, flake free and so soft.  </li>
            <li> I could run my fingers through it quite easily to detangle it.</li>
            <li> i would say if your hair is pron to dryness already, or it brakes off easily, don&#x27;t use this line alone.</li>
            <li> Gravity helps in getting it out of the bottle easily.</li>
            <li> My curly hair doesn&#x27;t like most shampoos and after using Head and Shoulders before (it was so drying and had my hair feeling squeaky clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and one of my absolute favorite scents.</li>
            <li> A few more tweeks and this product can be awesome.</li>
            <li> It also provided a lot of slip allowing me to comb through my hair with my fingers easily.</li>
            <li> It was easy to put on my hair and easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> This co wash is an amazing cleansing conditioner which is gently scented and I love its consistency.</li>
            <li> This has a really nice smell and my hair felt nice and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it could possibly be as good as my high end, holy grail, co-wash products like DevaCurl or Wen.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it contains almond oil and is specially formulated for textured hair.</li>
            <li> This was first given to me by Head and Shoulders company and bzzagent to try and get my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I liked it at first, but my scalp is too oily to use co-wash.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly I like this new head and shoulders moisture care collection.</li>
            <li> no tangles or knots easily combed out and styled i recieved my product free to test from buzzAgent</li>
            <li> My favorite product is the co-wash, it leaves my hair feeling super silky and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This worked exceptionally well for her hair, but too strong chemically for her scalp (very sensitive skin and scalp).</li>
            <li> I was a little thrown by the texture of the products but was still very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to say that it left my hair feeling light and moisturized.</li>

            <li> I recieve a full bottle of this FREE from BZZAGAENT and HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS....</li>
            <li> I noticed a significant change in</li>
            <li> As I said in my review of the shampoo, I haven&#x27;t had the best experience with Head &amp; Shoulders products in the past.</li>
            <li> The conditioners that come with hair dye have been the best, (most conditioning), for my thick, unruly hair, but I&#x27;ve yet to encounter any non-hair dye conditioner that beats this Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Co-Wash!</li>
            <li> I was excited to join the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection for 2 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a free, full size bottle of the Co-Wash from BzzAgent over a month ago.</li>
            <li> But I was really excited to try it out when I was sent this product to reveiw.</li>
            <li> Its worth it!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super manageable/tangle free.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels clean AND moisturized, but not greasy or clogged.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got to try it free from a promotion, Thanks Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair hydrated and clean.</li>
            <li> More importantly, I have had no burning or intense itching.</li>
            <li> My scalp also felt nice and it left my strands looking healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> It rinsed thoroughly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> And the scent is pleasant, but not-overpowering as to attract bees to your hair outside.</li>
            <li> I honestly was truly surprised by the results!</li>
            <li> It smells good and is super thick as to where I didn&#x27;t feel that I needed to use a lot to get a good wash.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, I have found my hair to be full of moisture (in a good way!), smooth and easier to tame.  </li>
            <li> Oh.. I don&#x27;t want to forget the smell is amazing and not harsh.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from buzz agent, and normally I don&#x27;t like many hair care products that go together</li>
            <li> It gave me good overall moisture and helped with the detangling process as well.</li>
            <li> Overall, it was moisturizing, cleansing and provided good volume.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find how nicely this worked.</li>
            <li> Co-Wash was my absolute favorite in the line.  </li>
            <li> Go check out my full review on my youtube channel at Lifeintheskye.</li>
            <li> my curly hair doesn&#x27;t like the way 2 in one shampoos and conditioners which head and shoulders was famous for, because they don&#x27;t provide as much moisture.</li>
            <li> along with my 2 sister who have also purchased this product in full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Head &amp; Shoulders for the free sample!</li>
            <li> I also love that it is pH balanced and gentle on chemically treated hair.  </li>
            <li> and it really looks and feels healthy.</li>
            <li> so thanks to bzz agent i was able to try out the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture care collection.</li>
            <li> Opinion is my true feelings.</li>
            <li> It also smells good, I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Smells good and extra perk, I&#x27;m flake-free!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need to worry so it the dryness from shampooing often while getting the full benefits of shampoo (iE, a cleansed scalp and hair).</li>
            <li> I got this entire line free from Head and Shoulders to try out and of all the products this was my favorite hands down surprisingly!!</li>
            <li> It was so easy to style after and after about a month i am almost completely flake free!</li>
            <li> I am really loving this product because it is not expensive like many companies (SheaMoisture, etc) that are especially made for the curly- ladies.</li>
            <li> I’m constantly looking for the next best thing when it comes to moisture.</li>
            <li> more dandruff and made my hair soft and itch free.</li>
            <li> As pictured my curls were popping everywhere and my hair was super moisturized.</li>
            <li> did it make my scalp feel better, it didn&#x27;t tagnle my hair at all &amp; left it really smooth!</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild psoriasis of the scalp.</li>
            <li> I think this was great conditioner, it was moisturizing but not heavy and had I no trouble rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the most success with the co-wash but not as a replacement but more of a mid week wash.</li>
            <li> I got this product free from head&amp; shoulders and the first time I use it, I like the way it made my curls like.  </li>
            <li> I got this free to try from bzz.com at first</li>
            <li> my hair and scalp felt like it was given a new life to be able breathe</li>
            <li> However, the new Head and Shoulders Moisture line has made an improvement on it&#x27;s scent, which I have really enjoyed.</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft and the end of my hair was left beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best co-washes I have used because it left my hair feeling moisturized and not completely stripped of oils.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased!  </li>
            <li> I got this product , plus 2 other full sized products or free to review from Bzz Agent and will be using the included coupon to buy more!</li>
            <li> , it was that pretty,  i want to preserve the curls!</li>
            <li> I got a HUGE free sample of the new Co-wash from Head and shoulders</li>
            <li> This product stayed in place making it easy to make sure that all of my strands were totally covered.</li>
            <li> It is a good detangler is the only positive I have to say about this product.  </li>
            <li> It smelled amazing which is a big deal for me when it comes to hair care products.</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell amazing</li>
            <li> It is on the heavy side which is great for my hair.</li>
            <li> Some shampoos can be very stripping, so I have been co-washing or using sulfate free shampoos.</li>
            <li> I got this product free from bzzagent, to try for myself and out of the whole collection</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzzagent and head and shoulders for this free product.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from BzzAgent and after using the Moisture Care co-wash, I realized that I really didn&#x27;t need it after using the 2in1.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling moisturized and soft, plus it has a great smell.</li>
            <li> but it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I gave it another try because it leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Co-Wash was my absolute favorite in the line,  What I wanted to know was does this really moisturize my hair and take care of dandruff.  </li>
            <li> The awesomeness of the product made the having to pick the bottle up off of the shower floor worth it.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest and say i have very mixed feeling on this product.</li>
            <li> For those that don&#x27;t have my kind of dandruff this should work for you as a regular co-washing alternative.</li>
            <li> I received the product free from BzzAgent, but would definitely pay to get more.</li>
            <li> trust me its worth a try.</li>
            <li> Bzzagent was nice enough to send me the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture care system.</li>
            <li> I would repurchase, the relief it gives my itchy scalp is worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a product line especially made for AA hair textures that you can buy in any store.</li>
            <li> more than 1-2x a week it gets dried out and really kind of brittle looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People please get this product it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> my hair was really soft after my wash, I used this product multiple times already and its great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how soft and manageable it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and shiny it made my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and clean!</li>
            <li> If your hesitant on trying it don&#x27;t be its is one of the best product for hair in my opinion because I was skeptical too when i first got it not knowing how much it changed my hair for the better.</li>
            <li> OMG my hair is SUPER soft, easy to manage, shiny, and smells fantastic.you</li>
            <li> It also provided just the right amount of moisture to help seal my hair and maintain the moisture.</li>
            <li> You can feel your hair just lock in the moisture right after you apply it.</li>
            <li> I am always scared to try new products on my easily damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this new line and will definitely make sure this becomes a staple in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> My hair is manageable, shiny, moisturized and for the first time in forever completely flake free!</li>
            <li> Left my dry hair and scalp very moisturized and smells great!</li>

            <li> I love to co wash because the less steps the better for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> After being less than impressed by the scalp soother spray, I had very low expectations for this product.</li>
            <li> Just SUPER smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> so quick and just a few washes with this and my hair was clean and smelled nice.</li>
            <li> It is super quick and easy to use during my mid week wash.</li>
            <li> butyou have made me a loyal customer for LIFE with this new line!!</li>
            <li> My husbands hair is slightly more thick and coarse than mine, he loved it!</li>
            <li> I received the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-Wash for free from a Head &amp; Shoulders Campaign with BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> I received the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-wash Conditioner for free from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I continue to use my regular dandruff shampoo and have found that if I supplement the co-wash during the week I get a good dose of moisture to my locks, they feel soft and manageable (and</li>
            <li> Loving this as a second day hair cleanse without stripping my hair too much.  </li>
            <li> But the New Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Co-wash is EVERYTHING!!!</li>
            <li> my curls were amazing but after continual use its pretty much the same as if I weren&#x27;t using this product and using another.</li>
            <li> This gives your hair just the right moisture you need and aides in getting your hair back to that healthy state that we all want.</li>
            <li> That being said, I really liked the way it left my hair super soft, silky and manageable.</li>
            <li> I loved how rich and thick it was.</li>
            <li> I also loved that I was able to keep my hair in its most natural state for a few days &amp; it didn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> Often, with so many tangles, I break off a ton of hair but definitely saw a noticable difference in the breakage when brushing after this product.</li>
            <li> As a natural, slippage is the most important thing, as the only time I detangle is when I am in the shower washing my hair and I am finger detangling.</li>
            <li> I used the moisture care first</li>
            <li> My hair can be coarse at times, However I was able to run my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptic at first</li>
            <li> the next day after i run mu hands through it :)</li>
            <li> my hair is soft and flake free</li>
            <li> It not only softens the hair, but makes it more manageable than I could have ever asked for.</li>
            <li> This really locks in the moisture!</li>
            <li> My scalp can act really funny some times, but it didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I use for first time</li>
            <li> and I will be recommending this product in this line because after 3 uses within 2 weeks it made my hair feel exactly like I would like it</li>
            <li> I would most definitely purchase this produce.</li>
            <li> Anyone interested in the Scalp Soother I have to say it&#x27;s one of my favorites in this line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried head and shoulders before and I am not particularly a big fan but that has nothing specifically to do with the product and more to do with the type of dandruff I have.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more soon.   </li>
            <li> It has a toothpaste consistency, which weirded me out at first</li>
            <li> I intend to keep using the product and supporting the brand.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite, its thick perfect for my relaxed thick hair to penetrate and coat each strand, after rinsing it make my hair so soft i love this product</li>
            <li> First off, I have never tried a co-wash before.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The bigger bonus was I got to try this product for free from Buzz Agent!</li>
            <li> It actually appears as a lotion more than a co-wash.</li>
            <li> This product did exactly that.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this works better when used as part of Head Shoulders hair care only.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this collection :-)</li>
            <li> this helps ;)</li>
            <li> All three products worked actually and I will be getting more of this once it is gone.</li>
            <li> However -- after I detangled with my rinse out conditioner, I was able to get enough slip to run my brush through my hair without pulling any out or pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great thing about that is my daughter has coarse superthick dry hair.</li>
            <li> Care Co-Wash works great and is the only line in your brand to eliminate dry scalp and embarrassing flakes for my bi-racial family.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try out this product, since I have been searching for products that work well with my natural hair and a product that will keep my hair moisturized,and I have found it.  </li>
            <li> I recently discovered co washing, so when I got ahold of this I was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li> She has been using the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection for almost a week now and it seems to be helping tremendously.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cow ash.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so soft and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos and moisturizers and nothing has really worked.</li>
            <li> , this is about the best you can get, (especially for those who have thick, textured hair).</li>
            <li> I really have been noticing a big difference to the texture and enjoying the smoothness of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really am so grateful to be able to finally have manageable hair.  </li>
            <li> Felt normal for the first time in months!</li>
            <li> My little one who is trying to be more independent by washing her hair on her own didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> The way it leaves your hair feeling silky, soft, and with less frizz is amazing!</li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair super soft and moisturized (bye-bye flakes).</li>
            <li> I was kind of nervous at first because my extensions are expensive and I need to use the best care when treating them if I want them to last me a long time.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t super soft, but I didn&#x27;t have to give in to dryness and add another product.</li>
            <li> My hair natural hair was super moisturized</li>
            <li> and i also love how it gets rid of dry scalp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about what hair care products we use, but this receives my stamp of approval.</li>
            <li> Soothes a dry scalp with a lovely cooling feeling and it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li> I left it on my hair for the remainder of my shower, as I normally do, and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> My hair felt amazingly nourished and soft, even in the dry</li>
            <li> My hair type is wavy, frizzy, fine to medium strands, to lower back.</li>
            <li> It is nice and thick, and allows me to detangle my hair (which i keep in a natural Afro state) easily in the shower.</li>
            <li> it is a product you want to try because it really does work</li>
            <li> It was better than expected</li>
            <li> Thanks to buzz agent for testing of this product.</li>
            <li> and it takes a lot of product to really get everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I have very &amp;#34;thirtsy&amp;#34; hair so even with a pre-poo</li>
            <li> Moisturizer really well.</li>
            <li> It was creamy; it felt smooth on contact and also left my hair feeling softer.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for fast wash and go styles.</li>
            <li> and I really do like them.</li>
            <li> Im very picky when it comes to comes to using Conditioners.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and my hair</li>
            <li> I am stuck between this product being &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; and me really liking it.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product really work for dandruff hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scalp soother (spray) burns more if you use it after shampooing, because your scalp&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for my dandruff and the scalp soother ruined my hairstyle.</li>
            <li> My hair is very moisturized when washed with this even if I do to follow with a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is prone to dandruff and to become very itchy.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling smooth</li>
            <li> So it works really well to detangle.</li>
            <li> I could readily tell from the package that the contents were made for textured</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have an issue with flakes, but I did with itching</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing it!</li>
            <li> I never knew what to do about the flakes until now, thanks to Moisture Care</li>
            <li> Thanks BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> but I find that this makes it really stick to my hair</li>
            <li> Thanks to bzzagent</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use much of the product, as it spreads nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning and leave it on until I get ready to leave for work.</li>
            <li> Thanks to head and shoulders</li>
            <li> it worked immediately and not only was I flake free</li>
            <li> The Moisture Care Co-Wash really did the job</li>
            <li> My hair became very tangled.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and co-wash worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get what the point of a co-wash is when you are already using a shampoo/conditioner in one.</li>
            <li> I DID NOT NOTICE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I was chosen to try the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care line, and the Co-Wash was among them.</li>
            <li> I slathered it on my hair and used a wide tooth comb to make sure it was evenly distributed throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> My son has my hair type and he really likes this product too.</li>
            <li> I really like the co wash because it has coconut oil in it</li>
            <li> and I really like that.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product..</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> I was sent this Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture care dandruff co-wash to try as part of promotion from the brand and really like it.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do anything for  my hair.</li>
            <li> I must say this product really does what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> It added so much moisture to my hair...</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to manage their hair and to style it that I don&#x27;t think we will ever be using another shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This co-wash by Head &amp; Shoulders moisture care line really does wonders for my curls.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for textured hair!</li>
            <li> Has some slip but not too much.</li>
            <li> and I noticed after using this that I didn&#x27;t get itchy as fast</li>
            <li> It had so much slip</li>
            <li> I knew that I really something that would help my hair with the itching, dandruff and hives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product left my hair soft and my scalp felt so much better after using this.   </li>
            <li> This cowash did a good job of cleaning my thick hair and my scalp.</li>
            <li> The cowash is amazingly thick and smells so good.</li>
            <li> I got to try my new holy grail cowash, for anyone looking for a great cowash especially for girls with dry damaged and natural hair</li>
            <li> Because for me its not really anything special, at first I thought it was because after the first use (which I wrote about on bzzagent)</li>
            <li> The product burned but I was able to see a difference even while wet!</li>
            <li> I use the regular Head&amp;Shoulders to help manage my dandruff and was excited to see they had a line to help with my issue and help keep my and my daughters moisturized.</li>
            <li> So many people think Head and Shoulders products are for individuals who suffer with dandruff or other scalp conditions.</li>
            <li> I was a bit unsure at first as I don’t really suffer from a flaky scalp but was pleasantly surprised at how silky and moisturized my hair felt.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, curly, color treated/ bleached hair and these products provided just the right amount of moisture without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> it was soft and very very manageable</li>
            <li> Nothing special, I ended up mixing it into my regular conditioner to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> It really coated and my hair, helping to provide more moisture, without wasting half the bottle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect much from it, but was definitely pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> However, I was pretty surprised at how well it moisturized mine and my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I normally use Cantu and Jane Carter products, but I could really see myself adding this to my product list.</li>
            <li> Being that I am a natural girl, I prefer to cowash more than regular shampoo to preserve the natural oils in my hair.</li>
            <li> First it has a natural coconut scent that isn&#x27;t overbearing.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, no other products needed after using it.  </li>
            <li> I think I have found a new product for my hair!</li>
            <li> It leaves my scalp feeling great and I have noticed less breakage and tangling due to the added moisture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick and rich cleansing conditioner that has completely replaced shampoo for me and my hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick and rich cleansing conditioner that has completely replaced shampoo for me and my hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li> After using the co-wash treatment my scalp was less irritated and my hair is more manageable and smoother.</li>
            <li> After using the co-wash treatment my scalp was less irritated and my hair is more manageable and smoother.</li>
            <li> It is better than the previous co washes that I have done</li>
            <li> I also noticed that this particular co-wash, gave my hair some noticeable volume.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the product but wouldn’t recommend it if you’re not looking for extra volume, which I personally am not.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, but what really got me was how thick this product was.</li>
            <li> but it left my hair feeling soft, and tangle free</li>
            <li> The nature of this product also helps make showering faster and easier, which is important in my busy work day, with its ability to deeply moisturize scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick, it&#x27;s a paste really.</li>
            <li> I was wrong, this co-wash had a wonderful creamy texture and was actually moisturizing for me.</li>
            <li> I actually had more flakes in the days following use of this product than I started with!</li>
            <li> my hair is very soft and feels like my hair really soaked in the moisture from co-washing it.  </li>
            <li> My husband, who is African American, and my daughter and I, who are Hispanic and African American, have been very pleased with how soft, shiny and flake free our hair and scalp have been since using this product.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t put my hopes too high.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this product after washing with the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This will become one of my newest staples, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> However, I was not offered additional incentives or monetary rewards in exchange for a high status review</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for textured hair girls..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for all textured hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for textured hair</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for textured hair.</li>
            <li> so it takes a little more effort to rinse it all out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive products in the past and didn&#x27;t have results as good as this!</li>
            <li> It could provide a little more slip as i work it thru my hair.</li>
            <li> The co-wash from Head and Shoulders left their hair clean and did not strip it from all its natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, AfroCaribbean hair, and live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any strong smells, so it mixes well with other products you would apply to your hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be very drying to my natural 4a hair.</li>
            <li> Really like this conditioner it makes my hair feel soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li> I know Head &amp; Shoulders as a brand doesn&#x27;t really make products for textured hair, but I was surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> It really moisturized my hair as well as my sisters who is completely natural.</li>
            <li> I will try the Head and Shoulders 2-in1 with the co-wash a few more times to see if it helps my dandruff, but I will keep the co-wash even if it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This don&#x27;t have the normal conditioner feel</li>
            <li> Surely it won&#x27;t be as harsh on my scalp as the shampoo was :)&#x27;</li>
            <li> Coconut and almond oil really made me willing to give it a try since I use coconut oil almost daily.</li>
            <li> I did need about a palm full to cover all of my long hair.</li>
            <li> This is a thick co-wash and it can be used to wash your hair just on its own.</li>
            <li> My scalp is sensitive, gets irritated easily and is very dry.</li>
            <li> It tingles when it hits the scalp, you can feel the dry patches in your hair feel better instantly.</li>
            <li> It left my curls defined, my hair was super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Love that I didn&#x27;t have to use shampoo because my hair is dry enough.</li>
            <li> The product itself doesn&#x27;t seem a whole lot different from the original Head and Shoulders, but the change in smell alone has convinced me to buy the new stuff next winter.</li>
            <li> The shampoo offers more fragrance than the shampoo and the &amp;#34;Scalp Soother Treatment&amp;#34; smells a little like medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new head &amp; shoulders moisture</li>
            <li> I received the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-wash Conditioner as a promotional offer from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> This my new go to co wash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found my new co-wash for my wash and go&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Anyhow I didn&#x27;t plan on adding this to that regimen but it never hurts to try something new.</li>
            <li> I received the NEW Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection as a part of a promotion.</li>
            <li> I received the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-wash Conditioner as a promotional offer from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I use it in between my shampoo days, or when I just need to fully refresh my hair for a new style and don&#x27;t feel as if a shampoo is needed.</li>
            <li> I was also new to the Head &amp; Shoulders brand too.</li>
            <li> I received the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care</li>
            <li> I received the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-wash Conditioner as a promotional offer from Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve told some of my friends who live by H&amp;S products and</li>
            <li> However, since I have been using the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-Wash</li>
            <li> I tried the new head and shoulders</li>
            <li> My hair felt so soft, smelled great and didn&#x27;t look dry or dull.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t LOVE it because it&#x27;s not doing anything different to my hair than other decent products.</li>
            <li> After using the product after shampooing for several weeks I did notice some difference, my scalp was less irritated and my hair much softer and more managable.</li>
            <li> I believe you will really enjoy using this co-wash, especially as a regular conditioner or deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> However, for whatever reason, I expected the co-wash to preform better, because &#x27;hey, it&#x27;s basically only a conditioner.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair super moisturized, thick and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> She has curly hair and it often times can dry out quickly and get frizzy and this product just made it melt like butter.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for fine hair as it will probably weigh it down.</li>
            <li> My hair felt really clean and free of product build up, but my scalp was tight and dry.</li>
            <li> It was very soft.</li>
            <li> So I was very surprised when i tried the head and shoulders</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m african-american and my hair is transitioning to natural hair and this product added all the moisture right back in!</li>
            <li> No more itching and sore scalp from itching and my hair feel so healthy.</li>
            <li> This is the second Co-wash product on the market I&#x27;ve ever tried and I was pleasantly surprised at the results of this product which is only a fraction of the cost of what I&#x27;ve been using, and with the benefit of specifically helping to stay flake free.</li>
            <li> I got home, disappointed, but still tried it out and LOVED IT!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first co-wash (specific) conditioner I used.</li>
            <li> Moisturized curls/scalp without the feeling of being weighed down and free of  flakes and build up</li>
            <li> My scalp feels clean and refreshed as well, and we all know that can be an issue when using other co-washes on your hair.</li>
            <li> But I must make it clear that just because my experience with Head &amp; Shoulders proved to be a complete disaster, it does not mean that yours will be too.</li>
            <li> I have used other conditioners as a co-wash for many years and I must say that the Head &amp; Shoulders by far left my hair moisturized.  </li>
            <li> first time I tired the product I thought it was OK.</li>
            <li> I received a product sample, coupon, collateral or other special premium from BzzAgent or the brand.</li>
            <li> I can not tell you how must more moisture my hair has, not to mention the feel of my hair, both when it is wet and when it is dry.</li>
            <li> Overall I felt the product did a good job at moisturizing and leaving my scalp less irritated and would definitely buy this product in the future and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I EVEN HAD TO APPLY MY REGULAR HAIR CONDITIONER TO GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE SLIP.  </li>
            <li> After using this in conjunction with the 2-n-1, my hair is soft and flowy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 3 years</li>
            <li> For textured hair; this co-wash works with your hair regimen to deeply moisturize scalp and hair Formulated with vitamin Erich almond oil and coconut essence pH balanced and gentle on chemically treated hair</li>
            <li> I was very apprehensive of this product, ESPECIALLY since it combines the shampoo and conditioner in one.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and moisturized after the cowash.</li>
            <li> It allows me to de-tangle my curly, coily natural hair in no time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cleansing yet very moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li> Having natural curly hair, I have tried product out there.</li>
            <li> My curls are moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> I am natural</li>
            <li> This Head &amp; Shoulders Co-Wash surprised me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and the way that it left my hair feeling.</li>
            <li> how soft it is after a rinse.</li>
            <li> This product have lessen both of these issues while not drying out my natural 3c-4a</li>
            <li> After using this product, my hair became instantly soft and the detangling process was a breeze.</li>
            <li> When kept with the 2-in 1 bottle of the same collection its looks very neat on the shower rack.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My experience with the co-wash was much the same as the shampoo</li>
            <li> As far as &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; conditioners go, (and that&#x27;s basically what Head &amp; Shoulders Co-Wash is)</li>
            <li> my hair was soft, not dryness</li>
            <li> I can say that it had my hair soft just like the 2n1 Shampoo and Conditioner..</li>
            <li> I can comb through my natural hair without my hair falling out from being tangled.</li>
            <li> When I went natural</li>
            <li> but hair felt so hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> and it has also added some moisture to my natural hair</li>
            <li> This product cleans the hair and scalp without stripping the natural oils and weakening the hair.</li>
            <li> I think every person with natural hair to give it a go.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and bouncy as well as getting and help fight any dandruff I have.</li>
            <li> The co-wash leaves my hair soft and even takes away a lot of the frizz.</li>
            <li> It also helped my style stay in place while irritation and dandruff stayed far away.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft yet my curls are defined.</li>
            <li> I am a natural girl and was concerned.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Additionally, if you color your hair with semi permanent hair color, this product will strip the color completely.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to learn that they have a co-wash.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, definitely works for my itching and dryness</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my routine much easier in the shower, as I am only using the one product in the shower routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling rather soft as well.  </li>
            <li> with me being a natural</li>
            <li> it was so soft.</li>
            <li> Unlike most Caucasian hair that is straight, textured hair is so tightly coiled that the oils cannot travel down the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> After using the co-wash treatment my scalp was less irritated, dry and itchy and my hair is more manageable and smoother.</li>
            <li> texture is nice &amp; thick, a lil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> For anyone with dry scalp, and naturally textured hair, I certainly think you should give this Co-Wash</li>
            <li> I would use this product line again and would highly recommend this product to others who are looking for the same relief</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to others who are looking for the same relief</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough for my 2yr old and it left his hair as soft as mine.</li>
            <li> I would defnetly be using this product line again and would highly recommend this product to others who are looking for the same relief</li>
            <li> The only reason I can&#x27;t give it a 5 is because their coconut oil isn&#x27;t as high on the ingredients list as I&#x27;d like it</li>
            <li> I am currently using the new product line from Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> I have a very itchy &amp; dry scalp.</li>
            <li> This really relieves my dry course hair.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling smooth after I dried it</li>
            <li> With that said I think head &amp; shoulders should try and make a product that&#x27;s all natural because that would reach a wider african-American community who only use natural products on their hair.</li>
            <li> It left my hair manageable and soft and didn&#x27;t strip my hair of my natural oils.  </li>
            <li> After all, if things went south like last time, I could always just gift everything to my sister, who is even more of a hair-care fanatic than I am.  </li>
            <li> Although the product was thick it came out of the bottle easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super thick and feels like a high end hair mask.</li>
            <li> My daughter who has extremely dry, thick, long hair experienced the same results as I did and that&#x27;s not an often occurrence considering that our different hair types.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I made a point to not put any other product on my hair for 2 days.</li>
            <li> we natural hair sisters usually just do a co-wash to our hair and it helps hold in the moisture very well while your hair is still very manageable.</li>
            <li> So I will review them all here in case anyone is interested in trying the other products mentioned in this line.</li>
            <li> However, as I stated earlier in my review, any hopes I had for this brand where quickly shot down.  </li>
            <li> I recently went natural and my new growth is very coarse.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very thick, smells clean and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  thick and rich cleansing and maybe that has completely replaced shampoo for me..</li>
            <li> I would have to water my hair down to work up a good lather because it was so thick!</li>
            <li> After using a hair conditioner that caused a severe allergic reaction which included: blistering hives from my scalp to legs, severe dandruff, rawness and general itchiness.</li>
            <li> But, having course, natural African American hair, we need a creamy moisturizer  to complete the job.</li>
            <li> Every co-wash I have tried never left my hair moisturized or soft.</li>
            <li> I like it because on non-shampoo days I still rinse my hair in the shower and this helps to put moisture back into my tresses and keep them soft.</li>
            <li> Since I have gone natural I only wash my hair 2 times a month</li>
            <li> and I will definitely be continuing to use this product to completely help control it.</li>
            <li> I actually used this product to test two styles,my natural fro and straighten.</li>
            <li> and it left my hair feeling soft and untangled.</li>
            <li> and it definitely didn&#x27;t make it soft..</li>
            <li> The scalp treatment is to be applied directly to the scalp where itching/flaking is present, yet I haven&#x27;t had to use it.</li>
            <li> After using it my curls felt a lot more bouncy and its not so heavy as to way it down either.</li>
            <li> My hair is very manageable and not dried out when I air dry or blow dry.</li>
            <li> I had noticeably less dandruff and flakes and almost no itching after the first use.</li>
            <li> I really thought it was going to be like other co-washes I have used.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not pretty much coming out as soon as I rub it in.</li>
            <li> I now use every other day and it makes me so much happier with my hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s missing a little something, maybe a tinge more moisturizer</li>
            <li> The product was thick, rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> I used this with the 2-in-1 shampoo that left my hair soft after washing, but when I followed up with this conditioner it took the softness to the next level.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair came out so soft that I actually didn&#x27;t put any oil in it till the second day because I forgot!</li>
            <li> My hair is think a curly and most products say they can help, but only make it worse.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I have found other than at a salon that actually moisturizes my hair and scalp while conditioning at the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent lots on high end hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally suffer from dandruff since I have been natural but after getting a silk press in April I have had slight dandruff every since even though my hair has been washed weekly.  </li>
            <li> I have mixed (black and white) hair that I wear natural and straight.</li>
            <li> I received the co-wash along with a few other of their products free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I was a little confused because most &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34; products are meat to take the place of shampoo / condition that you would normally do.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, dry shoulder length hair and moisture is extremely important for my hair type.</li>
            <li> The co-wash, along with the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Shampoo, helps to additionally cleanse the daily summer residue that my hair tends to build up, fight dry heat flakes and leaves my hair easy to style without the use of any other heavy or harmful products.  </li>
            <li> Just tried my new Head and Shoulders Moisture care collection from my Bzz Agent Promotion the other day</li>
            <li> which is huge when you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> I loved that, it did the job of an expensive hair detangler, but it dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> I have virgin textured hair  and very few products have really wowed me so far in the long lasting moisture department, including Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> From a African American busy mother of 5 who has long suffered from dry, itchy scalp  </li>
            <li> Very thick and rich.</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and my curls bouncy without the frizz and the dryness of other dandruff wash.</li>
            <li> I was truly skeptical about using it on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair because I&#x27;ve only used shampoos that are specially formulated for natural ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> I am also finding that I do not need nearly the amount of styling products as I once did using other co-washes.</li>
            <li> I washed my daughter&#x27;s hair with the cowash and while I was skeptical of the products initially, I was so pleased with how moisturizing it was on my daughter&#x27;s dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Fast forward to the past couple weeks, and if anything, my experience with all 3 products seems to have only inflamed my scalp&#x27;s irritation.</li>
            <li> It is generally unruly and very dry.  </li>
            <li> I left it on for a few hours, and after washing my hair it was very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I would rather stick to my usual regimen that doesn&#x27;t really involve co washing</li>
            <li> The scent last long but is not over powering.  </li>
            <li> Last time I co-washed it left me feeling uncomfortable because my scalp wasnt left clean</li>
            <li> Having dry, course hair, its hard to find the right balance in shampoos and conditioners, they will leave my hair either dry and brittle or flat and greasy.</li>
            <li> So, I use it on a dry scalp and each night before my next shampoo shampoo.</li>
            <li> It provides the same dry/itchy scalp relief but without the ingredients that dry out my curls.</li>
            <li> It provides the same dry/itchy scalp relief but without the ingredients that dry out my curls.</li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp and the entire collection is helping me get rid of flakes.</li>
            <li> It provides the same dry/itchy scalp relief but without the ingredients that dry out my curls.</li>
            <li> Really the only downfall I found to this product was the consistancy was rather thick.</li>
            <li> Usually my hair is very brittle when I blow dry it but not when I use the head and shoulders cowash.</li>
            <li> And of course with having thick hair i use a half full product to reach my scalp like i need it to.</li>
            <li> It provides the same dry scalp relief but without the ingredients that dry out my curls.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this co-wash that I received free to try in my BzzKit from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I use Head and Shoulder products all winter long to prevent flakes, but I can&#x27;t say I ever felt like I was treating myself or that it was a luxury product  because of the not so luxurious smell.</li>
            <li> The scent stays on your hair long after it is washed.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair so this worked really well for my hair texture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This co-wash has no sulfates and is thick; you really feel it cleansing the scalp.</li>
            <li> in your hair care routine for the shower and will totally eliminate dry scalp and flakes!!</li>
            <li> I also typically alternate between a moisturizing conditioner and a strengthening conditioner since the former leaves my hair limp and the latter leaves it dry.</li>
            <li> My little one has softer/looser curls, my big girl has tighter kinkier curls, and I&#x27;m somewhere in the middle.</li>
            <li> It makes me want to play in my hair all day long!</li>
            <li> and i also use other product  on the same line the shampoo  and the 2 and 1</li>
            <li> I only use the 2 in 1 every other day and it cleans without drying as well.</li>
            <li> With other conditioners, I&#x27;ve had to let it sit in my hair for several minutes before I felt that effect.</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend due to cleansing effectiveness.</li>
            <li> For my curly textured hair I alternate between a one weekly cleansing clarifying shampoo, and co-washing all the other days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it did take a little color out of my hair but nothing major (not like the 2n1).</li>
            <li> Once dry, my hair didn&#x27;t feel much different from other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> 2-in1 because it helps your hair not to feel dry.</li>
            <li> Also, I let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> Additionally, my hair wasn&#x27;t abnormally dry.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t strip moisture nor make my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I have really dry scalp and go through spurts where it feels like I&#x27;m scratching non-stop.</li>
            <li> However, I do suffer from dry itchy scalp and dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair did not feel dry and it was manageable.</li>
            <li> but i do have dry scalp.. .  </li>
            <li> I have a 4b type curl pattern and my hair can tend to be really dry.</li>
            <li> In fact, after a disastrous few incidents I had with the brand about 2 years ago, I swore off using H&amp;S for good.</li>
            <li> Dealing with a dry, itchy scalp dandruff just tops it off.</li>
            <li> Which means I suffer from scalp irritation, intense burning and a ridiculous need to scratch, which then produces flakes and then comes the scalp sores.</li>
            <li> but I do have to deal with dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Also no itching and dry scalp which is a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> I  have dandruff but have a dry scalp that loves Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry and brittle after co-washing, from the roots</li>
            <li> Do you have a dry scalp?</li>
            <li> my hair is constantly dry.</li>
            <li> i no longer deal with dry and itchy scalp</li>
            <li> Cleanse away all the products from the week without leaving your hair dry as a bone.</li>
            <li> I do not have dandruff but have a dry scalp that loves Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> The uncomfortableness of a dry scalp is gone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave your hair dry.</li>
            <li> I never new about this product  </li>
            <li> I am not new to co washing.</li>
            <li> The feel of the Co-Wash is thick like conditioner and the smell is very natural and favorable!</li>
            <li> Many years ago, after having suffered with an irritated and itching scalp for months on end, I went to see my doctor and was diagnosed with Scalp Psoriasis, a common skin disorder that leaves dry, flaky, white patches of built up skin cells at random intervals on my scalp.</li>
            <li> ive cut down to once a week because it keeps my hair moisturized enough.</li>
            <li> I actually almost used half a bottle to cover all of my hair</li>
            <li> Typically I use a shampoo, a conditioner AND a deep conditioner -- and I still have to add product to keep my hair moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> The consistency is slightly runny but it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> The shampoo alone without the co-wash left my hair feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li> I really do not have a problem with dandruff, but I used this after taking down braids to detangle and deep condition my hair.</li>
            <li> My children are bi-racial and have curly hair that is often times very dry after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> both the 2-1 which made my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> Their hair was extremely soft and not the least bit dry after using the Co-Wash.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item for women with dry, thick or coarse hair or any one looking for extra moisture with a bit of volume.</li>
            <li> It is definitely helps in keeping the textured hair in a little control.</li>
            <li> It did not strip my hair and leave it dry like some other co-washes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have used other products and my scalp would always feel just as dry or feel like there is a buildup after use, but not this one.</li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s boyfriend, who also suffers from a (different) skin disorder that affects his scalp as well, had much the same experience with the shampoo as I did.</li>
            <li> My only negative isn&#x27;t related to the product itself, mores so the bottle</li>
            <li> I should also add that i have long curly hair that has a thin to medium texture, not thick at all.</li>
            <li> For a product that promotes dandruff control I expected a medicinal smell, but this was not the case.</li>
            <li> I have noticed minimal to no flakes since i started to use the line.</li>
            <li> My had did not feel rough</li>
            <li> You can open a bottle of conditioner or shampoo and my the time you close the bottle and set it down the stuff is running down your arm.</li>
            <li> I have never used this product before &amp; was little worried if it would work or not due to my thick long hair.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product in the mail, I was skeptical about how it would work.</li>
            <li> My scalp literally felt like it was being bitten by a hundred angry ants the first time I used the moisture care shampoo.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t touch any of my other products since I received this in the mail.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to see if it actually worked.</li>
            <li> I have used Head and Shoulders before in the past and knew it wouldn&#x27;t be a product that I would use on a regular wash day.</li>
            <li> they are telling me it works just as well as any of their other products</li>
            <li> All of the other claims by this co-wash did not work for my hair.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> My hair was moisturized but not to the extent that I have had with other products.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have your usual chalk white conditioner look it</li>
            <li> It as well as other products from the Moisture Care Collection were included in my Bzzkit.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, since I didn&#x27;t fully understand what Co-Wash was and couldn&#x27;t imagine it being a replacement of conditioner for my very long hair.  </li>
            <li> My scalp seems less dry and way less itchy.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, I’m half black with EXTREMLY thick, coarse and DRY hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, natural hair</li>
            <li> Almost every shampoo product, including those only found at salons, can leave my hair feeling gummy and hard to comb through.</li>
            <li> Usually if I don&#x27;t at least twist up my hair, by the next day I&#x27;m wearing a helmet afro, but not after this co-wash.</li>
            <li> I use it at least 2-3 times a week, following the 2in1 shampoo.</li>
            <li> Second the texture is thick, not runny as some products can be.</li>
            <li> The co wash is thick but wonderul for daily washing without sucking the moisture out of your hair.</li>
            <li> If you have coarse thick hair give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick 3B curls that are prone to drying.</li>
            <li> but my hair didn&#x27;t feel weighted down.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care did not weigh my hair down and it smells</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing, without weighing the hair down.</li>
            <li> Now I had just taken my hair down from wearing a weave soooooo</li>
            <li> It did not weigh my hair down or leave any residue or build-up.</li>
            <li> I feel my scalp is healthier and definitely less flaky.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I use it half a day before shampooing.</li>
            <li> and my hair is visibly less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Over the couse of a week or so, I had less itchiness and fewer flakes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less to no flakes from using this product.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and have always battled dandruff.  </li>
            <li> When I blow dried my hair, there were no flakes, it had body and again don&#x27;t feel weighted down or filmy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my curly hair doesn&#x27;t like the way Head and Shoulders can be so drying especially when I cannot find the plain conditioner in any local stores (just the shampoo or the 2 in 1).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my curly hair doesn&#x27;t like the way Head and Shoulders can be so drying especially when I cannot find the plain conditioner in any local stores (just the shampoo or the 2 in 1).</li>
            <li> , I was a little concerned about trying the co-wash.</li>
            <li> I just put some in my hand, rub it in my hair, add a little water so I can lather it up</li>
            <li> I have very dry thick hair and my curl pattern is a 4c.</li>
            <li> and it woke up all the dead cells in my scalp and removed them and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday (sometimes after shampooing, sometimes by itself) for probably 3 weeks and plan on making it part of my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> My problem with it is all of the harsh chemicals it contains.</li>
            <li> Co washing is cleansing your hair and scalp without the use of harsh shampoos that strip the moisture from your hair.</li>
            <li> When textured hair is subjected to harsh shampoos that strip moisture it tends to shed and break.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I prefer to go through a few rounds with a product before placing a constructive review on it.</li>
            <li> It also fought the heavy dandruff I had on my scalp.</li>
            <li> And itbworjs without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> atleast twice a week now and only apply a little amount because I&#x27;m skeptical about it weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Due to living in Florida, being maintenance for our apartment complex, and going to the beach</li>
            <li> This product has helped the dandruff slow down</li>
            <li> There are limited brands I stand behind</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint is that I kinda wish the bottle had some type of finger grooves or some thing to make it easier to hold on to it while its wet and your are shaking it violently to get the creamy goodness out.</li>
            <li> I usually cowash twice a week, using my head and shoulders</li>
            <li> The cleansing is usually done with conditioner instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been prescribed numerous expensive types of medicated oils, sprays, rubs and shampoos that never resolved the issue...</li>
            <li> no more itching..#gotitfree</li>
            <li> I have also tired the other products that go along with this care line</li>
            <li> my hair usually comes out of the co-wash looking dull.</li>
            <li> My hair was almost as hard to manage as before.</li>
            <li> Imagine my shock when it was quite moisturizing and helped with the itching I have been experiencing lately.</li>
            <li> sucks up moisture like its nothing.</li>
            <li> At least in my naturalista</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> This cowash product is thick and moisturizing for curly, coily, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It is extremely thick but glides through my thick curls and coils.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, I found this product extremely drying to my scalp.</li>
            <li> The sample I received was very small</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because I tried this lines 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner and did not like it</li>
            <li> Unlike its counter part 2 in 1 moustier the co wash was less disappointing.</li>
            <li> It was very thick and took some work getting it all over the hair</li>
            <li> I was confused that the ingredients didn&#x27;t list coconut at all.</li>
            <li> and I usually have hair that gets dirty</li>

            <li> I used the Moisture Care Co –Wash as soon as it arrived. Let me start by saying, I’m half black with EXTREMLY thick, coarse and DRY hair. I’m constantly looking for the next best thing when it comes to moisture. After trying this product, I definitely felt the moisture people are raving about. My hair felt amazingly nourished and soft, even in the dry, Colorado weather. I was a bit unsure at first as I don’t really suffer from a flaky scalp but was pleasantly surprised at how silky and moisturized my hair felt. It smelled amazing which is a big deal for me when it comes to hair care products. It gave me good overall moisture and helped with the detangling process as well. Brushing out my hair can be quite the hassle and I definitely noticed a cutback in the amount of time it took me once I used the product. Often, with so many tangles, I break off a ton of hair but definitely saw a noticable difference in the breakage when brushing after this product. I also noticed that this particular co-wash, gave my hair some noticeable volume. I enjoyed the product but wouldn’t recommend it if you’re not looking for extra volume, which I personally am not. Overall, it was moisturizing, cleansing and provided good volume. I would recommend this item for women with dry, thick or coarse hair or any one looking for extra moisture with a bit of volume. I recieved this product as part of a promotion but all views and opions expressed are mine soley.</li>
            <li> The new head &amp; shoulders moisture care co-wash is a grate free product to try out. it is a product you want to try because it really does work it helps prevent dandruff from coming back its grate try now. I received mine from bzzagent for free its grate. I rated it 5 stars because it works grate</li>
            <li> Was given this for free.&lt;br /&gt;No more dandruff and made my hair soft and itch free.</li>
            <li> I received the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-Wash Conditioner for free through BzzAgent to try and review. I used this with the 2-in-1 shampoo that left my hair soft after washing, but when I followed up with this conditioner it took the softness to the next level. I didn&#x27;t have to use any hair oils, such as coconut or Argan oil, this worked so well.</li>
            <li> I received the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-wash Conditioner as a promotional offer from Bzzagent. After using the co-wash treatment my scalp was less irritated and my hair is more manageable and smoother. I received really love the coconut smell. I would use this product line again and would highly recommend this product to others who are looking for the same relief</li>
            <li> got it free from bzzagent. Although it took me a minute to figure out what a &amp;#34;cowash&amp;#34; was, I did enjoy using this product. I noticed an immediate difference in the level of irritation on my scalp. It wasn&#x27;t itchy or burning at all. Felt normal for the first time in months! I will definitely get this again</li>
            <li> If I had to choose between the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 and the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Co-wash I would definitely go for the co-wash. This thing has great slippage, smells great and it leaves my hair super soft and moisturized (bye-bye flakes). As a natural, slippage is the most important thing, as the only time I detangle is when I am in the shower washing my hair and I am finger detangling. As pictured my curls were popping everywhere and my hair was super moisturized. What more can I ask for? Thank you Head and Shoulders for allowing me to try this product for free. I would definitely be purchasing another bottle, when mine is finished.</li>
            <li> What can I not say about this product. I received a free sample of this product via BzzAgent, and was so excited to try this hair care line. I have not used any Head and Shoulders in years, and must say this will definitely be my go to product for now on. The smell is amazing, but what really got me was how thick this product was. You can open a bottle of conditioner or shampoo and my the time you close the bottle and set it down the stuff is running down your arm. This product stayed in place making it easy to make sure that all of my strands were totally covered. It really coated and my hair, helping to provide more moisture, without wasting half the bottle. For a product that promotes dandruff control I expected a medicinal smell, but this was not the case. It smells so good. I have natural hair and always looking for a good product. I have terrible dry scalp, and did not notice not one flake after using these products.</li>
            <li> So I used this to initially wash my hair extensions. I was kind of nervous at first because my extensions are expensive and I need to use the best care when treating them if I want them to last me a long time. I was surprised to find how nicely this worked. I used it to wash them then I let them airdry before blowdrying and straightening them and the hair was so beautiful. It was very soft. That&#x27;s when I decided to try it on my own hair and I usually have hair that gets dirty so quick and just a few washes with this and my hair was clean and smelled nice. I&#x27;m happy I was lucky enough to receive these to try.</li>
            <li> I received the moisture care and Co-wash as part of a promotional deal and was surprisingly happy with the results.  I am African American with natural hair.  I used the moisture care first and it lathered nicely, leaving my scalp feeling clean and my hair moisturized.  I could lather and comb my fingers through my hair without a lot of tangles. So far so good!  I rinsed and used he co-wash, and was extremely happy with the feel of the co-wash on my hair. Again I could feel the moisture but my hair didn&#x27;t feel weighted down. I left it on for about 5-8 minutes in the shower before rinsing. When I blow dried my hair, there were no flakes, it had body and again don&#x27;t feel weighted down or filmy like some products feel. Overall I am pleased!  It was better than expected</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this co-wash that I received free to try in my BzzKit from BzzAgent. I didn&#x27;t think it could possibly be as good as my high end, holy grail, co-wash products like DevaCurl or Wen. But it really is just as good. It&#x27;s super thick and feels like a high end hair mask. It also smells like heaven! It leaves my hair super manageable/tangle free. I&#x27;m not sold on the dandruff aspect of it, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in that department, but it&#x27;s a great, affordable co-wash either way!</li>
            <li> Its not often that a product gets five stars from me. But the New Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Co-wash is EVERYTHING!!! I can not tell you how must more moisture my hair has, not to mention the feel of my hair, both when it is wet and when it is dry. I have used this product twice and both times, I ended up sitting and just playing in my hair. I am also finding that I do not need nearly the amount of styling products as I once did using other co-washes. My scalp feels clean and refreshed as well, and we all know that can be an issue when using other co-washes on your hair. This was first given to me by Head and Shoulders company and bzzagent to try and get my honest opinion. I have sense purchased three more bottles, on the off chance I stop seeing in the stores around me. Nice to know amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> I received this from Head and Shoulders via BzzAgent for review. I tried this product with the 2-in-1 conditioner/shampoo and because I didn&#x27;t have the best luck with that, I was a little concerned about trying the co-wash. It turns out that the co-wash is much better than the 2-in-1 in my opinion. This product left my hair feeling moisturized and soft, plus it has a great smell. I will try the Head and Shoulders 2-in1 with the co-wash a few more times to see if it helps my dandruff, but I will keep the co-wash even if it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I had dandruff in my scalp and my hair needed to be washed. When I used Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care I was amazed at how it made my scalp feel. It cleansed my scalp of all the impurities. My hair can be coarse at times, However I was able to run my fingers through my hair. Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care did not weigh my hair down and it smells Amazing!! I for sure will use this product. It also help define the curls in my hair and gave it a beautiful shine.  Thank you Head and Shoulders!!!! The moisture care scalp soother made it tingle and it woke up all the dead cells in my scalp and removed them and my hair and scalp felt like it was given a new life to be able breathe it was truly refreshing. #samplequeen2015@gmail.com</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product!  It is a win win product..  I can use my own shampoo and conditioner them use the co-wash and still have the benefit of having the moisture from the head and shoulders moisture care.  Thanks to buzz agent for testing of this product.</li>
            <li> I just want to take a moment to give a praise report for the co-wash because this stuff smells freaking amazing!!! My hair smells like coconut essence for days later after I have washed it. This is a thick co-wash and it can be used to wash your hair just on its own. It left my hair feeling smooth after I dried it and my hair is flake free. With that said I think head &amp; shoulders should try and make a product that&#x27;s all natural because that would reach a wider african-American community who only use natural products on their hair. I did review this product free from head &amp; shoulders.</li>
            <li> I received the product free from Head &amp; Shoulders to test. Having dry, course hair, its hard to find the right balance in shampoos and conditioners, they will leave my hair either dry and brittle or flat and greasy. After using this in conjunction with the 2-n-1, my hair is soft and flowy. The shampoo alone without the co-wash left my hair feeling a little dry. But, having course, natural African American hair, we need a creamy moisturizer  to complete the job. I am very satisfied so far. Usually, after I wash my hair, my scalp is terribly itchy and dry. I haven&#x27;t experience any of this days later. My scalp feels clean AND moisturized, but not greasy or clogged.</li>
            <li> I was skeptic at first but I actually like this! It burns like heck but it gets rid of the dandruff. Must have! After one use I was able to see a difference. My scalp is sensitive, gets irritated easily and is very dry. The product burned but I was able to see a difference even while wet! I think I have found a new product for my hair! #MoistureCare and #GotItFree</li>
            <li> I recently received a sample of this product from Bzzagent.  I must say this Co wash for Textured hair is not what I was expecting.  I tried the 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner and it dried my hair out real bad.  I used a salon brand conditioner to bring back the moisture to my hair.  The second time I washed my hair using the 2 in 1 I followed it with the Co Wash.  This product is more like a conditioner.  It was very thick and took some work getting it all over the hair but it worked great.  I have very thick, natural hair and it takes a lot of product to really get everywhere.  I actually almost used half a bottle to cover all of my hair but it was well worth it.  The smell and moisture was great.  This is definitely something I will try again.  I also have to say I have been flake free for 2 weeks now.  Yay!!</li>
            <li> I received the Co-wash as a promotion,  and I was so excited to try it on my 3b/c curly hair and was so glad that it worked! I used it with the 2in1 shampoo and the scalp soother and I&#x27;m in love with the scent, and the feel of my hair and scalp.  Moisturized curls/scalp without the feeling of being weighed down and free of  flakes and build up</li>
            <li> I had the privilege of trying this product as part of a promotion. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I&#x27;m so glad I tried it &amp; will be adding this to my hair regime. I&#x27;ve been natural for 3 years so if it&#x27;s on the market I&#x27;ve tried it, tinkered with it &amp; tossed it. I fell in love with this product from first wash. First, I love the coconut &amp; almond smell. Second the texture is thick, not runny as some products can be. I felt like I was putting a mask on my hair. Third it actually  moisturized my hair! I have very &amp;#34;thirtsy&amp;#34; hair so even with a pre-poo my hair usually comes out of the co-wash looking dull. I was impressed that not only did this product rinse away my dandruff but that my hair was shiny. I also loved that I was able to keep my hair in its most natural state for a few days &amp; it didn&#x27;t dry out. Usually if I don&#x27;t at least twist up my hair, by the next day I&#x27;m wearing a helmet afro, but not after this co-wash. Thus will be my one and only co-wash going forward.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I have natural/unprocessed curly hair. All different textures. My little one has softer/looser curls, my big girl has tighter kinkier curls, and I&#x27;m somewhere in the middle. Moisture, convenience, and having one product that works for all of us are important to us. I love the way the co-wash makes our hair feel. Just be aware the product is very creamy (to me a good thing) so it takes a little more effort to rinse it all out. My little one who is trying to be more independent by washing her hair on her own didn&#x27;t like that I had to help her rinse it out.</li>
            <li> Great product. Made my hair feel squeaky clean. Moisturizer really well.</li>
            <li> This Head and Shoulder co wash is amazing. It tingles when it hits the scalp, you can feel the dry patches in your hair feel better instantly. My scalp felt so much better the next day after i run mu hands through it :)</li>
            <li> I received Head &amp; Shoulders moisture co wash free from Head &amp; Shoulders and it works miracles. I tried head &amp; shoulders co wash and I was impressed on how my hair turned out in the end. My hair felt 100 times better than before. I always lack moisture on my hair and struggle with dry/itchy scalp and head &amp; shoulders co wash was the perfect product. It relieved my itchy/dry scalp and gave my hair the moisture it needed. The smell is wonderful. I love how this gives my hair a wonderful smelling scent. Overall great product for textured hair.</li>
            <li> For textured hair; this co-wash works with your hair regimen to deeply moisturize scalp and hair Formulated with vitamin Erich almond oil and coconut essence pH balanced and gentle on chemically treated hair I rte ally do ike this product I got to try for free from BzzAgent.  It works great for my hair and leaves my scalp feeling great.  my hair is soft and flake free</li>
            <li> The Co-Wash, I really enjoyed this product. It was creamy; it felt smooth on contact and also left my hair feeling softer. I was able to also detangle with ease while this product was on my hair. I received a product sample, coupon, collateral or other special premium from BzzAgent or the brand.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I am a bzzagent and was picked to review this product. I have to be honest and say that I did not expect much from this product.  I just felt like it would fall short so I didn&#x27;t put my hopes too high.  However, I was pretty surprised at how well it moisturized mine and my daughters hair. Its light but keeps our hair nice and clean.  I gave a 4 because I had to use a lot more to clean our scalp so this product will run out quickly if we were to add it to our product rotation.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product as part of a campaign for #BzzAgent and #Head&amp;Shoulders. This product is great. I wasn&#x27;t sure of it the first time I used it but I&#x27;m glad I gave it another try because it leaves my hair feeling soft and silky. It was very easy to distribute throughout my hair and very easy to rinse out. I highly recommend using this product after washing with the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in1 because it helps your hair not to feel dry. This product smells amazing. I would recommend this product to all of my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I got this for free to try from Bzz Agent.  As an African-American woman with hair that is not relaxed, moisturized hair is often elusive. I was very apprehensive of this product, ESPECIALLY since it combines the shampoo and conditioner in one. Typically I use a shampoo, a conditioner AND a deep conditioner -- and I still have to add product to keep my hair moisturized all day. The first time I used this, I made a point to not put any other product on my hair for 2 days. Also, I let my hair air dry. Not only did my roots not itch, but I didn&#x27;t have any scalp flaking either. Additionally, my hair wasn&#x27;t abnormally dry. It wasn&#x27;t super soft, but I didn&#x27;t have to give in to dryness and add another product. I would recommend this for fast wash and go styles. I did not have the courage to try this before using any heat styling tools yet. Maybe next week! 4 out of 5 stars -- I wish the scent was a tiny bit stronger. I like when I can smell how clean my hair is!</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders Co-Wash was my absolute favorite in the line,  What I wanted to know was does this really moisturize my hair and take care of dandruff.  The answer is yes!  I love to co wash because the less steps the better for my hair type.  while  still having the ability to cleanse my scalp.  It left my hair manageable and soft and didn&#x27;t strip my hair of my natural oils.  Head and Shoulders Co-Wash was my absolute favorite in the line.  It conditioned my hair well . This my new go to co wash.  I receive this product for testing purposes. This product was sent to me free from Head and Shoulders</li>
            <li> I liked it bit I&#x27;m a shampoo type of girl!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING. After using the head and shoulders 2-in-1, my hair was feeling &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; like and i knew immediately that this wasn&#x27;t for me. After applying the Head and shoulders co-wash...OMG my hair is SUPER soft, easy to manage, shiny, and smells fantastic.you will definitely see a transition from the 2-in1 to the co wash.  if you are using the 2-in-1 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE also use the co-wash. you WON&#x27;T regret it. i received this product as part of a promotion for a brand, however, all opinions are solely based on my own review.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair soft and my scalp felt so much better after using this.   #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
            <li> I got a HUGE free sample of the new Co-wash from Head and shoulders and I TOTALLY LOVE IT. I recently went natural and my new growth is very coarse. But, this co-wash gives me hope. It not only softens the hair, but makes it more manageable than I could have ever asked for. It makes me want to play in my hair all day long! After my sample is gone, I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I use Head and Shoulder products all winter long to prevent flakes, but I can&#x27;t say I ever felt like I was treating myself or that it was a luxury product  because of the not so luxurious smell. However, the new Head and Shoulders Moisture line has made an improvement on it&#x27;s scent, which I have really enjoyed. The product itself doesn&#x27;t seem a whole lot different from the original Head and Shoulders, but the change in smell alone has convinced me to buy the new stuff next winter. I received this as a Buzz Agent Campaign.</li>
            <li> Received a bottle of this to sample. I have never used this product before &amp; was little worried if it would work or not due to my thick long hair. I have to say I was impressed! I shampooed my hair then added this afterwards, not only did it make my scalp feel better, it didn&#x27;t tagnle my hair at all &amp; left it really smooth! Also it smells really good! I love this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  Great for super curly hair. It left my hair soft and my curls bouncy without the frizz and the dryness of other dandruff wash. My scalp seems less dry and way less itchy. I&#x27;ve used this for about 2 weeks now and I can honestly say....NO dandruff. I got this product , plus 2 other full sized products or free to review from Bzz Agent and will be using the included coupon to buy more!</li>
            <li> Tried this product as a BzzAgent and LOVED it. I love the way it smells, cleans your hair and softens your hair. My flakes are deteriorating and that&#x27;s the best part of all. #gotitforfree</li>
            <li> Love the spot at Lowe&#x27;s good and cleans my hair good. And leaves my head Smelling as good</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try &amp; review by BzzAgent. I am African American with natural,kinky,4c hair. This cowash did a good job of cleaning my thick hair and my scalp. It didn&#x27;t strip moisture nor make my hair dry. My hair was soft and moisturized after the cowash. I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I was given the product free to review from bzzagent.com. Let me start off by saying.. I&#x27;ve never tried a product before that was just for co-washing so I was very excited to try this product. I always co-wash my hair extensions and this was perfect. My hair was so soft and the end of my hair was left beautiful. It smelled very good as well. I co-wash my hair atleast twice a week now and only apply a little amount because I&#x27;m skeptical about it weighing my hair down. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This really locks in the moisture! Usually my hair is very brittle when I blow dry it but not when I use the head and shoulders cowash. I got it free from bzzagent for review purposes . not only does it  makes my hair gel great but the flakes diminished drastically.</li>
            <li> so I got this product free from #BzzAgent and im always skeptical because my hair tangles and i have to say this erased all my skepticism, i love this stuff.  Not only does this smell amazing but it left my hair feeling soft, and tangle free but my scalp fully moisturized and tangle free.  This will become one of my newest staples, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a BuzzAgent and had the opportunity to try the Head&amp;Shoulders Moisture products and I really do like them. I use the regular Head&amp;Shoulders to help manage my dandruff and was excited to see they had a line to help with my issue and help keep my and my daughters moisturized. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I recieve a full bottle of this FREE from BZZAGAENT and HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS.... I am already a regular consumer of Head and Shoulders because of my horrible scalp butyou have made me a loyal customer for LIFE with this new line!! The co-wash helped my hair smooth out more then the 2 in 1 alone and had my hair smelling amazing! It was so easy to style after and after about a month i am almost completely flake free! Defintely calmed my itch!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use, it leaves you hair feeling smooth and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I was sent the line for free from BzzAgent to try out. The Co-Wash has awesome slip!! It allows me to de-tangle my curly, coily natural hair in no time. My scalp can act really funny some times, but it didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp AT ALL. I have noticed minimal to no flakes since i started to use the line. My only minor complaint is that I kinda wish the bottle had some type of finger grooves or some thing to make it easier to hold on to it while its wet and your are shaking it violently to get the creamy goodness out. The awesomeness of the product made the having to pick the bottle up off of the shower floor worth it. It&#x27;s cleansing yet very moisturizing at the same time. It leaves my hair looking, feeling and smelling AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> **Please note the opinions and views in this review are solely my own, I was given the product as a promotion from the company BZZagent. However, I was not offered additional incentives or monetary rewards in exchange for a high status review rather I was asked to provide my honest review and the opinions are solely my own honest feedback and opinion of the product.After using the product after shampooing for several weeks I did notice some difference, my scalp was less irritated and my hair much softer and more managable. I really loved that the scent wasn’t the typical medicated scent as with many anti-dandruff products, it had a really pleasant smell. Really the only downfall I found to this product was the consistancy was rather thick. I would have to water my hair down to work up a good lather because it was so thick! I also felt it because of this it was more work to rinse it out and make sure it didn’t leave a weighing residue. Overall I felt the product did a good job at moisturizing and leaving my scalp less irritated and would definitely buy this product in the future and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Received this from BzzAgent &amp;&amp; i must say i really enjoy it. i have started going Natural and this works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> Just tried the head &amp; shoulders hogwash for textured hair. I thought it would be very drying to my natural 4a hair. Imagine my shock when it was quite moisturizing and helped with the itching I have been experiencing lately. I could run my fingers through it quite easily to detangle it. The one thing I would have liked is if it were silicone free. But for those that have problems.s with dandruff and itchy scalp who do not mind silicones, you should give it a try. I received this product through a promotion from head &amp; shoulders.</li>
            <li> Daughter has really bad flakes and I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos and moisturizers and nothing has really worked. She has been using the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection for almost a week now and it seems to be helping tremendously. I received the products for free through BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE!!! Im very picky when it comes to comes to using Conditioners. I have very curly hair and my hair sucks up moisture like its nothing. So I was very surprised when i tried the head and shoulders cowash. Also when you think of head and shoulders the biggest misconception is that you have to have dandruff, but i was so wrong. The cowash is amazingly thick and smells so good. I usually cowash twice a week, using my head and shoulders ive cut down to once a week because it keeps my hair moisturized enough. I received my product for free for the purpose of my review from BUZZAGENT.</li>
            <li> Having natural curly hair, I have tried product out there. Every co-wash I have tried never left my hair moisturized or soft. I received&lt;br /&gt;Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care as part of a promotion from the brand. I really thought it was going to be like other co-washes I have used. But I was so wrong. I love it!!!! My curls are moisturized and soft. I have found my forever co-wash</li>
            <li> I received the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-wash free from Head &amp; Shoulders. I love it!! I am natural so I use co-washes regularly. The difference in this one is that if gets rid of my dandruff. It also smells great and leaves my hair soft and manageable. I&#x27;ve found my new co-wash for my wash and go&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love love this product  I use for first time it got my dandruff  out and i also use other product  on the same line the shampoo  and the 2 and 1 omg I glad I got my for free for being a bzzagent  I never new about this product  now it is definitely  on the  shopping list works great smell good I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is so AWESOME! I used it after using the 2-n-1 Shampoo + Conditioner. My hair natural hair was super moisturized and I was able to finger detangle with it, too. This co-wash is now part of my regular hair care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy this product from Amazon. I was sent this product by bzzagent and Head and Shoulders to try free and give my honest opinion. I believe you will really enjoy using this co-wash, especially as a regular conditioner or deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> The cowash is great for my mid week wash. I exercise a lot and don&#x27;t like having to use a seperate shampoo and conditioner if I don&#x27;t have to. I will given a bottle for free from bzzagent of the cowash. I love it. It is super quick and easy to use during my mid week wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to hair products so for me to like a product, it&#x27;s got to be a good one. This Head &amp; Shoulders Co-Wash surprised me. I have really dry scalp and go through spurts where it feels like I&#x27;m scratching non-stop. I noticed a significant change in how often I did that while using this. I&#x27;ve used it everyday (sometimes after shampooing, sometimes by itself) for probably 3 weeks and plan on making it part of my hair regimen. I also typically alternate between a moisturizing conditioner and a strengthening conditioner since the former leaves my hair limp and the latter leaves it dry. But I didn&#x27;t have to alternate with this co-wash. A definite plus in my book. ***Glad I got to try it free from Head &amp; Shoulders.***</li>
            <li> i just love this product i will let my family and friends know and i also love how it gets rid of dry scalp</li>
            <li> I am stuck between this product being &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; and me really liking it. I like it because on non-shampoo days I still rinse my hair in the shower and this helps to put moisture back into my tresses and keep them soft. Before using this product I would do the same thing with just any conditioner that I had in the house and I think that&#x27;s why I am stuck with enjoying and it being okay. Because for me its not really anything special, at first I thought it was because after the first use (which I wrote about on bzzagent) my curls were amazing but after continual use its pretty much the same as if I weren&#x27;t using this product and using another. I would probably buy this as it works just as well but I don&#x27;t LOVE it because it&#x27;s not doing anything different to my hair than other decent products.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and the way that it left my hair feeling. It definitely surpassed my expectations. Go check out my full review on my youtube channel at Lifeintheskye.</li>
            <li> The title says it all this was definitely my favorite.  The almond oil in this smells incredible. The formula was very creamy and felt great on my hair.  My hair tends to be on the drier side and this actually helped my hair. I&#x27;m glad I was able to try this for free from Head &amp; Shoulders and Bzzagent!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have 4c hair,  so when I read &amp;#34;for textured hair&amp;#34; on the bottle, I guess that was meant for our hair type. I washed my daughter&#x27;s hair with the cowash and while I was skeptical of the products initially, I was so pleased with how moisturizing it was on my daughter&#x27;s dry hair.  The product was thick, rich and creamy. She even ran her hands through her hair and said she loved how her hair felt. I did not use any additional products. I also used the cowash as a leave in before blow drying her hair and I was impressed. I&#x27;m very particular about what hair care products we use, but this receives my stamp of approval. I normally use Cantu and Jane Carter products, but I could really see myself adding this to my product list. I received this via BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I received the Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Co Wash for free from BzzAgent. I was thrilled to be one of many to be selected to use and review these products. So many people think Head and Shoulders products are for individuals who suffer with dandruff or other scalp conditions. I have never suffered with dandruff. However, I do suffer from dry itchy scalp and dry hair. Since I have gone natural I only wash my hair 2 times a month and I co-wash in between. This Co-Wash is perfect amazing. My hair did not feel dry and it was manageable. It left my hair feeling and smelling great. If you do not believe me try it for yourself. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received this from Bzz Agent and Head and Shoulders to try for free. It has earned a spot in my routine as I love how it leaves my 4C hair moisturized. It is on the heavy side which is great for my hair. It leaves my scalp feeling great and I have noticed less breakage and tangling due to the added moisture. I feel my scalp is healthier and definitely less flaky.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. This Co-wash is for real the boom.com!!! i love the feel on my hair and how soft it is after a rinse. This will definitely be apart of my wash day. This smell is amazing. This don&#x27;t have the normal conditioner feel but it does do the job. The ingredients in this product really work for dandruff hair. Its works well with the 2-in-1 shampoo. I suggest you try it if you haven&#x27;t yet.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Tried this viz bzzAgent and have been pleased with the results, after shampoo can be somewhat drying, following up with this is perfect. Definitely a must try.  I&#x27;m african-american and my hair is transitioning to natural hair and this product added all the moisture right back in!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the Moisture Care &amp;#34;2-in-1&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;CoWash&amp;#34; line, but they did more for my hair than my scalp. I #GotItFree and received no compensation for my opinion. The shampoo offers more fragrance than the shampoo and the &amp;#34;Scalp Soother Treatment&amp;#34; smells a little like medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scalp soother (spray) burns more if you use it after shampooing, because your scalp&#x27;s wet and you just massaged it. So, I use it on a dry scalp and each night before my next shampoo shampoo. I shampooed and conditioned twice a week and sprayed my scalp about every 48 hours. It didn&#x27;t do much for my dandruff and the scalp soother ruined my hairstyle. That&#x27;s why I use it half a day before shampooing.</li>
            <li> i think that the co wash is great for curly hair. I do not have a lot of dandruff but i do have dry scalp.. .  my curly hair doesn&#x27;t like the way 2 in one shampoos and conditioners which head and shoulders was famous for, because they don&#x27;t provide as much moisture. however i absolutely love the  head and Shoulders Moisture Care Co-Wash . It provides the same dry scalp relief but without the ingredients that dry out my curls. It&#x27;s  thick and rich cleansing and maybe that has completely replaced shampoo for me.. my hair has never felt better. Highly recommend this for textured hair girls..this is a great  product.  #bzz agent #got it free</li>
            <li> Really like this conditioner it makes my hair feel soft, and shiny. The product smells wonderful I would definitely recommend it. I&#x27;m glad I got to try it free from a promotion, Thanks Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> i love that Head and Shoulders made a co wash, since i make my own.I&#x27;m a bzzagent so i got to try it free.I have to be honest and say i have very mixed feeling on this product.I loved that, it did the job of an expensive hair detangler, but it dried my hair out. i would say if your hair is pron to dryness already, or it brakes off easily, don&#x27;t use this line alone. i find using it with a good leave in conditioner will leave your hair flake free, but not as thirsty.#GotItFree</li>
            <li> Im in love with this product. I would have never tried this on my own but I was picked by bzzzagent. Great thing about that is my daughter has coarse superthick dry hair. This cowash has been used during our none wash dashes to help retain moisture. We did one month of use and now it haz been 2 weeks of nothing and the big flakey dandruff have yet to return. We are going to continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I received this Co-wash from BzzAgent to review and I have been really impressed.  I don&#x27;t normally suffer from dandruff since I have been natural but after getting a silk press in April I have had slight dandruff every since even though my hair has been washed weekly.  I used this and loved the way it felt when I washed my hair.  Its a creamy cleanser with no lather and smells really nice.  My hair is very moisturized when washed with this even if I do to follow with a leave in conditioner.  My scalp feels so much better and my hair is visibly less frizzy.  It does contain dimethicone which may matter to some curlies.</li>
            <li> This head and shoulders is a must have cause we natural hair sisters usually just do a co-wash to our hair and it helps hold in the moisture very well while your hair is still very manageable. This is my 2nd time trying this product I have since tried this bought a full size bottle at Walmart and I am loving it :) along with my 2 sister who have also purchased this product in full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product know that this is a great addition to my  Natural hair regimen. We Naturalistas are a always looking for the perfect Co-Wash to clean and not dry out our hair. This product did just that for me and I will be recommending this product in this line because after 3 uses within 2 weeks it made my hair feel exactly like I would like it to without using a shampoo ...CLEAN!!!&lt;br /&gt;#MBIB #GotItFree #HairTr</li>
            <li> My scalp is prone to dandruff and to become very itchy. This product have lessen both of these issues while not drying out my natural 3c-4a hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand</li>
            <li> When I first received this product in the mail, I was skeptical about how it would work. I know Head &amp; Shoulders as a brand doesn&#x27;t really make products for textured hair, but I was surprised with the results. I have a 4b type curl pattern and my hair can tend to be really dry. After using this product, my hair became instantly soft and the detangling process was a breeze. I would most definitely purchase this produce.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care co wash for free from BzzAgent. I used the co-wash today. It left my hair feeling smooth while washing The scent is pleasant while washing hair. My hair type is wavy, frizzy, fine to medium strands, to lower back. The sample I received was very small so I could not wash all of my hair with it. My problem with it is all of the harsh chemicals it contains.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product as well as the Head &amp; shoulders 2 in 1 and the Scalp Soother ( all Moisture Care line as well) via BzzAgent. So I will review them all here in case anyone is interested in trying the other products mentioned in this line. First, they smell wonderful and are not overbearing at all. I have baby fine, curly, color treated/ bleached hair and these products provided just the right amount of moisture without weighing my hair down. They also do not seem to be fading my color which is a huge plus! The co wash is thick but wonderul for daily washing without sucking the moisture out of your hair. Anyone with curly hair knows that dryness is the enemy of the curly headed lol. I only use the 2 in 1 every other day and it cleans without drying as well. My daughter who has extremely dry, thick, long hair experienced the same results as I did and that&#x27;s not an often occurrence considering that our different hair types. Anyone interested in the Scalp Soother I have to say it&#x27;s one of my favorites in this line. Soothes a dry scalp with a lovely cooling feeling and it&#x27;s not greasy which is huge when you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> I received the Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff system free from bzzagent. I&#x27;ve tried head and shoulders before and I am not particularly a big fan but that has nothing specifically to do with the product and more to do with the type of dandruff I have. I have seborrheic dermatitis and it requires a strict hair care regimen to stay under control since factors such as stress tend to affect flare ups. Anyhow I didn&#x27;t plan on adding this to that regimen but it never hurts to try something new. I&#x27;ve had the most success with the co-wash but not as a replacement but more of a mid week wash. I continue to use my regular dandruff shampoo and have found that if I supplement the co-wash during the week I get a good dose of moisture to my locks, they feel soft and manageable (and that is before I add my leave in treatments) with a great smell. For those that don&#x27;t have my kind of dandruff this should work for you as a regular co-washing alternative.</li>
            <li> I am a bzzagent and was sent this product to use and review, and I am so glad that I did! I have fine, AfroCaribbean hair, and live in a very dry climate. Some shampoos can be very stripping, so I have been co-washing or using sulfate free shampoos. This thing right here is fantastic folk! A product that moisturizes, with ought tripping the hair AND keeps dandruff at bay? This stuff deserves an award!</li>
            <li> I tried the Head &amp;Shoulders Co wash free courtesy of BzzAgent and Head &amp;Shoulders. Very excited to see a premium brand like Head &amp;Shoulders creating product lines for textured hair. I am not new to co washing. I was co washing my hair prior to receiving this product. Co washing is cleansing your hair and scalp without the use of harsh shampoos that strip the moisture from your hair. The cleansing is usually done with conditioner instead.&lt;br /&gt;Textured hair needs moisture and lots of it. Textured hair needs even more moisture imparting products than Caucasian hair. Unlike most Caucasian hair that is straight, textured hair is so tightly coiled that the oils cannot travel down the hair shaft. The moisture has to come from products used.  The most important aspect of a co wash is it moisture infusing abilities. When textured hair is subjected to harsh shampoos that strip moisture it tends to shed and break.&lt;br /&gt; The Head &amp;Shoulders co wash performed well overall. It smells heavenly, and leaves your hair with a nice coconut tropical fragrance.  I was totally in love with the fragrance. The consistency of the product was good too. Very thick and rich. I hate conditioners that are runny. The Head and Shoulders co wash provided good slip when combing my hair out with the product in. So it works really well to detangle. Although the product was thick it came out of the bottle easily. I could readily tell from the package that the contents were made for textured hair.&lt;br /&gt;The product rinsed well from my hair. I  take points away because I did not feel the co wash left my hair with lasting softness. Once dry, my hair didn&#x27;t feel much different from other products I have tried. My hair was almost as hard to manage as before. I have virgin textured hair  and very few products have really wowed me so far in the long lasting moisture department, including Head and Shoulders. While I would buy this on sale. I think this is a good product but the formula needs to be tweaked.It does perform exceptionally well in leaving  my  scalp feeling clean though.</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky hair and the cowash conditioner provided great slip needed to detangle my hair. It also provided just the right amount of moisture to help seal my hair and maintain the moisture. I really don&#x27;t have an issue with flakes, but I did with itching but  I haven&#x27;t had any itching since using the cowash. I received the product free from BzzAgent, but would definitely pay to get more.</li>
            <li> One of the best Co-Wash I&#x27;ve ever tried. Does a great job for textured hair. Recommend this to anyone that has an itchy scalp or dandruff.</li>
            <li> I have no experience with co washes which help in reducing the dandruff too.This one does.This product was given as a promotion by the company to use for review it. . It is definitely helps in keeping the textured hair in a little control. Like the design of the bottle. Gravity helps in getting it out of the bottle easily. When kept with the 2-in 1 bottle of the same collection its looks very neat on the shower rack.&lt;br /&gt;A+ for this product.</li>
            <li> For my hair-care routine, I&#x27;ll usually only shampoo once, and co-wash the rest of the week. Because of my hair&#x27;s kinky texture, moisture is easily stripped from it, so I was happy when I was sent a co-wash as well as a shampoo, so that I could keep with my regimen. But just like the shampoo, I was quickly disappointed with the results of this product.  As I said in my review of the shampoo, I haven&#x27;t had the best experience with Head &amp; Shoulders products in the past. In fact, after a disastrous few incidents I had with the brand about 2 years ago, I swore off using H&amp;S for good. But then this campaign started on Bzzagent and I was invited to join, and well, who can say no to free stuff? So I figured I&#x27;d give it another go with them and see how it went. After all, if things went south like last time, I could always just gift everything to my sister, who is even more of a hair-care fanatic than I am.  Many years ago, after having suffered with an irritated and itching scalp for months on end, I went to see my doctor and was diagnosed with Scalp Psoriasis, a common skin disorder that leaves dry, flaky, white patches of built up skin cells at random intervals on my scalp. Head &amp; Shoulders, having always been marketed as helping to relieve the discomfort of a dry and flaky scalp, seemed like the perfect product for me to try. However, as I stated earlier in my review, any hopes I had for this brand where quickly shot down.  Fast forward to the past couple weeks, and if anything, my experience with all 3 products seems to have only inflamed my scalp&#x27;s irritation. My scalp literally felt like it was being bitten by a hundred angry ants the first time I used the moisture care shampoo. Needless to say, I haven&#x27;t used it since. However, for whatever reason, I expected the co-wash to preform better, because &#x27;hey, it&#x27;s basically only a conditioner. Surely it won&#x27;t be as harsh on my scalp as the shampoo was :)&#x27; but nope, I was horribly wrong once again. My experience with the co-wash was much the same as the shampoo, the only difference being that despite feeling like how I imagine Michael Jackson felt after his pepsi commercial incident, the co-wash left my hair feeling silkier and easier to manage than before.  My sister is now the proud owner of 3 new hair-care products, and unlike me, she is absolutely in love with them. But I must make it clear that just because my experience with Head &amp; Shoulders proved to be a complete disaster, it does not mean that yours will be too. My sister&#x27;s boyfriend, who also suffers from a (different) skin disorder that affects his scalp as well, had much the same experience with the shampoo as I did. Besides us though, everyone with a normal, healthy scalp seems to love the moisture care products and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.  Head &amp; Shoulder&#x27;s sent this to me for free through Bzzagent.com though, so it&#x27;s not like I lost my money or anything on it, which I suppose is another plus.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, I ended up mixing it into my regular conditioner to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I received the NEW Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection as a part of a promotion. I got it free.... My hair definately was clean and my scalp felt good. However, I did not like the feeling of my hair afterwards. I give this product an A+ for cleanliness. I would just like to feel more of the moisture. My hair was shiny as well afterwards.</li>
            <li> As far as &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; conditioners go, (and that&#x27;s basically what Head &amp; Shoulders Co-Wash is), this is about the best you can get, (especially for those who have thick, textured hair). There&#x27;s only one thing that prevents a 5 out of 5 rating instead of 4 out of 5. The conditioners that come with hair dye have been the best, (most conditioning), for my thick, unruly hair, but I&#x27;ve yet to encounter any non-hair dye conditioner that beats this Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Co-Wash! You can feel your hair just lock in the moisture right after you apply it. With other conditioners, I&#x27;ve had to let it sit in my hair for several minutes before I felt that effect. And the scent is pleasant, but not-overpowering as to attract bees to your hair outside. I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing it! Thanks Head &amp; Shoulders for the free sample!</li>
            <li> I love this co-wash. It feels amazing on my hair and I can just use this alone. It&#x27;s enough of a wash for me. Leaves my textures hair smelling good and clean!</li>
            <li> Did anybody say dandruff, ugh so over it!! Dealing with a dry, itchy scalp dandruff just tops it off. I never knew what to do about the flakes until now, thanks to Moisture Care Co- Wash from Head &amp; Shoulders, that I received for free from them. This product has helped the dandruff slow down and I will definitely be continuing to use this product to completely help control it.</li>
            <li> I love this!! It smells great and leaves my hair feeling so soft! I think it&#x27;s a great product for the whole family. I&#x27;ve already recommended that some friends and family give it a try for themselves. Will definitely be buying more soon.   I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand, but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for reducing or removing dandruff and improving hair quality overall; it is formulated with vitamin Erich almond oil and coconut essence The nature of this product also helps make showering faster and easier, which is important in my busy work day, with its ability to deeply moisturize scalp and hair. I&#x27;ve always thought there was no way for my hair/scalp to ever feel properly moisturized and I was going to be stuck with so-so hair for the rest of my life. Since discovering Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection I have realized that I can have the hair I want! I also love that it is pH balanced and gentle on chemically treated hair.  This moisture co-care is like a big drink of water for your scalp and hair! I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I actually used this product to test two styles,my natural fro and straighten. I loved both outcomes. My hair came out so soft that I actually didn&#x27;t put any oil in it till the second day because I forgot! The curls from my fro were defined and when I straightened my hair their was no frizz! The consistency of this product is so rich and creamy &amp; smells amazing too. Definitely making this part of my hair care routine. Thanks BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from Head &amp; Shoulders. I try for free and in return I write reviews. The Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Co-Wash works great and is the only line in your brand to eliminate dry scalp and embarrassing flakes for my bi-racial family. I would definitely recommend the Moisture Care line for Head &amp; Shoulders to any ethnic hair and for any person with textured or coarse hair. The feel of the Co-Wash is thick like conditioner and the smell is very natural and favorable! This is A MUST in your hair care routine for the shower and will totally eliminate dry scalp and flakes!!</li>
            <li> I truly love this stuff! I got to try it free from BzzAgent. It&#x27;s nice and thick, it&#x27;s a paste really. It has a toothpaste consistency, which weirded me out at first but I find that this makes it really stick to my hair so it&#x27;s not pretty much coming out as soon as I rub it in. I just put some in my hand, rub it in my hair, add a little water so I can lather it up and it makes my hair super moisturized, thick and clean feeling. I didn&#x27;t really expect much from it, but was definitely pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and have always battled dandruff.  I&#x27;ve spent lots on high end hair are products and nothing has worked this well! My hair is manageable, shiny, moisturized and for the first time in forever completely flake free!</li>
            <li> Thanks to bzzagent I got to try my new holy grail cowash, for anyone looking for a great cowash especially for girls with dry damaged and natural hair this is the cowash for you. This gives your hair just the right moisture you need and aides in getting your hair back to that healthy state that we all want. If your hesitant on trying it don&#x27;t be its is one of the best product for hair in my opinion because I was skeptical too when i first got it not knowing how much it changed my hair for the better. When you put it in your hair its so smooth and creamy you can tell right off the bat its going to be a good product trust me its worth a try. Thank me later</li>
            <li> this product is so Moisturizing got it for free from.head and shoulders and bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> I got this product free from head&amp; shoulders and the first time I use it, I like the way it made my curls like.  my hair was soft, not dryness and it really looks and feels healthy. Great job head&amp; shoulders!!!</li>
            <li> I liked it. I felt it cleansed my hair and conditioned it at the same time. I use the 2 in 1 shampoo conditioner by head and shoulders as well and I felt this one was a lot thicker and better for my hair. They recommend using a shampoo as well before this one on the bottle but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary.   After using it my curls felt a lot more bouncy and its not so heavy as to way it down either. Would definitely recommend.  i got to try it free from BzzReport &amp; Head and shoulders</li>
            <li> I was excited to join the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection for 2 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I have naturally thick, curly hair. My hair requires lots of moisture and care; which means I can&#x27;t use any type of hair care products. There are limited brands I stand behind and I am very critical with products and brands that &amp;#34;claim&amp;#34; to work for all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I suffer from mild psoriasis of the scalp. Which means I suffer from scalp irritation, intense burning and a ridiculous need to scratch, which then produces flakes and then comes the scalp sores. I have been prescribed numerous expensive types of medicated oils, sprays, rubs and shampoos that never resolved the issue...only masked them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review:&lt;br /&gt;I ABSOLUTELY love the Co-wash. I use it at least 2-3 times a week, following the 2in1 shampoo. It leaves my hair hydrated and clean. I haven&#x27;t seen a flake since I started using the product. More importantly, I have had no burning or intense itching. My curls are still healthy and bouncy and I have noticeable growth. I don&#x27;t need to use much of the product, as it spreads nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical, but now I am a believer in Head &amp; Shoulders! I intend to keep using the product and supporting the brand. I can&#x27;t explain how happy I am that I found a product that addresses all issues!!</li>
            <li> I received the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-wash Conditioner as a promotional offer from Bzzagent. After using the co-wash treatment my scalp was less irritated and my hair is more manageable and smoother. I received really love the scent. Highly recommend this product to others who are looking for the same relief</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! It is nice and thick, and allows me to detangle my hair (which i keep in a natural Afro state) easily in the shower. It makes my hair and scalp feel clean with just this product alone! I use it in between my shampoo days, or when I just need to fully refresh my hair for a new style and don&#x27;t feel as if a shampoo is needed. Highly recommend. ****i received this product through a promotion from the brand. I am in no way getting paid for this review****</li>
            <li> I love this it is amazing. I love what it does to my curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer I had the pleasure of using this for my hair and my sons hair and it works amazing I gotta say we are sold on this product. I have bought bulk!!! Thanks bzzagent for allowing me to try this for free!!!!</li>
            <li> Heavenly on textured hair. I don&#x27;t  have dandruff but I do have to deal with dry itchy scalp. My curly hair doesn&#x27;t like most shampoos and after using Head and Shoulders before (it was so drying and had my hair feeling squeaky clean which isn&#x27;t good because that means all the natural oils have been shampooed away). I was sent this in a bzzkit for free from bzzagent and decided to give it another try. I absolutely am in love with it. It provides the same dry/itchy scalp relief but without the ingredients that dry out my curls. My hair has never felt better. Highly recommend this for all textured hair.</li>
            <li> I received this product free from head and shoulders and I have to say that it is wonderful and really do help with dryness and flaking I have also tired the other products that go along with this care line and they too are equally amazing I recommend to any one with textured hair having a problem with dryness and dandruff</li>
            <li> I used the the Moisture Co-Wash that I received free from BzzAgent after a day at Six Flags and I can say that it had my hair soft just like the 2n1 Shampoo and Conditioner..I was really pleased and it also had a pleasant scent. My head was itching from sweating throughout the day and after washing my hair with the Moisture Co-Wash no more itching..#gotitfree</li>
            <li> I got this product as part of an BzzAgent campaign and I must say it&#x27;s a must have with any of the shampoos.. The way it leaves your hair feeling silky, soft, and with less frizz is amazing! I left it in a good 10 minutes before rinsing and did not have to use any additional product in my hair! I truly loved it!!</li>
            <li> I got this product free from bzzagent, to try for myself and out of the whole collection this is my favorite, its thick perfect for my relaxed thick hair to penetrate and coat each strand, after rinsing it make my hair so soft i love this product</li>
            <li> I received Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Co-Wash from BzzAgent to try for free and I absolutely love it. I used it after using Head &amp; Shoulder 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner and also by itself and I&#x27;m happy to say that it left my hair feeling light and moisturized. I would buy this product and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzzagent and head and shoulders for this free product. Surprisingly I like this new head and shoulders moisture care collection. I have not been a fan of the others because of the smell. This has a warm soothing smell that is pleasing to the nose. My favorite product is the co-wash, it leaves my hair feeling super silky and hydrated. I can comb through my natural hair without my hair falling out from being tangled.</li>
            <li> I received a free, full size bottle of the Co-Wash from BzzAgent over a month ago. I prefer to go through a few rounds with a product before placing a constructive review on it. First off, I have never tried a co-wash before. I was also new to the Head &amp; Shoulders brand too. I liked it at first, but my scalp is too oily to use co-wash. Now, after 2 weeks, I allowed my husband and children to try it out. My husbands hair is slightly more thick and coarse than mine, he loved it! Our daughter has coily, curly hair. This worked exceptionally well for her hair, but too strong chemically for her scalp (very sensitive skin and scalp). Our son has fine, wavy/curly hair, and this was awesome on his hair type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always like to use head and shoulders before I tried this product. I have a very itchy &amp; dry scalp. When I went natural I  stopped using Head &amp; Shoulders because they didn&#x27;t have a co-wash. I&#x27;ve been using this product since I received it free from Head &amp; Shoulders over a month ago. I haven&#x27;t touch any of my other products since I received this in the mail. It&#x27;s gentle enough for my 2yr old and it left his hair as soft as mine. My hair is very manageable and not dried out when I air dry or blow dry. Also no itching and dry scalp which is a winner in my book. So Head &amp; Shoulders Co-wash has a 10 in my book. Oh.. I don&#x27;t want to forget the smell is amazing and not harsh.</li>
            <li> This is great. I use it in the morning and leave it on until I get ready to leave for work. It left my curls defined, my hair was super soft and manageable. It has a nice smell also</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cow ash. Thanks to head and shoulders I received this for free and I&#x27;m hooked. I tend to have a flaky scalp. Abd once I tried this it worked immediately and not only was I flake free but hair felt so hydrated and soft. Amazing product</li>
            <li> Awesome for kinky  hair! I  have dandruff but have a dry scalp that loves Head and Shoulders. Unfortunately, my curly hair doesn&#x27;t like the way Head and Shoulders can be so drying especially when I cannot find the plain conditioner in any local stores (just the shampoo or the 2 in 1). I saw this in an article and had to try it. I absolutely love it! It provides the same dry/itchy scalp relief but without the ingredients that dry out my curls. It&#x27;s a thick and rich cleansing conditioner that has completely replaced shampoo for me and my hair has never felt better. Highly recommend this for textured hair</li>
            <li> Good Slip!! Left my dry hair and scalp very moisturized and smells great!</li>
            <li> Loving this as a second day hair cleanse without stripping my hair too much.  Great for a quick rinse in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I received this as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I received the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-Wash conditioner courtesy of Head &amp; Shoulders and Bzzagent. I have used other conditioners as a co-wash for many years and I must say that the Head &amp; Shoulders by far left my hair moisturized.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry and brittle after co-washing, from the roots my hair is very soft and feels like my hair really soaked in the moisture from co-washing it.  I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;m glad that i got a chance to try this product its my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this product it helped to moisturize my scalp. Also it gives my curls more definition.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and my hair and scalp feel amazing!!! No more itching and sore scalp from itching and my hair feel so healthy. I will for sure keep on buying this product!!</li>
            <li> Bzzagent was nice enough to send me the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture care system. Although I relax (more texlax but still processed) my hair I find that co-washing is best to lock in moisture and prevent shampoos from stripping your hair. The Moisture Care Co-Wash really did the job and it left my hair feeling soft and untangled. Often times when I co-wash I find that conditioners will leave my hair tangled forcing me to have to finger comb it out , but I didn&#x27;t have to do it with this. My scalp also felt nice and it left my strands looking healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> Being that I am a natural girl, I prefer to cowash more than regular shampoo to preserve the natural oils in my hair. But I have a huge problem with dandruff so sometimes just co-washing alone doesn&#x27;t do the trick. So when I received the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Co-wash free to try through BzzAgent I was anxious to see if it actually worked. This is one of the best co-washes I have used because it left my hair feeling moisturized and not completely stripped of oils. It also fought the heavy dandruff I had on my scalp. I would most definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used Head and Shoulders before in the past and knew it wouldn&#x27;t be a product that I would use on a regular wash day. But I was really excited to try it out when I was sent this product to reveiw. Coconut and almond oil really made me willing to give it a try since I use coconut oil almost daily. When I first used the shampoo it instantly dried and striped my hair! My hair became very tangled. I WAS PISSED!!! Head and Shoulders need to remove the word Total Moisture from the Bottle because it didn&#x27;t leave my hair moisturized at all. I couldn&#x27;t even run my fingers through my hair at all. Once I did, get my hair untangle, I had a fist full of hair from just combing through my hair!!!!! Never again</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m a Head &amp; Shoulders girl now! The shampoo and co-wash worked very well for me. I had noticeably less dandruff and flakes and almost no itching after the first use. I did have to use more leave in conditioner, because I felt my hair was drier, but it was worth not having flakes and itching. I&#x27;ve used more expensive products in the past and didn&#x27;t have results as good as this! The bigger bonus was I got to try this product for free from Buzz Agent!</li>
            <li> I received the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-wash Conditioner as a promotional offer from Bzzagent.  My children are bi-racial and have curly hair that is often times very dry after shampooing.  The co-wash from Head and Shoulders left their hair clean and did not strip it from all its natural oils.  And a bonus was that it smelled good. I will definitely purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> The H&amp;S moisture care has helped with my flakes and itchy scalp and it has also added some moisture to my natural hair I&#x27;m using it every weekly wash day and I&#x27;ve told some of my friends who live by H&amp;S products and they are telling me it works just as well as any of their other products</li>
            <li> I received Head &amp; Shoulders Moisturizing Co-Wash to review several weeks ago. I have to say....this stuff is AWESOME! My husband, who is African American, and my daughter and I, who are Hispanic and African American, have been very pleased with how soft, shiny and flake free our hair and scalp have been since using this product.  This product cleans the hair and scalp without stripping the natural oils and weakening the hair. It also soothes the scalp and prevents dandruff. It is moisturizing, without weighing the hair down. It smells SO great.  I will definitely buy this product in the future and would recommend it for others.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get what the point of a co-wash is when you are already using a shampoo/conditioner in one. That being said, I really liked the way it left my hair super soft, silky and manageable.</li>
            <li> Im in love with this new Cowash from Head and Shoulders!!!  I started using the Pantene brand but it wasnt effective as the Head and Shoulders. It keeps my hair moistured and keeps the flakes away. I love it!!! Im happy I was able to give it a try. I think every person with natural hair to give it a go. Its worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the second Co-wash product on the market I&#x27;ve ever tried and I was pleasantly surprised at the results of this product which is only a fraction of the cost of what I&#x27;ve been using, and with the benefit of specifically helping to stay flake free. Head and Shoulders gave me this product to try for free in partnership with BzzAgent and I am so glad I took the chance to try it. This is the first product that I have found other than at a salon that actually moisturizes my hair and scalp while conditioning at the same time. Almost every shampoo product, including those only found at salons, can leave my hair feeling gummy and hard to comb through. With this 2 in 1 Co Wash after thr shower my hair was easy to comb through felt soft and moisturized and smelled great. Over the couse of a week or so, I had less itchiness and fewer flakes. This stuff works great. I highly recommend this for textured hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have textured hair, I accidentally bought this at Walmart in a hurry, thinking it was shampoo. I got home, disappointed, but still tried it out and LOVED IT!!! It was like conditioner for your scalp (where you&#x27;re not supposed to put condition). It made my hair so soft and clean feeling. I now use every other day and it makes me so much happier with my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a good detangler is the only positive I have to say about this product.  All of the other claims by this co-wash did not work for my hair. Every product is not for everyone.  I recieved the head and shoulders co wash  to try out by being a Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> This is great for quick moisture boost in the shower. It helps to prevent flakes. I&#x27;ve noticed less to no flakes from using this product. It smells nice and rinses clean. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> THE DIRECTIONS ON THE BOTTLE  SAYS TO USE AFTER SHAMPOOING WITH THE 2-IN-1. HONESTLY, I DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND IT&#x27;S PURPOSE.  AFTER USING IT I DID NOT NOTICE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE.  MY HAIR FELT LIKE I WASHED IT WITH THE 2-IN-1 AGAIN. I EVEN HAD TO APPLY MY REGULAR HAIR CONDITIONER TO GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE SLIP.  I LIKE THE IDEA OF THIS PRODUCT  BUT IS NOT ENOUGH TO USE AFTER SHAMPOOING. I RECEIVED THIS AS PART OF A PROMOTION FROM THE BRAND</li>
            <li> Do you have a dry scalp? If so this is the product for you. I used the co-wash as a part of the moisture care collection and I was very pleased. I have a dry scalp and the entire collection is helping me get rid of flakes. For that I am truly grateful. Would defiantly recommend.</li>
            <li> I loved my free Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-Wash Conditioner. I walked in a room and my sister asked if i was eating coconut.  The scent is fresh, and makes my hair moisturized and feels refreshing.  The scent last long but is not over powering.  i would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I was chosen to try the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care line, and the Co-Wash was among them. I have thick, curly, dry shoulder length hair and moisture is extremely important for my hair type. First, I loved the coconut scent! It&#x27;s amazing and one of my absolute favorite scents. So I was very excited to give this a whirl. I slathered it on my hair and used a wide tooth comb to make sure it was evenly distributed throughout my hair. I left it on my hair for the remainder of my shower, as I normally do, and was pleased with the results. My hair felt so soft, smelled great and didn&#x27;t look dry or dull. My son has my hair type and he really likes this product too. For anyone with dry scalp, and naturally textured hair, I certainly think you should give this Co-Wash a try. I would have given it 5 stars but it&#x27;s missing a little something, maybe a tinge more moisturizer and this would be perfect!</li>
            <li> I really like the co wash because it has coconut oil in it and I really like that. It makes my hair soft and bouncy as well as getting and help fight any dandruff I have. This is an awesome product to try j am really glad head and shoulders made a product for black women. This is great. I received this free from head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product.. I didn&#x27;t feel like it cleaned my hair and it definitely didn&#x27;t make it soft.. I will not purchase this product again</li>
            <li> I love this product!! my hair is coarse and lacks moisture. This co wash has worked wonders. My hair is very soft and clean! Love that I didn&#x27;t have to use shampoo because my hair is dry enough. Added bonus is that this smells amazing as well!!</li>
            <li> I love the co wash it helped out with the dryness of the 2-1.</li>
            <li> I received the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-Wash for free from a Head &amp; Shoulders Campaign with BzzAgent.  I was a little skeptical at first, since I didn&#x27;t fully understand what Co-Wash was and couldn&#x27;t imagine it being a replacement of conditioner for my very long hair.  However, since I have been using the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-Wash I really have been noticing a big difference to the texture and enjoying the smoothness of my hair.  During humid summer months in New York, my textured hair is my worst enemy.  It is generally unruly and very dry.  Since using this product, I have found my hair to be full of moisture (in a good way!), smooth and easier to tame.  I loved that this new line of Head and Shoulders products are formulated with vitamin E–rich almond oil and coconut essence - unlike most anti-dandruff products that smell like medicine, the scent of this line is incredible and leaves my long hair looking healthy and shiny throughout the day.  The co-wash, along with the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Shampoo, helps to additionally cleanse the daily summer residue that my hair tends to build up, fight dry heat flakes and leaves my hair easy to style without the use of any other heavy or harmful products.  I am beyond impressed by both the simplicity and quality of this product and will surely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I am a member of BzzAgent and was able to try this product for free. However, I feel compelled to write a review because it was an excellent product. First it has a natural coconut scent that isn&#x27;t overbearing. The scent stays on your hair long after it is washed. The co-wash leaves my hair soft and even takes away a lot of the frizz. But, what you want and need to know is that the Co-Wash works amazingly at eliminating flakes and dandruff. Yes, it works. Yes, you should use it. I will go back for this soon!</li>
            <li> I really like this. I was sent this Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture care dandruff co-wash to try as part of promotion from the brand and really like it. I was thrown off when I saw the words &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34; on the bottle, from what I understand co-washing is when you wash your hair with conditioner. However after I read the back I realized that I could use it as an actual conditioner which is what I intended to do. I think this was great conditioner, it was moisturizing but not heavy and had I no trouble rinsing it out. I don&#x27;t know what it would be like if you used it as your sole product as you washed your hair but if you just need a conditioner this is a nice one to try.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from Head &amp; Shoulders. After being less than impressed by the scalp soother spray, I had very low expectations for this product. I was wrong, this co-wash had a wonderful creamy texture and was actually moisturizing for me. It left my scalp feeling refreshed and didn&#x27;t leave a filmy residue. It did not strip my hair and leave it dry like some other co-washes I&#x27;ve tried. I would repurchase, the relief it gives my itchy scalp is worth it. My only negative isn&#x27;t related to the product itself, mores so the bottle - I would prefer if it came in a pump style dispenser, but that&#x27;s not enough for me to not give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from BzzAgent and after using the Moisture Care co-wash, I realized that I really didn&#x27;t need it after using the 2in1. It really didn&#x27;t do anything for  my hair. It actually appears as a lotion more than a co-wash.</li>
            <li> From a African American busy mother of 5 who has long suffered from dry, itchy scalp  I must say this product really does what it is intended to do. I love the fact that it contains almond oil and is specially formulated for textured hair. I have used other products and my scalp would always feel just as dry or feel like there is a buildup after use, but not this one. I love this new line and will definitely make sure this becomes a staple in my bathroom cabinet. I am so thankful to have received the product as part of a promotion from the brand!</li>
            <li> so thanks to bzz agent i was able to try out the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture care collection. I absolutely love this product. Due to living in Florida, being maintenance for our apartment complex, and going to the beach my hair is constantly dry. Since Ive been using the moisture care i no longer deal with dry and itchy scalp which is great i dont feel like a crazy person always scratching. #GotItFree</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this product. I received it in a Bzzagent Kit for free. It really moisturized my hair as well as my sisters who is completely natural. She has curly hair and it often times can dry out quickly and get frizzy and this product just made it melt like butter.Just SUPER smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I received Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Co-Wash, as part of a promotion. At first I was skeptical. My hair is think a curly and most products say they can help, but only make it worse. I love the Co-Wash! It is light feeling, non-greasy, The smell is heavenly, best of all i am dandruff free and have been for weeks! My curls look awesome and are beyond soft!</li>
            <li> I received the Moisture Care Co-Wash free courtesy of Head &amp; Shoulders and Bzzagent. I was truly skeptical about using it on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair because I&#x27;ve only used shampoos that are specially formulated for natural ethnic hair. I honestly was truly surprised by the results! Their hair was extremely soft and not the least bit dry after using the Co-Wash. It smells good and is super thick as to where I didn&#x27;t feel that I needed to use a lot to get a good wash. I will definitely be keeping this on hand for them!</li>
            <li> Received this product as a buzzagent for review.&lt;br /&gt;First thing I did was read the directions and I noticed that it says to wash your hair before using the product. I was a little confused because most &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34; products are meat to take the place of shampoo / condition that you would normally do. At least in my naturalista mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tired the product I thought it was OK. My hair was moisturized but not to the extent that I have had with other products. Now I had just taken my hair down from wearing a weave soooooo maybe I needed more than just a co-wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a week later I used both the 2-1 which made my hair very dry. I then followed it with the co-wash to see if I could add some moisture back and it did but not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say give it a try. It&#x27;s nice to have a product line especially made for AA hair textures that you can buy in any store. You don&#x27;t have to go searching to the &amp;#34;hair store.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like with all products it will work differently for the individual so it doesn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Smells good and seems to do a good job, but I didn&#x27;t realize I was to use it AFTER shampooing. So I&#x27;ve now started to shampoo with another co-wash and use this after. We&#x27;ll see how it works out!</li>
            <li> My natural hair looks so amazing after using this product , I enjoyed trying this product for free. I really am so grateful to be able to finally have manageable hair.  #GotItFree If you have coarse thick hair give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have mixed (black and white) hair that I wear natural and straight. I got this product for free from Head &amp; Shoulders to test and review, this did not influence my opinion. I used this to boost the power of the Moisture Care 2 in 1. I loved how rich and thick it was. I did need about a palm full to cover all of my long hair. It did not weigh my hair down or leave any residue or build-up. It rinsed thoroughly and cleanly. It definitely kept my hair hydrated and moist. It kept my hair flake-free. I did not feel any tightness on my scalp. It also helped my style stay in place while irritation and dandruff stayed far away.</li>
            <li> I got this product through Bzzagent and I have to say that I do kind of like it. I used the cowash last night and I was a bit worried. Last time I co-washed it left me feeling uncomfortable because my scalp wasnt left clean and it just made more build up. HOWEVER, when I used this cowash, it didn&#x27;t do that. My scalp was clean! And my curls were nice and moisturized. It is better than the previous co washes that I have done buuut I would rather stick to my usual regimen that doesn&#x27;t really involve co washing</li>
            <li> I recently discovered co washing, so when I got ahold of this I was super excited to try it. And I&#x27;m soooo glad I did. It&#x27;s creamy, smells great, and best of all sooths my normally dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I used this co-wash in conjunction with the matching 2 and 1 shampoo and conditioner.  This conditioner is very thick, smells clean and moisturizes very well. I am having the best hair day! My hair is soft yet my curls are defined. I would have never thought to try Head and Shoulders but I am glad I was given the opportunity. Great product for the curlys!  A must try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: I was given this product to try and sample*</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and from time to time I am sent products to try and review. I am currently using the new product line from Head &amp; Shoulders. This Moisture Care Collection is awesome! I have the 2-N-1 shampoo &amp; conditioner, the co-wash, and the scalp treatment. I have used the co-wash this week and I can already feel the difference. My scalp isn&#x27;t itchy, I haven&#x27;t seen a flake in two days!!!!!! The scalp treatment is to be applied directly to the scalp where itching/flaking is present, yet I haven&#x27;t had to use it. I will try the 2-n-1 next week and let you guys know how it goes...</li>
            <li> I received the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Co-wash Conditioner for free from Bzzagent. After using the co-wash treatment my scalp was less irritated, dry and itchy and my hair is more manageable and smoother. I really love the coconut smell. I would defnetly be using this product line again and would highly recommend this product to others who are looking for the same relief</li>
            <li> I got this free to try from bzz.com at first i was learly about a co wash from head and shoulders. I am a natural girl and was concerned. This product actually works. It could provide a little more slip as i work it thru my hair. And of course with having thick hair i use a half full product to reach my scalp like i need it to. A few more tweeks and this product can be awesome.</li>
            <li> Works great love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> OK I love this product. I received the head &amp; shoulders moisture care co-wash from bzzagent for free. I was a little skeptical because I tried this lines 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner and did not like it but this product is great. I have very dry thick hair and my curl pattern is a 4c. So I am always looking for products that provide a lot of moisture. This product did exactly that. It smells great and is very creamy. It also provided a lot of slip allowing me to comb through my hair with my fingers easily. Overall I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try out this product, since I have been searching for products that work well with my natural hair and a product that will keep my hair moisturized,and I have found it.  This product is enriched with Vitamin E and shea Butter.  I am really loving this product because it is not expensive like many companies (SheaMoisture, etc) that are especially made for the curly- ladies.</li>
            <li> I love this co-wash product by Head &amp; Shoulders. I received it for free from BzzAgent. I really do not have a problem with dandruff, but I used this after taking down braids to detangle and deep condition my hair. I left it on for a few hours, and after washing my hair it was very soft and manageable. I would definitely recommend! #GotitFree #GreatforTexuredHair</li>
            <li> We have all heard of Head&amp;Shoulders. I must say that created a good product here for the curly hair people. I received this to try from the company. I&#x27;m glad i did.. It added so much moisture to my hair...my curls were popping...i didn&#x27;t want to tock my hair, it was that pretty,  i want to preserve the curls!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my children. They&#x27;re mixed and if I have them wash their hair more than 1-2x a week it gets dried out and really kind of brittle looking. The co-wash from H&amp;S has their hair smelling great, and feeling really soft. It makes it so much easier to manage their hair and to style it that I don&#x27;t think we will ever be using another shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received from BzzAgent in exchange for a honest/unbiased review*</li>
            <li> I recieved this product curtesy of buzzagent. Unlike its counter part 2 in 1 moustier the co wash was less disappointing. My hair still was not as moustierzed as a &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34; conditoner should.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have used Head &amp; Shoulders before but this is a step up. This is the first co-wash (specific) conditioner I used. I really liked it. It was a light, nice smell. It cleaned my hair well. It was easy to put on my hair and easy to wash out. Good for anyone who deals with dandruff or product build up as well. Leaves hair feeling soft. This product was given to me as a promotion from the company BZZagent. Opinion is my true feelings.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. The only reason that I am giving this product four stars instead of five is that I wish the silky feeling that I got while it was in my hair remained after I washed it out. Other than that this is an awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;Instantly as I added it to my hair I felt a difference. What was the difference? De-tangling!!!! It was a breeze in the shower with this product. it has amazing slip. Smells amazing and is enjoyable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People please get this product it is worth every penny. I already bought two more to stock up. Not running out of this baby.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product free courtesy of the Head &amp; Shoulders.  Not impressed, I found this product extremely drying to my scalp. My hair felt really clean and free of product build up, but my scalp was tight and dry. I actually had more flakes in the days following use of this product than I started with! I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times with the same result.  I do use another brand shampoo and conditioner regularly. Perhaps this works better when used as part of Head Shoulders hair care only. Additionally, if you color your hair with semi permanent hair color, this product will strip the color completely. Overall I would recommend due to cleansing effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This co wash is an amazing cleansing conditioner which is gently scented and I love its consistency. I got to try this product free courtesy of the brands promotional program. It helps lock in moisture, relieve itchy scalp and  most importantly leaves my hair beautiful. Although it says for textured hair I perm my hair 2 to 3 times yearly.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this Cowash by Head &amp; Shoulders ! I was surprised to learn that they have a co-wash. I received the co-wash along with a few other of their products free for testing purposes. I do not co-wash often but the idea of helping dandruff in this way makes perfect sense. I&#x27;ve tried dandruff shampoos and some are a bit too stripping. This has a really nice smell and my hair felt nice and soft afterwards. Definitely a product I have already recommended and will continue to recommend.</li>
            <li> This cowash product is thick and moisturizing for curly, coily, frizzy hair. After using this product that I received as a promotional product, I like the way it moisturized my curly hair and made it feel soft and moisturized it worked great for my hair texture  which is curly and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Honestly this is the best product i&#x27;ve used and it is best for textured /curly hair when applying the product it was to wet hair. After my wash i never had my hair feel so moisturized it was soft and very very manageable no tangles or knots easily combed out and styled i recieved my product free to test from buzzAgent</li>
            <li> Just tried my new Head and Shoulders Moisture care collection from my Bzz Agent Promotion the other day and I love it. The shampoo left my hair manageable and the conditioner made my hair feel like butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A day later i used the scalp soother and it worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this collection :-)</li>
            <li> I really like this product, definitely works for my itching and dryness I had, I recommended anyone who has that problem to try it.</li>
            <li> Best ever. I got this product for free from buzz agent, and normally I don&#x27;t like many hair care products that go together but the set of the new head and shoulder 2 in 1 shampoo and this product is great together. my hair was really soft after my wash, I used this product multiple times already and its great.</li>
            <li> It does what a co-wash is designed to do. Cleanse away all the products from the week without leaving your hair dry as a bone. You get a good amount of product in the bottle. It doesn&#x27;t have any strong smells, so it mixes well with other products you would apply to your hair. It doesn&#x27;t have your usual chalk white conditioner look it ha s a light taupe color. It is extremely thick but glides through my thick curls and coils. For the accessibility of the line and the price point.I think its a good buy.I got to try this in a free kit on bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> I tried the co-wash in return for honest feedback, through bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off the smell is very nice. Pineapple &amp; coconut, even though the bottle says coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is nice &amp; thick, a lil goes a long way. A co-wash for those who haven&#x27;t tried or heard of it, is a cleansing conditioner. Use it maybe in between semi-weekly washes. For my curly textured hair I alternate between a one weekly cleansing clarifying shampoo, and co-washing all the other days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This co-wash by Head &amp; Shoulders moisture care line really does wonders for my curls. My scalp is flake free, non irritated &amp; well balanced. My curls are silkier and have more bounce than when using a conditioner and a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my routine much easier in the shower, as I am only using the one product in the shower routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps ;)</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness I adore this stuff. I have curly hair with psoriasis.   I always bought head and shoulders for my husband but would never use it because the smell.  ONce I tried the new head and shoulders co-wash coconut scent I knew my scalp could now be flake free and smell great!      now have my own head and shoulders.  The cowash is the greatest..  Leaves my hair smelling great, shiny, flake free and so soft.  Thank you head and shoulders....I never thought I would say that you are now my go to shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Awesome for curly hair! I do not have dandruff but have a dry scalp that loves Head and Shoulders. Unfortunately, my curly hair doesn&#x27;t like the way Head and Shoulders can be so drying especially when I cannot find the plain conditioner in any local stores (just the shampoo or the 2 in 1). I saw this in an article and had to try it. I absolutely love it! It provides the same dry/itchy scalp relief but without the ingredients that dry out my curls. It&#x27;s a thick and rich cleansing conditioner that has completely replaced shampoo for me and my hair has never felt better. Highly recommend this for textured hair!</li>
            <li> The Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Co-Wash is perfect for naturals.  It left my hair feeling clean and super soft with amazing shine.  This product is so great it is a stand alone product for my 3B hair.  That&#x27;s right, no other products needed after using it.  I  was able to try this product for free through BzzAgent.  It as well as other products from the Moisture Care Collection were included in my Bzzkit.  I did not expect for this product to be so amazing.  I will definitely purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this product but since i received it for free through BzzAgent i figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try. My hair was very soft and moisturized after using the shampoo and co-wash and my curls looked very nice if i do say so myself! I was a little thrown by the texture of the products but was still very impressed with the results. I would totally purchase and encourage others too as well. I should also add that i have long curly hair that has a thin to medium texture, not thick at all.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. I received it for free from bzzagent. This really relieves my dry course hair. I an currently transitioning to nature And itbworjs without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I received this cowash free as part of a promotion from head and shoulders.  I absolutely love how soft and manageable it leaves my hair. The uncomfortableness of a dry scalp is gone.  I am always scared to try new products on my easily damaged hair.  But I am glad I tried this!</li>
            <li> I got this entire line free from Head and Shoulders to try out and of all the products this was my favorite hands down surprisingly!! It smells good and it&#x27;s creamy. Has some slip but not too much. It leaves my hair feeling rather soft as well.  The only reason I can&#x27;t give it a 5 is because their coconut oil isn&#x27;t as high on the ingredients list as I&#x27;d like it and it did take a little color out of my hair but nothing major (not like the 2n1).</li>
            <li> I got this product as a promotional offer for free from Head and Shoulders. I actually like it. It did a good job cleansing my hair and my hair felt soft after using it. I do suffer from itchy patches on my scalp and I noticed after using this that I didn&#x27;t get itchy as fast and my scalp has not been as flaky. I will keep using it to see if it can make a permanent change to my scalp. It smells great. The consistency is slightly runny but it&#x27;s no big deal. I was confused that the ingredients didn&#x27;t list coconut at all. It&#x27;s kinda weird to have it pictured on the bottle and its not on the list.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for free from bzzagent, all opinions are my own. I like the head &amp; shoulders Co Wash Moisture care. I used this after I used the 2 in 1 shampoo and it helped keep my hair from drying out. I also like that I could use this instead of shampooing all the time. It helped with flakes, itchiness and it has nice oils in the ingredients. It also smells good, I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. I was given the opportunity to try this for free courtesy of BzzAgent and Head and Shoulders. I love how soft and shiny it made my hair feel and look. I have thick hair so this worked really well for my hair texture. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for fine hair as it will probably weigh it down. Smells good and extra perk, I&#x27;m flake-free!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good combination with the shampoo. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave your hair dry.</li>
            <li> I love this CO wash!! I just used this yesterday and I just loved it. It had so much slip and I was able to detangle my hair with ease. with me being a natural I need products that will be good for my hair. My had did not feel rough it was so soft. All three products worked actually and I will be getting more of this once it is gone. I also got these products free from Head &amp; Shoulders. Thanks for these wonderful product keep them coming!!</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick 3B curls that are prone to drying. After using a hair conditioner that caused a severe allergic reaction which included: blistering hives from my scalp to legs, severe dandruff, rawness and general itchiness. I knew that I really something that would help my hair with the itching, dandruff and hives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This co-wash has no sulfates and is thick; you really feel it cleansing the scalp. I couldn&#x27;t detangle my hair with only this co-wash. However -- after I detangled with my rinse out conditioner, I was able to get enough slip to run my brush through my hair without pulling any out or pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp feels and looks so much better! The fact that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a cleansing conditioner makes it so much more useful. I don&#x27;t even need to worry so it the dryness from shampooing often while getting the full benefits of shampoo (iE, a cleansed scalp and hair). It smells so nice, too! Their &#x27;Textured Hair&#x27; line is surely going to be my new favorite of theirs.</li>
            <li> So creamy. Love it for my 4a/4b hair.</li>
