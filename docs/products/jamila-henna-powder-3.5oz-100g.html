    <ol>
            <li>This henna mixes the best of all the hennas I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>The henna was great!!!</li>
            <li>Greatest deal online and off 1 buy lasted me about a year.</li>
            <li>Very beautiful!</li>
            <li>Nothing but great results!</li>
            <li>IF YOU ARE DOING HENNA, MAKE THE PASTE 2-3 DAYS BEFORE HAND FOR THE BEST STAIN.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with this brand whenever I use it for henna staining my skin.</li>
            <li>and they said it was the correct Jamila, which is one of the best Henna&#x27;s in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This is VERY good henna.</li>
            <li>I loved it!</li>
            <li>Brown Henna Hair Dye 100 Grams]]these work beautifully.</li>
            <li>I used this Jamila Henna and it&#x27;s worked great in and on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have had great results</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>and I got really good results.</li>
            <li>I heard so much good news about henna, so i decided to try it,  </li>
            <li>i think i did good 1st time using it, it condtion</li>
            <li>The product states &#x27;Superior Quality Haircolor&#x27; instead of \\&quot;Superior Quality Henna&#x27; which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li>It was a good quality</li>
            <li>Ordered 4 of these and the packaging did not say \\&quot;Superior Quality Henna\\&quot; like it shows in the photo, but it says \\&quot;Superior Quality Hair Color\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It worked great and had a nice dye release.</li>
            <li>I loved the results I achieved using Jamila Henna Powder.  </li>
            <li>I know that henna is usually good for 2 years,</li>
            <li>However, it had good color release and covered my greys well.  </li>
            <li>Well, after I did the application, my henna results were actually really good.  </li>
            <li>I loved it, it wasn&#x27;t in foil wrap</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really good for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The henna mixed with my aloe vera juice wonderfully, and the dye release was great!</li>
            <li>Not so sure what kind of henna mix it was, but for sure NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing henna for years, and Jamila has consistently been the best product for the money.  </li>
            <li>This is the first henna I ever bought, so I may not have the best opinion.</li>
            <li>I used the product on my hair, and the color came out amazing.</li>
            <li>I  was really happy with the product and noticed light highlights.</li>
            <li>I had been hearing so many good reviews online, when searching for what brand of henna I should use.</li>
            <li>It made my hair nice, but since it&#x27;s not what was advertised I give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t looking for a tint, but i got one, it was nice.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know what happened.</li>
            <li>that bothered me but honestly my biggest gripe is that the henna came out orange.</li>
            <li>and it is nice and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for this wonderful product and fast shipping :) 4/5</li>
            <li>good product, but too strong for my hair.</li>
            <li>It washed out very easily.</li>
            <li>It goes on, and washes out easily, leaving a beautiful, rich, long-lasting stain.     </li>
            <li>This one is one the most popular ones I saw.</li>
            <li>So make sure you call them and figure out what kind of henna</li>
            <li>Once we received it and saw the box it seemed that the powder was more for hair dying than tattoos.  </li>
            <li>This is hell of a lot better than a rinse.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product though and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Your best bet is to open it with scissors rather than tearing it.    </li>
            <li>I love henna</li>
            <li>Followed directions and was pleased with results.</li>
            <li>was expecting something better and fresh....will not order more....</li>
            <li>I really do love the product.</li>
            <li>my hair and my hair color    was not like i wanted it, but its ok i will just use regual hair color  and use the henna as a condtion treatement when i think i need it, over all  </li>
            <li>I coupled it with indigo and the results were fantastic!</li>
            <li>and then i have this crappy, carrot colored, literally orange hair at the top (these are on my grays)</li>
            <li>While this henna worked okay on my palms, it didn&#x27;t work at all on my skin.</li>
            <li>It does need to be sifted to make sure it doesn&#x27;t clog my cones.</li>
            <li>I have used henna to color my gray hair many times before so I am not a novice.  </li>
            <li>yet the BAQ is better than the Henna for Hair. :)</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It washes out a lot easier and it gives my hair a much better color.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel more conditioned</li>
            <li>so I looked more and found Jamila Henna Powder and after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>I must say that I was 100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li>i think my solution might&#x27;ve been too strong--snapped most of it like a twig</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d started to notice more and more hair in the drain after showers and one of the many things I&#x27;ve read about henna</li>
            <li>but it ended up being pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to finally get some color in my hair after reading all of the superb reviews and comments.</li>
            <li>Henna is an ancient product and I feel comfortable and confident when I use it.</li>
            <li>This is a very inexpensive way to keep my hair looking good.</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft, conditioned, and has a very nice auburn tint in the sun.</li>
            <li>This product is a great price, but when it comes to using it for mehndi it dies a bit light and didn&#x27;t take nearly as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Works we&#x27;ll shipping quickly, easily.</li>
            <li>The powder seems nice enough - it&#x27;s not clumpy, and the deal was a good one.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the easiest to rinse out (apparently the 2009 product is the best when it comes to that), but it gives great color and works well with indigo to dye my hair black.</li>
            <li>In general, it is an excellent product, however, my 2010 shipment will probably work very well on hair.</li>
            <li>My first design lasted only a week, but maybe that&#x27;s because I dont have the best skin</li>
            <li>The sift is quite fine, no grit.</li>
            <li>Although we have purchased this brand before and it worked fine</li>
            <li>It is very finely processed, very easy to apply (as far as henna goes).</li>
            <li>So I ordered some last summer and got great results with it.</li>
            <li>as well PLEASE feel free to share.     </li>
            <li>The henna was not as fresh and as greenish but more brown .</li>
            <li>and it does fantastic things for my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The henna mixes (say, for auburn, light brown, etc.)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand because it&#x27;s easy to find and has consistent results.</li>
            <li>, I took a risk, and so far, I am pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I was expecting to receive the original Jamila henna that I always purchase in the silver bag</li>
            <li>, my henna lasted me three uses from the single box, (I have shoulder length hair), and provided great color each time.</li>
            <li>, my henna lasted me three uses from the single box, (I have shoulder length hair), and provided great color each time.</li>
            <li>It completely covered the gray hair even better than chemical dyes!</li>
            <li>This is a high quality henna that was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The red wasn&#x27;t bright, but it shone well in sunlight.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, the identical one that I bought at the Indian Grocery store had a good colour release and rinsed out easily enough</li>
            <li>The hair is better at absorbing dyes than the skin is.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s a good year I get extra boxes and keep them in my freezer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I received the super quality jamila henna.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and everything was correct.</li>
            <li>Soft, strong, red-tinted curlies!</li>
            <li>but I live in the Caribbean so purchasing in bulk makes more sense for me.</li>
            <li>Following instructions I found online,  I was able to use Jamila Henna to condition and tint my hair fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>The color deposit is not as strong as BAQ, but pretty good for a henna that was not fresh.</li>
            <li>I love this henna, my hair was soft.</li>
            <li>I used to use a different kind of henna until I found Jamila and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>So we threw it away and went to the India store and bought a different kind</li>
            <li>That alone is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I have tried one other brand of henna and this henna is of superior quality.</li>
            <li>Do your research before mixing because you need the right consistency.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just not mixing it just right?</li>
            <li>If i would be able to find another NATURAL 100% henna , I will drop Jamila like a hot potato.</li>
            <li>Now that I have new, known good henna, I thought that doing henna would actually work on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great - not sure if it&#x27;s great-er, but it does work well</li>
            <li>it says superior henna what a joke) or a fake because it didn&#x27;t do anything but ruin my lovely curls!</li>
            <li>The powder is very easy to mix and use but the tattoos don&#x27;t get very dark, they stay more of an orange color than the nice dark brown we wanted.</li>
            <li>After using Jamila the brown turned out to be a deep rich auburn color and the gray, light highlights of red/auburn.  </li>
            <li>The henna gave me a vibrant, warm red, like I had in my twenties.</li>
            <li>This was my first time as a henna user.</li>
            <li>this is my first time buying henna online.  </li>
            <li>But lIke I said, I&#x27;ve had long lasting color that looks great after it sets for about week</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the results and will continue to use it for the foreseeable future.  </li>
            <li>I use this henna to dye my beard, head hair, and occasionally my skin as well and love it.</li>
            <li>When I used this product for the first time, I noticed that the dye didn&#x27;t release after sitting there for 8 hours.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll see how it goes the first time and go on from there.</li>
            <li>It came out more like a carrots red on my hair</li>
            <li>Since using this product my breakage has decreased significantly, I am retaining far more length, and my hair is more voluminous my twist outs and other styles look so great.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>In that time, and I thought it was a fluke the first time</li>
            <li>My hair is a medium brown, and I used this product hoping to achieve more red.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do henna often but this should last way more than one pack from the DIY box.</li>
            <li>Jamila Henna Powder left my hair soft, shiny, with a spectacular color.</li>
            <li>I was really worried about trying henna for the first time.</li>
            <li>After using henna, and after it&#x27;s developed, most of my hair is a rich deep reddish/brown color, (and much redder in the sun) with the grays/whites being a more slightly carroty/golden color.</li>
            <li>Finely sifted and produces a deep, chocolate brown stain on both hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I have fine 4A kinky/curly hair and am very prone to breakage although I deep condition weekly and moisturize my hair well.</li>
            <li>and it does a great job of strengthening my hair follicles (I can actually see my strands clearly in the mirror!)and slightly loosening my extra curly hair pattern (making it more manageble).</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>the jenna arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing happened.</li>
            <li>God knows what it really is</li>
            <li>Really like this brand of henna.  </li>
            <li>but I was really expecting the dated box.</li>
            <li>My hair really loves this stuff..</li>
            <li>it works rather well&amp;&amp;it&#x27;s really affordable..</li>
            <li>the quality of th us product us very good&amp;&amp;I recommend it to anyone who enjoys applying henna to their hair..</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t seem like it needs to be sifted.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s wrapped in Saran Wrap with a knit beanie on my head the whole time.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>When you open the box, it is NOT in a foil pouch, but in a cheap plastic pouch.</li>
            <li>I absolutely ADORE this product.</li>
            <li>but this doesn&#x27;t stain the skin very well.</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer, the color is much richer, and it doesn&#x27;t fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At least with those boxes I have a fairly good idea what the results will be.</li>
            <li>product is definitely better than some other hennas sold.</li>
            <li>Well it took 3 hours for the dye to release once i mix it and 5 hours for it to stain my hair a rich red color.</li>
            <li>Fast shopping and a decent product ell around,no problems and</li>
            <li>i absolutely love the red stain it leaves on my grey hair and it makes my hair so soft and full.</li>
            <li>paying WAY less then if you get a kit at a craft store, preparation is pretty easy.</li>
            <li>And sweet- I got exactly what I expected, quality henna for my hair.</li>
            <li>With this brand, I have gotten a decent stain just using purified water, lemon juice and the powder.</li>
            <li>I do wish I&#x27;d ordered more, for three weeks back to back applications.</li>
            <li>this particular order</li>
            <li>this particular order</li>
            <li>The recommendations were high</li>
            <li>so was not holding my hopes high.  </li>
            <li>Anyways honestly don&#x27;t waste your money this product on there are hundreds of other great and legitimate henna dyes on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The color that came out not exactly like promised more orange yellow than red, But the henna was well grinded fine poweder...</li>
            <li>Theres enough henna in this box for at least 20 detailed hand designs, probably more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly long my color lasted, but it did last more than 2 months,</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this henna again, and the shipping was right on time that it claimed i would get it.</li>
            <li>So far my hair is softer, has a subtle colour and feels very healthy.</li>
            <li>If you live in the states you probably wont mind ordering every month</li>
            <li>, you could barley see the design, then we bought new tools and tried again</li>
            <li>came in a cheap looking imitation box.</li>
            <li>I used it again a couple of days ago, this time using warm water, a splash of lemon juice, left it in a warmer place, and checked it every few hours.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff and have been using it for a few months so far.</li>
            <li>The color looks very natural not brassy.</li>
            <li>but this time we tried to mix it several times and never could get to stain or show very much color</li>
            <li>This product has completely transformed my hair!</li>
            <li>: Make sure you deep condition afterwards to restore moisture as it is drying even though extremely beneficial.</li>
            <li>I normally purchase Henna from another site that specializes in Henna and natural products</li>
            <li>Due to my prior use of the other henna, the ends are now this beautiful red</li>
            <li>now the benefits/pros (less hair in the drain, hair feels like hair, beautiful color) far out weigh the cons (smell, very messy, major fear of dying skin</li>
            <li>now the benefits/pros (less hair in the drain, hair feels like hair, beautiful color) far out weigh the cons (smell, very messy, major fear of dying skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying this as long as it&#x27;s available, never going back to chemical dye again!</li>
            <li>You get more of a reddish-brown stain than dark brown (especially on hands/feet).  </li>
            <li>I used warm water and left it in room temperature, as I usually do.  </li>
            <li>Jamila was a completely different experience easy to put in, easy to wash out and the color is very subtle.</li>
            <li>No stiff hay-like feel after using henna, as it is with hair dye.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little nervous about buying Jamila (6 for the price of one) because it&#x27;s so cheap.  </li>
            <li>Adding the essential oils gives me a gorgeous dark stain in minimal time which is nice when I&#x27;m doing it with teens or other people who are too impatient to let it sit for hours on their skin.</li>
            <li>The package inside was clear and the box was sealed and dated.d shampoo it out.</li>
            <li>The package inside was clear and the box was sealed and dated.</li>
            <li>FOR HAIR\\&quot; clearly on the inside, and indeed, it leaves no trace of a tattoo on skin.</li>
            <li>The product was delivered fast and on my shorter hair I had enough for two separate applications.</li>
            <li>I´m really surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>it covered my gray hair an red-orange color, it also made my hair very shiny, although there was no expiration date on the box, I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>It is a month old, time to try it again.</li>
            <li>may be becuase heena was old...</li>
            <li>I am trying to use natural and strengthening products in my hair, so if anyone may have any suggestions for shampoo or anything else</li>
            <li>it made my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>So far I have used it two times in my hair and will use it again this weekend.</li>
            <li>and I use it for my hair and skin frequently.</li>
            <li>I am a professional henna artist</li>
            <li>Upon opening, the powder is brown and not green</li>
            <li>and i have been using this henna for nearly five years</li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>(my hair is naturally carmel in color).</li>
            <li>I tried lush&#x27;s henna that was a complete NIGHTMARE</li>
            <li>too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an African-American natural and tried this by recommendation.</li>
            <li>All my life I use henna because it is natural.</li>
            <li>definitely do not waste anymore time on amazon henna.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so natural looking</li>
            <li>I was sent fake henna in a clear cellophane container and the box read superior quality hair color.</li>
            <li>I used a sulfate free shampoo every other day and still, the color was gone after about ten days.</li>
            <li>after i flat ironed my hair, that&#x27;s when i really notice the softness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a few boxes, the first couple arrived looking brand new, the last couple arrived looking like they&#x27;d probably spent some time in a warehouse in the sun, but the product inside was just fine, no problems with it at all.</li>
            <li>Sadly since I cant and I cannot be bothered to order every month I&#x27;m probably switch to bulk henna but Jamila henna will always be my first love.</li>
            <li>It does not give a deep, rich, long lasting color on the skin.</li>
            <li>I had purchased Jamila&#x27;s henna since I normally buy it and use it from a local store in the city.</li>
            <li>I was normally using the Dulhan brand from my local indian grocery stores.</li>
            <li>but all of a sudden 4 out of 4 of my local stores no longer had dulhan or any pure henna for that matter.</li>
            <li>This product description states that the paste will leave a tattoo if applied, set to dry, and then scraped gently off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted to dye my jet black hair brown for a while I tried one henna product with out success</li>
            <li>I mixed with half lemon juice, half warm water, let dye release for 12 hours and applied overnight.  </li>
            <li>This one looked old, the henna was brown in color (did not have the olive green color), and didn&#x27;t have the distinct henna smell.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels stronger and has a lovely subtle red tint.</li>
            <li>The colour thatI got is a subtle honey colour which is due to the a mixture of the permanent colour I had used and my own more dark brown than black hair.</li>
            <li>but I plan to in the near future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done all of my hair 2 or 3 times, and am now at the point where I can use this on just my roots, it barely fades at all.</li>
            <li>Jamila Henna has no additives, just henna, so no pink hair, which is why I tried this versus a mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Desiring a much darker color due to gray along the temples.</li>
            <li>Buyer beware, shop around before you pay your money and try to be as clear as possible about the product that you will actually get.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, can be fiddled with to produce different results (SLIGHTLY different) and</li>
            <li>and my hair is not long!</li>
            <li>First time trying to help with shedding, left my hair smoother and a slight hint of reddish maroon color.</li>
            <li>And the bag the powder is in is rather thin like cellophane; it tore easily, and I ended up with some powder on my kitchen counter.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This henna mixes the best of all the hennas I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> The henna was great!!!</li>
            <li> Greatest deal online and off 1 buy lasted me about a year.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful!</li>
            <li> Nothing but great results!</li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE DOING HENNA, MAKE THE PASTE 2-3 DAYS BEFORE HAND FOR THE BEST STAIN.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this brand whenever I use it for henna staining my skin.</li>
            <li> and they said it was the correct Jamila, which is one of the best Henna&#x27;s in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is VERY good henna.</li>
            <li> I loved it!</li>
            <li> Brown Henna Hair Dye 100 Grams]]these work beautifully.</li>
            <li> I used this Jamila Henna and it&#x27;s worked great in and on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have had great results</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> and I got really good results.</li>
            <li> I heard so much good news about henna, so i decided to try it,  </li>
            <li> i think i did good 1st time using it, it condtion</li>
            <li> The product states &#x27;Superior Quality Haircolor&#x27; instead of \\&quot;Superior Quality Henna&#x27; which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> It was a good quality</li>
            <li> Ordered 4 of these and the packaging did not say \\&quot;Superior Quality Henna\\&quot; like it shows in the photo, but it says \\&quot;Superior Quality Hair Color\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It worked great and had a nice dye release.</li>
            <li> I loved the results I achieved using Jamila Henna Powder.  </li>
            <li> I know that henna is usually good for 2 years,</li>
            <li> However, it had good color release and covered my greys well.  </li>
            <li> Well, after I did the application, my henna results were actually really good.  </li>
            <li> I loved it, it wasn&#x27;t in foil wrap</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The henna mixed with my aloe vera juice wonderfully, and the dye release was great!</li>
            <li> Not so sure what kind of henna mix it was, but for sure NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing henna for years, and Jamila has consistently been the best product for the money.  </li>
            <li> This is the first henna I ever bought, so I may not have the best opinion.</li>
            <li> I used the product on my hair, and the color came out amazing.</li>
            <li> I  was really happy with the product and noticed light highlights.</li>
            <li> I had been hearing so many good reviews online, when searching for what brand of henna I should use.</li>
            <li> It made my hair nice, but since it&#x27;s not what was advertised I give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t looking for a tint, but i got one, it was nice.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what happened.</li>
            <li> that bothered me but honestly my biggest gripe is that the henna came out orange.</li>
            <li> and it is nice and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for this wonderful product and fast shipping :) 4/5</li>
            <li> good product, but too strong for my hair.</li>
            <li> It washed out very easily.</li>
            <li> It goes on, and washes out easily, leaving a beautiful, rich, long-lasting stain.     </li>
            <li> This one is one the most popular ones I saw.</li>
            <li> So make sure you call them and figure out what kind of henna</li>
            <li> Once we received it and saw the box it seemed that the powder was more for hair dying than tattoos.  </li>
            <li> This is hell of a lot better than a rinse.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product though and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Your best bet is to open it with scissors rather than tearing it.    </li>
            <li> I love henna</li>
            <li> Followed directions and was pleased with results.</li>
            <li> was expecting something better and fresh....will not order more....</li>
            <li> I really do love the product.</li>
            <li> my hair and my hair color    was not like i wanted it, but its ok i will just use regual hair color  and use the henna as a condtion treatement when i think i need it, over all  </li>
            <li> I coupled it with indigo and the results were fantastic!</li>
            <li> and then i have this crappy, carrot colored, literally orange hair at the top (these are on my grays)</li>
            <li> While this henna worked okay on my palms, it didn&#x27;t work at all on my skin.</li>
            <li> It does need to be sifted to make sure it doesn&#x27;t clog my cones.</li>
            <li> I have used henna to color my gray hair many times before so I am not a novice.  </li>
            <li> yet the BAQ is better than the Henna for Hair. :)</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> It washes out a lot easier and it gives my hair a much better color.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel more conditioned</li>
            <li> so I looked more and found Jamila Henna Powder and after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the product</li>
            <li> I must say that I was 100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li> i think my solution might&#x27;ve been too strong--snapped most of it like a twig</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d started to notice more and more hair in the drain after showers and one of the many things I&#x27;ve read about henna</li>
            <li> but it ended up being pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally get some color in my hair after reading all of the superb reviews and comments.</li>
            <li> Henna is an ancient product and I feel comfortable and confident when I use it.</li>
            <li> This is a very inexpensive way to keep my hair looking good.</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft, conditioned, and has a very nice auburn tint in the sun.</li>
            <li> This product is a great price, but when it comes to using it for mehndi it dies a bit light and didn&#x27;t take nearly as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Works we&#x27;ll shipping quickly, easily.</li>
            <li> The powder seems nice enough - it&#x27;s not clumpy, and the deal was a good one.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the easiest to rinse out (apparently the 2009 product is the best when it comes to that), but it gives great color and works well with indigo to dye my hair black.</li>
            <li> In general, it is an excellent product, however, my 2010 shipment will probably work very well on hair.</li>
            <li> My first design lasted only a week, but maybe that&#x27;s because I dont have the best skin</li>
            <li> The sift is quite fine, no grit.</li>
            <li> Although we have purchased this brand before and it worked fine</li>
            <li> It is very finely processed, very easy to apply (as far as henna goes).</li>
            <li> So I ordered some last summer and got great results with it.</li>
            <li> as well PLEASE feel free to share.     </li>
            <li> The henna was not as fresh and as greenish but more brown .</li>
            <li> and it does fantastic things for my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The henna mixes (say, for auburn, light brown, etc.)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand because it&#x27;s easy to find and has consistent results.</li>
            <li> , I took a risk, and so far, I am pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to receive the original Jamila henna that I always purchase in the silver bag</li>
            <li> , my henna lasted me three uses from the single box, (I have shoulder length hair), and provided great color each time.</li>
            <li> , my henna lasted me three uses from the single box, (I have shoulder length hair), and provided great color each time.</li>
            <li> It completely covered the gray hair even better than chemical dyes!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality henna that was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The red wasn&#x27;t bright, but it shone well in sunlight.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, the identical one that I bought at the Indian Grocery store had a good colour release and rinsed out easily enough</li>
            <li> The hair is better at absorbing dyes than the skin is.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s a good year I get extra boxes and keep them in my freezer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I received the super quality jamila henna.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and everything was correct.</li>
            <li> Soft, strong, red-tinted curlies!</li>
            <li> but I live in the Caribbean so purchasing in bulk makes more sense for me.</li>
            <li> Following instructions I found online,  I was able to use Jamila Henna to condition and tint my hair fairly easily.  </li>
            <li> The color deposit is not as strong as BAQ, but pretty good for a henna that was not fresh.</li>
            <li> I love this henna, my hair was soft.</li>
            <li> I used to use a different kind of henna until I found Jamila and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> So we threw it away and went to the India store and bought a different kind</li>
            <li> That alone is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I have tried one other brand of henna and this henna is of superior quality.</li>
            <li> Do your research before mixing because you need the right consistency.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not mixing it just right?</li>
            <li> If i would be able to find another NATURAL 100% henna , I will drop Jamila like a hot potato.</li>
            <li> Now that I have new, known good henna, I thought that doing henna would actually work on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great - not sure if it&#x27;s great-er, but it does work well</li>
            <li> it says superior henna what a joke) or a fake because it didn&#x27;t do anything but ruin my lovely curls!</li>
            <li> The powder is very easy to mix and use but the tattoos don&#x27;t get very dark, they stay more of an orange color than the nice dark brown we wanted.</li>
            <li> After using Jamila the brown turned out to be a deep rich auburn color and the gray, light highlights of red/auburn.  </li>
            <li> The henna gave me a vibrant, warm red, like I had in my twenties.</li>
            <li> This was my first time as a henna user.</li>
            <li> this is my first time buying henna online.  </li>
            <li> But lIke I said, I&#x27;ve had long lasting color that looks great after it sets for about week</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the results and will continue to use it for the foreseeable future.  </li>
            <li> I use this henna to dye my beard, head hair, and occasionally my skin as well and love it.</li>
            <li> When I used this product for the first time, I noticed that the dye didn&#x27;t release after sitting there for 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll see how it goes the first time and go on from there.</li>
            <li> It came out more like a carrots red on my hair</li>
            <li> Since using this product my breakage has decreased significantly, I am retaining far more length, and my hair is more voluminous my twist outs and other styles look so great.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> In that time, and I thought it was a fluke the first time</li>
            <li> My hair is a medium brown, and I used this product hoping to achieve more red.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do henna often but this should last way more than one pack from the DIY box.</li>
            <li> Jamila Henna Powder left my hair soft, shiny, with a spectacular color.</li>
            <li> I was really worried about trying henna for the first time.</li>
            <li> After using henna, and after it&#x27;s developed, most of my hair is a rich deep reddish/brown color, (and much redder in the sun) with the grays/whites being a more slightly carroty/golden color.</li>
            <li> Finely sifted and produces a deep, chocolate brown stain on both hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I have fine 4A kinky/curly hair and am very prone to breakage although I deep condition weekly and moisturize my hair well.</li>
            <li> and it does a great job of strengthening my hair follicles (I can actually see my strands clearly in the mirror!)and slightly loosening my extra curly hair pattern (making it more manageble).</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> the jenna arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing happened.</li>
            <li> God knows what it really is</li>
            <li> Really like this brand of henna.  </li>
            <li> but I was really expecting the dated box.</li>
            <li> My hair really loves this stuff..</li>
            <li> it works rather well&amp;&amp;it&#x27;s really affordable..</li>
            <li> the quality of th us product us very good&amp;&amp;I recommend it to anyone who enjoys applying henna to their hair..</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t seem like it needs to be sifted.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s wrapped in Saran Wrap with a knit beanie on my head the whole time.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> When you open the box, it is NOT in a foil pouch, but in a cheap plastic pouch.</li>
            <li> I absolutely ADORE this product.</li>
            <li> but this doesn&#x27;t stain the skin very well.</li>
            <li> My hair is much softer, the color is much richer, and it doesn&#x27;t fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At least with those boxes I have a fairly good idea what the results will be.</li>
            <li> product is definitely better than some other hennas sold.</li>
            <li> Well it took 3 hours for the dye to release once i mix it and 5 hours for it to stain my hair a rich red color.</li>
            <li> Fast shopping and a decent product ell around,no problems and</li>
            <li> i absolutely love the red stain it leaves on my grey hair and it makes my hair so soft and full.</li>
            <li> paying WAY less then if you get a kit at a craft store, preparation is pretty easy.</li>
            <li> And sweet- I got exactly what I expected, quality henna for my hair.</li>
            <li> With this brand, I have gotten a decent stain just using purified water, lemon juice and the powder.</li>
            <li> I do wish I&#x27;d ordered more, for three weeks back to back applications.</li>
            <li> this particular order</li>
            <li> this particular order</li>
            <li> The recommendations were high</li>
            <li> so was not holding my hopes high.  </li>
            <li> Anyways honestly don&#x27;t waste your money this product on there are hundreds of other great and legitimate henna dyes on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The color that came out not exactly like promised more orange yellow than red, But the henna was well grinded fine poweder...</li>
            <li> Theres enough henna in this box for at least 20 detailed hand designs, probably more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly long my color lasted, but it did last more than 2 months,</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this henna again, and the shipping was right on time that it claimed i would get it.</li>
            <li> So far my hair is softer, has a subtle colour and feels very healthy.</li>
            <li> If you live in the states you probably wont mind ordering every month</li>
            <li> , you could barley see the design, then we bought new tools and tried again</li>
            <li> came in a cheap looking imitation box.</li>
            <li> I used it again a couple of days ago, this time using warm water, a splash of lemon juice, left it in a warmer place, and checked it every few hours.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff and have been using it for a few months so far.</li>
            <li> The color looks very natural not brassy.</li>
            <li> but this time we tried to mix it several times and never could get to stain or show very much color</li>
            <li> This product has completely transformed my hair!</li>
            <li> : Make sure you deep condition afterwards to restore moisture as it is drying even though extremely beneficial.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase Henna from another site that specializes in Henna and natural products</li>
            <li> Due to my prior use of the other henna, the ends are now this beautiful red</li>
            <li> now the benefits/pros (less hair in the drain, hair feels like hair, beautiful color) far out weigh the cons (smell, very messy, major fear of dying skin</li>
            <li> now the benefits/pros (less hair in the drain, hair feels like hair, beautiful color) far out weigh the cons (smell, very messy, major fear of dying skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying this as long as it&#x27;s available, never going back to chemical dye again!</li>
            <li> You get more of a reddish-brown stain than dark brown (especially on hands/feet).  </li>
            <li> I used warm water and left it in room temperature, as I usually do.  </li>
            <li> Jamila was a completely different experience easy to put in, easy to wash out and the color is very subtle.</li>
            <li> No stiff hay-like feel after using henna, as it is with hair dye.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little nervous about buying Jamila (6 for the price of one) because it&#x27;s so cheap.  </li>
            <li> Adding the essential oils gives me a gorgeous dark stain in minimal time which is nice when I&#x27;m doing it with teens or other people who are too impatient to let it sit for hours on their skin.</li>
            <li> The package inside was clear and the box was sealed and dated.d shampoo it out.</li>

            <li> FOR HAIR\\&quot; clearly on the inside, and indeed, it leaves no trace of a tattoo on skin.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered fast and on my shorter hair I had enough for two separate applications.</li>
            <li> I´m really surprised by the results.</li>
            <li> it covered my gray hair an red-orange color, it also made my hair very shiny, although there was no expiration date on the box, I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is a month old, time to try it again.</li>
            <li> may be becuase heena was old...</li>
            <li> I am trying to use natural and strengthening products in my hair, so if anyone may have any suggestions for shampoo or anything else</li>
            <li> it made my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it two times in my hair and will use it again this weekend.</li>
            <li> and I use it for my hair and skin frequently.</li>
            <li> I am a professional henna artist</li>
            <li> Upon opening, the powder is brown and not green</li>
            <li> and i have been using this henna for nearly five years</li>
            <li> No issues so far.</li>
            <li> (my hair is naturally carmel in color).</li>
            <li> I tried lush&#x27;s henna that was a complete NIGHTMARE</li>
            <li> too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an African-American natural and tried this by recommendation.</li>
            <li> All my life I use henna because it is natural.</li>
            <li> definitely do not waste anymore time on amazon henna.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so natural looking</li>
            <li> I was sent fake henna in a clear cellophane container and the box read superior quality hair color.</li>
            <li> I used a sulfate free shampoo every other day and still, the color was gone after about ten days.</li>
            <li> after i flat ironed my hair, that&#x27;s when i really notice the softness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few boxes, the first couple arrived looking brand new, the last couple arrived looking like they&#x27;d probably spent some time in a warehouse in the sun, but the product inside was just fine, no problems with it at all.</li>
            <li> Sadly since I cant and I cannot be bothered to order every month I&#x27;m probably switch to bulk henna but Jamila henna will always be my first love.</li>
            <li> It does not give a deep, rich, long lasting color on the skin.</li>
            <li> I had purchased Jamila&#x27;s henna since I normally buy it and use it from a local store in the city.</li>
            <li> I was normally using the Dulhan brand from my local indian grocery stores.</li>
            <li> but all of a sudden 4 out of 4 of my local stores no longer had dulhan or any pure henna for that matter.</li>
            <li> This product description states that the paste will leave a tattoo if applied, set to dry, and then scraped gently off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to dye my jet black hair brown for a while I tried one henna product with out success</li>
            <li> I mixed with half lemon juice, half warm water, let dye release for 12 hours and applied overnight.  </li>
            <li> This one looked old, the henna was brown in color (did not have the olive green color), and didn&#x27;t have the distinct henna smell.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels stronger and has a lovely subtle red tint.</li>
            <li> The colour thatI got is a subtle honey colour which is due to the a mixture of the permanent colour I had used and my own more dark brown than black hair.</li>
            <li> but I plan to in the near future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done all of my hair 2 or 3 times, and am now at the point where I can use this on just my roots, it barely fades at all.</li>
            <li> Jamila Henna has no additives, just henna, so no pink hair, which is why I tried this versus a mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Desiring a much darker color due to gray along the temples.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware, shop around before you pay your money and try to be as clear as possible about the product that you will actually get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, can be fiddled with to produce different results (SLIGHTLY different) and</li>
            <li> and my hair is not long!</li>
            <li> First time trying to help with shedding, left my hair smoother and a slight hint of reddish maroon color.</li>
            <li> And the bag the powder is in is rather thin like cellophane; it tore easily, and I ended up with some powder on my kitchen counter.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman who has natural hair</li>
            <li> but I usually cave right at 4 to 4 and half.</li>
            <li> My hair color didn&#x27;t change and it didn&#x27;t cover my grey hair.</li>
            <li> Speaking of money, if you still are curious about experimenting with this product, it&#x27;s probably cheaper at your local Indian grocery store: $1.99 as opposed to $5.99.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t come with any instuctions as to how to mix it or how long to leave it on.</li>
            <li> I swear these golden reviews are also false too.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder-length, and I mixed up only half the powder, which was plenty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps I got a bad batch, but I&#x27;m really disappointed about this product since there are so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Now i am not saying this is a good or bad thing as I am still not sure how i feel about it, but the texture of my hair was definitely different.  </li>
            <li> I mixed as I usually do my other henna and rinse it out</li>
            <li> They used, what looked like a Jamila box, but was considerably smaller than my other Jamila boxes.</li>
            <li> It might work for somebody with auburn or dark red hair.</li>
            <li> Half of a box is enough to touch my roots and ends once or twice a year</li>
            <li> mixed mine with  paprika, sugar, amla oil, black tea,</li>
            <li> Regardless, whatever results you do manage to get with this product last less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a small change in the growth and general health of my hair.    </li>
            <li> I  mixed it with 4 bags of green tea(2</li>
            <li> Did what it I expected.</li>
            <li> color did not came out as what was expected....</li>
            <li> Total waste of time and money.   </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and thick.  </li>
            <li> I even took a picture of this one in comparision to the one I purchased from the other site and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used henna 4x times, every other month for about six months now, and have not dyed my hair since.</li>
            <li> But there are other benefits too, like, my hair feels like hair again.</li>
            <li> have indigo and other additives.</li>
            <li> My concern is that it might secretly have metals in it, which worries me for in the future if I ever want to do something different.</li>
            <li> If your hair is darker (mine&#x27;s dark brown), this does nothing to cover your grays.</li>
            <li> This product went on well, and colored my hair, but the desciption says that it is dark redish brown</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark brown.  </li>

            <li> I miss in the afterwards wipe down)</li>
            <li> What I received is brown color, and it&#x27;s less than 100 grams in the package.</li>
            <li> my RAVEN black hair color</li>
            <li> since-- less hair in the drain after showers.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll take slightly carroty gold over that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it has a tendency to give me a slight headache.</li>
            <li> no highlights not even a little lightening</li>
            <li> But my designs just aren&#x27;t turning out very dark.  </li>
            <li> instead I got a smaller badly printed box with a clear bag.</li>
            <li> I had used it, and it seemed that I wasted my time applying it.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair mixing with green tea, honey, and olive oil</li>
            <li> This heavily implies that it&#x27;s a henna tattoo formula, and it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I usually mix it with water and a little lemon, let it sit for an hour.  </li>
            <li> It was very disappointing to learn that it didn&#x27;t have the fresh henna smell.</li>
            <li> I have imported Jamila henna for body art purposes for the past 4 years.  </li>
            <li> I usually use(...).  </li>
            <li> :/  </li>
            <li> it was so pointless</li>
            <li> I do not love the smell.</li>
            <li> Considering how messy and time consuming it is to do properly color your hair with henna, I found the results disappointing.</li>
            <li> Dissapointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> To my disappointment, I paid almost five dollars for something that I could have paid $1.79 + tax for at my local indian grocery store (in Hollywood Fl).</li>
            <li> Like any other plant product, henna can go stale and stop staining --</li>
            <li> I too, like other posters on here, received the fake henna product.</li>
            <li> Instead, what I got was some questionable dark brown powder, with the interior of the box stating that it is &#x27;henna for hair&#x27;, whatever that is.</li>
            <li> I like to use henna on my hair and this gave me a subtle auburn color.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to someone unwilling to have a mess, a ruined towel, and an uncomfortable bag on their head overnight.</li>
            <li> Too bad there are no punitive damages for the hassle of having to buy this counterfeit product, otherwise, I&#x27;d definitely sign up for that as well!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not pleasant, and over the course of waiting the three hours I leave it on</li>
            <li> Not BAQ, the color is weak.</li>
            <li> I still have are going to get dusty.</li>
            <li> I still have are going to get dusty.</li>
            <li> This is false advertising and should be removed immediately.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Too bad I&#x27;m past the return time, since I ordered a 6 pack.</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad bach</li>
            <li> This is fake henna.</li>
            <li> I contacted the Jamila company and the gentleman says that this is a fake product, the packaging inside the box will be in foil and that they do not make \\&quot;Hair Color\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Lame, Amazon.</li>
            <li> The product does not even smell like henna, so I am afraid to even use it, so I am promptly returning it for a refund.</li>
            <li> it was a fake henna!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad for the price</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed with either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Real lame.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because I needed it that day for a demonstration in college</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We were looking for Henna powder to use for Henna tattoos and we came across the Jamila Powder.  The recommendations were high so we bought it.  Once we received it and saw the box it seemed that the powder was more for hair dying than tattoos.  The powder is very easy to mix and use but the tattoos don&#x27;t get very dark, they stay more of an orange color than the nice dark brown we wanted.</li>
            <li> I have imported Jamila henna for body art purposes for the past 4 years.  In general, it is an excellent product, however, my 2010 shipment will probably work very well on hair. It does not give a deep, rich, long lasting color on the skin. Maybe next year.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thinning gray hair. This product covered all the gray and brought life back to my hair. The color looks very natural not brassy. [[ASIN:B000RLBTMA Jamila Henna Powder 3.5oz (100g)]]I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I had been hearing so many good reviews online, when searching for what brand of henna I should use. This one is one the most popular ones I saw. So I ordered some last summer and got great results with it. My ends were already dyed so I didn&#x27;t want to use anything that would damage it any further. I recommend this to does with already colored hair and want to dye it a color with a reddish tint. This is hell of a lot better than a rinse. Of course, like all hair dyes, the color fades after a while. I don&#x27;t know exactly long my color lasted, but it did last more than 2 months, (I think it was around 3 months).</li>
            <li> I used this Jamila Henna and it&#x27;s worked great in and on my hair. It makes my hair soft and thick.  I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I bought this henna to use on my hair and I got really good results. The product was delivered fast and on my shorter hair I had enough for two separate applications. I loved it!</li>
            <li> I´m really surprised by the results. Jamila Henna Powder left my hair soft, shiny, with a spectacular color. I recommend this product. Since I will definitely use it again</li>
            <li> I bought this to condition my hair. The description says that it&#x27;s body art quality, but I received the hair color quality which is subpar to the body art quality. It made my hair nice, but since it&#x27;s not what was advertised I give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This henna mixes the best of all the hennas I have ever tried. It goes on, and washes out easily, leaving a beautiful, rich, long-lasting stain.     It imparts a shining gloss, and strengthens the hair shaft.     I will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It isn&#x27;t the easiest to rinse out (apparently the 2009 product is the best when it comes to that), but it gives great color and works well with indigo to dye my hair black. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. So far my hair is softer, has a subtle colour and feels very healthy. I had used permanent colour on my hair before and still had some on my ends and I&#x27;ve had no adverse effects from the henna. The colour thatI got is a subtle honey colour which is due to the a mixture of the permanent colour I had used and my own more dark brown than black hair. I wish I could get this in bulk. Sadly since I cant and I cannot be bothered to order every month I&#x27;m probably switch to bulk henna but Jamila henna will always be my first love. If you live in the states you probably wont mind ordering every month but I live in the Caribbean so purchasing in bulk makes more sense for me. I love this product though and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used the product on my hair, and the color came out amazing. I do recommend testing in on a lock or two of your hair (I had saved some from my last trim) so you can see what color it&#x27;ll give you. My hair is naturally red but dulled from age. The henna gave me a vibrant, warm red, like I had in my twenties. I wore latex gloves and applied it with my hands, but you could also use a paintbrush or a comb.    The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the packaging. The box does not contain any instructions for use. Not on the outside nor on a product insert. Nada. I had to ask the seller for instructions. And the bag the powder is in is rather thin like cellophane; it tore easily, and I ended up with some powder on my kitchen counter. Your best bet is to open it with scissors rather than tearing it.    Depending on the length of your hair, you might get two applications out of 1 package. My hair is shoulder-length, and I mixed up only half the powder, which was plenty.</li>
            <li> This review is short-I got it within a couple days. And sweet- I got exactly what I expected, quality henna for my hair.</li>
            <li> The henna was great!!! I  mixed it with 4 bags of green tea(2 cups),and left it on for about 7hrs, rinsed ,deep conditioned(left that on over night) it covered my gray hair an red-orange color, it also made my hair very shiny, although there was no expiration date on the box, I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this henna, my hair was soft. i wasn&#x27;t looking for a tint, but i got one, it was nice. after i flat ironed my hair, that&#x27;s when i really notice the softness. I will definitely buy this henna again, and the shipping was right on time that it claimed i would get it.</li>
            <li> I have not yet tried this henna rinse.  I usually use(...).  I have had great results w/this.  I mix it w/green tea instead of lemon juice and I mix in 2-3 tablespoons of honey just before I put it on my hair.  The thing is, why such a difference in price?  I&#x27;m a little nervous about buying Jamila (6 for the price of one) because it&#x27;s so cheap.  I love henna and it&#x27;s results on my hair.  I will give this a try.  Maybe. lol.</li>
            <li> Did what it I expected. Do your research before mixing because you need the right consistency.</li>
            <li> This was my first time as a henna user. Followed directions and was pleased with results. It is a month old, time to try it again. I will mix indigo with it this time. Desiring a much darker color due to gray along the temples.</li>
            <li> color did not came out as what was expected....may be becuase heena was old...was expecting something better and fresh....will not order more....</li>
            <li> I really do love the product. I have noticed a small change in the growth and general health of my hair.    Henna is an ancient product and I feel comfortable and confident when I use it. I am trying to use natural and strengthening products in my hair, so if anyone may have any suggestions for shampoo or anything else as well PLEASE feel free to share.     I would like to know if there are specific things to add or apply to the Henna.    Thank you for this wonderful product and fast shipping :) 4/5</li>
            <li> I had purchased Jamila&#x27;s henna since I normally buy it and use it from a local store in the city. But, recently they didn&#x27;t carry them anymore, so I purchased it off amazon. It was very disappointing to learn that it didn&#x27;t have the fresh henna smell. It smelled metallic. No color. I had used it, and it seemed that I wasted my time applying it. Not so sure what kind of henna mix it was, but for sure NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that this henna powder was not specifically for body art but it ended up being pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> The powder seems nice enough - it&#x27;s not clumpy, and the deal was a good one.  But my designs just aren&#x27;t turning out very dark.  Maybe I&#x27;m just not mixing it just right?</li>
            <li> I heard so much good news about henna, so i decided to try it,  i think i did good 1st time using it, it condtion my hair and my hair color    was not like i wanted it, but its ok i will just use regual hair color  and use the henna as a condtion treatement when i think i need it, over all  i like the henna, i will order it again.</li>
            <li> the jenna arrived fast. I  was really happy with the product and noticed light highlights. I plan on using the product again.</li>
            <li> Fast shopping and a decent product ell around,no problems and it made my hair really soft and shiny. I coupled it with indigo and the results were fantastic!</li>
            <li> I used this for a year and it made my hair grow the longest it has been since my pregnancy. Greatest deal online and off 1 buy lasted me about a year.</li>
            <li> I received the super quality jamila henna. Mixed it in tea, grapefruit juice, and some lemon and waited 12 hours. I applied it to my brown hair and left it on for 7 hours. Absolutely nothing happened. My hair was never dyed. I honestly don&#x27;t know what happened. I guess I will try something else.</li>
            <li> This is fake henna. What I received is brown color, and it&#x27;s less than 100 grams in the package. Too bad I&#x27;m past the return time, since I ordered a 6 pack. :/  Do not buy this henna. God knows what it really is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing henna for years, and Jamila has consistently been the best product for the money.  A lot of hennas need sifting to remove chunks or bits of sticks/leaves, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this brand.    You get more of a reddish-brown stain than dark brown (especially on hands/feet).  Very beautiful!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and everything was correct. The henna mixed with my aloe vera juice wonderfully, and the dye release was great! So far I have used it two times in my hair and will use it again this weekend. Nothing but great results! Soft, strong, red-tinted curlies! I have found my staple henna!</li>
            <li> I have been using henna in my hair for about a year. I was normally using the Dulhan brand from my local indian grocery stores. I dont know if they stopped making that brand or something but all of a sudden 4 out of 4 of my local stores no longer had dulhan or any pure henna for that matter. at any rate because of all this ive had to search elsewhere for comparable price and i found this on amazon. I have heard of Jamila before but ive never seen it in stores and this is my first time buying henna online.  I mixed as I usually do my other henna and rinse it out and bam, I notice my hair is definitely does not look the same. Now i am not saying this is a good or bad thing as I am still not sure how i feel about it, but the texture of my hair was definitely different.  that bothered me but honestly my biggest gripe is that the henna came out orange. Due to my prior use of the other henna, the ends are now this beautiful red and then i have this crappy, carrot colored, literally orange hair at the top (these are on my grays) i purposely waited to write this review to see if it would become darker over time but nope still have orange hair.  I will never buy this brand again and now that i know its Dulhan i used before (it took this experience for me to seek out and search the brand i was actually using prior) i will continue my quest to find that brand at a similar price i was paying.</li>
            <li> This product was lame.it didn&#x27;t dye release so I couldn&#x27;t use it.i tried it multiple times, i&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad bach but I do not recommend this henna for hair.</li>
            <li> Really like this brand of henna.  I have had no problems with using it over the last year.  Works great.</li>
            <li> This product was not as shown as picture. The product states &#x27;Superior Quality Haircolor&#x27; instead of \\&quot;Superior Quality Henna&#x27; which is why I purchased it. I wanted the later. Dissapointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> I like to use henna on my hair and this gave me a subtle auburn color.  I have tried one other brand of henna and this henna is of superior quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this henna thinking that it was the dated, body art quality Jamila brand. To my disappointment, I paid almost five dollars for something that I could have paid $1.79 + tax for at my local indian grocery store (in Hollywood Fl). It was a good quality but I was really expecting the dated box. Buyer beware, shop around before you pay your money and try to be as clear as possible about the product that you will actually get. At the end of the day, the identical one that I bought at the Indian Grocery store had a good colour release and rinsed out easily enough so I could have saved my money.</li>
            <li> My hair really loves this stuff..it works rather well&amp;&amp;it&#x27;s really affordable..it even lasts me a longtime..the quality of th us product us very good&amp;&amp;I recommend it to anyone who enjoys applying henna to their hair..</li>
            <li> This is the first henna I ever bought, so I may not have the best opinion. You get a box that is a bit bigger than a deck of cards. The henna is inside a plastic bag inside. It really doesn&#x27;t seem like it needs to be sifted. My first design lasted only a week, but maybe that&#x27;s because I dont have the best skin and i only let it sit for a day. IF YOU ARE DOING HENNA, MAKE THE PASTE 2-3 DAYS BEFORE HAND FOR THE BEST STAIN. Theres enough henna in this box for at least 20 detailed hand designs, probably more.</li>
            <li> Now that I have new, known good henna, I thought that doing henna would actually work on my skin. While this henna worked okay on my palms, it didn&#x27;t work at all on my skin. This henna comes without instructions, and that&#x27;s a problem.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to receive the original Jamila henna that I always purchase in the silver bag instead I got a smaller badly printed box with a clear bag.The henna was not as fresh and as greenish but more brown .</li>
            <li> Two of my packages were the cellophane, one package was foil but no date. I still had red hair color though, and I&#x27;m no expert on Henna, so I don&#x27;t know what results I&#x27;m supposed to have compared to what I&#x27;m getting. There is no label on the box that says BAQ even though the title description says that it is BAQ. But lIke I said, I&#x27;ve had long lasting color that looks great after it sets for about week and my hair feels stronger, dryer but stronger; so I guess the packages have done what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;My mix is a package with Lemon Juice until its a yogurt consistency, and then it sets for 10 hours, then I apply it everywhere, every time because I&#x27;m looking for maximum saturation on my strands and I let that set for 4-5 hours, I try to hold out for the 5 but I usually cave right at 4 to 4 and half. And it&#x27;s wrapped in Saran Wrap with a knit beanie on my head the whole time. Then I use suave conditioner to get it out, and I cover in Coconut Oil through the night while I sleep. My concern is that it might secretly have metals in it, which worries me for in the future if I ever want to do something different. But that&#x27;s only because the packaging doesn&#x27;t look like what I&#x27;ve seen on the internet.</li>
            <li> Following instructions I found online,  I was able to use Jamila Henna to condition and tint my hair fairly easily.  I was pleased with the results and will continue to use it for the foreseeable future.  My hair feels stronger and has a lovely subtle red tint.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change on my hair after I used this product. My hair color didn&#x27;t change and it didn&#x27;t cover my grey hair.</li>
            <li> Works we&#x27;ll shipping quickly, easily. Reasonable price. I order this product every 6 months. Keeping reorder whenever I ran out off it.</li>
            <li> Did NOT receive henna powder. Instead, what I got was some questionable dark brown powder, with the interior of the box stating that it is &#x27;henna for hair&#x27;, whatever that is. DO NOT PURCHASE</li>
            <li> It does everything henna should, it&#x27;s BAQ and I use it for my hair and skin frequently. Half of a box is enough to touch my roots and ends once or twice a year</li>
            <li> I am a professional henna artist and I swear by Jamila henna -- it&#x27;s vacuum-packed for freshness and has a harvest date stamped on the bottom.  Like any other plant product, henna can go stale and stop staining -- the window for freshness is about 2 years for body art and 6 years for your hair.  The hair is better at absorbing dyes than the skin is.</li>
            <li> Ordered 4 of these and the packaging did not say \\&quot;Superior Quality Henna\\&quot; like it shows in the photo, but it says \\&quot;Superior Quality Hair Color\\&quot;.  I contacted the Jamila company and the gentleman says that this is a fake product, the packaging inside the box will be in foil and that they do not make \\&quot;Hair Color\\&quot;.  Upon opening, the powder is brown and not green like lawsonia inermis is supposed to be and does not smell like henna either.  I am returning all 4 boxes.  If I put this on my hair, I would have no idea of the reaction, the color and what it was I was putting on it.  Beware!</li>
            <li> I am a black woman who has natural hair and i have been using this henna for nearly five years i absolutely love the red stain it leaves on my grey hair and it makes my hair so soft and full.</li>
            <li> I bought this Jamila henna for body and when I recieved it I saw that the package wasn&#x27;t in tinfoil and there was no harvest date so I called Kahana Pakahna and they said that I bought the hair henna. I was very disappointed because I needed it that day for a demonstration in college and I was fooled. So make sure you call them and figure out what kind of henna it is because it doesn&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li> This is VERY good henna. Finely sifted and produces a deep, chocolate brown stain on both hair and skin. I use this henna to dye my beard, head hair, and occasionally my skin as well and love it.</li>
            <li> First time trying to help with shedding, left my hair smoother and a slight hint of reddish maroon color. No issues so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this brand whenever I use it for henna staining my skin. It does need to be sifted to make sure it doesn&#x27;t clog my cones. This is my favorite brand because it&#x27;s easy to find and has consistent results. When it&#x27;s a good year I get extra boxes and keep them in my freezer.&lt;br /&gt;I use a mix of tea, lemon juice, a bit of sugar, and some lavender and tea tree essential oils in my mix. With this brand, I have gotten a decent stain just using purified water, lemon juice and the powder. Adding the essential oils gives me a gorgeous dark stain in minimal time which is nice when I&#x27;m doing it with teens or other people who are too impatient to let it sit for hours on their skin.</li>
            <li> I have used henna to color my gray hair many times before so I am not a novice.  When I used this product for the first time, I noticed that the dye didn&#x27;t release after sitting there for 8 hours.  I used warm water and left it in room temperature, as I usually do.  I put the mix in my hair anyway and my roots didn&#x27;t take the color.  I used it again a couple of days ago, this time using warm water, a splash of lemon juice, left it in a warmer place, and checked it every few hours.  After 48 hours, the dye still hasn&#x27;t released.  I put a dab of the  mix on my skin, and there&#x27;s was no stain at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I got a bad batch, but I&#x27;m really disappointed about this product since there are so many good reviews.  I will not buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I also have this product and Yes this company does make Henna for Hair. Yes I did call the company to verify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please visit their website at [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Henna comes in two forms&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAQ - Body Art Quality comes in Foil inside the box&lt;br /&gt;Henna for hair comes in plastic inside the box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely better than some other hennas sold. yet the BAQ is better than the Henna for Hair. :)&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed with either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed mine with  paprika, sugar, amla oil, black tea, and Yes to carrots conditioner.</li>
            <li> I used to use a different kind of henna until I found Jamila and gave it a try.  I love it.  It washes out a lot easier and it gives my hair a much better color.  I usually mix it with water and a little lemon, let it sit for an hour.  I apply it to my hair and then rinse after an hour.  It makes my hair feel more conditioned and it is nice and shiny.  This is a very inexpensive way to keep my hair looking good.</li>
            <li> Considering how messy and time consuming it is to do properly color your hair with henna, I found the results disappointing. If your hair is darker (mine&#x27;s dark brown), this does nothing to cover your grays. It might work for somebody with auburn or dark red hair. Regardless, whatever results you do manage to get with this product last less than two weeks. I used a sulfate free shampoo every other day and still, the color was gone after about ten days. Total waste of time and money.   Speaking of money, if you still are curious about experimenting with this product, it&#x27;s probably cheaper at your local Indian grocery store: $1.99 as opposed to $5.99. Lame, Amazon. Real lame.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with intentions to use it for deep conditioning my hair, I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I plan to in the near future. I do wish I&#x27;d ordered more, for three weeks back to back applications. But I&#x27;ll see how it goes the first time and go on from there.</li>
            <li> This product went on well, and colored my hair, but the desciption says that it is dark redish brown and it is definitly not. It came out more like a carrots red on my hair (my hair is naturally carmel in color). It also didn&#x27;t come with any instuctions as to how to mix it or how long to leave it on. Over all, it colored my hair well, but not the color I wanted.</li>
            <li> This product has completely transformed my hair! I have fine 4A kinky/curly hair and am very prone to breakage although I deep condition weekly and moisturize my hair well. Since using this product my breakage has decreased significantly, I am retaining far more length, and my hair is more voluminous my twist outs and other styles look so great. I use it every 4-6 weeks and you cannot beat the quality of this product. I tried lush&#x27;s henna that was a complete NIGHTMARE but I did not want to give up on the prospect of hennaing my hair. Jamila was a completely different experience easy to put in, easy to wash out and the color is very subtle. I absolutely love this stuff and have been using it for a few months so far.</li>
            <li> I was sent fake henna in a clear cellophane container and the box read superior quality hair color. This is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to dye my jet black hair brown for a while I tried one henna product with out success so I looked more and found Jamila Henna Powder and after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. I was so excited to finally get some color in my hair after reading all of the superb reviews and comments. To my suprise the henna came with NO INSTRUCTIONS so I went on google and found some articles on how to mix henna so I mixed it with my oil mix( apricot oil,castor oil, jojoba oil,vatika coconut oil,alma oil shikakai oil, and olive miracle oil), some yogurt, conditioner,water and an egg then I let refrigerate for a day or 2(remember henna has to soak to release the DYE otherwise it probalbly won&#x27;t work!).Then I got some gloves and a mixing stick and saturated my hair with it and put a plastic hair cap on and went to sleep(7+hrs) when I woke up it looked brownish then I washed it out and it had changed the TEXTURE of my curly hair and guess what it was still my RAVEN black hair color no highlights not even a little lightening this henna is either very low quailty(on the box it says superior henna what a joke) or a fake because it didn&#x27;t do anything but ruin my lovely curls! I swear these golden reviews are also false too.I recommend you use [[ASIN:B001T7APMG Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend, 150-gram]]or [[ASIN:B001GIHKP8 Brown Henna Hair Dye 100 Grams]]these work beautifully. Anyways honestly don&#x27;t waste your money this product on there are hundreds of other great and legitimate henna dyes on Amazon.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m reviewing this I&#x27;m realizing...hmmm I&#x27;m overdue to place another order for this. I saw a 6 pack too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an African-American natural and tried this by recommendation. It&#x27;s great - not sure if it&#x27;s great-er, but it does work well and so I will continue to use. I use it on my hair mixing with green tea, honey, and olive oil and it does a great job of strengthening my hair follicles (I can actually see my strands clearly in the mirror!)and slightly loosening my extra curly hair pattern (making it more manageble). If you haven&#x27;t tried henna before, this is the brand to go with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Make sure you deep condition afterwards to restore moisture as it is drying even though extremely beneficial.</li>
            <li> This product is a great price, but when it comes to using it for mehndi it dies a bit light and didn&#x27;t take nearly as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I order a package of it last friday and recvd it the next day. I&#x27;m using it for hair purposes. Well it took 3 hours for the dye to release once i mix it and 5 hours for it to stain my hair a rich red color. I love the product</li>
            <li> I too, like other posters on here, received the fake henna product. They used, what looked like a Jamila box, but was considerably smaller than my other Jamila boxes. There was no stamp indicating crop date. When you open the box, it is NOT in a foil pouch, but in a cheap plastic pouch. The product does not even smell like henna, so I am afraid to even use it, so I am promptly returning it for a refund. Too bad there are no punitive damages for the hassle of having to buy this counterfeit product, otherwise, I&#x27;d definitely sign up for that as well!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing someone&#x27;s results on youtube about it.  I must say that I was 100% satisfied.  I received several compliments.</li>
            <li> COMPANY BEGAN TO ADD CHEMICAL COLORING AGENTS! All my life I use henna because it is natural. Last time I have purchased through Amazon,plastic bag was larger than usual, when I have poured hot water to make a paste, I noticed feels different (slimy) on the fingers and smells differently, gave different color. If i would be able to find another NATURAL 100% henna , I will drop Jamila like a hot potato.</li>
            <li> I used this henna on my hair. It worked great and had a nice dye release. My hair felt soft, conditioned, and has a very nice auburn tint in the sun.</li>
            <li> and my hair is not long! The color that came out not exactly like promised more orange yellow than red, But the henna was well grinded fine poweder...</li>
            <li> My sister is a henna artist and tried it on someone to see about the quality..the lady held the henna on for 3HOURS!!!!! it was so pointless bbecause it was a fake henna! It had no COLOR!!! U TRICKED MY SISTER!!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to using commercial dyes that contain toxic chemicals to cover my gray hair.  I loved the results I achieved using Jamila Henna Powder.  It completely covered the gray hair even better than chemical dyes! My hair is naturally dark brown.  After using Jamila the brown turned out to be a deep rich auburn color and the gray, light highlights of red/auburn.  This is a high quality henna that was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this henna at an Indian grocery store for $1.49.  This is henna for hair, not BAQ. I opened the pack, and saw on the inside tab that it was produced in January 2011.  I know that henna is usually good for 2 years, so was not holding my hopes high.  However, it had good color release and covered my greys well.  The color deposit is not as strong as BAQ, but pretty good for a henna that was not fresh. The sift is quite fine, no grit. I mixed with half lemon juice, half warm water, let dye release for 12 hours and applied overnight.  It washed out very easily.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because my Jamila Henna did not come with an expiration date on the outside of the box or on the inside of the bag which has the henna inside.  I normally purchase Henna from another site that specializes in Henna and natural products but I took a chance.  I compared the two to see if there was any difference in the quality of the henna. This one looked old, the henna was brown in color (did not have the olive green color), and didn&#x27;t have the distinct henna smell.  I even took a picture of this one in comparision to the one I purchased from the other site and the colors are distinctly different.  Well, after I did the application, my henna results were actually really good.  So, even though there was no expiration date, the color was brown, and there was no earthy grassy smell....it worked!  Therefore, I gave it four stars.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal! I loved it, it wasn&#x27;t in foil wrap but I called the company to confirm and they said it was the correct Jamila, which is one of the best Henna&#x27;s in my opinion. It is not BAQ however.</li>
            <li> Not BAQ, the color is weak. came in a cheap looking imitation box. definitely do not waste anymore time on amazon henna. go to hennasooq.com</li>
            <li> I absolutely ADORE this product. It&#x27;s natural, can be fiddled with to produce different results (SLIGHTLY different) and boy, does the color hold up! I&#x27;ve done all of my hair 2 or 3 times, and am now at the point where I can use this on just my roots, it barely fades at all. It is very finely processed, very easy to apply (as far as henna goes). I&#x27;ve gotten a few boxes, the first couple arrived looking brand new, the last couple arrived looking like they&#x27;d probably spent some time in a warehouse in the sun, but the product inside was just fine, no problems with it at all. I&#x27;ve been recommending this to everyone I know that likes to dye their hair red, it&#x27;s so natural looking and it does fantastic things for my hair. I&#x27;ll be buying this as long as it&#x27;s available, never going back to chemical dye again!</li>
            <li> good product, but too strong for my hair. i think my solution might&#x27;ve been too strong--snapped most of it like a twig</li>
            <li> Although we have purchased this brand before and it worked fine but this time we tried to mix it several times and never could get to stain or show very much color, you could barley see the design, then we bought new tools and tried again and still it would not  leave a tattoo. So we threw it away and went to the India store and bought a different kind</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad for the price but this doesn&#x27;t stain the skin very well. There&#x27;s no date on the packaging.</li>
            <li> I was really worried about trying henna for the first time. Scary visions of carroty hair made this seem way more risky than the chemicals in the hair dye I&#x27;ve been using for years. At least with those boxes I have a fairly good idea what the results will be. But I&#x27;d started to notice more and more hair in the drain after showers and one of the many things I&#x27;ve read about henna is it&#x27;s really good for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I took a risk, and so far, I am pretty happy with the results. I&#x27;ve used henna 4x times, every other month for about six months now, and have not dyed my hair since. In that time, and I thought it was a fluke the first time but it&#x27;s been this way ever since-- less hair in the drain after showers. That alone is worth it to me. But there are other benefits too, like, my hair feels like hair again. No stiff hay-like feel after using henna, as it is with hair dye. My hair is much softer, the color is much richer, and it doesn&#x27;t fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with dyed auburn/red hair and I have grays/white hair at the temples and sprinkled throughout. After using henna, and after it&#x27;s developed, most of my hair is a rich deep reddish/brown color, (and much redder in the sun) with the grays/whites being a more slightly carroty/golden color. I read that the henna that&#x27;s mixed with indigo changed your grays/whites to a pinkish color so I&#x27;ll take slightly carroty gold over that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The henna mixes (say, for auburn, light brown, etc.) have indigo and other additives. Jamila Henna has no additives, just henna, so no pink hair, which is why I tried this versus a mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is the smell issue. I do not love the smell. I don&#x27;t hate but it&#x27;s not pleasant, and over the course of waiting the three hours I leave it on, it has a tendency to give me a slight headache. I mix the henna with lemon juice and let it develop overnight or two days, then mix it with some conditioner to apply. Leave it on three hours with a bag or shower cap on my head, and shampoo it out. Then use conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now the benefits/pros (less hair in the drain, hair feels like hair, beautiful color) far out weigh the cons (smell, very messy, major fear of dying skin I miss in the afterwards wipe down) so all those boxes of hair color I still have are going to get dusty. Wonder what I should do with them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding this particular order, my henna lasted me three uses from the single box, (I have shoulder length hair), and provided great color each time. The package inside was clear and the box was sealed and dated.d shampoo it out. Then use conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now the benefits/pros (less hair in the drain, hair feels like hair, beautiful color) far out weigh the cons (smell, very messy, major fear of dying skin I miss in the afterwards wipe down) so all those boxes of hair color I still have are going to get dusty. Wonder what I should do with them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding this particular order, my henna lasted me three uses from the single box, (I have shoulder length hair), and provided great color each time. The package inside was clear and the box was sealed and dated.</li>
            <li> My hair is a medium brown, and I used this product hoping to achieve more red. The red wasn&#x27;t bright, but it shone well in sunlight. This was what I desired. I would not recommend this to someone unwilling to have a mess, a ruined towel, and an uncomfortable bag on their head overnight.</li>
            <li> This product description states that the paste will leave a tattoo if applied, set to dry, and then scraped gently off. This heavily implies that it&#x27;s a henna tattoo formula, and it&#x27;s not. When you get the package and open it, it says \\&quot;HENNA FOR HAIR\\&quot; clearly on the inside, and indeed, it leaves no trace of a tattoo on skin. This is false advertising and should be removed immediately.</li>
            <li> paying WAY less then if you get a kit at a craft store, preparation is pretty easy. I don&#x27;t do henna often but this should last way more than one pack from the DIY box.</li>
