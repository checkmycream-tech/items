            <li> Not what I thought.  Looks good, nice size but made out ot plastic.  Can&#x27;t put anything hot because it will melt.  This was purchase so I could take my lunch to work.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a way to loose weight with your purse.&lt;br /&gt;Quite a bargain.  Lots of room and light weight when empty.  Looks to be quite durable.</li>
            <li> So upset! The bag came stained, black color smudged on some of the white. Now I have to go out of my way to see if I can exchange it. Really liked the bag too! :(</li>
            <li> The design is casual with sophisticated touch. Just what I wanted. That said, it&#x27;s useless. The bag is so cheaply made, I would be embarrassed to carry it in public.  It can&#x27;t even be used to bag groceries because the chains are so flimsy - they would break. In this case I say Caveat Emptor.</li>
            <li> Carry anything in this beautiful bag.  Awesome for travel.</li>
            <li> I donâ€™t like this product, is very very small,Not exactly at the photo, donâ€™t recommended this product at any wear... not comeback shopping</li>

            <li> It was horrible dont waist your time and money</li>
            <li> Should be a stronger material</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t like the handle they were very cheap looking  they rest of the purse I liked they were great in  comunications</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute &amp; came on the correct date thanks so much ðŸ˜»ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li> This bag is my daughter&#x27;s and the blue one is mine.. The black bag arrived damages.. One side of the &#x27;chain&#x27; holder is broken.. The chain is not even in the plastic bag...disappointed...</li>
