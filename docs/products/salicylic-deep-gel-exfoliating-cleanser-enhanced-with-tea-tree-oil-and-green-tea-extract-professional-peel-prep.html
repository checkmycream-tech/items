            <li>: I found this to be a very effective, exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li>Once a week, I followed with the chemical peel pads (also amazing!)</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>This cleanser is amazing!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an amazing cleanser!..</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but its a million times better.</li>
            <li>I have been using Perfect image products for 6 months now and really love them.</li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job in exfoliating skin and leaves a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I am convinced that no matter how great a product is said to be, it cannot possibly be good for everyone.  </li>
            <li>I just found that Perfect Image worked better for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You may see some dryness in your skin, but if you keep on top of moisturizing the results are excellent.</li>
            <li>I also use Perfect Image TCA peel which isn&#x27;t too strong but does the trick.</li>
            <li>I always followed with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>good?</li>
            <li>but this is usually good.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be a good cleanser</li>
            <li>but my skin stays really good with this regimen</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite this, the product is good for peeling treatment.</li>
            <li>Really good product to use to prepare your skin for a peel</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a good smell.</li>
            <li>immediately I loved how it cleaned.  </li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was 25.</li>
            <li>I use this before and after my peel and it makes my skin smooth and look great!</li>
            <li>My skin feels sooo good afterwards.</li>
            <li>use this now about 3 times weekly follow up with a good moisturizer and</li>
            <li>People comment on how good my skin looks when I use it</li>
            <li>good transaction, product</li>
            <li>This cleanser works wonderfully as a pre-peel treatment, as well as light peeling itself.</li>
            <li>Loved it, a must have product.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overly drying like Neutrogena makes my skin feel, but as another reviewer suggested, I&#x27;d use a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because of all the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Since I visited doctors and pay 50 buck for a visit and a 100 for a product that wasn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and very easy to use and it helps me control my acne</li>
            <li>I use this pre-peel for just that, a prep for a more thorough Perfect Image Peel (LOVE the Pineapple Pumpkin Peel)</li>
            <li>I use many Perfect Image products &amp; love them.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied , saw results on my face with an a week.</li>
            <li>Peel- Enhanced with Papaya Extract &amp; AHA [from Perfect Image], which I use rarely</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>very pleased</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product, and I will buy it again.  </li>
            <li>But I am happy to say I&#x27;ve found a face cleanser I will continue using as the results are better than I&#x27;ve been able to achieve before!</li>
            <li>I am sure it will fit perfectly to my needs.</li>

            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve order this product a couple of times now, and I&#x27;m pleased with how it works.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is safe to expose treated area to the sun.</li>
            <li>Especially when it&#x27;s the best cleaner/acne fighter on the market.</li>
            <li>I love using this product 1 - 2 times a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and haven&#x27;t been able to catch a break.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to have chose these products.</li>
            <li>If you have really oily skin, this is great</li>
            <li>Well I have to say this face wash works better than any over the counter or proactive product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This stings a bit more but works well</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>i will surely but it again.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Perfect for use prior to peels.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, love the tingle and love the way it leaves my skin.  </li>
            <li>I might be able to get away with just using it and giving up my proactiv</li>
            <li>but I can sincerely say that this cleanser has played a part in keeping me zit-free.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but after I used this recommended cleanset and the results were outstanding.</li>
            <li>I rated this cleanser a five star because I love the way it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a hell of a lot more convenient.</li>
            <li>I  have been highly satisfied with the quality of every purchase.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I have it to keep these enlarged pores at bay.</li>
            <li>I let it stay for more than the allowed time</li>
            <li>so I have been trying many products.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I also make sure to use it prior to using the Perfect Image Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel treatment.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have acne-prone skin but since using this in combination with a peel, my skin has never looked clearer or better.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line - this stuff works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried for mild-moderate acne, both for prevention and treatment (including prescription-strength Benzoyl Peroxide &amp; Salicylic acid formulations).</li>
            <li>Either they made me break out more, and it just didn&#x27;t make any difference.</li>
            <li>Until I tried Perfect Image&#x27;s Pre-Peel Salicylic Deep Gel Exfoliating Cleanser.</li>
            <li>LOVE this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I still love this cleanser though, so I still use it 1-3 times a week depending on how my skin&#x27;s doing.</li>
            <li>&gt;: )</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>my skin hasn&#x27;t gotten any better</li>
            <li>Love this product and I&#x27;m preparing to place another order alongside the pineapple enzyme peel.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>If it goes up any more though, I won&#x27;t order</li>
            <li>I love to Sonya Dakar products</li>
            <li>This is a great product, and it is the type of things that your local stores won&#x27;t carry, because it is too good</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I rinse it off in the shower and wash my face again to be sure all of the product is removed.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this order.</li>
            <li>Im Definatley going to buy again!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>the cleanser works better than any product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>It has helped with my acne and I am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is the best.</li>
            <li>I love this because I can feel it.</li>
            <li>Excellent cleanser for people to workout - especially outdoors.</li>
            <li>I do love this product it keeps the blemishes away.</li>
            <li>However, now that I&#x27;ve gotten rid of my acne, I do enjoy using this cleanser quite a bit because the smell is so amazing</li>
            <li>I also changed my diet: mostly vegetarian (fish, beans, lentils),</li>
            <li>Now, my skin is softer, brighter, more even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For regular peels, I use the 50% Lactic Acid peel by Perfect Image and am going to start using the 12% TCA peel soon for more aggressive results on the acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this for my arsenal.</li>
            <li>I had ordered this many months ago, used it twice a week.</li>
            <li>He noticed the condition of my skin (age 57), and commented on how refreshed and healthy it looked.</li>
            <li>It worked better then most products ive tried.</li>
            <li>Then wash with your favorite face wash with a lufa type scrubby.  </li>
            <li>I use my favorite Retin-A product.</li>
            <li>Works so much better than what you can find at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue to use for sure...</li>
            <li>I get a bit of a sting when using it, but its ok because that tells me its working.</li>
            <li>love the cleanser</li>
            <li>While rinsing, I sort of rubbed the water around to be sure to rinse thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>one of those machine that their a pad that rotation around) since it better than cleaning your face with your hands</li>
            <li>sure to use the peel, wash and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>pretty good on its own; the peel was too strong for me, so I used this as a milder version</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 1/7/13 - I have now been using this product for almost a full year and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!  </li>
            <li>great product as a prep for main peel.</li>
            <li>My face feels very clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Rinse with cool or warm water</li>
            <li>Seemed to work pretty good  </li>
            <li>Her face is now clear and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I bought this cleanser a week ago, used it every morning and to my surprise its the best cleanser ever, makes your skin soft, smooth and clean, redness got better and acne marks have diminished too.</li>
            <li>: since so many others seem to have great experiences, don&#x27;t let my review completely deter you.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week with my clarisonic and it keeps my oily skin in check and provides a nice mild exfoliation that keeps my skin looking luminous all week.</li>
            <li>I received both the cleanser and peel (which I think I might have to return after my experience with the scrub) promptly and was very excited to try the cleanser after reading so many fantastic reviews.</li>
            <li>but after i used more than 2 weeks it&#x27;s fine on my skin.</li>
            <li>after everytime I use this cleanser, just &#x27;Clean&#x27;!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll come away clean an refreshed!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft,smooth &amp; clean!</li>
            <li>She isn&#x27;t used to using anything stronger than over the counter products on her face, so I&#x27;m guessing if she gradually worked up to more contact time it would be fine for her too.</li>
            <li>and I love other Perfect Image products, so</li>
            <li>I found this product to be a very good deep cleaning cleanser.</li>
            <li>but I must say, I really love how smooth my skin is getting.</li>
            <li>but it would be great to not have to reorder so frequently.  </li>
            <li>The product works great to clear out my oily-combination skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and more importantly</li>
            <li>Gentle and works good.</li>
            <li>but it cleans very well and is a good prep for the peels.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t have an offensive smell (more like a light cleaning product smell), easy to use</li>
            <li>I have mild to occasionally severe acne and this product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, they each come with very clear instructions for use, which is good because these are potent products.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser makes my face feel very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Maybe every other day would be best for some depending on skin type.</li>
            <li>, they were clean just in the top layer.</li>
            <li>I also use a very mild peel 2X a month.  </li>
            <li>I believe the peel will work better when the face is squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Love this product, keeps my skin clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Might help with very mild surface acne or just roughness of the skin.</li>
            <li>If you do a thorough cleansing with Perfect Image cleanser, you will remove most of the dead skin.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell(something in between clorox and cleaning detergent).</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended about to try there peel also.</li>
            <li>It is strong and can lead to dryness</li>
            <li>The peel does have a strong tingling sensation.  </li>
            <li>This is a a strong cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It is quite strong but nothing that can&#x27;t be dealt with.</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY REFRESHING AND CLEANS FACE AREA VERY WELL.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I have fair, freckled skin and live in FL.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it in conjunction with anything that has a resurfacing element to it and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use the cleanser as a wash by itself and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it is a response of my integumentary and endorcrine systems to secrete more oil</li>
            <li>I have also started a 3 series Arctic Laser Peel with my dermatologist which I am hoping with help with fine lines and boost my collagen production.  </li>
            <li>The gel really help more than the chemical peel did which they did a pretty good job as well.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products but this wins the race.</li>
            <li>Overall, this brand is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists since I was like 16 (now 31) and had always fought acne issues, yes had all kinds of prescriptions, nothing is perfect, scripts work for awhile then stops after few months or even a year.</li>
            <li>is the kind of stuff that really ought to be applied by licensed cosmetologists!&lt;br</li>
            <li>No scrubbing with this though as it is plenty string on its own just to be gently massaged into.</li>
            <li>This peel when used according to the direction  is a fantastic peel for acne skin.</li>
            <li>This cleanser used just a couple of times a week has kept me acne free for almost a year.  </li>
            <li>Yes indeed both Mother and Son are using the same product with great results.</li>
            <li>Will give you a smooth sensation in your face.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic wash.</li>
            <li>It is great used as a skin prep before a peel is performed as it prepares the skin by deep cleansing and removing any bacteria and debris that causes breakouts.</li>
            <li>It works without drying your face, and your face feels smooth and comfortable afterward.</li>
            <li>and soon I will be smooth again.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and this is a fantastic cleanser for my skin.  </li>
            <li>This works great for deep cleaning oily skin.  </li>
            <li>you enjoy this as I have.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>but, so far so good.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for  the pass 6 months and have had good result so far.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with how smooth my face felt after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li>This is not for a everyday wash but its good for an exfoliating wash and it smells good.</li>
            <li>Salicylic Deep Exfoliating gel is FABULOUS!!!  </li>
            <li>I have very clear, smooth skin and do not break out since I started using this product!!</li>
            <li>For me, it is worth the price!</li>
            <li>First day used, most of my acne had disappered.</li>
            <li>As long as you follow the instructions this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cleanser and feel that it really helps with cleaning out my pores and giving my face a fresh feeling while helping it to also look better too.  </li>
            <li>He started used both these items &amp; his skin has significantly improved.</li>
            <li>Dont go overboard on using the product though, you have to give your face time to heal so its best to use the product once every 3 days or so</li>
            <li>I have had a minor purge but nothing that I haven&#x27;t experienced before.</li>
            <li>I then wait for about an hour after my shower and moisturize with an acne friendly moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you rinse it off good and pat your face dry!</li>
            <li>amazing like I have new skin.</li>
            <li>It gives it that clean feeling.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, it completely strips the skin of dirt and oil and really gives you that squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I use this to keep my pores clean.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best acne facial wash you will ever use!</li>
            <li>This is a great face cleaner that doesn&#x27;t strip his skin too dry.</li>
            <li>These two together work in conjunction to keep my face clean without abusing my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean and refreshed and it has reduced my breakouts.  </li>
            <li>feel clean, and the skin stays cleaner for longer.</li>
            <li>when the skin seems too dry to use this cleaner, that would be great.</li>
            <li>This product seems to clean the skin</li>
            <li>Now to be clean</li>
            <li>My face is squeaky clean  after use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you don&#x27;t mind spending this kind of money on face wash, but if you&#x27;re really trying to get rid of acne with it</li>
            <li>It works super well, so really brush it on then rinse it off right away!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others but have never seen positive results like this.</li>
            <li>OTOH, I didn&#x27;t experience any of the positive effects of usage that many mentioned in their reviews, either.  </li>
            <li>Staying young and healthy takes effort!  </li>
            <li>I love how active it is and how good it works to keep blackheads and acne at bay.  </li>
            <li>It is a good Aid for you against the unexpected breakouts, it will treat the problem very fast.</li>
            <li>Be sure to have your moisturizer ready.</li>
            <li>It cleans deep and makes my skin look and feel so good.</li>
            <li>Definitely use moisturizer after and your good.</li>
            <li>I will try to find this product somewhere else for a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>However, it had such good reviews</li>
            <li>I AM VERY WELL PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WILL PURCHASE IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wait unless you want the full on peeling.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, and I will definitely buy again.  </li>
            <li>It is bit strong at first</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li>So I honestly believe that I had a major reaction to this product!</li>
            <li>This product is great for maintaining the results of a chemical peel, but it can be just a little over drying so for that i suggest an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and my face feels so fresh and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>Face feels fresh, and clean after cleaning with this.</li>
            <li>My teenage son who has had acne issues is seeing great results with this cleaner &amp; I, in my mid 40&#x27;s love how clean my face feels (without drying out) after I use.</li>
            <li>which I cannot find any products do the same job of such excellent exfoliating without scrubbles...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took my face 3 days to recover, and I&#x27;m lucky</li>
            <li>and I had to quickly rinse off.</li>
            <li>This is because each time I used it my pimples, although not too many, increased in sizes, and I develop even more pimples than I had prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried peels for the feet, hands, and mild scrubs for the face,but not a peel for the face.  </li>
            <li>I admit I got panicky when I stated to feel the tingle and a mild burning feel.  </li>
            <li>, I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is much more stronger than the your normal 2% Salicylic cleanser</li>
            <li>nothing&#x27;s worthy full star rating, I am not really 5-star person, but the products good</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that this stuff was as strong as others made it out to be</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a really super cleanser, my skin is fresh after using it and not so oily.</li>
            <li>Really strong, you will see results really quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>Really strong, you will see results really quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>This is a good stand-alone cleanser but overuse can dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser for my oily skin cuts right through and I feel clean without feeling dried out.</li>
            <li>finally when i came to this product i was interested in the tea tree oil peel and this facial wash (both from the perfect image line).</li>
            <li>Salicylic acid penetrates better anyway when there is less oil on the face so in my opinion, I feel it would be fore effective to wash before using it.</li>
            <li>Product is very strong and gives you a real deep clean in your face.</li>
            <li>so i can use it more frequenly, follow it up with a nice moisturizer or your skin will feel really tight.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my skin is very dry, but I deal with that by using a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It works great for exfoliating the dead skin cells and renewing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how amazing this product is.</li>
            <li>This face wash is amazing, especially if you have oily or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s powerful stuff, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a million different types of its kind and this one blows the rest out of the water.</li>
            <li>So far, my acne has calmed more and my skin is smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I use this regularly it does a great job keeping my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser for my 66 year old, yet still oily, skin with clogged pore issues.  </li>
            <li>I think its worth getting</li>
            <li>Hopefully with continued use I will get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I learned my skin is more sensitive than I ever thought</li>
            <li>Far better than a doctor’s visit.  </li>
            <li>It controls any breakouts and keeps my skin looking young and healthy without being overly drying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that this is starting to clear my skin...</li>
            <li>so I restrict the more frequent use to just those oilier areas.</li>
            <li>Apply a dime amount has recommended you don&#x27;t need a lot this is powerful stuff.</li>
            <li>This so far is my favorite cleanser..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li>It keeps my 52 year old skin smooth &amp; free of breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Although the Perfect Image Cleanser was drying at first, plus I have naturally dry skin, with regular use the dryness subsided.  </li>
            <li>I had a facial done in June and the esthetician told me that I had absolutely no black heads and my skin looked great.  </li>
            <li>This wonderful facial cleanser had left my skin feeling clean and clear without any drying.  </li>
            <li>This wonderful facial cleanser had left my skin feeling clean and clear without any drying.</li>
            <li>Cleans properly, leaves the skin Very Clean, Breathable, Glowy and Smooth.</li>
            <li>I began by using it prior to the other Perfect Image peels, but now I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>My skin looked burned but my pores did not looked totally clean, just only  the top layer was cleaned(same result</li>
            <li>I like how it makes my skin so clean, smooth and soft after using it to cleanse my face.  </li>
            <li>I got too excited and used too much.  </li>
            <li>combined with 3-6 months using this product and the regular use of the topical pure hyaluronic acid, my skin is pretty much perfect, now, really!</li>
            <li>You could tell right away...pores that stay no matter</li>
            <li>Since 2013 I have been on a mission to find the right cleansing/moisturizing/treatment routine for my skin.  </li>
            <li>right before I run out</li>
            <li>- right now it&#x27;s at $25.</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference right away...</li>
            <li>Really gets face clean (even mascara) without over drying.</li>
            <li>It works great so long as I use it two times a day and not a few times a week as it suggests.</li>
            <li>you might flake, but if you want a product that is really going to clean your skin, this is what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I kind of like it, but it maybe a little strong for the acne start scarring.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle of this and I am super pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a week now and am happy I purchased this product!</li>
            <li>I read all of the reviews, and was excited to try this, because everything spoke so highly of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The results have definitely been worth putting up with the dryness for me, just be sure to give your skin time to heal and dont use it too often (use it once every 3 days).</li>
            <li>I just ordered my second bottle, so can easily recommend this for those who do home/professional peels as well as those who just want a deeper clean that the salicylic acid provides.</li>
            <li>I am sure for some people, this product is great, but for me, it is useless.</li>
            <li>I have very oily, sensitive skin and cannot even wear most makeup.</li>
            <li>I received my item very fast.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face super clean, glowing, and smooth, without dry feeling.</li>
            <li>Can be a little drying but just use a good moisturizer or skip a day.  </li>

            <li>Works fast!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it promises to do.  </li>
            <li>Didnt do much !  </li>
            <li>is controlled pretty much all day, with just a dewy glow by the end of the day -- not a grease trap!  </li>
            <li>It has really cleared up my skin!</li>
            <li>But I scrub ever so gently!</li>
            <li>I am just about finished with my first bottle.</li>
            <li>Just make sure use it only twice a week maybe, and use sunscreen after each use.</li>
            <li>I have been able to use this product as a daily cleanser.</li>
            <li>For the first year, we also did thye salicylic acid peel twice a month.</li>
            <li>I am sure he will continue using it for the next year or so.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, it is one of those products that actually works.</li>
            <li>But even after the first use, I could tell that my skin was smoother and clearer.</li>
            <li>I purchased it more for my teenage son than for myself.</li>
            <li>Clear with smooth texture.</li>
            <li>It is a great product to use at least 3 times per week.</li>
            <li>I love how deep cleansing this cleanser is.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser, use it daily for control of my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>After much research and reading all the reviews I thought I found a &amp;#34;keeper&amp;#34;. NOT!</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried so many different cleansers.</li>
            <li>I used this first then the glyolic acid peel</li>
            <li>However, I love to use it daily.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even express how much this has helped!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t even say how much it&#x27;s helped!</li>
            <li>The effect is noticeable after the first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually looking forward to trying more of their products.</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle</li>
            <li>and it really works, skin feels fresh and healthier with the use before a peel&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>First time use......</li>
            <li>really hope this product never goes away, it has been a life saver!</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel insanely smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>...Should have been an indicator that this was not going to end pretty.</li>
            <li>However when I went to first use it, I was immediately thrown off by the striking, aqua blue color and bathroom cleaner scent.</li>
            <li>I first used the cleanser on my face for 5 days and then did the peel on the weekend.</li>
            <li>and it really helps!</li>
            <li>This product, according to my analysis, does exactly what it purports to.</li>
            <li>I actually ordered this item by mistake &amp; lodged it even better than the product I was using (Infinite Skin Clarity Cleanser)</li>
            <li>This combo has really been good for my skin to help control oil, breakouts and fade dark spots.</li>
            <li>salicylic acid is ideal for penetrating acne deep down &amp; cleansing.</li>
            <li>Has a very mild sting at 1st, but nothing bad, your face will feel wonderful after using this product &amp; you can use this with or without moisturizing afterwards, as it isn&#x27;t over drying.</li>
            <li>Great daily cleanser product but be prepared to use it as a regimen and not alone unless you want peeling, dry skin which will age your skin.</li>
            <li>It did not burned as much as the first time and I just peeled for a couple of days, but pores looked very much as the first time</li>
            <li>I was waking each morning and washing with my gentle cleanser that had been fine up until my surgery and my face returned to complete oil after hours.  </li>
            <li>Cool water on-hand is important, however, this system got rid of my adult acne/breakouts and continues to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>It is very strong, if you leave it on too long it will dry and peel the top layer.  </li>
            <li>I had really bad acne for most of my teenage years to the point that people call me (pizza face) and Perfect Image help a lot to clean acne.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>: I have mildly sensitive skin, and some adult acne (mostly T zone and chin line).</li>
            <li>I have used this product over the last month for deep cleaning and it is giving good results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it lasts pretty well because you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this product alone though worked very well, I noticed results after the first day.</li>
            <li>I bought this cleanser (Pre-Peel Salicylic Deep Gel Exfoliating Cleanser) and the Glycolic Acid 30% Gel Peel - Enhanced with Retinol and Green Tea Extract (Professional Chemical Peel) from Perfect Image through Amazon in mid-September</li>
            <li>Really the first line that I&#x27;ve used all together that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair - no freckles and naturally small pores.</li>
            <li>It works pretty better than any other major acne wash products in market; and it doesn&#x27;t irrate/over-dry your skin although it contains strong salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>I had to use it once a day, due to the fact that it is very strong.</li>
            <li>I would just like to say that I have now been using this product for about 6 months, and I have noticed a significant difference not only in my face, but most importantly in my back.</li>
            <li>hope all of you share a similar experience and enjoy it as much as I have and will continue to!</li>
            <li>It gets rid of most of my flaky dry skin.</li>
            <li>I alternates it with Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Balancing Cleanser in the morning since I consider it might be too strong to use it twice daily.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how strong this stuff would actually be!</li>
            <li>However, if you do have skin that may react to certain dyes or scents and you end up with an electric blue, strongly scented product, please, err on the side of caution.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and blotchy skin</li>
            <li>B0047AKVW6 Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure Refill 8 oz]]</li>
            <li>Hopefully I never have to live without it!!</li>
            <li>pretty good facial peel, be careful dries you out.</li>
            <li>It is strong yet gentle on the skin at the same time.</li>
            <li>but after the first use I was so excited by the noticeable difference in my skin that I used it the next day as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting a pimple here and there, so this is not a total fix, but it&#x27;s a HUGE improvement.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;M SURE THIS PRODUCT DOES EVERYTHING AND MORE FOR THOSE WHO LOVE IT, BUT MY SKIN HAD A BAD REACTION TO IT.  </li>
            <li>and you can really feel that the exfoliating works.</li>
            <li>I dont feel like this did much for me.</li>
            <li>THIS IS PRODUCT IS REALLY WORKING ON MY SKIN AFTER THAT</li>
            <li>My skin now feels smooth, evenly exfoliated, and properly prepped for treatment.  </li>
            <li>It has a medicinal smell which I am not a fan of and cleanses really well</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50+ and have really oily skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product weekly for about a month now, but don&#x27;t see much difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it before lactic or TCA peels because it really opens my pores up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This product has helped diminish by brown spots from my face and makes my face so much smoother.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and this is very drying but</li>
            <li>I really had to build up my skin tolerance.</li>
            <li>You can really feel it working, after using this product for a month</li>
            <li>This product confuses me so much I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it.</li>
            <li>I don’t expect the cleanser to do the whole job by itself.  </li>
            <li>I have really oily skin (must blot skin every 2 hours or so).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have very oily acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t seen an improvement.</li>
            <li>For me, this formula is a bit drying to use 2x/day, even 1x/day is too much.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels cleaner and pores are no longer very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This product is really helpfull for acne.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I guess I can say that this stuff didn&#x27;t do much and for the amount of money they ask for the product it should work really well</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It really works clears your complextion up</li>
            <li>this product really helped me alot clearing my acne..</li>
            <li>This cleanser really prepares your face for your peel.</li>
            <li>This cleanser really rids one&#x27;s complexion of sweat, dirt, and debris.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to men and women!</li>
            <li>and the bottle lasts a while because you don&#x27;t need to use much product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I want to use it for my whole body.</li>
            <li>i use this stuff a few times a week and will be ordering a second bottle, it lasts about 4 months for two people, but if you use it more often you will have to order more of it.  </li>
            <li>this wash has really helped to improve my condition.i hear</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week to maintain my very oily skin.</li>
            <li>The beads exfoliate very well.</li>
            <li>I still get ocassional whiteheads, but they are the tiny kind you can pop and then disappear the next day.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more for myself as well as for my 22yr old daughter who loves it as well.</li>
            <li>Because there is a higher content of acid in this face wash it will dry your face more than usual after the wash; it&#x27;s very important to moisturize after.  </li>
            <li>It is a great deal for the price because a little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but if used too much your skin will dry out easy if it&#x27;s like mine.  </li>
            <li>I receive compliments on the smooth texture and vibrant clarity of my skin almost daily.</li>
            <li>I love all their other products</li>
            <li>, it did significantly reduce the white heads and</li>
            <li>It is a strong cleanser, but thats what i love, finally a cleanser that has enough salicylic acid in it to actually do something for your acne.  </li>
            <li>I might say that it&#x27;s just probably my skin, but make sure to check the product first behind your ear for sensitivity because it is very powerful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had such a clean face in my life.</li>
            <li>I also alternate between the TCA and Salycylic peels which have Greatly improved my skin over the past couple of years.</li>
            <li>for me, this does not dry my face as much since i have been using it for 6 months as daily use, my acne has more than cleared up</li>
            <li>My pores seem to look smaller and my face feels clean after every use.  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean, my pores appear smaller and my skin feels taut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell but so far, I have had no bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it daily, but rather save it to use just before applying my Bentonite clay mask, or before a special event or photo shoot.</li>
            <li>It really cleans better than the typical salicylic acid cleansers I tried before (Neutrogena, Phisoderm, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is slightly drying, so it is essential to follow with a good moisturiser.</li>
            <li>but it certainly helps exfoliate and reveal new skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>I was good for several years and stopped seeing dermatologists entirely, but started getting facials regularly in my 30s.</li>
            <li>first I was a little nervous to start using it because I do have very sensitive skin, and many things react.</li>
            <li>He likes it very much because it is easy to rinse off, smells good and leaves his skin less dry than other products he has used.</li>
            <li>You only need a pea size amount to work up a good lather and removes oil and shine for hours and leaves your skin feeling a little tighter too hopefully prolonging any winkles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could ever live without this product!</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live with out it!</li>
            <li>Also, it may be best to start slow, wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it everyday at the beginning.</li>
            <li>But I end up using main level 2 peel.  </li>
            <li>If you have a hairless Chinese Crested, I recommend the mild percentages from &amp;#34;Perfect Image&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>when I apply it, but my only draw back is that you have to use more than the directed dime sized amount to get it to foam/lather up.  </li>
            <li>This facial wash is a phenomenal product especially as a prep for peel.  </li>
            <li>I am a forty-something -year-old female that struggled with acne for most of my life and this product has made such a difference for my skin.</li>
            <li>I mainly bought this product for my Salycic acid treatment</li>
            <li>I love this face wash and have been using it for the last several months.  </li>
            <li>Stings a little on the first few uses but after that its great.</li>
            <li>Gentle even on very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have to admit it&#x27;s very hard to understand why this product would be so far superior to others with very similar ingredient profiles (particularly the primary ingredient, salicylic acid).</li>
            <li>This makes my oily, combination skin feel really squeaky clean, but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement in my clocked pores and minor breakouts.</li>
            <li>A Very Good product for the skin!&lt;br /&gt;Tried and tested and have been using it little by little on the face and neck!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>It really allowed me to get the maximum benefits out of my peel and helped clear up some acne as well!</li>
            <li>So of course I had high expectations based on all the 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for women and men.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for problem skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest one buy a cleansing machine though (</li>
            <li>give me extra smooth skin and shine free for longer hours while I was at work compare to my previous cleanser.</li>
            <li>Used as part of a daily process of derma pen treatments monthly, peeling with combination salicylic and glycol acids 15% bi weekly, using hyaluronic acid with C and moisturizer I am happy to report a serious improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit drying for daily use, but several times a week is fine if you have very oily or resistant skin.  </li>
            <li>Too strong when used in combination with other acne products</li>
            <li>Too strong when used in combination with other acne products</li>
            <li>I had a really bad blackhead problem, but with the use of this, the sacilyic gel mask, and the gylcolic gel mask by Perfect Image.  </li>
            <li>It is a great exfoliation for troubled skin.  </li>
            <li>It will make your skin much too sensitive.</li>
            <li>This wash has helped so much with my adult acne that has just decided to pop up in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and I really like the results so far.  </li>
            <li>really helps clear up acne pimples</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neutral: This product contains propylene glycol, an alcohol that normally irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>Fresh enough!</li>
            <li>The only suggestion I have is that I wish they offered a larger size of this product for those of us who use it more frequently.</li>
            <li>I have purchased a few of there items and I really love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this cleanser removes the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>I definitely will order more in the near future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to save your skin and your sanity the trouble.</li>
            <li>will continue to use it for a few more months.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is a powerful alternative to scrubs, which are either too abrasive or don&#x27;t exfoliate enough.</li>
            <li>This product seems to cause my face to shed dead skin cells right after I use it more then when I use the actual peel.</li>
            <li>For me, this is the only treatment I need for now for my cystic pimples and they clear up quickly (3 – 4 days).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to find that glycolic acid and salicylic acid combined in a facial cleansing regimen has been able to tackle my acne prone skin and this product has conditioners that keep the skin from being bone dry after washing.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating properties are obvious both in terms of leaving skin appearing more fresh and in the very gentle peeling that accompanies use of this wash after only a few days.</li>
            <li>Right now, I&#x27;m following the directions for the 5-7 days of use to prep for my at home peel, which will be tomorrow.</li>
            <li>It is something special in my limited regimen of skin products.  </li>
            <li>right back again...</li>
            <li>face is totally clean with this, it&#x27;s gentle and has actually help diminished scaring caused from the severe rosacea that I had over last summer.</li>
            <li>Third time I waited for a couple of weeks, but though the burning in my skin was less the results were the same: clean pores just in the top layer.</li>
            <li>, I have several of this company&#x27;s &amp;#34;Perfect Image&amp;#34; line and they all work very well with an ok cost, about average pricing.</li>
            <li>The directions do imply not to use daily, but as long as I have a good moisturizer I have had absolutely not problems.  </li>
            <li>My acne has somewhat stabilized, but there is some improvement to new breakouts.  </li>
            <li>and this is something new</li>
            <li>I think I found a new product..</li>
            <li>I also liked the subtle scent of tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but it didn&#x27;t do much when I had the deep cystic acne that I had to go on accutane to get rid of.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I do have fairer, more sensitive skin, I have never had an adverse reaction to tea tree oil, green tea extract, or salicylic acid -even</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who struggles with adult acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin  </li>
            <li>i do have a very sensitive and acne prone skin, but this product works for me.</li>
            <li>So I bought this product a while back and even though I don&#x27;t use it too often, I do very much like it.</li>
            <li>but this keeps it clear!</li>
            <li>I started out by first buying this as a pre-peel prep when I was having a lot of facial peels and microdermabrasions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try some of the other peels as well.  </li>
            <li>Do not put it near your eyes!</li>
            <li>At first, my skin could only take the product for about 15 seconds</li>
            <li>Evens out my Irish complexion better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months now (around twice a week) and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>favorite part about this product, is not only the fact that it helps improve acne, but also leaves your skin feeling extremely \\&quot;squeaky</li>
            <li>This product felt like a thousand needles on my face every time I used it until it dried off but its really effective when used alone, some of the pimples that I had under my skin faded almost completely away after 3 uses and some of the tougher pimples shrank after the 3rd use.</li>
            <li>(Professional)]]First purchased this cleanser in Feb. 2013; I just ordered my second bottle (just as the first is about to run out).</li>
            <li>I get constant compliments on my skin and would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>My face peeling around my mouth especially the first week or so, then started clearing up.</li>
            <li>The two together are a little strong for me.  </li>
            <li>My skin clogs easily so, I needed something to facilitate removal of the all the dead skin keeping the bacteria inside the pores to wreak havoc.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I am 50 with fair-skin, green eyes and do not burn easily.  </li>
            <li>If interested, my daily skin regimen consists of this product, the Rodan Fields anti-age/redefine or reverse line + sun block and topical pure hyaluronic acid</li>
            <li>The cleaner is extremely powerful so I definitely recommend using a high quality moisturizer after each cleaning (personally I use CeraVe Moisturizing cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off note that I am 27 years old, a male and suffer from adult acne.</li>
            <li>It makes my face look smooth, soft and less oily.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt tight and smooth after the treatment.</li>
            <li>but I found using the product with a scrub to remove the dry skin, and then leaves your skin smooth and soft as if I just received a facial.</li>
            <li>even though I like to use this as my daily cleanser, I have to skip one or two days with using different gentler product that contain moisturizer just to make sure my skin not became too dry.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product to anyone looking to further their beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and acne scars along with the occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li>I have contacted the company just to share my concerns, and I am certain I will hear back from them soon.</li>
            <li>I feel like this product helped smooth it out by sloughing off all the skin keeping those little buggers in and also flattened out those hormonal pimples.</li>
            <li>Definitely exfoliates, my skin feels very soft afterwards because it&#x27;s that fresh new layer of skin, but probably too fresh because it needs a few days to heal afterwards and feels pretty dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy in his late teens, and this works pretty well on helping clean your face of excess oil.</li>
            <li>I have been clear of blackheads.</li>
            <li>It is the only face wash I&#x27;ve found that really helps to keep me clear.  </li>
            <li>I have very stubborn blackheads, and this product is about the only thing that I have found that will help get rid of them and clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>but it has not made me clear.</li>
            <li>I use this for a daily wash and it really keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>It has undoubtedly enhanced my skin care products and the balance, texture and look of my (now) clear skin.</li>
            <li>I hope that this helps someone who is looking to make their skin balanced, clear, tightened, admirable and youthful.  </li>
            <li>Keeps pores clear without over drying.</li>
            <li>It keeps the skin clear in between peels.</li>
            <li>It helps me maintain clear skin.</li>
            <li>I let my sister try it , she also has oily skin that is prone to breakouts, and it helped to clear her pores too.  </li>
            <li>- my skin is clear and exfoliated.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne, melasma, and milia.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer getting facials all that often, however, I still use this salicylic gel wash at least 2-3 times a week and more often in the summer.  </li>
            <li>I have combination and mildly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it daily, but I really like the way my skin feels after I use it</li>
            <li>So far im liking this product.</li>
            <li>I have a very oily t-zone with very big pores on nose and cheeks and this product is not helping neither to reduce oiliness nor pore reduction.</li>
            <li>Has already healed old acne scars.</li>
            <li>And I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My only quarrel with this product is that, it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I want it to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling with adult acne.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely far stronger than anything you&#x27;d find at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t have hyper sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have oily t-zone and have suffered adult acne all my adult life.</li>
            <li>It works as sold its to early to know details.</li>
            <li>Until recently I realized, it really is...</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, watch out.</li>
            <li>This cleanser works very well as a deep cleanser in a weekly regimen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 66 years old, and find that I still have a combination oily/normal  skin.  </li>
            <li>It probably took between 4 and 5 months of intensive therapy to clear out my face completely.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item along with the Peel for my Husband who has adult Acne.</li>
            <li>I have mature, combination normal/oily skin with acne on my cheeks and whiteheads on my nose</li>
            <li>I use a gentle hydrating toner and a regular oil skin moisturizer (Neutrogena).  </li>
            <li>im getting so far.</li>
            <li>Mostly natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Mostly natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been battling acne since my early teens.</li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>Also if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am 66 and continue to have oily combination sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It has caused me to be overly self conscious.</li>
            <li>embarrassing adult acne.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne (comodone acne)  </li>
            <li>i dont have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Although, she complained of it stinging and wasn&#x27;t able to tolerate it as well.  </li>
            <li>It just makes your skin feel so darn baby soft</li>
            <li>I did notice the redness of old scars has been reduced with using the cleanser,peel and hydrating lotion.</li>
            <li>One word of caution: use an old towel.</li>
            <li>so hoping my face gets clear completely and stays..</li>
            <li>If you know anything about facial care, a deep exfoliating cleanser is vital to success.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t be thick peeing but noticeable for sure.</li>
            <li>The over the counter stuff is just not strong enough for me and most people with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>This makes your skin tight and really clean.  </li>
            <li>After wash, skin felt tight and clean.</li>
            <li>This is my first year that I have made it through the holidays without a single breakout.  </li>
            <li>The only side effect that it has had when using it alone is that it makes my face super dry after cleaning it off but</li>
            <li>a great product just dont use it in combination with other acne fighting products because it might be too harsh on your face together with the other products.</li>
            <li>a great product just dont use it in combination with other acne fighting products because it might be too harsh on your face together with the other products.</li>
            <li>The results are subtle and get better over time.</li>
            <li>As someone in her early 40s with dry, sensitive skin, I didn&#x27;t think that this product would help much.</li>
            <li>it makes my face feel clean without harsh</li>
            <li>I use this a s a daily cleanser within my skin regime (which is mainly perscption creams, pills, and peels) to treat my cystic acne and over-production of candida cells.  </li>
            <li>If you have normal or sensitive skin, you may want to only use it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>So, my verdict : may use as a normal cleanser but not too frequent and definitely not daily.</li>
            <li>I re-order this all the time it last a long time and worth every penny for use in-between peels</li>
            <li>My skin is having a positive reaction (thank god) and beginning to dry out my blemishes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone struggling with daily acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I presume the high percentage of acid works the same in exfoliating as a scrub with particles.  </li>
            <li>then I suggest getting on accutane as soon as you possibly can because no cleanser can get deep enough into the skin to really help much with cysts.</li>
            <li>Finally I have found a cleanser that has helped my adult chin acne!!  </li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling smooth and less congested</li>
            <li>The bottle lasted a long time as you do not have to use much.  </li>
            <li>It has given me back my normal skin and my oily skin</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin relatively clear, but not acne free, you need something stronger to help substitute this every few weeks (like their facial peel).</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product, and I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t dry you up as much.</li>
            <li>So glad that a little goes a long way because my hubby and son are using it daily too.</li>
            <li>Another issue I&#x27;ve had with prior products is I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if something is going on with my skin that makes it unusual, but I can use this every single day, sometimes twice per day, with no drying and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Other than the fact that it is a small quantity and a little pricey, other than that a great product!  </li>
            <li>I get sunburns, and the occasional windburn, but makeup doesn&#x27;t usually bother me, and I don&#x27;t react to most facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>Other than that, these products work exactly as described</li>
            <li>That being said, I don&#x27;t have any major problems with my skin anymore</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cleaner for about 4 months now and have not had any major breakouts since.  </li>
            <li>It smells much like chemicals and made my skin very very dry.</li>
            <li>Helped to clear up my stubborn adult acne (along with other products prescribed by doctor) and use everyday to keep breakout free.</li>
            <li>I started seeing dermatologists when I was in high school and was given countless oral and topical medications to try.</li>
            <li>but I use it on the regular like twice a week to keep my glow And face clear.</li>
            <li>so I wash my face with a simple face wash for sensitive skin before using this product.</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;m in mid 30s, olive complexion and have rosacea - generally sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I had to avoid sensitive areas, and only used it on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I came across this product by using the sorting options on Amazon to look for a facial cleanser with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>so I figured that I would replace it with an all natural facial cleanser like this one.</li>
            <li>I use it as a deep cleanser for my oily, acne prone, 36 year old skin.  </li>
            <li>I recently went of birth control, so my hormones are completely out of sync.</li>
            <li>so far big plus!!!</li>
            <li>Despite that, it hasn&#x27;t made my skin any worse... or any better.</li>
            <li>It is thorough and gentle enough not to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>It helps wash off old dry skin and leaves my face really soft.</li>
            <li>Use a good moisturizer afterwards to avoid excessive drying of the skin if used daily, which I had a hard time not doing.</li>
            <li>Skin feels tight but a good youthful tight, not dry crocodile tight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the little extra time.</li>
            <li>My skin is used to products like this so, results might vary for other people and might be harsh if you haven&#x27;t used strong salicylic acid products before.</li>
            <li>I do have a very sensitive skin so if you have a sensitive skin, too, please try some other product.</li>
            <li>It is not too harsh and it leaves my skin clean and dry all day and night.</li>
            <li>During my trials, my skin would clear up and then to my chagrin, acne and hyper pigmentation would come roaring back to my face bigger and badder than before I tried to find something to help.  </li>
            <li>product in combination with the acid peel (by the same company) has completely rid my face of acne/old acne scars and facial discoloration.</li>
            <li>i would recommend it to my friends but it was solely my decision to make this into a daily facial cleanser, may not be recommended for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>In the first day(s) of use, the skin may react to the power of this product, by sensation or with a minimal dry patch (so protect against the onset of discoloration with sunscreen if this happens)</li>
            <li>And hey, I&#x27;ve only used up half of the bottle of peel and half the bottle of cleanser since I bought them both two months ago, so I&#x27;m looking at spending about forty bucks every four months - not a bad deal at all!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to keep it on your skin too long, or use it every day if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li>It can be a little drying, especially on my chin, so I don&#x27;t always use the peel/wash on my chin area, but it has helped my jawline sooooooo much!</li>
            <li>Right now the small size lasts about a month</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels cleaner and pores are no longer very noticeable, with less redness just from use of the cleanser alone.  </li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin and this does not irritate or dry in any way.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have much effect on my red marks, but it somewhat calmed my acne down.</li>
            <li>If the price was just a little lower I would certainly issue 5 stars .</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me completely breakout-free, but if I have a new zit, I will dab some of the cleanser on my dry face for a few seconds and then wet my clarisonic and really work it in.</li>
            <li>You can visibly see a difference after use - skin is tight and there is a glow to it, really.  </li>
            <li>I had suffered from very oily, acne prone skin as a teenager and a young adult, but as I aged (and especially after I had children), my skin began to dry out a little bit with some oil in the T-zone.  </li>
            <li>Some minor stuff around that time of the month, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li>However, I have over-active sebacious glands and as I&#x27;ve gotten older, my celluar turnover has slowed down.</li>
            <li>First time I used it I applied less quantity than suggested for half the time, the results were a very red and sensitive nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend their other products too!</li>

            <li> completely satisfied!!</li>
            <li> : I found this to be a very effective, exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li> Once a week, I followed with the chemical peel pads (also amazing!)</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an amazing cleanser!..</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but its a million times better.</li>
            <li> I have been using Perfect image products for 6 months now and really love them.</li>
            <li> It does a wonderful job in exfoliating skin and leaves a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> I am convinced that no matter how great a product is said to be, it cannot possibly be good for everyone.  </li>
            <li> I just found that Perfect Image worked better for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You may see some dryness in your skin, but if you keep on top of moisturizing the results are excellent.</li>
            <li> I also use Perfect Image TCA peel which isn&#x27;t too strong but does the trick.</li>
            <li> I always followed with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> good?</li>
            <li> but this is usually good.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be a good cleanser</li>
            <li> but my skin stays really good with this regimen</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite this, the product is good for peeling treatment.</li>
            <li> Really good product to use to prepare your skin for a peel</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a good smell.</li>
            <li> immediately I loved how it cleaned.  </li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was 25.</li>
            <li> I use this before and after my peel and it makes my skin smooth and look great!</li>
            <li> My skin feels sooo good afterwards.</li>
            <li> use this now about 3 times weekly follow up with a good moisturizer and</li>
            <li> People comment on how good my skin looks when I use it</li>
            <li> good transaction, product</li>
            <li> This cleanser works wonderfully as a pre-peel treatment, as well as light peeling itself.</li>
            <li> Loved it, a must have product.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overly drying like Neutrogena makes my skin feel, but as another reviewer suggested, I&#x27;d use a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of all the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Since I visited doctors and pay 50 buck for a visit and a 100 for a product that wasn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and very easy to use and it helps me control my acne</li>
            <li> I use this pre-peel for just that, a prep for a more thorough Perfect Image Peel (LOVE the Pineapple Pumpkin Peel)</li>
            <li> I use many Perfect Image products &amp; love them.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied , saw results on my face with an a week.</li>
            <li> Peel- Enhanced with Papaya Extract &amp; AHA [from Perfect Image], which I use rarely</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> very pleased</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, and I will buy it again.  </li>
            <li> But I am happy to say I&#x27;ve found a face cleanser I will continue using as the results are better than I&#x27;ve been able to achieve before!</li>
            <li> I am sure it will fit perfectly to my needs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: I love this cleanser!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic in a bottle!</li>

            <li> This is an excellent deep cleaning cleanser...</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser for what I bought it for - not quite a peel, but better than soap.  </li>
            <li> I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve order this product a couple of times now, and I&#x27;m pleased with how it works.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is safe to expose treated area to the sun.</li>
            <li> Especially when it&#x27;s the best cleaner/acne fighter on the market.</li>
            <li> I love using this product 1 - 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and haven&#x27;t been able to catch a break.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to have chose these products.</li>
            <li> If you have really oily skin, this is great</li>
            <li> Well I have to say this face wash works better than any over the counter or proactive product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This stings a bit more but works well</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> i will surely but it again.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Perfect for use prior to peels.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, love the tingle and love the way it leaves my skin.  </li>
            <li> I might be able to get away with just using it and giving up my proactiv</li>
            <li> but I can sincerely say that this cleanser has played a part in keeping me zit-free.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> but after I used this recommended cleanset and the results were outstanding.</li>
            <li> I rated this cleanser a five star because I love the way it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a hell of a lot more convenient.</li>
            <li> I  have been highly satisfied with the quality of every purchase.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I have it to keep these enlarged pores at bay.</li>
            <li> I let it stay for more than the allowed time</li>
            <li> so I have been trying many products.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I also make sure to use it prior to using the Perfect Image Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel treatment.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin but since using this in combination with a peel, my skin has never looked clearer or better.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line - this stuff works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried for mild-moderate acne, both for prevention and treatment (including prescription-strength Benzoyl Peroxide &amp; Salicylic acid formulations).</li>
            <li> Either they made me break out more, and it just didn&#x27;t make any difference.</li>
            <li> Until I tried Perfect Image&#x27;s Pre-Peel Salicylic Deep Gel Exfoliating Cleanser.</li>
            <li> LOVE this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I still love this cleanser though, so I still use it 1-3 times a week depending on how my skin&#x27;s doing.</li>
            <li> &gt;: )</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> my skin hasn&#x27;t gotten any better</li>
            <li> Love this product and I&#x27;m preparing to place another order alongside the pineapple enzyme peel.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> If it goes up any more though, I won&#x27;t order</li>
            <li> I love to Sonya Dakar products</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and it is the type of things that your local stores won&#x27;t carry, because it is too good</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I rinse it off in the shower and wash my face again to be sure all of the product is removed.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this order.</li>
            <li> Im Definatley going to buy again!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> the cleanser works better than any product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> okay...</li>
            <li> It has helped with my acne and I am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is the best.</li>
            <li> I love this because I can feel it.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleanser for people to workout - especially outdoors.</li>
            <li> I do love this product it keeps the blemishes away.</li>
            <li> However, now that I&#x27;ve gotten rid of my acne, I do enjoy using this cleanser quite a bit because the smell is so amazing</li>
            <li> I also changed my diet: mostly vegetarian (fish, beans, lentils),</li>
            <li> Now, my skin is softer, brighter, more even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For regular peels, I use the 50% Lactic Acid peel by Perfect Image and am going to start using the 12% TCA peel soon for more aggressive results on the acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this for my arsenal.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this many months ago, used it twice a week.</li>
            <li> He noticed the condition of my skin (age 57), and commented on how refreshed and healthy it looked.</li>
            <li> It worked better then most products ive tried.</li>
            <li> Then wash with your favorite face wash with a lufa type scrubby.  </li>
            <li> I use my favorite Retin-A product.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than what you can find at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue to use for sure...</li>
            <li> I get a bit of a sting when using it, but its ok because that tells me its working.</li>
            <li> love the cleanser</li>
            <li> While rinsing, I sort of rubbed the water around to be sure to rinse thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> one of those machine that their a pad that rotation around) since it better than cleaning your face with your hands</li>
            <li> sure to use the peel, wash and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> pretty good on its own; the peel was too strong for me, so I used this as a milder version</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 1/7/13 - I have now been using this product for almost a full year and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!  </li>
            <li> great product as a prep for main peel.</li>
            <li> My face feels very clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Rinse with cool or warm water</li>
            <li> Seemed to work pretty good  </li>
            <li> Her face is now clear and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser a week ago, used it every morning and to my surprise its the best cleanser ever, makes your skin soft, smooth and clean, redness got better and acne marks have diminished too.</li>
            <li> : since so many others seem to have great experiences, don&#x27;t let my review completely deter you.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week with my clarisonic and it keeps my oily skin in check and provides a nice mild exfoliation that keeps my skin looking luminous all week.</li>
            <li> I received both the cleanser and peel (which I think I might have to return after my experience with the scrub) promptly and was very excited to try the cleanser after reading so many fantastic reviews.</li>
            <li> but after i used more than 2 weeks it&#x27;s fine on my skin.</li>
            <li> after everytime I use this cleanser, just &#x27;Clean&#x27;!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll come away clean an refreshed!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft,smooth &amp; clean!</li>
            <li> She isn&#x27;t used to using anything stronger than over the counter products on her face, so I&#x27;m guessing if she gradually worked up to more contact time it would be fine for her too.</li>
            <li> and I love other Perfect Image products, so</li>
            <li> I found this product to be a very good deep cleaning cleanser.</li>
            <li> but I must say, I really love how smooth my skin is getting.</li>
            <li> but it would be great to not have to reorder so frequently.  </li>
            <li> The product works great to clear out my oily-combination skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and more importantly</li>
            <li> Gentle and works good.</li>
            <li> but it cleans very well and is a good prep for the peels.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t have an offensive smell (more like a light cleaning product smell), easy to use</li>
            <li> I have mild to occasionally severe acne and this product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, they each come with very clear instructions for use, which is good because these are potent products.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser makes my face feel very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Maybe every other day would be best for some depending on skin type.</li>
            <li> , they were clean just in the top layer.</li>
            <li> I also use a very mild peel 2X a month.  </li>
            <li> I believe the peel will work better when the face is squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Love this product, keeps my skin clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Might help with very mild surface acne or just roughness of the skin.</li>
            <li> If you do a thorough cleansing with Perfect Image cleanser, you will remove most of the dead skin.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell(something in between clorox and cleaning detergent).</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended about to try there peel also.</li>
            <li> It is strong and can lead to dryness</li>
            <li> The peel does have a strong tingling sensation.  </li>
            <li> This is a a strong cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It is quite strong but nothing that can&#x27;t be dealt with.</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY REFRESHING AND CLEANS FACE AREA VERY WELL.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I have fair, freckled skin and live in FL.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it in conjunction with anything that has a resurfacing element to it and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use the cleanser as a wash by itself and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty sure it is a response of my integumentary and endorcrine systems to secrete more oil</li>
            <li> I have also started a 3 series Arctic Laser Peel with my dermatologist which I am hoping with help with fine lines and boost my collagen production.  </li>
            <li> The gel really help more than the chemical peel did which they did a pretty good job as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products but this wins the race.</li>
            <li> Overall, this brand is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists since I was like 16 (now 31) and had always fought acne issues, yes had all kinds of prescriptions, nothing is perfect, scripts work for awhile then stops after few months or even a year.</li>
            <li> is the kind of stuff that really ought to be applied by licensed cosmetologists!&lt;br</li>
            <li> No scrubbing with this though as it is plenty string on its own just to be gently massaged into.</li>
            <li> This peel when used according to the direction  is a fantastic peel for acne skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser used just a couple of times a week has kept me acne free for almost a year.  </li>
            <li> Yes indeed both Mother and Son are using the same product with great results.</li>
            <li> Will give you a smooth sensation in your face.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic wash.</li>
            <li> It is great used as a skin prep before a peel is performed as it prepares the skin by deep cleansing and removing any bacteria and debris that causes breakouts.</li>
            <li> It works without drying your face, and your face feels smooth and comfortable afterward.</li>
            <li> and soon I will be smooth again.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and this is a fantastic cleanser for my skin.  </li>
            <li> This works great for deep cleaning oily skin.  </li>
            <li> you enjoy this as I have.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> but, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for  the pass 6 months and have had good result so far.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with how smooth my face felt after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> This is not for a everyday wash but its good for an exfoliating wash and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Salicylic Deep Exfoliating gel is FABULOUS!!!  </li>
            <li> I have very clear, smooth skin and do not break out since I started using this product!!</li>
            <li> For me, it is worth the price!</li>
            <li> First day used, most of my acne had disappered.</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the instructions this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleanser and feel that it really helps with cleaning out my pores and giving my face a fresh feeling while helping it to also look better too.  </li>
            <li> He started used both these items &amp; his skin has significantly improved.</li>
            <li> Dont go overboard on using the product though, you have to give your face time to heal so its best to use the product once every 3 days or so</li>
            <li> I have had a minor purge but nothing that I haven&#x27;t experienced before.</li>
            <li> I then wait for about an hour after my shower and moisturize with an acne friendly moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you rinse it off good and pat your face dry!</li>
            <li> amazing like I have new skin.</li>
            <li> It gives it that clean feeling.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, it completely strips the skin of dirt and oil and really gives you that squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my pores clean.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best acne facial wash you will ever use!</li>
            <li> This is a great face cleaner that doesn&#x27;t strip his skin too dry.</li>
            <li> These two together work in conjunction to keep my face clean without abusing my skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean and refreshed and it has reduced my breakouts.  </li>
            <li> feel clean, and the skin stays cleaner for longer.</li>
            <li> when the skin seems too dry to use this cleaner, that would be great.</li>
            <li> This product seems to clean the skin</li>
            <li> Now to be clean</li>
            <li> My face is squeaky clean  after use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you don&#x27;t mind spending this kind of money on face wash, but if you&#x27;re really trying to get rid of acne with it</li>
            <li> It works super well, so really brush it on then rinse it off right away!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others but have never seen positive results like this.</li>
            <li> OTOH, I didn&#x27;t experience any of the positive effects of usage that many mentioned in their reviews, either.  </li>
            <li> Staying young and healthy takes effort!  </li>
            <li> I love how active it is and how good it works to keep blackheads and acne at bay.  </li>
            <li> It is a good Aid for you against the unexpected breakouts, it will treat the problem very fast.</li>
            <li> Be sure to have your moisturizer ready.</li>
            <li> It cleans deep and makes my skin look and feel so good.</li>
            <li> Definitely use moisturizer after and your good.</li>
            <li> I will try to find this product somewhere else for a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> However, it had such good reviews</li>
            <li> I AM VERY WELL PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WILL PURCHASE IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait unless you want the full on peeling.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, and I will definitely buy again.  </li>
            <li> It is bit strong at first</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li> So I honestly believe that I had a major reaction to this product!</li>
            <li> This product is great for maintaining the results of a chemical peel, but it can be just a little over drying so for that i suggest an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and my face feels so fresh and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Face feels fresh, and clean after cleaning with this.</li>
            <li> My teenage son who has had acne issues is seeing great results with this cleaner &amp; I, in my mid 40&#x27;s love how clean my face feels (without drying out) after I use.</li>
            <li> which I cannot find any products do the same job of such excellent exfoliating without scrubbles...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took my face 3 days to recover, and I&#x27;m lucky</li>
            <li> and I had to quickly rinse off.</li>
            <li> This is because each time I used it my pimples, although not too many, increased in sizes, and I develop even more pimples than I had prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried peels for the feet, hands, and mild scrubs for the face,but not a peel for the face.  </li>
            <li> I admit I got panicky when I stated to feel the tingle and a mild burning feel.  </li>
            <li> , I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is much more stronger than the your normal 2% Salicylic cleanser</li>
            <li> nothing&#x27;s worthy full star rating, I am not really 5-star person, but the products good</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this stuff was as strong as others made it out to be</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really super cleanser, my skin is fresh after using it and not so oily.</li>
            <li> Really strong, you will see results really quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> Really strong, you will see results really quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> This is a good stand-alone cleanser but overuse can dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser for my oily skin cuts right through and I feel clean without feeling dried out.</li>
            <li> finally when i came to this product i was interested in the tea tree oil peel and this facial wash (both from the perfect image line).</li>
            <li> Salicylic acid penetrates better anyway when there is less oil on the face so in my opinion, I feel it would be fore effective to wash before using it.</li>
            <li> Product is very strong and gives you a real deep clean in your face.</li>
            <li> so i can use it more frequenly, follow it up with a nice moisturizer or your skin will feel really tight.</li>
            <li> After using this product, my skin is very dry, but I deal with that by using a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It works great for exfoliating the dead skin cells and renewing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how amazing this product is.</li>
            <li> This face wash is amazing, especially if you have oily or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s powerful stuff, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million different types of its kind and this one blows the rest out of the water.</li>
            <li> So far, my acne has calmed more and my skin is smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I use this regularly it does a great job keeping my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser for my 66 year old, yet still oily, skin with clogged pore issues.  </li>
            <li> I think its worth getting</li>
            <li> Hopefully with continued use I will get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I learned my skin is more sensitive than I ever thought</li>
            <li> Far better than a doctor’s visit.  </li>
            <li> It controls any breakouts and keeps my skin looking young and healthy without being overly drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that this is starting to clear my skin...</li>
            <li> so I restrict the more frequent use to just those oilier areas.</li>
            <li> Apply a dime amount has recommended you don&#x27;t need a lot this is powerful stuff.</li>
            <li> This so far is my favorite cleanser..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> It keeps my 52 year old skin smooth &amp; free of breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Although the Perfect Image Cleanser was drying at first, plus I have naturally dry skin, with regular use the dryness subsided.  </li>
            <li> I had a facial done in June and the esthetician told me that I had absolutely no black heads and my skin looked great.  </li>
            <li> This wonderful facial cleanser had left my skin feeling clean and clear without any drying.  </li>
            <li> This wonderful facial cleanser had left my skin feeling clean and clear without any drying.</li>
            <li> Cleans properly, leaves the skin Very Clean, Breathable, Glowy and Smooth.</li>
            <li> I began by using it prior to the other Perfect Image peels, but now I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> My skin looked burned but my pores did not looked totally clean, just only  the top layer was cleaned(same result</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my skin so clean, smooth and soft after using it to cleanse my face.  </li>
            <li> I got too excited and used too much.  </li>
            <li> combined with 3-6 months using this product and the regular use of the topical pure hyaluronic acid, my skin is pretty much perfect, now, really!</li>
            <li> You could tell right away...pores that stay no matter</li>
            <li> Since 2013 I have been on a mission to find the right cleansing/moisturizing/treatment routine for my skin.  </li>
            <li> right before I run out</li>
            <li> - right now it&#x27;s at $25.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference right away...</li>
            <li> Really gets face clean (even mascara) without over drying.</li>
            <li> It works great so long as I use it two times a day and not a few times a week as it suggests.</li>
            <li> you might flake, but if you want a product that is really going to clean your skin, this is what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kind of like it, but it maybe a little strong for the acne start scarring.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this and I am super pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a week now and am happy I purchased this product!</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews, and was excited to try this, because everything spoke so highly of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure to put moisturizer on after use, makes skin very try and sensitive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Easy to apply, clear instructions</li>
            <li> The results have definitely been worth putting up with the dryness for me, just be sure to give your skin time to heal and dont use it too often (use it once every 3 days).y 3 days or so (the bottle suggest once every</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Easy to apply, clear instructions</li>
            <li> The results have definitely been worth putting up with the dryness for me, just be sure to give your skin time to heal and dont use it too often (use it once every 3 days).</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second bottle, so can easily recommend this for those who do home/professional peels as well as those who just want a deeper clean that the salicylic acid provides.</li>
            <li> I am sure for some people, this product is great, but for me, it is useless.</li>
            <li> I have very oily, sensitive skin and cannot even wear most makeup.</li>
            <li> I received my item very fast.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face super clean, glowing, and smooth, without dry feeling.</li>
            <li> Can be a little drying but just use a good moisturizer or skip a day.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get over how smooth and clean my face felt that I decided to use it daily.</li>
            <li> Works fast!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it promises to do.  </li>
            <li> Didnt do much !  </li>
            <li> is controlled pretty much all day, with just a dewy glow by the end of the day -- not a grease trap!  </li>
            <li> It has really cleared up my skin!</li>
            <li> But I scrub ever so gently!</li>
            <li> I am just about finished with my first bottle.</li>
            <li> Just make sure use it only twice a week maybe, and use sunscreen after each use.</li>
            <li> I have been able to use this product as a daily cleanser.</li>
            <li> For the first year, we also did thye salicylic acid peel twice a month.</li>
            <li> I am sure he will continue using it for the next year or so.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it is one of those products that actually works.</li>
            <li> But even after the first use, I could tell that my skin was smoother and clearer.</li>
            <li> I purchased it more for my teenage son than for myself.</li>
            <li> Clear with smooth texture.</li>
            <li> It is a great product to use at least 3 times per week.</li>
            <li> I love how deep cleansing this cleanser is.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, use it daily for control of my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> After much research and reading all the reviews I thought I found a &amp;#34;keeper&amp;#34;. NOT!</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried so many different cleansers.</li>
            <li> I used this first then the glyolic acid peel</li>
            <li> However, I love to use it daily.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even express how much this has helped!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even say how much it&#x27;s helped!</li>
            <li> The effect is noticeable after the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually looking forward to trying more of their products.</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle</li>
            <li> and it really works, skin feels fresh and healthier with the use before a peel&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> First time use......</li>
            <li> really hope this product never goes away, it has been a life saver!</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel insanely smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> ...Should have been an indicator that this was not going to end pretty.</li>
            <li> However when I went to first use it, I was immediately thrown off by the striking, aqua blue color and bathroom cleaner scent.</li>
            <li> I first used the cleanser on my face for 5 days and then did the peel on the weekend.</li>
            <li> and it really helps!</li>
            <li> This product, according to my analysis, does exactly what it purports to.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this item by mistake &amp; lodged it even better than the product I was using (Infinite Skin Clarity Cleanser)</li>
            <li> This combo has really been good for my skin to help control oil, breakouts and fade dark spots.</li>
            <li> salicylic acid is ideal for penetrating acne deep down &amp; cleansing.</li>
            <li> Has a very mild sting at 1st, but nothing bad, your face will feel wonderful after using this product &amp; you can use this with or without moisturizing afterwards, as it isn&#x27;t over drying.</li>
            <li> Great daily cleanser product but be prepared to use it as a regimen and not alone unless you want peeling, dry skin which will age your skin.</li>
            <li> It did not burned as much as the first time and I just peeled for a couple of days, but pores looked very much as the first time</li>
            <li> I was waking each morning and washing with my gentle cleanser that had been fine up until my surgery and my face returned to complete oil after hours.  </li>
            <li> Cool water on-hand is important, however, this system got rid of my adult acne/breakouts and continues to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> It is very strong, if you leave it on too long it will dry and peel the top layer.  </li>
            <li> I had really bad acne for most of my teenage years to the point that people call me (pizza face) and Perfect Image help a lot to clean acne.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> : I have mildly sensitive skin, and some adult acne (mostly T zone and chin line).</li>
            <li> I have used this product over the last month for deep cleaning and it is giving good results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it lasts pretty well because you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this product alone though worked very well, I noticed results after the first day.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser (Pre-Peel Salicylic Deep Gel Exfoliating Cleanser) and the Glycolic Acid 30% Gel Peel - Enhanced with Retinol and Green Tea Extract (Professional Chemical Peel) from Perfect Image through Amazon in mid-September</li>
            <li> Really the first line that I&#x27;ve used all together that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair - no freckles and naturally small pores.</li>
            <li> It works pretty better than any other major acne wash products in market; and it doesn&#x27;t irrate/over-dry your skin although it contains strong salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> I had to use it once a day, due to the fact that it is very strong.</li>
            <li> I would just like to say that I have now been using this product for about 6 months, and I have noticed a significant difference not only in my face, but most importantly in my back.</li>
            <li> hope all of you share a similar experience and enjoy it as much as I have and will continue to!</li>
            <li> It gets rid of most of my flaky dry skin.</li>
            <li> I alternates it with Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Balancing Cleanser in the morning since I consider it might be too strong to use it twice daily.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how strong this stuff would actually be!</li>
            <li> However, if you do have skin that may react to certain dyes or scents and you end up with an electric blue, strongly scented product, please, err on the side of caution.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and blotchy skin</li>
            <li> B0047AKVW6 Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure Refill 8 oz]]</li>
            <li> Hopefully I never have to live without it!!</li>
            <li> pretty good facial peel, be careful dries you out.</li>
            <li> It is strong yet gentle on the skin at the same time.</li>
            <li> but after the first use I was so excited by the noticeable difference in my skin that I used it the next day as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting a pimple here and there, so this is not a total fix, but it&#x27;s a HUGE improvement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SURE THIS PRODUCT DOES EVERYTHING AND MORE FOR THOSE WHO LOVE IT, BUT MY SKIN HAD A BAD REACTION TO IT.  </li>
            <li> and you can really feel that the exfoliating works.</li>
            <li> I dont feel like this did much for me.</li>
            <li> THIS IS PRODUCT IS REALLY WORKING ON MY SKIN AFTER THAT</li>
            <li> My skin now feels smooth, evenly exfoliated, and properly prepped for treatment.  </li>
            <li> It has a medicinal smell which I am not a fan of and cleanses really well</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50+ and have really oily skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product weekly for about a month now, but don&#x27;t see much difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it before lactic or TCA peels because it really opens my pores up.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product has helped diminish by brown spots from my face and makes my face so much smoother.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and this is very drying but</li>
            <li> I really had to build up my skin tolerance.</li>
            <li> You can really feel it working, after using this product for a month</li>
            <li> This product confuses me so much I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it.</li>
            <li> I don’t expect the cleanser to do the whole job by itself.  </li>
            <li> I have really oily skin (must blot skin every 2 hours or so).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have very oily acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen an improvement.</li>
            <li> For me, this formula is a bit drying to use 2x/day, even 1x/day is too much.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels cleaner and pores are no longer very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This product is really helpfull for acne.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I guess I can say that this stuff didn&#x27;t do much and for the amount of money they ask for the product it should work really well</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It really works clears your complextion up</li>
            <li> this product really helped me alot clearing my acne..</li>
            <li> This cleanser really prepares your face for your peel.</li>
            <li> This cleanser really rids one&#x27;s complexion of sweat, dirt, and debris.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to men and women!</li>
            <li> and the bottle lasts a while because you don&#x27;t need to use much product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I want to use it for my whole body.</li>
            <li> i use this stuff a few times a week and will be ordering a second bottle, it lasts about 4 months for two people, but if you use it more often you will have to order more of it.  </li>
            <li> this wash has really helped to improve my condition.i hear</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week to maintain my very oily skin.</li>
            <li> The beads exfoliate very well.</li>
            <li> I still get ocassional whiteheads, but they are the tiny kind you can pop and then disappear the next day.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more for myself as well as for my 22yr old daughter who loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Because there is a higher content of acid in this face wash it will dry your face more than usual after the wash; it&#x27;s very important to moisturize after.  </li>
            <li> It is a great deal for the price because a little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but if used too much your skin will dry out easy if it&#x27;s like mine.  </li>
            <li> I receive compliments on the smooth texture and vibrant clarity of my skin almost daily.</li>
            <li> I love all their other products</li>
            <li> , it did significantly reduce the white heads and</li>
            <li> It is a strong cleanser, but thats what i love, finally a cleanser that has enough salicylic acid in it to actually do something for your acne.  </li>
            <li> I might say that it&#x27;s just probably my skin, but make sure to check the product first behind your ear for sensitivity because it is very powerful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such a clean face in my life.</li>
            <li> I also alternate between the TCA and Salycylic peels which have Greatly improved my skin over the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> for me, this does not dry my face as much since i have been using it for 6 months as daily use, my acne has more than cleared up</li>
            <li> My pores seem to look smaller and my face feels clean after every use.  </li>
            <li> My face feels clean, my pores appear smaller and my skin feels taut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell but so far, I have had no bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it daily, but rather save it to use just before applying my Bentonite clay mask, or before a special event or photo shoot.</li>
            <li> It really cleans better than the typical salicylic acid cleansers I tried before (Neutrogena, Phisoderm, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is slightly drying, so it is essential to follow with a good moisturiser.</li>
            <li> but it certainly helps exfoliate and reveal new skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> I was good for several years and stopped seeing dermatologists entirely, but started getting facials regularly in my 30s.</li>
            <li> first I was a little nervous to start using it because I do have very sensitive skin, and many things react.</li>
            <li> He likes it very much because it is easy to rinse off, smells good and leaves his skin less dry than other products he has used.</li>
            <li> You only need a pea size amount to work up a good lather and removes oil and shine for hours and leaves your skin feeling a little tighter too hopefully prolonging any winkles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could ever live without this product!</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live with out it!</li>
            <li> Also, it may be best to start slow, wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it everyday at the beginning.</li>
            <li> But I end up using main level 2 peel.  </li>
            <li> If you have a hairless Chinese Crested, I recommend the mild percentages from &amp;#34;Perfect Image&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> when I apply it, but my only draw back is that you have to use more than the directed dime sized amount to get it to foam/lather up.  </li>
            <li> This facial wash is a phenomenal product especially as a prep for peel.  </li>
            <li> I am a forty-something -year-old female that struggled with acne for most of my life and this product has made such a difference for my skin.</li>
            <li> I mainly bought this product for my Salycic acid treatment</li>
            <li> I love this face wash and have been using it for the last several months.  </li>
            <li> Stings a little on the first few uses but after that its great.</li>
            <li> Gentle even on very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have to admit it&#x27;s very hard to understand why this product would be so far superior to others with very similar ingredient profiles (particularly the primary ingredient, salicylic acid).</li>
            <li> This makes my oily, combination skin feel really squeaky clean, but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement in my clocked pores and minor breakouts.</li>
            <li> A Very Good product for the skin!&lt;br /&gt;Tried and tested and have been using it little by little on the face and neck!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> It really allowed me to get the maximum benefits out of my peel and helped clear up some acne as well!</li>
            <li> So of course I had high expectations based on all the 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for women and men.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for problem skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest one buy a cleansing machine though (</li>
            <li> give me extra smooth skin and shine free for longer hours while I was at work compare to my previous cleanser.</li>
            <li> Used as part of a daily process of derma pen treatments monthly, peeling with combination salicylic and glycol acids 15% bi weekly, using hyaluronic acid with C and moisturizer I am happy to report a serious improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit drying for daily use, but several times a week is fine if you have very oily or resistant skin.  </li>
            <li> Too strong when used in combination with other acne products</li>
            <li> Too strong when used in combination with other acne products</li>
            <li> I had a really bad blackhead problem, but with the use of this, the sacilyic gel mask, and the gylcolic gel mask by Perfect Image.  </li>
            <li> It is a great exfoliation for troubled skin.  </li>
            <li> It will make your skin much too sensitive.</li>
            <li> This wash has helped so much with my adult acne that has just decided to pop up in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and I really like the results so far.  </li>
            <li> really helps clear up acne pimples</li>
            <li> /&gt;Neutral: This product contains propylene glycol, an alcohol that normally irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Fresh enough!</li>
            <li> The only suggestion I have is that I wish they offered a larger size of this product for those of us who use it more frequently.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few of there items and I really love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this cleanser removes the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I definitely will order more in the near future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to save your skin and your sanity the trouble.</li>
            <li> will continue to use it for a few more months.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is a powerful alternative to scrubs, which are either too abrasive or don&#x27;t exfoliate enough.</li>
            <li> This product seems to cause my face to shed dead skin cells right after I use it more then when I use the actual peel.</li>
            <li> For me, this is the only treatment I need for now for my cystic pimples and they clear up quickly (3 – 4 days).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to find that glycolic acid and salicylic acid combined in a facial cleansing regimen has been able to tackle my acne prone skin and this product has conditioners that keep the skin from being bone dry after washing.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating properties are obvious both in terms of leaving skin appearing more fresh and in the very gentle peeling that accompanies use of this wash after only a few days.</li>
            <li> Right now, I&#x27;m following the directions for the 5-7 days of use to prep for my at home peel, which will be tomorrow.</li>
            <li> It is something special in my limited regimen of skin products.  </li>
            <li> right back again...</li>
            <li> face is totally clean with this, it&#x27;s gentle and has actually help diminished scaring caused from the severe rosacea that I had over last summer.</li>
            <li> Third time I waited for a couple of weeks, but though the burning in my skin was less the results were the same: clean pores just in the top layer.</li>
            <li> , I have several of this company&#x27;s &amp;#34;Perfect Image&amp;#34; line and they all work very well with an ok cost, about average pricing.</li>
            <li> The directions do imply not to use daily, but as long as I have a good moisturizer I have had absolutely not problems.  </li>
            <li> My acne has somewhat stabilized, but there is some improvement to new breakouts.  </li>
            <li> and this is something new</li>
            <li> I think I found a new product..</li>
            <li> I also liked the subtle scent of tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but it didn&#x27;t do much when I had the deep cystic acne that I had to go on accutane to get rid of.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I do have fairer, more sensitive skin, I have never had an adverse reaction to tea tree oil, green tea extract, or salicylic acid -even</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who struggles with adult acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin  </li>
            <li> i do have a very sensitive and acne prone skin, but this product works for me.</li>
            <li> So I bought this product a while back and even though I don&#x27;t use it too often, I do very much like it.</li>
            <li> but this keeps it clear!</li>
            <li> I started out by first buying this as a pre-peel prep when I was having a lot of facial peels and microdermabrasions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try some of the other peels as well.  </li>
            <li> Do not put it near your eyes!</li>
            <li> At first, my skin could only take the product for about 15 seconds</li>
            <li> Evens out my Irish complexion better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months now (around twice a week) and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> favorite part about this product, is not only the fact that it helps improve acne, but also leaves your skin feeling extremely \\&quot;squeaky</li>
            <li> This product felt like a thousand needles on my face every time I used it until it dried off but its really effective when used alone, some of the pimples that I had under my skin faded almost completely away after 3 uses and some of the tougher pimples shrank after the 3rd use.</li>
            <li> (Professional)]]First purchased this cleanser in Feb. 2013; I just ordered my second bottle (just as the first is about to run out).</li>
            <li> I get constant compliments on my skin and would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> My face peeling around my mouth especially the first week or so, then started clearing up.</li>
            <li> The two together are a little strong for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin clogs easily so, I needed something to facilitate removal of the all the dead skin keeping the bacteria inside the pores to wreak havoc.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I am 50 with fair-skin, green eyes and do not burn easily.  </li>
            <li> If interested, my daily skin regimen consists of this product, the Rodan Fields anti-age/redefine or reverse line + sun block and topical pure hyaluronic acid</li>
            <li> The cleaner is extremely powerful so I definitely recommend using a high quality moisturizer after each cleaning (personally I use CeraVe Moisturizing cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off note that I am 27 years old, a male and suffer from adult acne.</li>
            <li> It makes my face look smooth, soft and less oily.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt tight and smooth after the treatment.</li>
            <li> but I found using the product with a scrub to remove the dry skin, and then leaves your skin smooth and soft as if I just received a facial.</li>
            <li> even though I like to use this as my daily cleanser, I have to skip one or two days with using different gentler product that contain moisturizer just to make sure my skin not became too dry.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to anyone looking to further their beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and acne scars along with the occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li> I have contacted the company just to share my concerns, and I am certain I will hear back from them soon.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product helped smooth it out by sloughing off all the skin keeping those little buggers in and also flattened out those hormonal pimples.</li>
            <li> Definitely exfoliates, my skin feels very soft afterwards because it&#x27;s that fresh new layer of skin, but probably too fresh because it needs a few days to heal afterwards and feels pretty dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy in his late teens, and this works pretty well on helping clean your face of excess oil.</li>
            <li> I have been clear of blackheads.</li>
            <li> It is the only face wash I&#x27;ve found that really helps to keep me clear.  </li>
            <li> I have very stubborn blackheads, and this product is about the only thing that I have found that will help get rid of them and clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> but it has not made me clear.</li>
            <li> I use this for a daily wash and it really keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> It has undoubtedly enhanced my skin care products and the balance, texture and look of my (now) clear skin.</li>
            <li> I hope that this helps someone who is looking to make their skin balanced, clear, tightened, admirable and youthful.  </li>
            <li> Keeps pores clear without over drying.</li>
            <li> It keeps the skin clear in between peels.</li>
            <li> It helps me maintain clear skin.</li>
            <li> I let my sister try it , she also has oily skin that is prone to breakouts, and it helped to clear her pores too.  </li>
            <li> - my skin is clear and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne, melasma, and milia.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer getting facials all that often, however, I still use this salicylic gel wash at least 2-3 times a week and more often in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I have combination and mildly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it daily, but I really like the way my skin feels after I use it</li>
            <li> So far im liking this product.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily t-zone with very big pores on nose and cheeks and this product is not helping neither to reduce oiliness nor pore reduction.</li>
            <li> Has already healed old acne scars.</li>
            <li> And I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My only quarrel with this product is that, it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I want it to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with adult acne.</li>
            <li> but it is definitely far stronger than anything you&#x27;d find at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t have hyper sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have oily t-zone and have suffered adult acne all my adult life.</li>
            <li> It works as sold its to early to know details.</li>
            <li> Until recently I realized, it really is...</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, watch out.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works very well as a deep cleanser in a weekly regimen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 years old, and find that I still have a combination oily/normal  skin.  </li>
            <li> It probably took between 4 and 5 months of intensive therapy to clear out my face completely.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item along with the Peel for my Husband who has adult Acne.</li>
            <li> I have mature, combination normal/oily skin with acne on my cheeks and whiteheads on my nose</li>
            <li> I use a gentle hydrating toner and a regular oil skin moisturizer (Neutrogena).  </li>
            <li> im getting so far.</li>
            <li> Mostly natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Mostly natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling acne since my early teens.</li>
            <li> No issues so far.</li>
            <li> Also if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am 66 and continue to have oily combination sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It has caused me to be overly self conscious.</li>
            <li> embarrassing adult acne.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne (comodone acne)  </li>
            <li> i dont have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Although, she complained of it stinging and wasn&#x27;t able to tolerate it as well.  </li>
            <li> It just makes your skin feel so darn baby soft</li>
            <li> I did notice the redness of old scars has been reduced with using the cleanser,peel and hydrating lotion.</li>
            <li> One word of caution: use an old towel.</li>
            <li> so hoping my face gets clear completely and stays..</li>
            <li> If you know anything about facial care, a deep exfoliating cleanser is vital to success.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be thick peeing but noticeable for sure.</li>
            <li> The over the counter stuff is just not strong enough for me and most people with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This makes your skin tight and really clean.  </li>
            <li> After wash, skin felt tight and clean.</li>
            <li> This is my first year that I have made it through the holidays without a single breakout.  </li>
            <li> The only side effect that it has had when using it alone is that it makes my face super dry after cleaning it off but</li>
            <li> a great product just dont use it in combination with other acne fighting products because it might be too harsh on your face together with the other products.</li>
            <li> a great product just dont use it in combination with other acne fighting products because it might be too harsh on your face together with the other products.</li>
            <li> The results are subtle and get better over time.</li>
            <li> As someone in her early 40s with dry, sensitive skin, I didn&#x27;t think that this product would help much.</li>
            <li> it makes my face feel clean without harsh</li>
            <li> I use this a s a daily cleanser within my skin regime (which is mainly perscption creams, pills, and peels) to treat my cystic acne and over-production of candida cells.  </li>
            <li> If you have normal or sensitive skin, you may want to only use it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> So, my verdict : may use as a normal cleanser but not too frequent and definitely not daily.</li>
            <li> I re-order this all the time it last a long time and worth every penny for use in-between peels</li>
            <li> My skin is having a positive reaction (thank god) and beginning to dry out my blemishes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone struggling with daily acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I presume the high percentage of acid works the same in exfoliating as a scrub with particles.  </li>
            <li> then I suggest getting on accutane as soon as you possibly can because no cleanser can get deep enough into the skin to really help much with cysts.</li>
            <li> Finally I have found a cleanser that has helped my adult chin acne!!  </li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling smooth and less congested</li>
            <li> The bottle lasted a long time as you do not have to use much.  </li>
            <li> It has given me back my normal skin and my oily skin</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin relatively clear, but not acne free, you need something stronger to help substitute this every few weeks (like their facial peel).</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product, and I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry you up as much.</li>
            <li> So glad that a little goes a long way because my hubby and son are using it daily too.</li>
            <li> Another issue I&#x27;ve had with prior products is I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if something is going on with my skin that makes it unusual, but I can use this every single day, sometimes twice per day, with no drying and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Other than the fact that it is a small quantity and a little pricey, other than that a great product!  </li>
            <li> I get sunburns, and the occasional windburn, but makeup doesn&#x27;t usually bother me, and I don&#x27;t react to most facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> Other than that, these products work exactly as described</li>
            <li> That being said, I don&#x27;t have any major problems with my skin anymore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleaner for about 4 months now and have not had any major breakouts since.  </li>
            <li> It smells much like chemicals and made my skin very very dry.</li>
            <li> Helped to clear up my stubborn adult acne (along with other products prescribed by doctor) and use everyday to keep breakout free.</li>
            <li> I started seeing dermatologists when I was in high school and was given countless oral and topical medications to try.</li>
            <li> but I use it on the regular like twice a week to keep my glow And face clear.</li>
            <li> so I wash my face with a simple face wash for sensitive skin before using this product.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m in mid 30s, olive complexion and have rosacea - generally sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had to avoid sensitive areas, and only used it on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I came across this product by using the sorting options on Amazon to look for a facial cleanser with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> so I figured that I would replace it with an all natural facial cleanser like this one.</li>
            <li> I use it as a deep cleanser for my oily, acne prone, 36 year old skin.  </li>
            <li> I recently went of birth control, so my hormones are completely out of sync.</li>
            <li> so far big plus!!!</li>
            <li> Despite that, it hasn&#x27;t made my skin any worse... or any better.</li>
            <li> It is thorough and gentle enough not to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It helps wash off old dry skin and leaves my face really soft.</li>
            <li> Use a good moisturizer afterwards to avoid excessive drying of the skin if used daily, which I had a hard time not doing.</li>
            <li> Skin feels tight but a good youthful tight, not dry crocodile tight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the little extra time.</li>
            <li> My skin is used to products like this so, results might vary for other people and might be harsh if you haven&#x27;t used strong salicylic acid products before.</li>
            <li> I do have a very sensitive skin so if you have a sensitive skin, too, please try some other product.</li>
            <li> It is not too harsh and it leaves my skin clean and dry all day and night.</li>
            <li> During my trials, my skin would clear up and then to my chagrin, acne and hyper pigmentation would come roaring back to my face bigger and badder than before I tried to find something to help.  </li>
            <li> product in combination with the acid peel (by the same company) has completely rid my face of acne/old acne scars and facial discoloration.</li>
            <li> i would recommend it to my friends but it was solely my decision to make this into a daily facial cleanser, may not be recommended for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> In the first day(s) of use, the skin may react to the power of this product, by sensation or with a minimal dry patch (so protect against the onset of discoloration with sunscreen if this happens)</li>
            <li> And hey, I&#x27;ve only used up half of the bottle of peel and half the bottle of cleanser since I bought them both two months ago, so I&#x27;m looking at spending about forty bucks every four months - not a bad deal at all!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to keep it on your skin too long, or use it every day if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> It can be a little drying, especially on my chin, so I don&#x27;t always use the peel/wash on my chin area, but it has helped my jawline sooooooo much!</li>
            <li> Right now the small size lasts about a month</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels cleaner and pores are no longer very noticeable, with less redness just from use of the cleanser alone.  </li>
            <li> She has sensitive skin and this does not irritate or dry in any way.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have much effect on my red marks, but it somewhat calmed my acne down.</li>
            <li> If the price was just a little lower I would certainly issue 5 stars .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me completely breakout-free, but if I have a new zit, I will dab some of the cleanser on my dry face for a few seconds and then wet my clarisonic and really work it in.</li>
            <li> You can visibly see a difference after use - skin is tight and there is a glow to it, really.  </li>
            <li> I had suffered from very oily, acne prone skin as a teenager and a young adult, but as I aged (and especially after I had children), my skin began to dry out a little bit with some oil in the T-zone.  </li>
            <li> Some minor stuff around that time of the month, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li> However, I have over-active sebacious glands and as I&#x27;ve gotten older, my celluar turnover has slowed down.</li>
            <li> First time I used it I applied less quantity than suggested for half the time, the results were a very red and sensitive nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend their other products too!</li>
            <li> It really cleanses the skin with less then a dime-sized amount, so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it once every 4-5 days in fall/winter and every 2 days in the summer because it will dry your skin out if your not careful.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the results are real</li>
            <li> My pores look smaller, my skin is less oily and my skin is soft and it glows!  </li>
            <li> Made me have sandpaper-like skin which clear from afar but looked very rough in the sunlight and up close.</li>
            <li> Not sure it really does anything that regular soap doesn&#x27;t do..</li>
            <li> As such, I use this cleanser once a day - usually at night and really like the way it cleans - it seems to help with shrinking my pores and my acne, which has been a life-long problem, has been kept at bay.  </li>
            <li> Of course, there were other major, drastic modifications in my lifestyle that contributed to my now zit-less complexion (daily probiotics, strict vegan diet, drinking tons of water, wearing no makeup/</li>
            <li> I have the same results with this single one product and it only takes about a minute.</li>
            <li> Really clears skin without excessive drying, haven&#x27;t had a cystic pimple since I started using this cleanser</li>
            <li> Fast forward to this past month -- at 35</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally easy to use and doesn&#x27;t excessively irritate my average quality skin, but it does leave it a little red after use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products whose major component was salicylic acid</li>
            <li> I have tried various cleansers and my face still broke out or felt dry with non-comodogenic products too.</li>
            <li> BUT once the peeling process is over, my old acne marks decrease and become less noticeable</li>
            <li> Only thing is it does leave some dry spots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 41 old female who is half Chinese and half Mexican.</li>
            <li> Left my skin very dry after just one use.</li>
            <li> This product is not for daily use as will have your face very dry.</li>
            <li> However, it can be a little drying if you use it too frequent.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say to use it for a week prior to your peel, but I simply don&#x27;t plan out my peels but base it on a combination of free-time with nothing &#x27;social&#x27; coming up for several days (When the peel really works, it can be a bit embarrassing ;-) ).  </li>
            <li> My fine, mild, chin acne is now a painful, dry, red mess, and larger, tender bumps have started to form underneath the patches of dried skin.</li>
            <li> Although I love the product, I forked out the money for it when I was frantically and desperately trying to make my cystic acne go away.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested I use a salicylic acid wash on a daily basis for my recently developed (past year) hormonal acne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m experimenting with how long I rub it in and how often I use it to get the benefits without the dryness.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s strange but I like it.</li>
            <li> if you rub your face with this stuff to long you start to feel a burn/tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> Bottle lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and it lasts a long way.</li>
            <li> but it lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> It has a somewhat medicinal smell, but I wouldn&#x27;t care what it smells like as long as it helps me conquer the oily skin.  </li>
            <li> This was the dead, old skin coming off.</li>
            <li> This also works on my canine child as he is a true hairless Chinese Crested and the lower dosages works to unclog his pours, shrink his pours and keep from expensive vet bills for having clogged pours.</li>
            <li> but I would also like to note that my face is not entirely clear.  </li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend doing this to other people thinking of doing this as it left my skin really dry for about a week and left red blemishes on parts of my face when using this together with other acne fighting products.</li>
            <li> This was the one new variable after trying dozens of products over the past decade.</li>
            <li> Some people might experience dryness in the face when using this product but after reading some of the other reviews it seems to be pretty common.</li>
            <li> Some people might experience dryness in the face when using this product but after reading some of the other reviews it seems to be pretty common.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice daily, as I would any other face wash.</li>
            <li> When used with a couple of other products that I use on a daily basis, it helps to  keep pore size reduced.</li>
            <li> Other days I use a gentler cleanser - Collagen Facial Cleansing gel.  </li>
            <li> My only guess is that the reaction was due to either the dye, the scent, or both.</li>
            <li> The red blemishes will probably go away after 2 weeks of not using any products but my face still felt dry for about a week after using it together with other acne</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, you probably should not use this.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It does dry your face, so use lots of moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Some people experience dry skin when using this product</li>
            <li> Some people experience dry skin when using this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using the cleanser every day twice a day, but found that would dry my face out.</li>
            <li> Warning - This will dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> , it will dry your skin out, yes</li>
            <li> it seems make my face too dry within one week when I started to use this product.</li>
            <li> But my skin was dry afterwards so don&#x27;t apply a lot.</li>
            <li> If my skin is too dry</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s my skin out.  </li>
            <li> If you use it too often, it can seriously dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> But when I got pregnant with my 2nd child, my hormones went crazy and I started breaking out again and the facials weren&#x27;t enough anymore.</li>
            <li> It developed little bubbly rush all over my face!</li>
            <li> No new pimples have emerged.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single boil.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive oily skin that is really hard to treat with acne products because the products either make my face dry up, overproduce oil, or the chemicals are too harsh on the sensitive skin and create blemishes.</li>
            <li> I usually go to an anesthetist to get mine done professionally</li>
            <li> but i did some heavy hitting research on natural products, peels, befores and afters for other people.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is a little thick, so when you get down to the last few drops, you can add a little bit of water and get three or four more days out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> However, I have read that the salicylic acid is wasted in a cleanser as it does not stay on the skin long enough to have an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t put much thought into cleansers, so long as it didn&#x27;t make my acne worse.</li>
            <li> It stings a little, but not enough to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I also have relatively dry skin and tend to use this every other day in the evenings in addition to a milder soap on the off days and in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smells, but it stings badly and dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> Usually, during my morning shower, I blot my wet face with a towel and apply it to barely damp skin - to maximize the effect and longevity of the product - I also leave it on for a minute or so.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very soapy at all, almost no suds.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;ve spent hundreds over the years,</li>
            <li> but is a tiny bit harsh.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t any rough &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; to help exfoliation (i.e. apricot scrubs).  </li>
            <li> I have used the product for roughly a month with around 40 uses.</li>
            <li> Going to try using for a few weeks before  starting the peels.</li>
            <li> These products do not cause me to have blemishes, uneven or imbalanced skin; just the opposite.</li>
            <li> Well, I use it a few times a week as part of my daily regime.  </li>
            <li> Not too harsh for daily use.</li>
            <li> One needs to be careful to keep the cleanser away from lips, nose and eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this a few days</li>
            <li> um no thanks.</li>
            <li> This seriously decreased the amount of blackheads that I had and made my face much smoother.</li>
            <li> Prior to using it I would get fairly heavy breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for a few months between peels and sometimes as a daily cleanser.</li>
            <li> ; first I put this on dry face (I knownsounds weird but try it).</li>
            <li> I mean nothing has helped me fight adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out slightly in the beginning, so I only used it a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> and i break out easy even those annoying white heads</li>
            <li> I usually use this product once daily at night and use a moisturizing serum afterwards.</li>
            <li> of warning: don&#x27;t treat this like any other face cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use this product every other day.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I use in addition to other products and peels, however I can see the difference when I add this cleanser to my routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every other night for about a year now and on the nights that I don&#x27;t use it (proactiv)</li>
            <li> One bottle usually lasts me about a month, if I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I used as suggested by other viewers before applying Lactic acid and haven&#x27;t seen any results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this and their other products.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is actually clearing any acne, though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy residue like some of my other cleansers.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve used this twice daily for the past two months and have never had clearer skin.</li>
            <li> I use every other day.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day to maintain my skin.</li>
            <li> was that this product lathers where the other did not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and this cleanser cuts thru the oil and cleans thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I have replaced all of my other RX cleansers (that didn&#x27;t help) and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I used to get quite large, itchy, PAINFUL cystic acne on my face, especially on my jawline, but since my insurance has changed and no longer covers anything for half of the year, I certainly couldn&#x27;t afford to go to my dermatologist and spend hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on prescriptions (which were usually ineffective after a few months anyway) and face washes that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> However, it leaves your skin a little dry.</li>
            <li> Risne while face is very wet</li>
            <li> It will dry your face out so you need a heavy duty moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To heal my active acne, I use GSE 2% with Lysine ointment by Nutribiotics.  </li>
            <li> In the beginning I used it everyday, and within a day or 2 I had no new breakouts.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter and the dark spots are fading.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month now, at the beginning i could see the dark spots getting lighter, but now  i see no improvement&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do this on average of once a week</li>
            <li> but they are so much less huge and painful than before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing the 20% Salicylic acid peel every few days (maybe every three) and using this cleanser once every other day.</li>
            <li> It gives him a burning sensation on all the pimples n black head on face while appling it.</li>
            <li> Prior to using, I had hormonal pimples around my chin and also had a weird reaction to something which caused tiny pimples around my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and clogged pores and since I started using this, my skin is less oily throughout the day and my pores seem less congested.</li>
            <li> You eat healthier (less dairy, fried, processed food, etc)</li>
            <li> I have noticed that in the month of using this product, my skin has cleared up with less acne and less blackheads.</li>
            <li> I can feel it working (slight burning sensation)</li>
            <li> and now i have a black spot on my where i used it on.</li>
            <li> but it creates this slight peeling effect that clogs my pores</li>
            <li> So I typically use this once a day.</li>
            <li> I had cyst like acne-lots of white heads, thought to have been caused by being lazy and not washing my face twice a day as I usually do for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> It has gone up about $10 a bottle since I purchased it about a year and a half ago.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, I did had high expectations from this product.</li>
            <li> This product doesnt leave my skin feeling too tight..</li>
            <li> My pores are a little cleaner</li>
            <li> I added this to the powder and it foamed a little.  </li>
            <li> Also it can be a little drying to your skin.  </li>
            <li> Please keep mind that there&#x27;s a little cons..</li>
            <li> A little bit of a smell</li>
            <li> Then add a little water to my hands working into a lather.</li>
            <li> While doing this, my hands felt little pills of dead skin rolling into little balls.  </li>
            <li> I moisturize with pure cold pressed jojoba oil by Aura after.</li>
            <li> so I use it at night or if I&#x27;m not going out for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I also use the St. Ives face scrub in the mornings to scrub off the dead skin that the salicylic acid dried out...</li>
            <li> After browsing the reviews for this cleanser I decided to give it a shot and have been using it every few days since April.</li>
            <li> My skin is... complicate: Pores, blemish, uneven skin tone...</li>
            <li> I use this a few times a week switching with infinite skin cleansers.</li>
            <li> This product beats me scrubbing my face, sometimes unevenly, and its gentler.</li>
            <li> I notice I am not having a bunch of dried skin like I use to.</li>
            <li> and I can see the dead skin cells being wiped away.</li>
            <li> He still has a few pimples</li>
            <li> Use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> and i have not had any trouble since then.</li>
            <li> It has saved me a few doctors’ visits for the cysts, so this product is a winner.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a few times a week without it drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> And so I did another round of Accutane.</li>
            <li> And the next morning, my zit will have decreased in redness and size.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating Cleanser - Enhanced with Tea Tree Oil &amp; Green Tea Extract</li>
            <li> Cal. and years and years of struggling with blemishes, hyperpigmentation and uneven skin].  </li>
            <li> However, I think it should be used sparingly, and if you are going to get a chemical peel, use it a few days before, but not on the day of the peel.  </li>
            <li> it dried my skin out a lot)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> even bought it a few times then</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it everyday, I no longer have problem with clogged pores and acne flare-ups.</li>
            <li> for- since the skin is so dead and sapped moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have listened to my gut in the beginning when I was not comfortable with look and the smell of the product.  </li>
            <li> Now I use the cleanser a few times a week and the peel on the weekends if I don&#x27;t plan on being out in the sun.  </li>
            <li> It is not too harsh on my skin and it helps keep acne breakouts to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> Sounds harsh, and this might be for your skin</li>
            <li> It is a little harsh, so please don&#x27;t overuse it!</li>
            <li> but i hAve pretty bad acne.</li>
            <li> I wasted 30.00 on this product hoping it will work for me and sadly it didn&#x27;t I used this for a month and saw nothing a total waste</li>
            <li> I broke out really bad only my forehead and especially my chin!</li>
            <li> As soon as you start using it you feel this tingling sensation and started seeing results as little as two days!</li>
            <li> Needed very little product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it burned like crazy but my skin looked closer to clear</li>
            <li> My 14 year old who suffers from acne use it as well .</li>
            <li> not sure how well this works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what percentage of Salicylic Acid is used</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten any zits for the past two months.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t observe any of the excessive drying/peeling/whatever that reviewers warned about through overuse.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I feel it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side</li>
            <li> just started using  it ,not sure yet</li>
            <li> No more whiteheads</li>
            <li> I do like the feel of my face after using this product and usually use it about 2 - 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed to show my face and no more caked on makeup to cover it up.  </li>
            <li> AND this cleanser drastically reduces breakouts all over, and helps shed dead skin after few washes, I get them around my eyes, very thick skin, and that skin needs to be removed.</li>
            <li> I went through that crap for wayyyy too long and wish I ditched the harsh cleansers long ago and went on the accutane.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and hardly ever get cystic acne anymore.</li>
            <li> At 56 it is hard to know how to handle all these issues along with aging skin.  </li>
            <li> and I learned the hard way what I can&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li> I use it a couple times a week if my skin is looking dull or to chase away any lingering blemishes.  </li>
            <li> (I learned the hard way.)  </li>
            <li> No need to scrub hard.</li>
            <li> I used to use those &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; systems with three/ four steps that took at least 10 minutes out of my day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Esthetician in my late 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> [Also, always be mindful of how or if you [over] apply around the delicate under eye area].</li>
            <li> I drink at least 1.5L of H2O a day and take a probiotic.  </li>
            <li> This is serious stuff.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a serious cleanser.</li>
            <li> and the shipping charges was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> so I think I can get by using a less expensive cleanser than this and might not repurchase when I run out.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is bad about it is the price.  </li>
            <li> If I have a pimple that is starting to become painful, I use this cleanser two or three days in a row.  </li>
            <li> I am planning on ordering again when I run out - it does look like the price might have gone up a few $$ - or maybe I&#x27;m remembering wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have tough skin, I suppose.</li>
            <li> i know this facial soap is not meant to be used everyday, however, i had horribly(!!!)</li>
            <li> The smell is not great</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out in days and it even saw lightness from the acne spots that were on my skin.</li>
            <li> Since using this, I&#x27;ve barely broken out at all.</li>
            <li> and he turned my skin thin those areas even darker.</li>
            <li> Especially a few days before a peel....</li>
            <li> At 23 years old I decided to try this after reading its reviews for probably my biggest and worst breakout..</li>
            <li> I typically get nasty breakouts during the holidays, due to my lack of willpower when it comes to food, but this year I had nothing, not even one pimple!!  </li>
            <li> didnt help with my acne sadly.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this product didn&#x27;t anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> From inexpensive drugstore ones to expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> Sorry it couldn&#x27;t be a raving review like the ones I read when I bought it.</li>
            <li> and I had no idea that my crazy oily, acne prone skin would return as a result of the surgery.  </li>
            <li> Not like the crap you see on commercials that make false claims.</li>
            <li> Infinite Skin isn&#x27;t a bad product at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to anger the face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update when I get the chance</li>
            <li> This cleanser paired with the chemical peel is my preemptive strike, it saves me 1-2 weeks of painful breakouts.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s crazy talk!</li>
            <li> I need something to fight the acne itself and not just the scars :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two bottles, and will continue to use this as my base cleanser.</li>
            <li> He had really really bad acne and this combination worked !</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start getting acne until I was in my 20&#x27;s, and it has been terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works fast! Follow directions. Great results! Stings a little on the first few uses but after that its great. Lasted four months. Purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will fit perfectly to my needs. I am really very exited to use it, yay and happy</li>
            <li> This is a great product and very easy to use and it helps me control my acne</li>
            <li> This is an excellent deep cleaning cleanser... It does exactly what it promises to do.  Be sure to have your moisturizer ready.</li>
            <li> Caveat: Different skin, different results. This review is based on my experience. I have adult acne, melasma, and milia. I was hoping this cleanser could help with my skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I found this to be a very effective, exfoliating cleanser. I used it several times a week as a part of my evening routine. I always followed with a good moisturizer. Once a week, I followed with the chemical peel pads (also amazing!) to enhance the effectiveness. My skin felt tight and smooth after the treatment. It helped with my acne and also reduced the milia. I also liked the subtle scent of tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral: This product contains propylene glycol, an alcohol that normally irritates my skin. I am happy to say that my skin did not react although I did worry about the possibility. (http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/705315/PROPYLENE_GLYCOL/)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: At almost $7 per ounce, this cleanser is a bit pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I love this cleanser! I&#x27;ve tried many others but have never seen positive results like this. For me, it is worth the price!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see a different</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser for what I bought it for - not quite a peel, but better than soap.  It&#x27;s totally easy to use and doesn&#x27;t excessively irritate my average quality skin, but it does leave it a little red after use so I use it at night or if I&#x27;m not going out for a few hours.  It will last quite a while, too.</li>
            <li> I started out by first buying this as a pre-peel prep when I was having a lot of facial peels and microdermabrasions.  I&#x27;m no longer getting facials all that often, however, I still use this salicylic gel wash at least 2-3 times a week and more often in the summer.  I have combination and mildly sensitive skin.  I love how active it is and how good it works to keep blackheads and acne at bay.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.  It is aggressive, so be careful if you have extremely sensitive skin. Also, it may be best to start slow, wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it everyday at the beginning.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It works great for exfoliating the dead skin cells and renewing. It clears up any acne, helps with sun spots and sun damage, helps diminish wrinkles, and tightens pores. My skin looks younger brighter and renewed when used with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied , saw results on my face with an a week. I&#x27;m recommending it to my sister. My 14 year old who suffers from acne use it as well . It gives him a burning sensation on all the pimples n black head on face while appling it. It goes away as well pimples have within just a wk of use .</li>
            <li> So far the best face wash for acne prone skin. I have tried so many products but this wins the race. It is clearing up my blackheads and acne. It&#x27;s like magic in a bottle! I use is two to three times a week. My friend recommended it to me and I would recommend it to everyone with problematic skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve order this product a couple of times now, and I&#x27;m pleased with how it works.  Your skin definitely feels cleaner and healthier after using it.  Still have some breakouts, but I don&#x27;t expect any product to be 100% effective, 100% of the time.  And it&#x27;s powerful stuff, so I don&#x27;t use it daily, but I really like the way my skin feels after I use it and you can really feel that the exfoliating works.</li>
            <li> So far im liking this product. Make sure to put moisturizer on after use, makes skin very try and sensitive.</li>
            <li> love the product! Other than the fact that it is a small quantity and a little pricey, other than that a great product!  I had a really bad blackhead problem, but with the use of this, the sacilyic gel mask, and the gylcolic gel mask by Perfect Image.  I have been clear of blackheads.</li>
            <li> I dont feel like this did much for me. It smells much like chemicals and made my skin very very dry. Didnt do much !  Plus the bottle is tiny</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. THIS IS PRODUCT IS REALLY WORKING ON MY SKIN AFTER THAT I USED FOR 3 DAYS I CAN SEE AND FEEL MY SKIN IS DIFFERENT.  My skin is lighter ans clearer.  It is bit strong at first but after i used more than 2 weeks it&#x27;s fine on my skin.</li>
            <li> Really clears skin without excessive drying, haven&#x27;t had a cystic pimple since I started using this cleanser and I have tried everything from mall cosmetic counters to prescription cleansers from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell(something in between clorox and cleaning detergent). First time I used it I applied less quantity than suggested for half the time, the results were a very red and sensitive nose and cheeks. My skin looked burned but my pores did not looked totally clean, just only  the top layer was cleaned(same result I get from scrubbing with sugar but without the burning). From the very next day the treated area peeled off for a week. Waited three weeks before using it again, this time I applied the quantity and time suggested. It did not burned as much as the first time and I just peeled for a couple of days, but pores looked very much as the first time, they were clean just in the top layer. Third time I waited for a couple of weeks, but though the burning in my skin was less the results were the same: clean pores just in the top layer. Pore size didn&#x27;t reduced and results will last just for a day. I have a very oily t-zone with very big pores on nose and cheeks and this product is not helping neither to reduce oiliness nor pore reduction. I would never suggest to use this product days before a peel nor any type of dermabrasion. I don&#x27;t know if it is safe to expose treated area to the sun. Sorry, I did had high expectations from this product.</li>
            <li> good? but not a revelation</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product. I&#x27;ve tried a million different types of its kind and this one blows the rest out of the water.</li>
            <li> I had suffered from very oily, acne prone skin as a teenager and a young adult, but as I aged (and especially after I had children), my skin began to dry out a little bit with some oil in the T-zone.  Thankfully, it was nothing like my younger days.  Fast forward to this past month -- at 35 I had a septoplasty and I had no idea that my crazy oily, acne prone skin would return as a result of the surgery.  I was waking each morning and washing with my gentle cleanser that had been fine up until my surgery and my face returned to complete oil after hours.  I searched online reviews and found Perfect Image.  I went back and forth on whether to do the daily cleanser or this one and decided that since I was planning on doing peels as well, that I would get this one and I could always go back and buy the daily cleanser if I needed something else.  I don&#x27;t know if something is going on with my skin that makes it unusual, but I can use this every single day, sometimes twice per day, with no drying and no irritation.  The only time I lay off of it are the days following a glycolic peel.  It has given me back my normal skin and my oily skin is controlled pretty much all day, with just a dewy glow by the end of the day -- not a grease trap!  My acne has somewhat stabilized, but there is some improvement to new breakouts.  I&#x27;m still getting a pimple here and there, so this is not a total fix, but it&#x27;s a HUGE improvement.  I would recommend this to a friend and would use it again.</li>
            <li> This does nothing for my skin. Left my skin very dry after just one use.</li>
            <li> not sure how well this works. it&#x27;s not very soapy at all, almost no suds. but maybe it&#x27;s supposed to be that way?</li>
            <li> Great product. Gentle and works good.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff! I mix this with Aluminum Oxide Crystals once a week. It has really cleared up my skin! Has already healed old acne scars. This bottle will last a while since you only need to use a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now but I must say, I really love how smooth my skin is getting. Right now, I&#x27;m following the directions for the 5-7 days of use to prep for my at home peel, which will be tomorrow. My skin is no stranger to chemical peels. I usually go to an anesthetist to get mine done professionally but I&#x27;m currently going to an accelerated nursing school which doesn&#x27;t allot enough time for me to stay home for the healing process. So, this is a great product to manage my skin in between treatments. My skin clogs easily so, I needed something to facilitate removal of the all the dead skin keeping the bacteria inside the pores to wreak havoc.&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s too early to tell but so far, I have had no bad reaction to it. And I have sensitive skin. No new pimples have emerged. Prior to using, I had hormonal pimples around my chin and also had a weird reaction to something which caused tiny pimples around my cheeks and forehead. Made me have sandpaper-like skin which clear from afar but looked very rough in the sunlight and up close. I feel like this product helped smooth it out by sloughing off all the skin keeping those little buggers in and also flattened out those hormonal pimples. My face looks a lot brighter too.&lt;br /&gt;  My only quarrel with this product is that, it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I want it to so I wash my face with a simple face wash for sensitive skin before using this product. Salicylic acid penetrates better anyway when there is less oil on the face so in my opinion, I feel it would be fore effective to wash before using it. I know what you&#x27;re thinking. Cleanse your face before you cleanse your face?? That&#x27;s crazy talk! It gives it that clean feeling. And of course, moisturize after!! I usually use this product once daily at night and use a moisturizing serum afterwards. I also use the St. Ives face scrub in the mornings to scrub off the dead skin that the salicylic acid dried out... But I scrub ever so gently! Don&#x27;t want to anger the face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update when I get the chance but, so far so good. Keep in mind though! My skin is used to products like this so, results might vary for other people and might be harsh if you haven&#x27;t used strong salicylic acid products before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with adult acne. I started using salicylic products for several years but it never maintained 100%. Although the percentage isn&#x27;t published this is stronger than the 2% products sold in stores. Every now and again I get a stubborn one that I have to use a clay wash on  but this is usually good. I moisturize with pure cold pressed jojoba oil by Aura after. And I use SAL 3 soap in between as a daily, the combo is working.</li>
            <li> First off note that I am 27 years old, a male and suffer from adult acne. I&#x27;ve tried every possible product from benzoyl peroxide, to facial scrubs, facial masks, etc, the list goes on and on. Nothing, and I mean nothing has helped me fight adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product in combination with the acid peel (by the same company) has completely rid my face of acne/old acne scars and facial discoloration. I can&#x27;t stress enough how amazing this product is. Another issue I&#x27;ve had with prior products is I have VERY sensitive skin. The cleaner is extremely powerful so I definitely recommend using a high quality moisturizer after each cleaning (personally I use CeraVe Moisturizing cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product combined with the 20% gel peel will run you almost $60. But if you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;ve spent hundreds over the years, so what&#x27;s another $60? Especially when it&#x27;s the best cleaner/acne fighter on the market.</li>
            <li> I love using this product 1 - 2 times a week. It cleans deep and makes my skin look and feel so good. I would certainly recommend this product to anyone looking to further their beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start getting acne until I was in my 20&#x27;s, and it has been terrible. I&#x27;ve tried everything and haven&#x27;t been able to catch a break. After browsing the reviews for this cleanser I decided to give it a shot and have been using it every few days since April. My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but its a million times better. I don&#x27;t get terrible breakouts anymore (though I do get a pimple here and there), and my blackheads and whiteheads have cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning: don&#x27;t treat this like any other face cleanser. You don&#x27;t want to keep it on your skin too long, or use it every day if you have sensitive skin like me. I read everyone&#x27;s warnings, as well as the instructions on the bottle but after the first use I was so excited by the noticeable difference in my skin that I used it the next day as well. My face was visibly red and I had a burning sensation all day. So use with caution but definitely use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the peel yet, but I plan to order it soon.</li>
            <li> This wonderful facial cleanser had left my skin feeling clean and clear without any drying.  I use this salicylic cleanser morning and night.  My skin looks and feels cleaner and pores are no longer very noticeable, with less redness just from use of the cleanser alone.  I also use it in my skin care regimen to prep when using the 50% Lactic gel peel also purchased from the Perfect Image.  My skin now feels smooth, evenly exfoliated, and properly prepped for treatment.  I am pleased to have chose these products.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic about this product and now I am not!  My pores look smaller, my skin is less oily and my skin is soft and it glows!  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a week now and am happy I purchased this product!</li>
            <li> If you have really oily skin, this is great</li>
            <li> I use this product every other day. My skin is... complicate: Pores, blemish, uneven skin tone... whatever!&lt;br /&gt;But after everytime I use this cleanser, just &#x27;Clean&#x27;! Fresh enough! which I cannot find any products do the same job of such excellent exfoliating without scrubbles...</li>
            <li> I am just about finished with my first bottle. So far, my acne has calmed more and my skin is smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a product that will be maintained in my daily regimen in the future.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best medicated acne face wash I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is strong yet gentle on the skin at the same time. Even though it says it&#x27;s for pre-peel use, I actually use it as a daily face wash at night.  It is the only face wash I&#x27;ve found that really helps to keep me clear.  I&#x27;m not sure what percentage of Salicylic Acid is used but it is definitely far stronger than anything you&#x27;d find at the drug store.  I haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions at all or drying.  I would highly recommend this product for anyone struggling with daily acne breakouts.  It has greatly helped me. The only suggestion I have is that I wish they offered a larger size of this product for those of us who use it more frequently. Right now the small size lasts about a month but it would be great to not have to reorder so frequently.  Other than that, I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Overall, this brand is great. I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with this product though. It has a medicinal smell which I am not a fan of and cleanses really well but is a tiny bit harsh. Don&#x27;t use it in conjunction with anything that has a resurfacing element to it and you will be fine. I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t have hyper sensitive skin but it could irritate your skin if you do.</li>
            <li> I use in addition to other products and peels, however I can see the difference when I add this cleanser to my routine. It not over drying and my face feels so fresh and clean afterwards. If the price was just a little lower I would certainly issue 5 stars .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very happy customer of perfect image. I&#x27;m a 41 old female who is half Chinese and half Mexican. I have oily t-zone and have suffered adult acne all my adult life. Everyone said it would go away in my 20&#x27;s, hah! No such luck. Well I have to say this face wash works better than any over the counter or proactive product I&#x27;ve tried. I don&#x27;t know what the percent of salicylic acid is but it&#x27;s pretty strong. When I use this regularly it does a great job keeping my skin clear. If I have a breakout like when my cycle hits, the sister peel to this works great too. I&#x27;m excited to try some of the other peels as well.  DawnRachelle</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, it completely strips the skin of dirt and oil and really gives you that squeaky clean feeling. I have oily skin and clogged pores and since I started using this, my skin is less oily throughout the day and my pores seem less congested. I use this product twice daily, as I would any other face wash. It can be drying, so I suggest using a moisturizer after cleansing. I will definitely continue to buy and use this product.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser for my 66 year old, yet still oily, skin with clogged pore issues.  I use this as a regular cleanser every day - it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I use this a few times a week switching with infinite skin cleansers. This stings a bit more but works well and i will continue to buy</li>
            <li> It works as sold its to early to know details. Of how well. This should not bec a mandatory field.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I use it once every 4-5 days in fall/winter and every 2 days in the summer because it will dry your skin out if your not careful. Definitely use moisturizer after and your good. This was my 2nd bottle, and it lasts me almost 6 months, about to purchase another bottle. I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists since I was like 16 (now 31) and had always fought acne issues, yes had all kinds of prescriptions, nothing is perfect, scripts work for awhile then stops after few months or even a year. Until recently I realized, it really is...you are what you eat. You eat healthier (less dairy, fried, processed food, etc) AND this cleanser drastically reduces breakouts all over, and helps shed dead skin after few washes, I get them around my eyes, very thick skin, and that skin needs to be removed. Strongly recommended about to try there peel also.</li>
            <li> It works pretty better than any other major acne wash products in market; and it doesn&#x27;t irrate/over-dry your skin although it contains strong salicylic acid. Just make sure use it only twice a week maybe, and use sunscreen after each use. FYI nothing&#x27;s worthy full star rating, I am not really 5-star person, but the products good</li>
            <li> Product works great on my skin - my skin is very smooth and clean.  I have been using for 3 months now and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Definitely exfoliates, my skin feels very soft afterwards because it&#x27;s that fresh new layer of skin, but probably too fresh because it needs a few days to heal afterwards and feels pretty dry. I&#x27;m experimenting with how long I rub it in and how often I use it to get the benefits without the dryness.</li>
            <li> First day used, most of my acne had disappered. Really works. Waiting 5 days to use the facial peel.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible reaction to using this just 3 or 4 times, once a week. The skin on my eyelids and around my mouth got scaly, flaky, and irritated. It&#x27;s been just awful. If you have sensitive skin, watch out.</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the instructions this is a great product. I have very stubborn blackheads, and this product is about the only thing that I have found that will help get rid of them and clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works very well as a deep cleanser in a weekly regimen.  I&#x27;m 66 years old, and find that I still have a combination oily/normal  skin.  I use this to keep my pores clean.  When used with a couple of other products that I use on a daily basis, it helps to  keep pore size reduced.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a very similar product to Obagi CLENZIderm M.D. Daily Care Foaming Cleanser. I use it daily with a rotating facial brush.</li>
            <li> This product beats me scrubbing my face, sometimes unevenly, and its gentler. I notice I am not having a bunch of dried skin like I use to. I use it once or twice a week and it lasts pretty well because you don&#x27;t need to use much. The bottle is about the length of a woman&#x27;s hand. Do not put it near your eyes! I think its worth getting and I recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I used this as suggested which is 5 days before using my Salicylic  acid facial peel. This product seems to cause my face to shed dead skin cells right after I use it more then when I use the actual peel. That&#x27;s strange but I like it. After using it I use a Witch Hazel soaked cotton ball and I can see the dead skin cells being wiped away. My skin has a really nice healthy glow and I believe this product is helping with that. I will try to find this product somewhere else for a more reasonable price. It&#x27;s rather steep for the tiny amount you receive. I will continue to pay the price though if I can&#x27;t find this elsewhere. Oh, it is not over drying at all.</li>
            <li> I use this a s a daily cleanser within my skin regime (which is mainly perscption creams, pills, and peels) to treat my cystic acne and over-production of candida cells.  I absolutely love this cleanser and feel that it really helps with cleaning out my pores and giving my face a fresh feeling while helping it to also look better too.  I have noticed that in the month of using this product, my skin has cleared up with less acne and less blackheads.</li>
            <li> if you rub your face with this stuff to long you start to feel a burn/tingling sensation. of course you should put lotion on after. didnt help with my acne sadly.</li>
            <li> So of course I had high expectations based on all the 5 star reviews. I have been using this for about a month. I found this product to be a good cleanser but that&#x27;s about it.  I have very sensitive skin. I was really hoping that this stuff was as strong as others made it out to be but I never peeled once. I never even got red. My pores are a little cleaner but it has not made me clear. I only got a tingling feeling a couple times but never a burning sensation. I have been able to use this product as a daily cleanser. Hopefully with continued use I will get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It dried my skin out slightly in the beginning, so I only used it a couple times a week. But now my skin is accustomed to it and I use it daily. I have acne prone skin but this keeps it clear!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really super cleanser, my skin is fresh after using it and not so oily. i will surely but it again.</li>
            <li> I returned this. I don&#x27;t often return things, but I couldn&#x27;t WAIT to get this out of my house. This BURNED me, and I&#x27;m not talking ow ow this hurts my face, I&#x27;m talking this left red marks and welts and I only had it on for about 10 seconds!&lt;br /&gt;This is the kind of stuff that really ought to be applied by licensed cosmetologists!&lt;br /&gt;It took my face 3 days to recover, and I&#x27;m lucky I applied it on a Friday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me: I have mildly sensitive skin, and some adult acne (mostly T zone and chin line). I get sunburns, and the occasional windburn, but makeup doesn&#x27;t usually bother me, and I don&#x27;t react to most facial cleansers. I&#x27;m fair - no freckles and naturally small pores.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. I use daily and one bottle has lasted 6 months using a pea sized drop. Really gets face clean (even mascara) without over drying.</li>
            <li> Can be drying if used too often but it certainly helps exfoliate and reveal new skin. Perfect for use prior to peels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every other night for about a year now and on the nights that I don&#x27;t use it (proactiv) I wish I could!!  I love the smell, love the tingle and love the way it leaves my skin.  I might be able to get away with just using it and giving up my proactiv but my skin stays really good with this regimen so I&#x27;m sticking with it.  I&#x27;m 50+ and have really oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best acne facial wash you will ever use! If you have dry skin, you probably should not use this. However, I have over-active sebacious glands and as I&#x27;ve gotten older, my celluar turnover has slowed down. Too much oil + dead skin cells sticking around &#x3D; heinous cystic acne. I use this every day and hardly ever get cystic acne anymore. I still get ocassional whiteheads, but they are the tiny kind you can pop and then disappear the next day. One bottle usually lasts me about a month, if I use it daily. I order two bottles at a time so I don&#x27;t have to wait for delivery when I run out. The cleanser is a little thick, so when you get down to the last few drops, you can add a little bit of water and get three or four more days out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Perfect Image has great products, but this one is not one of them. It doesn&#x27;t really do the job. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel after using it. After giving it several weeks of trial, it  ended up laying in my drawer and I am back to the Obagi Foaming Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for over six months, twice a day with my Clarisonic Aria, and I am sticking with it. It really cleans better than the typical salicylic acid cleansers I tried before (Neutrogena, Phisoderm, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has played a part in preventing acne breakouts. I haven&#x27;t gotten any zits for the past two months. Of course, there were other major, drastic modifications in my lifestyle that contributed to my now zit-less complexion (daily probiotics, strict vegan diet, drinking tons of water, wearing no makeup/no sunblock/no moisturizer on my face at all) but I can sincerely say that this cleanser has played a part in keeping me zit-free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product weekly for about a month now, but don&#x27;t see much difference in my skin.  Also, had no peeling what so ever.  Might try the next step up.</li>
            <li> This is one the best pre-peels. I use it before lactic or TCA peels because it really opens my pores up. I also use it a couple times throughout the week to help prevent acne.</li>
            <li> Face feels fresh, and clean after cleaning with this. I do notice &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; pimple reduction. And as a man notice the smell is not over powering.</li>
            <li> I kind of like it, but it maybe a little strong for the acne start scarring. It tends to rip off the scar and leave red skin.&lt;br /&gt;Despite this, the product is good for peeling treatment.</li>
            <li> great product as a prep for main peel. But I end up using main level 2 peel.  My sensitive acne-prone skin very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I use this for a daily wash and it really keeps my skin clear. It is recommended for use before peels or photofacials.</li>
            <li> Really good product to use to prepare your skin for a peel</li>
            <li> This cleanser works wonderfully! I don&#x27;t use it daily, but rather save it to use just before applying my Bentonite clay mask, or before a special event or photo shoot. It makes a noticeable difference in the size of my pores and clarity of my akin after each use. It is a little harsh, so please don&#x27;t overuse it! Be sure to apply a nice serum or moisturizer afterward.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> this is a great product to have if you have acne problems.  I have been using this product for  the pass 6 months and have had good result so far.</li>
            <li> I have monthly breakouts and have tried everything from masks, changing make-up, diet, not washing my face, washing my face a lot, and everything in between. This cleanser paired with the chemical peel is my preemptive strike, it saves me 1-2 weeks of painful breakouts.</li>
            <li> have been used for 4 month. did not work at all</li>
            <li> My son has been using this product for about 18 months. For the first year, we also did thye salicylic acid peel twice a month. He had really really bad acne and this combination worked ! He still has a few pimples but they are so much less huge and painful than before.  Now we need to take care of some of the scarring. This is a great face cleaner that doesn&#x27;t strip his skin too dry. I am sure he will continue using it for the next year or so.</li>
            <li> Product is very strong and gives you a real deep clean in your face. No scrubbing with this though as it is plenty string on its own just to be gently massaged into. Your face and neck with your fingers.  Rinse with cool or warm water and you&#x27;ll come away clean an refreshed!</li>
            <li> This cleanser (along with Avene creams with glycolic acid) changed my face. It probably took between 4 and 5 months of intensive therapy to clear out my face completely. I still keep using this cleanser for prophylactic once a week only as it dries up the skin. After 2 years of using it I&#x27;ve never had a breakout. This stuff is AMAZING. I&#x27;ve never had such a clean face in my life.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it is one of those products that actually works. Not like the crap you see on commercials that make false claims. I highly recommend this product for women and men.</li>
            <li> Great product in that it draws out and acne to the surface in preparation for the Salicylic Acid peel.  I am starting the peel process now so cant say the final results.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is the BEST cleanser ever... I use it even if I am not going to apply a peel to my face. I had to use it once a day, due to the fact that it is very strong. I would recommend !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and works well to treat my acne and breakouts. It is strong and can lead to dryness so I alternate between this and another cleanser.</li>
            <li> I used as suggested by other viewers before applying Lactic acid and haven&#x27;t seen any results.&lt;br /&gt;It has a good smell.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the product was anything spectacular.  After rereading all the &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; (no pun intended) reviews, and comparing them to the results I saw on myself, I began thinking a lot of the reviews were either left by employees or friends of the owner(s) of either or both the product manufacturer and the seller (if they&#x27;re separately-owned businesses).  My skin is pretty sensitive and I didn&#x27;t observe any of the excessive drying/peeling/whatever that reviewers warned about through overuse.  OTOH, I didn&#x27;t experience any of the positive effects of usage that many mentioned in their reviews, either.  I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> I tried the skin peel using my regular cleanser and it worked okay but after I used this recommended cleanset and the results were outstanding. This combination worked better than the expensive peels my dermatologist have me. I get lots of compliments about my glowing complexion.</li>
            <li> I rated this cleanser a five star because I love the way it leaves my skin. I have been using this product for about 6 weeks. This product has helped diminish by brown spots from my face and makes my face so much smoother.</li>
            <li> This peel when used according to the direction  is a fantastic peel for acne skin. Salicylic acid is great to clean up acne prone skin. Left my skin feeling smooth and less congested</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy in his late teens, and this works pretty well on helping clean your face of excess oil. Keeps my skin relatively clear, but not acne free, you need something stronger to help substitute this every few weeks (like their facial peel). I use this gel every day with a dime size squirt and have had the same bottle for about 4 months. Personally, I feel it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side but you have to pay for what works. It&#x27;s also a hell of a lot more convenient. I used to use those &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; systems with three/ four steps that took at least 10 minutes out of my day. I have the same results with this single one product and it only takes about a minute.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin bright and clean.</li>
            <li> Ingredients on the bottles is requested. Other than that, these products work exactly as described, I have several of this company&#x27;s &amp;#34;Perfect Image&amp;#34; line and they all work very well with an ok cost, about average pricing. I tend to throw the boxes away once opened so when I use the product, often times I am unsure which percentages I am using so I have to refer to my Amazon orders, way back, to check and deduce to figure it out. Once I know, I know how to use it and why, these are excellent and they do sting if you&#x27;re not careful. Cool water on-hand is important, however, this system got rid of my adult acne/breakouts and continues to keep my skin clear. This also works on my canine child as he is a true hairless Chinese Crested and the lower dosages works to unclog his pours, shrink his pours and keep from expensive vet bills for having clogged pours. If you have a hairless Chinese Crested, I recommend the mild percentages from &amp;#34;Perfect Image&amp;#34;. Thanks Perfect Image, LLC !</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m in mid 30s, olive complexion and have rosacea - generally sensitive skin. I have tried various cleansers and my face still broke out or felt dry with non-comodogenic products too. I started using this a while back (i&#x27;m about to go on my third bottle) and it has improved my skin routine greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is totally clean with this, it&#x27;s gentle and has actually help diminished scaring caused from the severe rosacea that I had over last summer.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product, as well as the salicylic acid peel and the glycolic acid peel.  I  have been highly satisfied with the quality of every purchase.  Additionally, they each come with very clear instructions for use, which is good because these are potent products.  However, if you use them as recommended, the results are excellent.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday. Helped to clear up my stubborn adult acne (along with other products prescribed by doctor) and use everyday to keep breakout free.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. My face has never been smoother and it definitely helps reduce blemishes. I would highly recommend this to anyone who struggles with adult acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Perfect image products for 6 months now and really love them. I would recommend this and their other products. I have purchased a few of there items and I really love the way it makes my skin feel.  well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this and I am super pleased with it. I use it every morning after St Ives Apricot Scrub. My skin feels great after and it certainly has stopped me breaking out. I&#x27;m in menopause and my skin, which never broke out in my teens, had suddenly become a bit acne prone. I don&#x27;t know if everyone could use this daily but it works for me. Maybe every other day would be best for some depending on skin type.</li>
            <li> I wanted something for the enlarged pores on my nose.  I&#x27;m over 60 and this is something new I haven&#x27;t had to deal with... I love all their other products so I thought I would give this a try. I used it on my cleansing brush..immediately I loved how it cleaned.  I have dry skin and this is very drying but what I was look for to shrink pores.  I keep Aztec clay and Pineapple enzyme powder mixed on my counter.  I added this to the powder and it foamed a little.  I applied the mask to my nose and the results were incredible.  You could tell right away...pores that stay no matter what...weren&#x27;t so deep.  This is serious stuff.  Don&#x27;t do what I did...I got too excited and used too much.  Not necessary.  Great cleanser and I do let it sit a bit on my problem areas.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday and I&#x27;m glad I have it to keep these enlarged pores at bay. Wished it smelled yummier but...it&#x27;s a serious cleanser.</li>
            <li> Bought this to prepare my face for a Salicylic Acid peel from Perfect Image. I can feel it working (slight burning sensation) when I apply it, but my only draw back is that you have to use more than the directed dime sized amount to get it to foam/lather up.  Sometimes I use the cleanser as a wash by itself and it works fine.  Because there is a higher content of acid in this face wash it will dry your face more than usual after the wash; it&#x27;s very important to moisturize after.  There aren&#x27;t any rough &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; to help exfoliation (i.e. apricot scrubs).  I presume the high percentage of acid works the same in exfoliating as a scrub with particles.  I would recommend this product to friends/family and I plan on buying it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I use it every night and everyone who&#x27;s used mine, buys their own bottle!! That alone says a lot!</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life. At first, my skin could only take the product for about 15 seconds and I had to quickly rinse off. I really had to build up my skin tolerance. But even after the first use, I could tell that my skin was smoother and clearer. Now I use it about twice a week which is perfect for my skin. In addition to this, I&#x27;ve had lower incidence of flare-ups during &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34;.  And, I&#x27;ve even convinced my husband to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have oily skin and use to get boils a couple of times a months. Since I have been using this I haven&#x27;t had a single boil. Because I have oily skin I use it almost everyday. If you have normal or sensitive skin, you may want to only use it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well for Rosacea and acne. Evens out my Irish complexion better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. The results are subtle and get better over time.</li>
            <li> I know it is for men but i used it and it worked. The only thing is that &#x27;follow the instructions on the bottle&#x27;. I let it stay for more than the allowed time and now i have a black spot on my where i used it on. I started using it as instructed and i have not had any trouble since then.</li>
            <li> Repeat buyer here!  I have large pores and acne scars along with the occasional breakout.  At 56 it is hard to know how to handle all these issues along with aging skin.  This cleanser used just a couple of times a week has kept me acne free for almost a year.  It is a great deal for the price because a little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> just started using  it ,not sure yet</li>
            <li> As someone in her early 40s with dry, sensitive skin, I didn&#x27;t think that this product would help much. I purchased it more for my teenage son than for myself. However, it had such good reviews and I love other Perfect Image products, so I thought to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months now (around twice a week) and all I can say is WOW! My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was 25. Clear with smooth texture. I use the Perfect Image moisturizer too and I think the combo of them together has made all the difference. This is one product I will use over and over.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item along with the Peel for my Husband who has adult Acne. He started used both these items &amp; his skin has significantly improved. He is very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I would just like to say that I have now been using this product for about 6 months, and I have noticed a significant difference not only in my face, but most importantly in my back. I read all of the reviews, and was excited to try this, because everything spoke so highly of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a little nervous to start using it because I do have very sensitive skin, and many things react. I also have relatively dry skin and tend to use this every other day in the evenings in addition to a milder soap on the off days and in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part about this product, is not only the fact that it helps improve acne, but also leaves your skin feeling extremely \\&quot;squeaky clean.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope all of you share a similar experience and enjoy it as much as I have and will continue to!</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the 20% salicylic acid chemical peel. I had to avoid sensitive areas, and only used it on my forehead and cheeks. After three washes my skin looked amazing. I no longer have acne, but I do have scars and they are noticeably improved already.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and blotchy skin so I have been trying many products. This by far has been the best. You can really feel it working, after using this product for a month I noticed the brown spot on my cheek was gone. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This product confuses me so much I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. I use it twice a week but it creates this slight peeling effect that clogs my pores BUT once the peeling process is over, my old acne marks decrease and become less noticeable so I don&#x27;t know what to do. I need something to fight the acne itself and not just the scars :(</li>
            <li> Love this product. Since 2013 I have been on a mission to find the right cleansing/moisturizing/treatment routine for my skin.  I have mature, combination normal/oily skin with acne on my cheeks and whiteheads on my nose plus I have cystic acne.  I learned my skin is more sensitive than I ever thought and I learned the hard way what I can&#x27;t use.  During my trials, my skin would clear up and then to my chagrin, acne and hyper pigmentation would come roaring back to my face bigger and badder than before I tried to find something to help.  Out of all that I learned what I can use and Salicylic Deep Gel Exfoliating is now a staple for me. This is one of my cleansers and I use it every three days.  It helps to keep my outbreaks under control.  If I have a pimple that is starting to become painful, I use this cleanser two or three days in a row.  For me, this is the only treatment I need for now for my cystic pimples and they clear up quickly (3 – 4 days).  Far better than a doctor’s visit.  Other days I use a gentler cleanser - Collagen Facial Cleansing gel.  These two together work in conjunction to keep my face clean without abusing my skin.  I imagine it is the tea tree in salicylic cleanser that helps me.  The smell is not great but I don’t like the smell of tea tree anyway.  I use a dime size amount and depending on the oiliness of my skin, I either use my cleansing brush or my hands to wash my face.  I use a gentle hydrating toner and a regular oil skin moisturizer (Neutrogena).  I also use a very mild peel 2X a month.  I do not use this cleanser on a day that I use the peel.  The two together are a little strong for me.  When I purchased the cleanser, it was not labeled as a “Pre-Peel”.  So now my second purchase (with coupon), my cleansing routine will remain the same even though the name of the product has changed.  I gave it a 5 but I would also like to note that my face is not entirely clear.  No more whiteheads EVER but blackheads show up from timeto time.  I don’t expect the cleanser to do the whole job by itself.  I do know this cleanser keeps the cysts at bay also.  It has saved me a few doctors’ visits for the cysts, so this product is a winner.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am very impressed with how smooth my face felt after just a few uses.  I had a glow that I haven&#x27;t had in years.</li>
            <li> It works great so long as I use it two times a day and not a few times a week as it suggests.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use as a prep for an at home peel.  Seemed to work pretty good  and I continued to use it after the peel when I had breakouts and it worked well on my breakouts as well.  The bottle lasted a long time as you do not have to use much.  Also it can be a little drying to your skin.  I will purchase again</li>
            <li> Funky smell in a way, electric blue color?  Not sure it really does anything that regular soap doesn&#x27;t do..</li>
            <li> Yes indeed both Mother and Son are using the same product with great results. We both like it because it deep cleans but not does try our skin out. It is a great product to use at least 3 times per week. When I am preparing for a chemical peel I wash face my daily with the cleanser.</li>
            <li> So I honestly believe that I had a major reaction to this product! It almost looked like it burned my skin! It developed little bubbly rush all over my face! I might say that it&#x27;s just probably my skin, but make sure to check the product first behind your ear for sensitivity because it is very powerful</li>
            <li> This makes your skin tight and really clean.  I have been using it a few times a week without it drying out my skin. I have oily skin to begin with so this is helping.  I also make sure to use it prior to using the Perfect Image Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel treatment.  I believe the peel will work better when the face is squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It does dry your face, so use lots of moisturizer.  I am not sure if it is actually clearing any acne, though.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY cleanser that has controlled my breakout and cystic acne without drying out my skin. Can&#x27;t imagine my skin care without this now... love it!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent cleanser.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy residue like some of my other cleansers.  I use this with the clarisonic brush.  Bottle lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for roughly a month with around 40 uses. It didn&#x27;t have much effect on my red marks, but it somewhat calmed my acne down. However, I have read that the salicylic acid is wasted in a cleanser as it does not stay on the skin long enough to have an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice a day and it did not make my skin any drier or irritated. I have tough skin, I suppose. I have really oily skin (must blot skin every 2 hours or so).</li>
            <li> I love how deep cleansing this cleanser is. I use it twice a week with my clarisonic and it keeps my oily skin in check and provides a nice mild exfoliation that keeps my skin looking luminous all week. I don&#x27;t think I could ever live without this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser on alternate days for several weeks now. This makes my oily, combination skin feel really squeaky clean, but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement in my clocked pores and minor breakouts. It is slightly drying, so it is essential to follow with a good moisturiser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Esthetician in my late 30&#x27;s and I LOVE this cleanser. It controls any breakouts and keeps my skin looking young and healthy without being overly drying. I use it often during the summer and cut back to twice a week during the winter. It also pairs nicely with my Clarisonic. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Skin feels amazing after using this. Haven&#x27;t tried the peel yet. Going to try using for a few weeks before  starting the peels.</li>
            <li> Love love love this cleanser!  I have very oily acne prone skin and this is by far the best cleanser i have ever used.  My skin feels so clean and refreshed and it has reduced my breakouts.  It is a strong cleanser, but thats what i love, finally a cleanser that has enough salicylic acid in it to actually do something for your acne.  The over the counter stuff is just not strong enough for me and most people with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect for weekly maintenance!</li>
            <li> I came across this product by using the sorting options on Amazon to look for a facial cleanser with all natural ingredients. I have been using a product called \\&quot;the regimen\\&quot; by acne.org which comes with a facial cleanser, a treatment bottle, and a moisturizer. I didnt like the facial cleanser that came with the regimen so I figured that I would replace it with an all natural facial cleanser like this one. The problem was that the regimen is applied twice a day (in the morning and before going to bed), this product can only be used once every 2-3 days. So I figured that I would use this facial cleanser every 2-3 days along with my regular treatment bottle and moisturizer from the regimen. I wouldnt recommend doing this to other people thinking of doing this as it left my skin really dry for about a week and left red blemishes on parts of my face when using this together with other acne fighting products. The red blemishes will probably go away after 2 weeks of not using any products but my face still felt dry for about a week after using it together with other acne products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product alone though worked very well, I noticed results after the first day. I have sensitive oily skin that is really hard to treat with acne products because the products either make my face dry up, overproduce oil, or the chemicals are too harsh on the sensitive skin and create blemishes. This product felt like a thousand needles on my face every time I used it until it dried off but its really effective when used alone, some of the pimples that I had under my skin faded almost completely away after 3 uses and some of the tougher pimples shrank after the 3rd use. The only side effect that it has had when using it alone is that it makes my face super dry after cleaning it off but its worth the hassle for the great results that im getting so far. Dont go overboard on using the product though, you have to give your face time to heal so its best to use the product once every 3 days or so (the bottle suggest once every 2-3 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;- Really strong, you will see results really quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to apply, clear instructions&lt;br /&gt;- Mostly natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;- Some people experience dry skin when using this product&lt;br /&gt;- Too strong when used in combination with other acne products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;Its a great product just dont use it in combination with other acne fighting products because it might be too harsh on your face together with the other products. Some people might experience dryness in the face when using this product but after reading some of the other reviews it seems to be pretty common. The results have definitely been worth putting up with the dryness for me, just be sure to give your skin time to heal and dont use it too often (use it once every 3 days).y 3 days or so (the bottle suggest once every 2-3 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;- Really strong, you will see results really quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to apply, clear instructions&lt;br /&gt;- Mostly natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;- Some people experience dry skin when using this product&lt;br /&gt;- Too strong when used in combination with other acne products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;Its a great product just dont use it in combination with other acne fighting products because it might be too harsh on your face together with the other products.

            <li> I have been using Cetaphil for a couple years now but decided to try this cleanser to use prior to applying a peel.  I couldn&#x27;t get over how smooth and clean my face felt that I decided to use it daily.So glad that a little goes a long way because my hubby and son are using it daily too. I&#x27;m very happy with the products that I have purchased from Perfect Image.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Will give you a smooth sensation in your face.This product is not for daily use as will have your face very dry. twice a week works for me.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing!  I have acne-prone skin but since using this in combination with a peel, my skin has never looked clearer or better.  I will definitely be purchasing more for myself as well as for my 22yr old daughter who loves it as well.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, use it daily for control of my acne prone skin. I hope they never discontinue it! I also alternate between the TCA and Salycylic peels which have Greatly improved my skin over the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and it lasts a long way. She has sensitive skin and this does not irritate or dry in any way. It helps her with any breakouts and she has been very happy with it</li>
            <li> pretty good facial peel, be careful dries you out. Will burn a bit too.. make sure to moisturize!</li>
            <li> Sadly, this product didn&#x27;t anything for my skin. After much research and reading all the reviews I thought I found a &amp;#34;keeper&amp;#34;. NOT!</li>
            <li> Great product! As soon as you start using it you feel this tingling sensation and started seeing results as little as two days! I have tried all types of acne products from the stores to as seen on T.V. from price ranges to $1 to $100 but who would of thought this bottle would have made the difference. I haven&#x27;t broken out in days and it even saw lightness from the acne spots that were on my skin. Only thing is it does leave some dry spots but I found using the product with a scrub to remove the dry skin, and then leaves your skin smooth and soft as if I just received a facial. You only need a pea size amount to work up a good lather and removes oil and shine for hours and leaves your skin feeling a little tighter too hopefully prolonging any winkles. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Totally recommend! I have acne on my cheek bones.. I have enlarged pores and they scar. I use this before and after my peel and it makes my skin smooth and look great!</li>
            <li> Perfect cleanser for pre_peel. However, it leaves your skin a little dry.</li>
            <li> I have to admit it&#x27;s very hard to understand why this product would be so far superior to others with very similar ingredient profiles (particularly the primary ingredient, salicylic acid). Bottom line - this stuff works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried for mild-moderate acne, both for prevention and treatment (including prescription-strength Benzoyl Peroxide &amp; Salicylic acid formulations). The exfoliating properties are obvious both in terms of leaving skin appearing more fresh and in the very gentle peeling that accompanies use of this wash after only a few days. I used this without added use of any peels and, in spite of this, still had some superficial peeling without any redness/flakiness (actually experienced the peeling during washing). Gentle even on very sensitive skin. Bottom line: I&#x27;ve used this twice daily for the past two months and have never had clearer skin. This was the one new variable after trying dozens of products over the past decade. I will be buying this for years to come.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen an improvement. For me, this formula is a bit drying to use 2x/day, even 1x/day is too much. I use every other day. I can&#x27;t say I would purchase it again, I will likely be using for another brand/formula.</li>
            <li> As everyone&#x27;s skin is different, just to give you some background on mine....I have oily, acne-prone skin that&#x27;s also starting to age (I&#x27;m 38). I&#x27;ve been battling acne since my early teens. I started seeing dermatologists when I was in high school and was given countless oral and topical medications to try. Nothing worked until I tried Accutane in college. It cleared up my skin entirely, but it did come back. And so I did another round of Accutane. I was good for several years and stopped seeing dermatologists entirely, but started getting facials regularly in my 30s. Accutane and extractions are the only things that ever made a difference in my skin. But when I got pregnant with my 2nd child, my hormones went crazy and I started breaking out again and the facials weren&#x27;t enough anymore. So I started trying different products.....  Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried so many different cleansers. From inexpensive drugstore ones to expensive department store brands. Either they made me break out more, and it just didn&#x27;t make any difference. So I didn&#x27;t put much thought into cleansers, so long as it didn&#x27;t make my acne worse. Until I tried Perfect Image&#x27;s Pre-Peel Salicylic Deep Gel Exfoliating Cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t make me completely breakout-free, but if I have a new zit, I will dab some of the cleanser on my dry face for a few seconds and then wet my clarisonic and really work it in. My skin feels sooo good afterwards. Pores look smaller. Skin feels tight but a good youthful tight, not dry crocodile tight. And the next morning, my zit will have decreased in redness and size. LOVE this cleanser. I bought this back in mid April and it&#x27;s lasted me through the end of August. I&#x27;ve tried using the cleanser every day twice a day, but found that would dry my face out. So I typically use this once a day. I alternate with Cerave&#x27;s cleanser for oily skin.  UPDATE - I went back to see a dermatologist to get some Retin-A, since that is supposed to help with both acne &amp; anti-aging. I&#x27;m using 0.025% Retin-a every night now so I&#x27;ve found that my skin cannot tolerate using this cleanser every day with Retin-a. I still love this cleanser though, so I still use it 1-3 times a week depending on how my skin&#x27;s doing. About to order my 3rd bottle.</li>
            <li> Not the best smelling face wash but definitely cleans better than any brand I&#x27;ve used before! I used this first then the glyolic acid peel then the after lotion. Great bundle!</li>
            <li> pretty good on its own; the peel was too strong for me, so I used this as a milder version</li>
            <li> Very good product, recomended to my friends. It cleans the skin and get ride of pimples. I recomended to my friends</li>
            <li> worked great, an excellent buy. This wonderful facial cleanser had left my skin feeling clean and clear without any drying. I use this salicylic cleanser morning and night. My skin looks and feels cleaner and pores are no longer very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else! I LOVE&amp;#60;LOVE&amp;#60;LOVE this product .This is a great line and have never ever had a problem!! I cant wait to get the next shipment! I REALLY LOVE IT! Smells and feels good and fresh!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It agrees with my skin. No problems with it and it is making a nice difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is really helpfull for acne. It is much more stronger than the your normal 2% Salicylic cleanser and it doesn&#x27;t dry you up as much. The only thing that i would request will be if the seller could put the % of Salicylic Acid on the bottle or on the description. I don&#x27;t know what it is I just know is greter than 2%.</li>
            <li> I do a chemical peel about every 3 weeks and came across this pre-peel cleanser.  The instructions say to use it for a week prior to your peel, but I simply don&#x27;t plan out my peels but base it on a combination of free-time with nothing &#x27;social&#x27; coming up for several days (When the peel really works, it can be a bit embarrassing ;-) ).  As such, I use this cleanser once a day - usually at night and really like the way it cleans - it seems to help with shrinking my pores and my acne, which has been a life-long problem, has been kept at bay.  I just ordered my second bottle, so can easily recommend this for those who do home/professional peels as well as those who just want a deeper clean that the salicylic acid provides.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a prewash to a tca peel. Per directions you use this for a week prior to prep the skin...but, day 1 after using it, people asked what I had done....&lt;br /&gt;: )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this now about 3 times weekly follow up with a good moisturizer and the peel is still under the sink....</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle.  I love this stuff.  People comment on how good my skin looks when I use it and I notice a big difference when I use 3 times a week.  I use it as a deep cleanser for my oily, acne prone, 36 year old skin.  It is a great exfoliation for troubled skin.  Last bottle lasted me ~ 8months.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B007004PZO Pre-Peel Salicylic Deep Gel Exfoliating Cleanser - Enhanced with Tea Tree Oil &amp; Green Tea Extract (Professional)]]First purchased this cleanser in Feb. 2013; I just ordered my second bottle (just as the first is about to run out). This product is excellent.  It has undoubtedly enhanced my skin care products and the balance, texture and look of my (now) clear skin. A tiny amount is all that you need.  How I use it: Usually, during my morning shower, I blot my wet face with a towel and apply it to barely damp skin - to maximize the effect and longevity of the product - I also leave it on for a minute or so.  In the first day(s) of use, the skin may react to the power of this product, by sensation or with a minimal dry patch (so protect against the onset of discoloration with sunscreen if this happens) [Also, always be mindful of how or if you [over] apply around the delicate under eye area]. These comments are not at all to alarm you, only to express my experience. That being said, regular 1x daily use, of a pinky-fingernail-size-amount is all I use.  You can visibly see a difference after use - skin is tight and there is a glow to it, really.  I will likely buy this time and time again.  My use rate is at ~ 4 months per bottle.  It is something special in my limited regimen of skin products.  If interested, my daily skin regimen consists of this product, the Rodan Fields anti-age/redefine or reverse line + sun block and topical pure hyaluronic acid [via amazon through Timeless Skin Care].  After 10 months of a commitment to use the Rodan Fields line 2x daily,[[ASIN:B0047AKVW6 Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure Refill 8 oz]] combined with 3-6 months using this product and the regular use of the topical pure hyaluronic acid, my skin is pretty much perfect, now, really! These products do not cause me to have blemishes, uneven or imbalanced skin; just the opposite. [This comes after a lifetime of living in So. Cal. and years and years of struggling with blemishes, hyperpigmentation and uneven skin].  {I came upon this cleanser as an initial step for the Pineapple Pumpkin Enzyme Skin Peel- Enhanced with Papaya Extract &amp; AHA [from Perfect Image], which I use rarely; The cleanser is recommended by perfect image for their pre-peel regimen.}  However, I love to use it daily.  I hope that this helps someone who is looking to make their skin balanced, clear, tightened, admirable and youthful.  PEACE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too wussy to use a chemical peel, but this is like a chemical cleanser.  I use it a couple times a week if my skin is looking dull or to chase away any lingering blemishes.  My face always looks brighter and clearer after, I&#x27;m pleased with the results!  No issues so far.</li>
            <li> My blemishes disappeared in 1 day, it&#x27;s a great exfoliator, my skin feels so smooth after it and no signes of any blemishes!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived just in time as promised&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product twice a day as my daily facial cleanser and it&#x27;s helped to manage my pimple breakout. Since using this, I&#x27;ve barely broken out at all. It really cleanses the skin with less then a dime-sized amount, so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Saw nothing no results my skin hasn&#x27;t gotten any better I wasted 30.00 on this product hoping it will work for me and sadly it didn&#x27;t I used this for a month and saw nothing a total waste</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic wash. It is great used as a skin prep before a peel is performed as it prepares the skin by deep cleansing and removing any bacteria and debris that causes breakouts.</li>
            <li> The purpose of this pre peel cleanser is to remove oil,dirt,dead skin cells,and prepare skin for the use of chemical peels. I used as directed: 5-7 days before using the peel. It really allowed me to get the maximum benefits out of my peel and helped clear up some acne as well!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I try to never run out.  Keeps pores clear without over drying.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. My face feels very clean after using it. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a week ago. Product is very good. Skin feels soft and clean after using it. No drying. I would recomend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> As the name implies, this is to be use before a chemical peel and also to maintain after a peel.  Well, I use it a few times a week as part of my daily regime.  I like how it makes my skin so clean, smooth and soft after using it to cleanse my face.  However, it can be a little drying if you use it too frequent.  So, my verdict : may use as a normal cleanser but not too frequent and definitely not daily.</li>
            <li> The best cleanser. Period. I&#x27;ve had two bottles, and will continue to use this as my base cleanser. Highly recommended for problem skin.</li>
            <li> The product is great for the listing price. It works without drying your face, and your face feels smooth and comfortable afterward.</li>
            <li> Great product for me to let my skin becomes better recommendation to buy, look forward to a better product.thank you</li>
            <li> This facial wash is a phenomenal product especially as a prep for peel.  I use this product two to three times a week even when not applying a peel.  It keeps the skin clear in between peels. Love this product and I&#x27;m preparing to place another order alongside the pineapple enzyme peel.</li>
            <li> FINALLY finally finally something that has helped me IMMENSELY! I&#x27;ve been doing the 20% Salicylic acid peel every few days (maybe every three) and using this cleanser once every other day. I can&#x27;t even express how much this has helped! I used to get quite large, itchy, PAINFUL cystic acne on my face, especially on my jawline, but since my insurance has changed and no longer covers anything for half of the year, I certainly couldn&#x27;t afford to go to my dermatologist and spend hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on prescriptions (which were usually ineffective after a few months anyway) and face washes that didn&#x27;t work. I searched around on Amazon and came across this stuff. Can&#x27;t even say how much it&#x27;s helped! Definitely start with this wash - I truly think the wash made ALL the difference when used in conjunction with the peel! I use it every other day to maintain my skin. It can be a little drying, especially on my chin, so I don&#x27;t always use the peel/wash on my chin area, but it has helped my jawline sooooooo much! That&#x27;s not to say that I have picture-perfect model skin, but it is sooooooo much better than when I started! And hey, I&#x27;ve only used up half of the bottle of peel and half the bottle of cleanser since I bought them both two months ago, so I&#x27;m looking at spending about forty bucks every four months - not a bad deal at all!</li>
            <li> I guess I can say that this stuff didn&#x27;t do much and for the amount of money they ask for the product it should work really well but it didn&#x27;t and the shipping charges was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I use this product in the evening time. The product works great to clear out my oily-combination skin. The effect is noticeable after the first use. It leaves my face super clean, glowing, and smooth, without dry feeling. Pores are minimized, and breakouts are in control. I alternates it with Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Balancing Cleanser in the morning since I consider it might be too strong to use it twice daily.</li>
            <li> good transaction, product</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.  However, I think it should be used sparingly, and if you are going to get a chemical peel, use it a few days before, but not on the day of the peel.  It will make your skin much too sensitive. (I learned the hard way.)  It&#x27;s a bit drying for daily use, but several times a week is fine if you have very oily or resistant skin.  I&#x27;m actually looking forward to trying more of their products.</li>
            <li> It works okay.  I do like this product but if used too much your skin will dry out easy if it&#x27;s like mine.  Also if you have sensitive skin I probably won&#x27;t get it.  I do like the feel of my face after using this product and usually use it about 2 - 3 times a week.  I would purchase it again and feel it is a quality product.</li>
            <li> A Very Good product for the skin!&lt;br /&gt;Tried and tested and have been using it little by little on the face and neck!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great Product. Not too harsh for daily use. I receive compliments on the smooth texture and vibrant clarity of my skin almost daily. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> At 23 years old I decided to try this after reading its reviews for probably my biggest and worst breakout.. I had cyst like acne-lots of white heads, thought to have been caused by being lazy and not washing my face twice a day as I usually do for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;While this product didn&#x27;t \\&quot;cure\\&quot; me, it did significantly reduce the white heads and the turned the condition from severe to moderate (I ended up having to go to the dermatologist for doxycycline and clyndicin, so I stopped using this)&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser definitely works faster than the Proactiv, Murad, and Neutrogena cleansers. I used it regularly (i dont recommend that though- it dried my skin out a lot)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it before  the perfect image 20% Salicylic acid gel peel once or twice a week it burned like crazy but my skin looked closer to clear then it did while I was on the acne prescriptions.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser for my oily skin cuts right through and I feel clean without feeling dried out. I use it often and will reorder and would recommend.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;twork for me. I had to change and go back to Proactive by wwashing my face and doing their 3 Step treatment with the chemical eel</li>
            <li> It really works clears your complextion up n gets rid of acne marks n scares I love this stuff even bought it a few times then right before I run out I purchase another one. Now I can&#x27;t live with out it!</li>
            <li> It is very strong, if you leave it on too long it will dry and peel the top layer.  I even use it as a spot treatment.  Excellent for acne, scars and sun damage.  I am planning on ordering again when I run out - it does look like the price might have gone up a few $$ - or maybe I&#x27;m remembering wrong.  If it goes up any more though, I won&#x27;t order - right now it&#x27;s at $25., think I paid $17.</li>
            <li> I love the way this cleanser removes the dead skin cells. I began by using it prior to the other Perfect Image peels, but now I use it twice a day. It is thorough and gentle enough not to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle.  I am 66 and continue to have oily combination sensitive skin.  My skin was congested and had white heads and enlarged pores.  Used as part of a daily process of derma pen treatments monthly, peeling with combination salicylic and glycol acids 15% bi weekly, using hyaluronic acid with C and moisturizer I am happy to report a serious improvement in my skin.  This cleanser may sting at the beginning of use but with patience and perseverance I believe you will see improvement as well.  I am sold.</li>
            <li> best face wash ever  i have very sensitive skin  and i break out easy even those annoying white heads&lt;br /&gt;ever since i use this i cleared up yay  i use it every night finally found something that keeps on working</li>
            <li> Warning - This will dry out your skin.  I have horrible build up. I use a facial brush plus I get facials and dermaplane but it was never enough.  This worked to break through my build-up.  I am so happy.  I love to Sonya Dakar products but my face was breaking out so I use this in place of her face wash.  I even use her oil omega booster which says a lot of about this product. I NEVER use oil on my face.  Great daily cleanser product but be prepared to use it as a regimen and not alone unless you want peeling, dry skin which will age your skin.</li>
            <li> I have severe cystic acne. I love the way this product smells, but it stings badly and dries my skin out. Despite that, it hasn&#x27;t made my skin any worse... or any better. I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase it. It might work for someone who has lighter acne.</li>
            <li> this product really helped me alot clearing my acne..i just finished my 2nd bottle and i will be ordering again..it&#x27;s an amazing cleanser!..</li>
            <li> The best for acne!  We tried everything and this is the only one that worked for my daughter.  Her face is now clear and beautiful.</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY REFRESHING AND CLEANS FACE AREA VERY WELL.  I HAVE BEEN USING FOR OVER SIX MONTHS. I AM VERY WELL PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WILL PURCHASE IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and it is the type of things that your local stores won&#x27;t carry, because it is too good (strong).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it will dry your skin out, yes you might flake, but if you want a product that is really going to clean your skin, this is what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t found anything that leave my skin feeling more refreshed than this!</li>
            <li> I recently went of birth control, so my hormones are completely out of sync. I broke out really bad only my forehead and especially my chin! It has caused me to be overly self conscious. I haven&#x27;t used anything on my face except Simple Skincare for the last month and finally used this product last week. My skin is having a positive reaction (thank god) and beginning to dry out my blemishes. I have had a minor purge but nothing that I haven&#x27;t experienced before. I&#x27;m so happy that this is starting to clear my skin... :) Give it a try if you&#x27;ve suffered with acne since teens</li>
            <li> I am a forty-something -year-old female that struggled with acne for most of my life and this product has made such a difference for my skin. This is my first bottle and I cannot imagine  my life without it from now on. SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this pre-peel for just that, a prep for a more thorough Perfect Image Peel (LOVE the Pineapple Pumpkin Peel) and then I use it daily on my nose and chin to help prevent the build up of moisturizers in my pores there.  It&#x27;s a bit drying so I restrict the more frequent use to just those oilier areas.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works wonderfully as a pre-peel treatment, as well as light peeling itself. It helps me maintain clear skin. Tip: for extra exfoliation leave it after massaging on your face for another minute or two.</li>
            <li> I have used this product over the last month for deep cleaning and it is giving good results.&lt;br /&gt;I feel clean, and the skin stays cleaner for longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser a week ago, used it every morning and to my surprise its the best cleanser ever, makes your skin soft, smooth and clean, redness got better and acne marks have diminished too. Loved it, a must have product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Does excatly what it&#x27;s suppose to do. My skin feels so soft,smooth &amp; clean! I use it almost every day. Please make a bodywash! Price went up $10.</li>
            <li> One needs to be careful to keep the cleanser away from lips, nose and eyes.  It does a wonderful job in exfoliating skin and leaves a healthy glow.  I use it after I wash my face before I shower.  I rinse it off in the shower and wash my face again to be sure all of the product is removed.  It&#x27;s worth the little extra time.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product, and I can&#x27;t live without it.  I have mild to occasionally severe acne and this product is wonderful.  It deep cleans and purifies my pores and my acne is now almost non-existent.  I use this about 2 times a week before I shower and leave it on for about 2-5 minutes and rinse.  I then wait for about an hour after my shower and moisturize with an acne friendly moisturizer.  I will continue to order this product in the future!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Cleans properly, leaves the skin Very Clean, Breathable, Glowy and Smooth. It is a good Aid for you against the unexpected breakouts, it will treat the problem very fast. I am satisfied with this order. ty</li>
            <li> Ive used the pre cleanser twice now and it really works, skin feels fresh and healthier with the use before a peel&lt;br /&gt;Must try</li>
            <li> Love this product, keeps my skin clean and refreshed. Minimizes outbreaks. This is the 3 bottle I have bought and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It makes my skin glow and helps fight my acne and blackheads. I mainly bought this product for my Salycic acid treatment but I use it on the regular like twice a week to keep my glow And face clear. Im Definatley going to buy again!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a few days but it cleans very well and is a good prep for the peels. I also use Perfect Image TCA peel which isn&#x27;t too strong but does the trick. This is a good stand-alone cleanser but overuse can dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> First time use......amazing like I have new skin. Just make sure you rinse it off good and pat your face dry!</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for about a month. I have combination skin (dry/oily T-zone) and over the age of 40. It is not too harsh and it leaves my skin clean and dry all day and night. I will continue to use this product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am sure for some people, this product is great, but for me, it is useless. I got it about three weeks ago, but I have only used it three times and I will never use it again.  This is because each time I used it my pimples, although not too many, increased in sizes, and I develop even more pimples than I had prior to using this product.  Besides, it tightened my face in a rather unfavorable manner.  I am convinced that no matter how great a product is said to be, it cannot possibly be good for everyone.  I do have a very sensitive skin so if you have a sensitive skin, too, please try some other product.</li>
            <li> the cleanser works better than any product I have ever used. it makes my face feel clean without harsh feeling.&lt;br /&gt;but it seems make my face too dry within one week when I started to use this product. I would like to be recommended  by perfect image which product will help and enhanced when the skin seems too dry to use this cleaner, that would be great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son who has acne. He likes it very much because it is easy to rinse off, smells good and leaves his skin less dry than other products he has used. I have noticed that his skin is improving nicely. I use it too and don&#x27;t find it too drying. It helps wash off old dry skin and leaves my face really soft. A great product for the price.</li>
            <li> This cleanser really prepares your face for your peel. I would recommend this cleanser to anyone doing a facial peel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in conjunction with the lactic acid peel. I thinks it works for the peel. But my skin was dry afterwards so don&#x27;t apply a lot. Apply a dime amount has recommended you don&#x27;t need a lot this is powerful stuff. It maybe costly but it lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t need a lot.This is not for a everyday wash but its good for an exfoliating wash and it smells good.</li>
            <li> This is pretty nice. I&#x27;ve used other products whose major component was salicylic acid and they all burned. This one doesn&#x27;t have an offensive smell (more like a light cleaning product smell), easy to use and you can feel a difference in your skin after you&#x27;ve washed it off. It isn&#x27;t overly drying like Neutrogena makes my skin feel, but as another reviewer suggested, I&#x27;d use a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> This product is great for people with acne problem. I&#x27;ll give it two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling to find acne products that work for me. I&#x27;ve come to find that glycolic acid and salicylic acid combined in a facial cleansing regimen has been able to tackle my acne prone skin and this product has conditioners that keep the skin from being bone dry after washing. Great product</li>
            <li> i used this with the skin pealer.&lt;br /&gt;no difference seen. i cant even use this all week because the directions say use 5-7 days prior the skin peel. okay...so i can only wash my face once a week? um no thanks. waste of money. pores look the same size, did not help.</li>
            <li> This wash has helped so much with my adult acne that has just decided to pop up in my 30&#x27;s. In the beginning I used it everyday, and within a day or 2 I had no new breakouts. I use it about 3 times a week now to keep everything under control, but could probably use it daily regardless. It will dry your face out so you need a heavy duty moisturizer. It does not burn or anything like that and foams nicely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope this product never goes away, it has been a life saver!</li>
            <li> I bought this with the Salicylic Acid peel and it works. It has helped with my acne and I am so glad I bought it. I hope it continues to work and soon I will be smooth again.</li>
            <li> This so far is my favorite cleanser.. give me extra smooth skin and shine free for longer hours while I was at work compare to my previous cleanser. Please keep mind that there&#x27;s a little cons.. even though I like to use this as my daily cleanser, I have to skip one or two days with using different gentler product that contain moisturizer just to make sure my skin not became too dry. Overall, this is the best. I definitely will order more in the near future.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a  cleanser to have if you like to feel it. I love this because I can feel it. If my skin is too dry or I&#x27;ve done a skin peel it burns, otherwise it just tingle. I am a loyal customer now to this brand!!</li>
            <li> i know this facial soap is not meant to be used everyday, however, i had horribly(!!!) embarrassing adult acne. nothing was working. granted i did not go to a dermatologist but i did some heavy hitting research on natural products, peels, befores and afters for other people. finally when i came to this product i was interested in the tea tree oil peel and this facial wash (both from the perfect image line). completely satisfied!! for me, this does not dry my face as much since i have been using it for 6 months as daily use, my acne has more than cleared up and i no longer try to hide my face. this cleanser is spectacular. i would recommend it to my friends but it was solely my decision to make this into a daily facial cleanser, may not be recommended for sensitive skin...just my stubborn skin.</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s my skin out.  I have adult acne (comodone acne)  This product seems to clean the skin but it has NOT affected my acne at all.  It is expensive so I am going to use it up but I will not be buying anymore.  Sorry it couldn&#x27;t be a raving review like the ones I read when I bought it.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleanser for people to workout - especially outdoors. This cleanser really rids one&#x27;s complexion of sweat, dirt, and debris. Since I&#x27;ve been using it everyday, I no longer have problem with clogged pores and acne flare-ups. I highly recommend this product to men and women!</li>
            <li> I do love this product it keeps the blemishes away.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but it didn&#x27;t do much when I had the deep cystic acne that I had to go on accutane to get rid of. However, now that I&#x27;ve gotten rid of my acne, I do enjoy using this cleanser quite a bit because the smell is so amazing and the bottle lasts a while because you don&#x27;t need to use much product. It makes your face feel insanely smooth and soft. Might help with very mild surface acne or just roughness of the skin. Although I love the product, I forked out the money for it when I was frantically and desperately trying to make my cystic acne go away. That being said, I don&#x27;t have any major problems with my skin anymore so I think I can get by using a less expensive cleanser than this and might not repurchase when I run out. It&#x27;s worth a try if you don&#x27;t mind spending this kind of money on face wash, but if you&#x27;re really trying to get rid of acne with it then I suggest getting on accutane as soon as you possibly can because no cleanser can get deep enough into the skin to really help much with cysts. I went through that crap for wayyyy too long and wish I ditched the harsh cleansers long ago and went on the accutane. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!  Enough said!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SURE THIS PRODUCT DOES EVERYTHING AND MORE FOR THOSE WHO LOVE IT, BUT MY SKIN HAD A BAD REACTION TO IT.  WHO KNOWS, I COULD BE ALLERGIC TO ONE OF THE INGRIEDIENTS!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and this is a fantastic cleanser for my skin.  It makes my face look smooth, soft and less oily.  My pores seem to look smaller and my face feels clean after every use.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> ...Should have been an indicator that this was not going to end pretty. I received both the cleanser and peel (which I think I might have to return after my experience with the scrub) promptly and was very excited to try the cleanser after reading so many fantastic reviews. However when I went to first use it, I was immediately thrown off by the striking, aqua blue color and bathroom cleaner scent. I went back to look through the reviews, but found no mention, from anyone, in regards to either of these things. Therefore, I decided I was probably just being paranoid and to ignore the red flags that went up in my head. I gave it a go, and boy, do I regret it. I have a horrible, bumpy, rash all over my chin and jaw line. My fine, mild, chin acne is now a painful, dry, red mess, and larger, tender bumps have started to form underneath the patches of dried skin. I am pretty sure it is a response of my integumentary and endorcrine systems to secrete more oil -which isn&#x27;t what I was hoping for- since the skin is so dead and sapped moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I do have fairer, more sensitive skin, I have never had an adverse reaction to tea tree oil, green tea extract, or salicylic acid -even used in conjunction. My only guess is that the reaction was due to either the dye, the scent, or both. Unless I received a tampered product. I should have listened to my gut in the beginning when I was not comfortable with look and the smell of the product.  I have contacted the company just to share my concerns, and I am certain I will hear back from them soon. I will further update my review from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final words to you are this: since so many others seem to have great experiences, don&#x27;t let my review completely deter you. However, if you do have skin that may react to certain dyes or scents and you end up with an electric blue, strongly scented product, please, err on the side of caution. It&#x27;s better to save your skin and your sanity the trouble.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested I use a salicylic acid wash on a daily basis for my recently developed (past year) hormonal acne.  I&#x27;m a 31yo woman with no kids.  I use Perfect Image Salicylic Clanser 1x-2x per day with my Clarisonic.  I use a fruit enzyme face wash by MyChelle if I don&#x27;t use this cleanser.  Although the Perfect Image Cleanser was drying at first, plus I have naturally dry skin, with regular use the dryness subsided.  I also changed my diet: mostly vegetarian (fish, beans, lentils), no dairy, no wheat; I began exercising about a month after I started using this cleanser, so it is not the cleanser alone, but it does help.  I drink at least 1.5L of H2O a day and take a probiotic.  I refused taking antibiotics which my dermatologist insisted on as antibiotics kill the immune system.  Now, my skin is softer, brighter, more even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To heal my active acne, I use GSE 2% with Lysine ointment by Nutribiotics.  For regular peels, I use the 50% Lactic Acid peel by Perfect Image and am going to start using the 12% TCA peel soon for more aggressive results on the acne scars.  I have also started a 3 series Arctic Laser Peel with my dermatologist which I am hoping with help with fine lines and boost my collagen production.  Staying young and healthy takes effort!  I have fair, freckled skin and live in FL.  But I am happy to say I&#x27;ve found a face cleanser I will continue using as the results are better than I&#x27;ve been able to achieve before!</li>
            <li> This product does what it is supposed to and then some. I love it. I want to use it for my whole body. It really removes the dead skin cells. I have been using it on my Face, chest, shoulders and hands. It is perfect for the pre peel.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser (Pre-Peel Salicylic Deep Gel Exfoliating Cleanser) and the Glycolic Acid 30% Gel Peel - Enhanced with Retinol and Green Tea Extract (Professional Chemical Peel) from Perfect Image through Amazon in mid-September and I really like the results so far.  I first used the cleanser on my face for 5 days and then did the peel on the weekend. Then I took a week off and repeated the process.  I leave the peel on my face for ten minutes. The peel does have a strong tingling sensation.  Now I use the cleanser a few times a week and the peel on the weekends if I don&#x27;t plan on being out in the sun.  The cleanser makes my face feel very clean and smooth.  My skin is brighter and the dark spots are fading.  I am 50 with fair-skin, green eyes and do not burn easily.  I have very oily, sensitive skin and cannot even wear most makeup. I do wear a tinted sunblock.  This combo has really been good for my skin to help control oil, breakouts and fade dark spots.</li>
            <li> This product is great for maintaining the results of a chemical peel, but it can be just a little over drying so for that i suggest an oil free moisturizer. I use it every two nights after a chemical peel to maintain the results.</li>
            <li> i use this stuff a few times a week and will be ordering a second bottle, it lasts about 4 months for two people, but if you use it more often you will have to order more of it.  the directions are iffy, you can use it every day if you like, you just have to listen to your skin. i dont have sensitive skin so i can use it more frequenly, follow it up with a nice moisturizer or your skin will feel really tight.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash and have been using it for the last several months.  I have very clear, smooth skin and do not break out since I started using this product!! I had a facial done in June and the esthetician told me that I had absolutely no black heads and my skin looked great.  Can be a little drying but just use a good moisturizer or skip a day.  The directions do imply not to use daily, but as long as I have a good moisturizer I have had absolutely not problems.  I get constant compliments on my skin and would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This works great for deep cleaning oily skin.  It is not too harsh on my skin and it helps keep acne breakouts to a minimum.  The only thing that is bad about it is the price.  It has gone up about $10 a bottle since I purchased it about a year and a half ago.  Update 6 May 2015:  This product still is great for cleaning oily skin.  Keeps my breakouts to a minimum and cleans my pores well.  I let my sister try it , she also has oily skin that is prone to breakouts, and it helped to clear her pores too.  Although, she complained of it stinging and wasn&#x27;t able to tolerate it as well.  She isn&#x27;t used to using anything stronger than over the counter products on her face, so I&#x27;m guessing if she gradually worked up to more contact time it would be fine for her too.</li>
            <li> Smells good and has a rich lather. Cleanses the face well even when you&#x27;re just using hands. Use a good moisturizer afterwards to avoid excessive drying of the skin if used daily, which I had a hard time not doing. It just makes your skin feel so darn baby soft</li>
            <li> I am a Licensed Cosmetologist...and have tried thousands of products! This is the best s*** I have ever used in my life!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I re-order this all the time it last a long time and worth every penny for use in-between peels</li>
            <li> This seriously decreased the amount of blackheads that I had and made my face much smoother. Definitely will be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> This is a a strong cleanser.  You can feel your skin tingling 5 seconds after you apply it.  It does a great job of exfoliating my skin.  I don&#x27;t use it every day...just once a week and it really helps!</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanser that works for me...i do have a very sensitive and acne prone skin, but this product works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 6 times and it seems to cleanse the face quite well.  A little bit of a smell but that&#x27;s okay; it&#x27;s not unbearable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how strong this stuff would actually be! It works super well, so really brush it on then rinse it off right away!!! Don&#x27;t wait unless you want the full on peeling. It won&#x27;t be thick peeing but noticeable for sure. I am glad I bought this for my arsenal.</li>
            <li> I recommended this product to everyone especially eith acne problem., this is a face cleanser that I got 3 benefits in one product.&lt;br /&gt;Besides from pre-peel salicylic deep gel, its also expoliating cleanser and enhanced with tea tree.</li>
            <li> I received my item very fast. I noticed it helped immediately reduce oil production. I&#x27;m going to use in conjunction with my herbal peel, the directions states to use 5-7 before peel, or 2-3 times per week for maintenance. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean, my pores appear smaller and my skin feels taut. After using this product, my skin is very dry, but I deal with that by using a good moisturizer. I will buy this product again...very pleased</li>
            <li> So I bought this product a while back and even though I don&#x27;t use it too often, I do very much like it. It gets rid of most of my flaky dry skin. The only thing is be prepared for the smell.. It is quite strong but nothing that can&#x27;t be dealt with.</li>
            <li> I use many Perfect Image products &amp; love them.  My teenage son who has had acne issues is seeing great results with this cleaner &amp; I, in my mid 40&#x27;s love how clean my face feels (without drying out) after I use.</li>
            <li> I have had to go and get laser treatment because of this stuff. I got it to help with my lip/chin area and he turned my skin thin those areas even darker. I&#x27;m sending this stuff back.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this many months ago, used it twice a week. It stings a little, but not enough to stop using it. I went to a cosmetic surgeon for a lift analysis. He noticed the condition of my skin (age 57), and commented on how refreshed and healthy it looked. The office had offered to sell me their much more expensive wash, but I refused. This product, according to my analysis, does exactly what it purports to. Buying it again!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, and I will buy it again.  It&#x27;s powerful without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!  Prior to using it I would get fairly heavy breakouts.  The jumbo cystic ones.  I&#x27;ve been using this cleaner for about 4 months now and have not had any major breakouts since.  Some minor stuff around that time of the month, but nothing major.  I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed to show my face and no more caked on makeup to cover it up.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/7/13 - I have now been using this product for almost a full year and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!  This is my first year that I have made it through the holidays without a single breakout.  I typically get nasty breakouts during the holidays, due to my lack of willpower when it comes to food, but this year I had nothing, not even one pimple!!  Even my husband noticed and has decided to give this stuff a try.  This is now my face wash of choice!  Hopefully I never have to live without it!!</li>
            <li> Love this gel cleanser! Especially a few days before a peel....helps peel work more effectively!</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few months between peels and sometimes as a daily cleanser. I still had a couple breakouts but i hAve pretty bad acne. It worked better then most products ive tried. I did notice the redness of old scars has been reduced with using the cleanser,peel and hydrating lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month now, at the beginning i could see the dark spots getting lighter, but now  i see no improvement&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it for a few more months.</li>
            <li> This face wash is amazing, especially if you have oily or acne prone skin.It will leave your skin matte, but not dry,&amp;you won&#x27;t have any oil build up for about 8hrs.I have cystic acne,&amp;it this wash has really helped to improve my condition.i hear salicylic acid is ideal for penetrating acne deep down &amp; cleansing.Has a very mild sting at 1st, but nothing bad, your face will feel wonderful after using this product &amp; you can use this with or without moisturizing afterwards, as it isn&#x27;t over drying.Its an awesome product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, and I will definitely buy again.  A little goes a long way and the results are real - my skin is clear and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this item by mistake &amp; lodged it even better than the product I was using (Infinite Skin Clarity Cleanser) Now to be clean Infinite Skin isn&#x27;t a bad product at all. I just found that Perfect Image worked better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was seeing results within a week.  My skin is softer and more importantly clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I liked most about it was that this product lathers where the other did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use the product; first I put this on dry face (I knownsounds weird but try it). Working it evenly over the face. Then add a little water to my hands working into a lather. Riense well. Then wash with your favorite face wash with a lufa type scrubby.  This helps get rid ilof the layer of skin you just loosened.  Risne while face is very wet I use my favorite Retin-A product. Sounds harsh, and this might be for your skin but I actually do this twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy this as I have. Take care</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  I use it about once to twice a week to get a deep exfoliation.  Works so much better than what you can find at the drugstore.  It keeps my 52 year old skin smooth &amp; free of breakouts.  Perfect Image has great products.  I highly recommend their other products too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried proactiv for years before it stopped working.  I tried this product because of all the good reviews.  My face peeling around my mouth especially the first week or so, then started clearing up. I now use it about 3 times/wk for maintenance.</li>
            <li> This face wash is great. You can instantly feel your skin tightening after washing. If you use it too often, it can seriously dry out your skin. I use it twice a week to maintain my very oily skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is a powerful alternative to scrubs, which are either too abrasive or don&#x27;t exfoliate enough. I use it several times a week, and sometimes I leave it on my face. One word of caution: use an old towel. Although we try to rinse thoroughly, sometimes there are remnants which will cause fading of the towel.</li>
            <li> Great product and I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference right away...saw blackheads n enlarged pores vanishing..really helps clear up acne pimples fast!!!im so relieved to finally start seeing results because the over the counter stuff just was doing it 100 percent just start n then bom right back again...so hoping my face gets clear completely and stays..so far big plus!!! I think I found a new product..I&#x27;m going to continue to use for sure...it&#x27;s a must you won&#x27;t regret it I don&#x27;t!!!!!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be a very good deep cleaning cleanser. I get a bit of a sting when using it, but its ok because that tells me its working. This product doesnt leave my skin feeling too tight.. Great product for the money, Id recommend it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding !!! I left Proactive for this product and I will never look back.</li>
            <li> If you know anything about facial care, a deep exfoliating cleanser is vital to success. This product delivers without robbing the bank.</li>
            <li> After wash, skin felt tight and clean. The beads exfoliate very well. No need to scrub hard. Needed very little product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and this cleanser cuts thru the oil and cleans thoroughly. I use it once a day in my T-zone. It visibly shrinks pores and removes oil from them. My face is squeaky clean  after use. It has a somewhat medicinal smell, but I wouldn&#x27;t care what it smells like as long as it helps me conquer the oily skin.  Very impressed with this.</li>
            <li> love the cleanser i notice a difference right away my skin feels great but make sure to moisturize the face after.</li>
            <li> I have tried peels for the feet, hands, and mild scrubs for the face,but not a peel for the face.  This stuff is amazing.  I admit I got panicky when I stated to feel the tingle and a mild burning feel.  So, I rinsed it off.  While rinsing, I sort of rubbed the water around to be sure to rinse thoroughly.  While doing this, my hands felt little pills of dead skin rolling into little balls.  This was the dead, old skin coming off. I do this on average of once a week and this is sufficient.  If you do a thorough cleansing with Perfect Image cleanser, you will remove most of the dead skin. and then do the peel.  I wait for about 30 minutes and then do the peel.  Both of these products are amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I had really bad acne for most of my teenage years to the point that people call me (pizza face) and Perfect Image help a lot to clean acne. Perfect Image has all really good products and I wouldn&#x27;t rate any of them lower than a five. Since I visited doctors and pay 50 buck for a visit and a 100 for a product that wasn&#x27;t as good. The gel really help more than the chemical peel did which they did a pretty good job as well. I highly suggest one buy a cleansing machine though (one of those machine that their a pad that rotation around) since it better than cleaning your face with your hands (Neautrogena sell one)</li>
            <li> Finally I have found a cleanser that has helped my adult chin acne!!  Salicylic Deep Exfoliating gel is FABULOUS!!!  I have replaced all of my other RX cleansers (that didn&#x27;t help) and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Really the first line that I&#x27;ve used all together that rocks.&lt;br /&gt;This is meant to be used in conjunction with their Salicylic peel.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to use the peel, wash and moisturizer.  You may see some dryness in your skin, but if you keep on top of moisturizing the results are excellent.</li>
