            <li>Smells good and has a great texture when applying it.</li>
            <li>I have tried, it doesn&#x27;t feel good.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good all around.</li>
            <li>It soothes the face and proved good lubrication of your skin.</li>
            <li>feels good after electric shave;no stinging.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not overpowering and it feels good on the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not to mention it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The pores on my face tend to \\&quot;clog-up\\&quot; during the warm season, but this product has not caused me any problems or concerns.</li>
            <li>really liked the scent too.</li>
            <li>this is a really great aftershave and best of all it really does sooth your skin unlike other aftershaves which don&#x27;t work as well, plus it has a really great scent to it, almost like perfume!</li>
            <li>And, Amazon&#x27;s subscriber service (not to mention the additional discount) is perfect as a new batch is sent to me every four months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very smooth on my skin after shaving, nice sent, women luv</li>
            <li>I never bought any balms for about 8 years after being given a very cheap one called Afta that did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent of its own, I can choose whatever cologne I prefer and not worry about the scents clashing.</li>
            <li>this is a good high quality product to add to your lineup to really polish off a great shave!</li>
            <li>This product is impressive in that in just two weeks after I started use, my redness and shaving discomfort were simply gone.  </li>
            <li>And of course I don&#x27;t like to put those on top of this one.  </li>
            <li>And once I am done with my bottle, I am not buying any more.</li>
            <li>I have more razor burn with this than if I used nothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying its the overall best out there on the market.</li>
            <li>Both nivea products works great, but this one really stands out.</li>
            <li>because that&#x27;s where it helps the most with the razor burn.</li>
            <li>This Nivea Replenishing has great coverage and really works.</li>
            <li>I love this aftershave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in my shaving routine for so many years.</li>
            <li>It also had a gentle but pleasant smell.      </li>
            <li>As the old saying goes for a hair product, a dab will do you, so just a dime size dollop works great.  </li>
            <li>Nivea has a fantastic men&#x27;s product line.&lt;br /&gt;Feels refreshing and invigorating with no greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read all of the reviews for this product and have to agree that it is really quite good.    </li>
            <li>It also had a strong &#x27;manly&#x27; odor (as my fianc√© put it).</li>
            <li>I also like the light fragrance.</li>
            <li>It does a GREAT job of covering the shadow left on your face after you shave.</li>
            <li>school\\&quot; like deodorant and the squeeze bottles just looked cheap</li>
            <li>While it lasts a long time I am convinced of the product quality and effectiveness for me, so elected to have a long-term supply and at a great cost savings.  </li>
            <li>I prefer Lucky Tiger over anything, but if I run out and need some aftershave before my Lucky Tiger comes in, this is easily found at 99% or retailers and drug stores.</li>
            <li>It was not as good for my entire face.  </li>
            <li>Good idea on paper, but does not work for me for the following reasons.  </li>
            <li>Feels good, makes you also look younger.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing, leaves the skin moisturized, and helps with nicks and irritation and really does make your skin look cleaner if you&#x27;re using inferior products whoch can cause irritation, I would know.</li>
            <li>Having tried several aftershaves over the years, this one finally seems to be the best for me.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a clean fresh scent that&#x27;s not too over powering, and soothes razor bumps and cuts right away without burning the skin (like some products that are alcohol based).</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years now, and have foung it to be a nice aftershave balm during the spring, summer and fall seasons.  </li>
            <li>To give a comparison in deodorant scents, this stuff is like right guard and I&#x27;m looking for some brut now.</li>
            <li>I am saying that its probably the best that can be found on the shelves of the big chain retail stores for less than $10.</li>
            <li>What I like most about the product is its mild scent (which disappears quickly) and the fact that it soothes my skin without leaving it either dry or oily.</li>
            <li>No burn, moisturizes, absorbs well, smells decent (clean smell and not overpowering).</li>
            <li>After using an entire bottle, over the course of several months, I can tell you with great authority that it does not do those things.  </li>
            <li>Very minor as I don&#x27;t touch my own face very much.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;slap\\&quot; is very gentle.</li>
            <li>The replenishing balm can replace your face lotion; it leaves your face feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>If only they made something with more of an earthy smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the $40 top of the line brands and the regular over the counter.</li>
            <li>Speaking of price, I paid $8 locally (Rite Aid) for a single bottle so getting the 4-pack is a great value.    </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really like it that much.</li>
            <li>and you do not need to put on that much</li>
            <li>This helps of course, but not as much.  </li>
            <li>Not trying to shill Nivea&#x27;s stuff, but I like it and find it reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>applied it liberally and rubbed it into my skin, and it really did make the burn go away.</li>
            <li>It will absolutely replenish your skin, soothe your razor burn, and make your face</li>
            <li>really like scent of this stuff and</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended! A+++</li>
            <li>It helps sooth my shaved face, which incidentally gets very irritated after a shave.</li>
            <li>much happier and so is my wallet.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>and I feel that this balm suits my needs very well.  </li>
            <li>It does not go on heavy, and has a nice, lite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m speaking from my point of view as a double edge safety razor, wet shaver (yea the kind your grandpa used).</li>
            <li>Too close, and I will inevitably get ingrown hairs and razor bumps, which will get more irritated with subsequent shaving.  </li>
            <li>The aftersave won&#x27;t soak in high quantities.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve started to use a sandalwood shave cream, and the \\&quot;Mediciney\\&quot; scent of this stuff (by comparison to a natural sandalwood scent) clashes a bit too much.</li>
            <li>at least that&#x27;s what my girlfriend says and leaves your skin with a nice protection while taken the redness off of my neck.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a residue on top of your skin that comes off during the day like dead skin.</li>
            <li>but they smelled too \\&quot;new</li>
            <li>The scent is quite pleasing and very masculine.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and shaving is truly and excruciating experience.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I bought it from Amazon because it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the one in the stores (granted, I bought it from Wal-Mart like a year and a half ago so it might&#x27;ve not smelt right for a reason).</li>
            <li>Went through various other product, but by far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>That saves time, mess and makes application much more simple.</li>
            <li>After Shave Gel, Sensitive Skin, 2.54 Ounces]].</li>
            <li>Nivea would make a killing off this stuff if it was completely unscented.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soothing, doesn&#x27;t burn when applied and it has a soft, unobtrusive scent.</li>
            <li>They had a Sensitive Skin one and this Replenishing version.</li>
            <li>the bottle design looks classy.</li>
            <li>fragrance is minimal is just right for my taste.</li>
            <li>I usually like to use an aftershave (different brands, but let&#x27;s say old spice) and then put a moisturizing lotion on top.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this stuff, and Amazon&#x27;s regular shipment program (with discount).  </li>
            <li>find that about 2 dime sized drops or less covers my whole face very well.</li>
            <li>I smelled both multiple times but couldn&#x27;t get much of a smell from the Sensitive Skin version and later found out that it&#x27;s scentless!</li>
            <li>At less than 6 dollars this aftershave is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a high quality aftershave with minimal to no burn and appreciates trying new shaving products.</li>
            <li>I have used it for several years with complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Next to witch hazel and regular use of [[ASIN:B001FB5IKK Nivea for Men Sensitive, Extra Soothing Lotion for Sensitive Skin, SPF 4, 2.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li>At the urging of my stylist, I purchased this because it has witch hazel which should close pores and help prevent the above symptoms and is marketed at being extra soothing for those, like me, with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin dries out much sooner compared to other lotions that I use (not after shave, but regular lotions).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only recently that I&#x27;ve moved back to wet shaving and really don&#x27;t care for the \\&quot;slap\\&quot; in the face that alcohol-based after shaves give.</li>
            <li>Like most lotions, spread a small amount both hand and rub across your whole face into a THIN even layer.</li>

            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and shaving is truly and excruciating experience.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I bought it from Amazon because it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the one in the stores (granted, I bought it from Wal-Mart like a year and a half ago so it might&#x27;ve not smelt right for a reason).</li>
            <li> Went through various other product, but by far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> That saves time, mess and makes application much more simple.</li>
            <li> After Shave Gel, Sensitive Skin, 2.54 Ounces]].</li>
            <li> Nivea would make a killing off this stuff if it was completely unscented.</li>

            <li> I usually like to use an aftershave (different brands, but let&#x27;s say old spice) and then put a moisturizing lotion on top.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this stuff, and Amazon&#x27;s regular shipment program (with discount).  </li>
            <li> find that about 2 dime sized drops or less covers my whole face very well.</li>
            <li> I smelled both multiple times but couldn&#x27;t get much of a smell from the Sensitive Skin version and later found out that it&#x27;s scentless!</li>
            <li> At less than 6 dollars this aftershave is well worth the price.</li>

            <li> At the urging of my stylist, I purchased this because it has witch hazel which should close pores and help prevent the above symptoms and is marketed at being extra soothing for those, like me, with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin dries out much sooner compared to other lotions that I use (not after shave, but regular lotions).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only recently that I&#x27;ve moved back to wet shaving and really don&#x27;t care for the \\&quot;slap\\&quot; in the face that alcohol-based after shaves give.</li>

            <li> : the only drawback for me is the product bottle opening is large and it&#x27;s difficult to just get the five drops needed to cover my face, so I empty the entire bottle contents into a more convenient dispenser with a narrow tip for small quantity control.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue but your skin will feel heavier and slightly masked after application until about 16 hours later.  </li>
            <li> I have a sensitivity to fragrances, but the fragrance in this is not overpowering, with just enough alcohol in it for a slight tingle when applied.  </li>

            <li> The only thing that helps clear the acne up is Apricot Scrub which dries my skin out unfortunately.</li>
            <li> However, that scent is my only complaint about the product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin around my mouth and chin after I shave. I have tried several after shaves and lotions. The Nivea for Men After Shave has worked the best for me. It does not take a lot of this product so a little goes a long ways. I also like the light fragrance. If you have dry dry skin after shaving. I would try this After Shave.</li>
            <li> Im 16 and I started shaving about a year ago. I initially started using an electric shaver but I didn&#x27;t really like it that much. So I asked my dad to pass off some of his \\&quot;REAL\\&quot; shaving stuff. He did. One of those things was the [[ASIN:B000065ABA Gillette Series After Shave Gel, Sensitive Skin, 2.54 Ounces]]. I tried it and did what after shave is supposed to do, except, dry out my skin like  crazy!!     So I went to the drug store and picked this product up. WOW! What a difference! It&#x27;s a great after shave! It smells good! and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin! It&#x27;s AWESOME!!!!!! Buy it now! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> After trying other brands and either they are to oily or smell bad.  This product smells great at least that&#x27;s what my girlfriend says and leaves your skin with a nice protection while taken the redness off of my neck.  I use a razor so my skin tends to get a bit red.  This takes care of it all, and again the smell it gives off is a manly smell and you do not need to put on that much so the bottle should last awhile.</li>
            <li> You can get a lot of use out of just one pack of four.  This product is impressive in that in just two weeks after I started use, my redness and shaving discomfort were simply gone.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue but your skin will feel heavier and slightly masked after application until about 16 hours later.  You do get used to it, and it is not inconvenient or uncomfortable for me.  The scent is quite pleasing and very masculine.</li>
            <li> I applied this all over my face thinking it would moisturize and tighten the pores of my face.  It was not as good for my entire face.  It is excellent as an after shave.  It minimized the razor burn feel you get after shaving.</li>
            <li> Went through various other product, but by far this is my favorite. Leaves a clean fresh scent that&#x27;s not too over powering, and soothes razor bumps and cuts right away without burning the skin (like some products that are alcohol based). And, Amazon&#x27;s subscriber service (not to mention the additional discount) is perfect as a new batch is sent to me every four months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor grip is that I wish this product did not leave a sticky tacky feeling. Very minor as I don&#x27;t touch my own face very much.</li>
            <li> I usually like to use an aftershave (different brands, but let&#x27;s say old spice) and then put a moisturizing lotion on top.  I see this product as some sort of a \\&quot;combination\\&quot; product where you only need to use one product instead of two.  Good idea on paper, but does not work for me for the following reasons.  1) It does not soothe my skin the way an after shave does. In other words, the razor burn just stays. This helps of course, but not as much.  2) It leaves a residue on top of your skin that comes off during the day like dead skin. Yes, it&#x27;s a bigger problem if you use a lot of it, but it&#x27;s still a problem even in smaller quantities.  3) My skin dries out much sooner compared to other lotions that I use (not after shave, but regular lotions). And of course I don&#x27;t like to put those on top of this one.  4) To the extent it works, it is only for the shaved part. Not the rest of the face. I have tried, it doesn&#x27;t feel good.  5) I like my daily lotion to have some SPF protection. This one of course does not have any.  The only time I actually use this (while I have it) is when I am traveling. That lets me carry just one thing, instead of two. But when I am home, I prefer my two part solution. And once I am done with my bottle, I am not buying any more.</li>
            <li> This stuff is greasy and bad and does not work at all. I have more razor burn with this than if I used nothing. AWFUL product.</li>
            <li> this is a really great aftershave and best of all it really does sooth your skin unlike other aftershaves which don&#x27;t work as well, plus it has a really great scent to it, almost like perfume!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Feels good, makes you also look younger. Good all around. Too bad Amazon no longer offers it as a refillable automatic re order and I have to it get at Wally.</li>
            <li> Having tried several aftershaves over the years, this one finally seems to be the best for me.  I have a sensitivity to fragrances, but the fragrance in this is not overpowering, with just enough alcohol in it for a slight tingle when applied.  As the old saying goes for a hair product, a dab will do you, so just a dime size dollop works great.  Next to witch hazel and regular use of [[ASIN:B001FB5IKK Nivea for Men Sensitive, Extra Soothing Lotion for Sensitive Skin, SPF 4, 2.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]], I&#x27;m all set for post shave.  Highly recommend this stuff, and Amazon&#x27;s regular shipment program (with discount).  Not trying to shill Nivea&#x27;s stuff, but I like it and find it reasonably priced.  A bonus is that my spouse likes the scent, maybe yours will too!</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with my neck having bad razor burn and developing bumps etc.. with this product those issues are gone.  I am a life long customer now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying its the overall best out there on the market. I am saying that its probably the best that can be found on the shelves of the big chain retail stores for less than $10. No burn, moisturizes, absorbs well, smells decent (clean smell and not overpowering). I prefer Lucky Tiger over anything, but if I run out and need some aftershave before my Lucky Tiger comes in, this is easily found at 99% or retailers and drug stores. I&#x27;m speaking from my point of view as a double edge safety razor, wet shaver (yea the kind your grandpa used).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read all of the reviews for this product and have to agree that it is really quite good.    It&#x27;s only recently that I&#x27;ve moved back to wet shaving and really don&#x27;t care for the \\&quot;slap\\&quot; in the face that alcohol-based after shaves give. Although this product does contain alcohol, I would not call it alcohol based and the \\&quot;slap\\&quot; is very gentle. I just wonder why Nivea though it necessary to include alcohol at all. It&#x27;s the alcohol that kept me from giving Nivea a fifth star.    What I like most about the product is its mild scent (which disappears quickly) and the fact that it soothes my skin without leaving it either dry or oily. I had been using Burberry&#x27;s after shave balm but the Nivea balm is at least as good and a lot less expensive. Since it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent of its own, I can choose whatever cologne I prefer and not worry about the scents clashing. Speaking of price, I paid $8 locally (Rite Aid) for a single bottle so getting the 4-pack is a great value.    By the way, I still use my Braun electric from time to time and Nivea after-shave balm work well with electrics too.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this based on the reviews, but for me it did not work. I use an electric &#x27;wet&#x27; shaver. When putting this on, I could feel a tingly stinging sensation, it made my skin feel dry and sore, not moisturized. It also had a strong &#x27;manly&#x27; odor (as my fianc√© put it). Long story short, I tried it once and sent it back.</li>
            <li> I have used this product after using nivea shaving gel for the last year. Both nivea products works great, but this one really stands out. The aftershave clears up all the nicks left on your face, and stops any blood from dripping. It does a GREAT job of covering the shadow left on your face after you shave. The replenishing balm can replace your face lotion; it leaves your face feeling smooth and soft. It also had a gentle but pleasant smell.      I believe the bottle says use generously, but DON&#x27;T. The aftersave won&#x27;t soak in high quantities. Like most lotions, spread a small amount both hand and rub across your whole face into a THIN even layer.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent after shave lotion. I have used it for several years with complete satisfaction. It soothes the face and proved good lubrication of your skin. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells good and has a great texture when applying it. Isn&#x27;t greasy and last several hours.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now, and have foung it to be a nice aftershave balm during the spring, summer and fall seasons.  It does not go on heavy, and has a nice, lite fragrance.  The pores on my face tend to \\&quot;clog-up\\&quot; during the warm season, but this product has not caused me any problems or concerns.</li>
            <li> About a year ago, I started wet shaving with a safety razor. It&#x27;s quite a bit different than shaving with a mach 3 or what-have-you. In the process of getting my technique down, I wound up with some serious razor burn. I&#x27;d never felt razor burn before, but wow, this was really uncomfortable! Seeking relief, I went to Target and picked up some of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it liberally and rubbed it into my skin, and it really did make the burn go away. Soon I was a happy camper again. I still use it after shaves to keep my skin moist and soothe any potential irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it says, and it does it fantastically. It will absolutely replenish your skin, soothe your razor burn, and make your face happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the scent too. It&#x27;s manly, but not overpowering. However, that scent is my only complaint about the product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started to use a sandalwood shave cream, and the \\&quot;Mediciney\\&quot; scent of this stuff (by comparison to a natural sandalwood scent) clashes a bit too much. If only they made something with more of an earthy smell. To give a comparison in deodorant scents, this stuff is like right guard and I&#x27;m looking for some brut now. Nivea would make a killing off this stuff if it was completely unscented.</li>
            <li> I have poor sensitive skin, prone to breaking out from a combo of acne and razor burn. The only thing that helps clear the acne up is Apricot Scrub which dries my skin out unfortunately. So every day after I wash my face, I&#x27;ll dab some of the Nivea on for comfort. I&#x27;ll cover my neckline as well because that&#x27;s where it helps the most with the razor burn. Without it I have noticeable irritation all over my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention it smells amazing. I bought it from Amazon because it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the one in the stores (granted, I bought it from Wal-Mart like a year and a half ago so it might&#x27;ve not smelt right for a reason). Amazon&#x27;s smells amazing. Don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s different.</li>
            <li> My husband has decided that this is one of the best products on the market.  He will only use Nivea products now.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and shaving is truly and excruciating experience.  Too close, and I will inevitably get ingrown hairs and razor bumps, which will get more irritated with subsequent shaving.  At the urging of my stylist, I purchased this because it has witch hazel which should close pores and help prevent the above symptoms and is marketed at being extra soothing for those, like me, with sensitive skin.  After using an entire bottle, over the course of several months, I can tell you with great authority that it does not do those things.  Ingrown hairs persist, red, inflamed skin remains, and, while the aftershave itself does not irritate my neck, it does nothing to quench the flames thereon.  Then there is the odor.  This, I believe says it is unscented, but, please don&#x27;t make my mistake of thinking it is odorless.  It smells horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use an electric shaver and I remain forever slightly scruffy.</li>
            <li> feels good after electric shave;no stinging.  fragrance is minimal is just right for my taste.</li>
            <li> Works Great!! Nivea has a fantastic men&#x27;s product line.&lt;br /&gt;Feels refreshing and invigorating with no greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;Will definately buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to others.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s performance in product availability and delivery was flawless - Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> very smooth on my skin after shaving, nice sent, women luv it, my ex adored it, wish it was in a plastic container thought</li>
            <li> This is the only after shave that I use. It&#x27;s soothing, doesn&#x27;t burn when applied and it has a soft, unobtrusive scent.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I&#x27;ve seen this stuff on the shelf for a couple of years. I had smelled it but never considered it as I already have a lot invested in liquid/splash form aftershaves. But recently I decided to buy some. They had a Sensitive Skin one and this Replenishing version. I smelled both multiple times but couldn&#x27;t get much of a smell from the Sensitive Skin version and later found out that it&#x27;s scentless! They also had some Nivea after shave balms in squeeze tubes that were a couple dollars cheaper but they smelled too \\&quot;new school\\&quot; like deodorant and the squeeze bottles just looked cheap so I went with the Replenishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like scent of this stuff and the bottle design looks classy. I never bought any balms for about 8 years after being given a very cheap one called Afta that did not work at all for me. This Nivea Replenishing has great coverage and really works. Consider me a balm convert! It&#x27;s not greasy. I personally don&#x27;t get a tingling sensation when I apply it as some other reviewers have stated. I also haven&#x27;t felt any burning from this product after applying it to shaving nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that about 2 dime sized drops or less covers my whole face very well. This product doesn&#x27;t have a tacky feel. I use much less of this Nivea than I ever have with a liquid based aftershave. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a high quality aftershave with minimal to no burn and appreciates trying new shaving products. It works really well. The scent for me lasts about an hour or less and isn&#x27;t overpowering. At less than 6 dollars this aftershave is well worth the price. I bought mine at Wal Mart and the next day I went to Target and it was a dollar less there. If you like shaving with safety razors and badger brushes this is a good high quality product to add to your lineup to really polish off a great shave! Highly recommended! A+++</li>
            <li> I love this aftershave. It helps sooth my shaved face, which incidentally gets very irritated after a shave. I have been using this for several years now and have no complaints. Great product.</li>
            <li> I HAD A PROBLEM WITH RAZOR BUMPS. THIS STUFF HAS GREATLY REDUCED THIS PROBLEM. I LUV IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in my shaving routine for so many years. It is refreshing, leaves the skin moisturized, and helps with nicks and irritation and really does make your skin look cleaner if you&#x27;re using inferior products whoch can cause irritation, I would know. I&#x27;ve tried the $40 top of the line brands and the regular over the counter. This has become my go to. Affordable, and lasts long. I apply some in my palm with the fingers, rub, and massage onto face. I also use a moisturizer afterwards. for those once in a blue moon cuts or irritation from that mach 3 cartridge which is way past its prime, - you know what I&#x27;m talking about fellas, squeeze the $$ out of those. but those are usually cuts that even after shave splash can&#x27;t fully cure. only a alum bloc. happy shaving folks. oh and I shifted now to traditional wet shaving. much happier and so is my wallet. closer shave too</li>
            <li> 11.29.12. I started using Nivea for Men Post Shave Replenishing Balm, 3.3-Ounce Bottles several years ago and always had to buy it a Walmart or some such store.  I tried amazon.com and found the same product \\&quot;Nivea for Men Post Shave Replenishing Balm, 3.3-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)\\&quot; in the 4-pack.  While it lasts a long time I am convinced of the product quality and effectiveness for me, so elected to have a long-term supply and at a great cost savings.  Thanks amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: the only drawback for me is the product bottle opening is large and it&#x27;s difficult to just get the five drops needed to cover my face, so I empty the entire bottle contents into a more convenient dispenser with a narrow tip for small quantity control. That saves time, mess and makes application much more simple.</li>
            <li> I researched the differences between aftershave and balm and I feel that this balm suits my needs very well.  It has great moisturizing properties and the fact that it comes in a pack of 3 at a good price, makes me a happy customer.  The smell is not overpowering and it feels good on the skin.  It&#x27;s definitely soothing (no stinging).</li>
