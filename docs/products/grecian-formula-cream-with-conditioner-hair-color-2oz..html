    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The liquid drips but the cream works perfectly around the hairline.</li>
            <li>In my opinion a very good product.</li>
            <li>and very nicely</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than wonderful  ....</li>
            <li>This was a good buy on this product.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Well, the cream, in my opinion, does not do nearly as good a job of removing the gray as the foam.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very pleased with the cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Grecian Formula Cream for 3 or 4 years and have been very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>This product is a great improvement over the original liquid formula sold in the stores.</li>
            <li>So many of these thigs either don&#x27;t work or leave you looking like a clown</li>
            <li>think that this cream is better to use than the liquid.</li>
            <li>It is even better than the foam version they sold.</li>
            <li>The product worked, maybe even better than advertised.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but is just Ok,.</li>
            <li>this is a huge overcharge rip off .</li>
            <li>Nice to find it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It took about 3 weeks before some of my original hair color came through.  </li>
            <li>Some parts of my hair are pretty resistant, but that&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully the smell quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li>The look and feel is great and would have given it five stars for performance, but the odor knocked it down to four.</li>
            <li>This company gave a reasonable price and got it to us very quickly.</li>
            <li>It might work fine for some customers but it didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li>was aware that this DOES NOT RESTORE your hair color but brings some of it back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks again!  </li>
            <li>The directions noted that should only wash hair once a week until the desired color is obtained, but I washed it more often and still had the benefit of color.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using the foam I saw results in days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a good idea to be using this stuff in the first place.</li>
            <li>I must say that it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying it.</li>
            <li>Only the liquid and foam versions are readily available, and I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>versions as much as the cream.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much cologne</li>
            <li>I like this cream better than there other types.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product that can be replaced by other products.</li>
            <li>This helps restore SOME of your natural hair color over a period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that this product does contain lead and is also stated in the accompanying literature.</li>
            <li>The colour is not longlasting and yopu need to put on several time to achieve a right colour for gray hair.</li>
            <li>Also, there is lead in the formula and it can have a chemical smell when first applied, so I usually spray a fine mist of cologne over my hair after putting on the cream.  </li>
            <li>Do you want to live forever or look like you are?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna pitch this tube and buy a new can of foam today.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of outright dying my hair because I feel you&#x27;re trying to hide what makes you who you really are.</li>
            <li>I think that the foam gets much better results at least for me anyway.</li>
            <li>With the cream, which I have been using for weeks now, I have not experienced the same good results as with the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product supposedly changes your hair back to it&#x27;s natural color</li>
            <li>It took several weeks for my hair to turn back to its natural gray after I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>Or consuming a typical US of A fast food meal 18.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the mess of the foam, so after reading several reviews here on Amazon</li>

            <li> Have been using  this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> this is only a simply white cream , no color present  at any time , in the past i bougth  sevral , the same product with color .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only trying to keep my hair with a salt-and-pepper look, rather than turning it from all white to all black.  </li>
            <li> The trick is to apply it to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves the product but it should only cost less than $10...</li>
            <li> Just use a little dab, and rub into&lt;br /&gt;hands, and apply as you would a regular hair cream.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll wet the hair and diminish its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> but I noticed that it changed my hair to a pale yellow.</li>
            <li> Not bad in maintenance mode, but it was bad during the initial period.  </li>
            <li> only one small tube, thought it would be three.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not embarrassed by gray hair because I&#x27;ve had it ever since I was a late teen, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind decreasing the amount of gray that I have.</li>
            <li> Within three weeks the desired color (dark brown, with a little gray), was achieved.  </li>
            <li> Far too expensive now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this works slowly.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about this product is the awful smell when you rub it into your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry that it is being dis-continued.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on-line because it&#x27;s become very difficult to find in stores.  </li>

            <li> This was a good buy on this product. I like this cream better than there other types. Just use a little dab, and rub into&lt;br /&gt;hands, and apply as you would a regular hair cream. In my opinion a very good product.</li>
            <li> So many of these thigs either don&#x27;t work or leave you looking like a clown&lt;br /&gt;this works slowly. and very nicely</li>
            <li> Outstanding product that can be replaced by other products. Price way t</li>
            <li> I used this product three times a week. The colour is not longlasting and yopu need to put on several time to achieve a right colour for gray hair. It&#x27;s not bad, but is just Ok,.</li>
            <li> and \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; on the same site is rated \\&quot;8\\&quot;. driving a car I suspect would rate 28. Or consuming a typical US of A fast food meal 18. Do you want to live forever or look like you are?</li>
            <li> only a fool would pay this price</li>
            <li> priced $12. over retail price.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my self have been using it for years hope I can still keep getting it</li>
            <li> my husband loves this product it help his hair stay grey instead of white i will keep on buying this for him forever</li>
            <li> only one small tube, thought it would be three. this is a huge overcharge rip off . vendor should be banned from amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It took about 3 weeks before some of my original hair color came through.  This is mentioned in the literature.&lt;br /&gt;I was aware that this DOES NOT RESTORE your hair color but brings some of it back.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a product to bring your hair color back, this is not the product for you. Use a dye.  This helps restore SOME of your natural hair color over a period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that this product does contain lead and is also stated in the accompanying literature. Also, once the desired color is reached you have to continue using it less frequently to maintain the restored hair color.&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time, I tend to feel that there is a limit as to how long the &amp;#34;restored&amp;#34; color will last.&lt;br /&gt;I think that this cream is better to use than the liquid.</li>
            <li> I tried Grecian Formula 16 Cream Men Size: 2 oz., on and off for several months. I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of outright dying my hair because I feel you&#x27;re trying to hide what makes you who you really are. I&#x27;m not embarrassed by gray hair because I&#x27;ve had it ever since I was a late teen, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind decreasing the amount of gray that I have. I&#x27;d prefer the salt/pepper look rather to having all gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this product is the awful smell when you rub it into your hair and scalp. Thankfully the smell quickly dissipates. This product supposedly changes your hair back to it&#x27;s natural color but I noticed that it changed my hair to a pale yellow. When my co-workers began asking me what was going on with my hair, I decided to stop using this product. It might work fine for some customers but it didn&#x27;t work very well for me. It took several weeks for my hair to turn back to its natural gray after I stopped using it. In addition, this product is a bit greasy and contains Lead Acetate. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a good idea to be using this stuff in the first place. Just because you can purchase a health or beauty product does not make it safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please rate this review if you found it helpful.</li>
            <li> I must say that it works very well.  The foam did not work but I&#x27;m very pleased with the cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than wonderful  .... after two weeks you cant  believe Thats your hair ...... But you must know how to used</li>
            <li> I have ginger hair and the color blends in well.&lt;br /&gt;I like the cream because it works as a conditioner and it also brigs back the waves in my hair.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to work, and does not last very long before needing a reapplication. I have been looking for a replacement but have not found anything yet.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product and we can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore for some reason.  This company gave a reasonable price and got it to us very quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is a great improvement over the original liquid formula sold in the stores. It is even better than the foam version they sold. The verdict is still out on how well it works though.</li>
            <li> Have been using  this product for a long time. I&#x27;m sorry that it is being dis-continued. Thanks for carrying it. I can use&lt;br /&gt;it a while longer. Thanks again!  Lloyd</li>
            <li> Our local stores no longer carry the Grecian Formula Cream.  The liquid drips but the cream works perfectly around the hairline.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the product but it should only cost less than $10...the price on line anywhere is prohibitive and I don&#x27;t understand why.  My husband like the cream not the liquid and drugstores don&#x27;t seem to cary the cream any longer.</li>
            <li> I like it and use it regularly, will come back to you with my next order&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best regards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fahd kassis</li>
            <li> The product worked, maybe even better than advertised.  Within three weeks the desired color (dark brown, with a little gray), was achieved.  The directions noted that should only wash hair once a week until the desired color is obtained, but I washed it more often and still had the benefit of color.  The only drawback was the smell.  Not bad in maintenance mode, but it was bad during the initial period.  The look and feel is great and would have given it five stars for performance, but the odor knocked it down to four.</li>
            <li> I have been using Grecian Formula foam for several months prior to trying the cream. I didn&#x27;t really like the mess of the foam, so after reading several reviews here on Amazon, I thought I would try the cream. Well, the cream, in my opinion, does not do nearly as good a job of removing the gray as the foam. When I first started using the foam I saw results in days. With the cream, which I have been using for weeks now, I have not experienced the same good results as with the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this item. I think that the foam gets much better results at least for me anyway. I&#x27;m gonna pitch this tube and buy a new can of foam today.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on-line because it&#x27;s become very difficult to find in stores.  Only the liquid and foam versions are readily available, and I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; versions as much as the cream.  I understand that the company is discontinuing the cream this year, so I wanted to have some saved in reserve.  I believe that it has a shelf life of up to three years.  I&#x27;ve used Grecian Formula Cream for 3 or 4 years and have been very satisfied with it.  It darkens your hair color gradually, so people don&#x27;t notice a sudden change.  Some parts of my hair are pretty resistant, but that&#x27;s OK.  I&#x27;m only trying to keep my hair with a salt-and-pepper look, rather than turning it from all white to all black.  The trick is to apply it to dry hair.  Use a hair dryer if you have to before applying this product.  Also, there is lead in the formula and it can have a chemical smell when first applied, so I usually spray a fine mist of cologne over my hair after putting on the cream.  Don&#x27;t use too much cologne or you&#x27;ll wet the hair and diminish its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Far too expensive now. Switch to Youthhair</li>
            <li> this is only a simply white cream , no color present  at any time , in the past i bougth  sevral , the same product with color . also it smell a lot</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make this stuff anymore.  Nice to find it at a reasonable price.</li>
