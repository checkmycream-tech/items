            <li>it works perfectly with</li>
            <li>LOVE these!!!</li>
            <li>And the grip on it is very good.  </li>
            <li>The one that just broke was tortoiseshell, and blended in beautifully with brown hair.</li>
            <li>product arrived on time and was in great shape.  </li>
            <li>so i decided to see if i could find it online and was happy when i did.</li>
            <li>Great clamp.</li>
            <li>my fine hair - price was good and service was speedy!</li>
            <li>I would buy them out of stores until they were no longer available, which upset me greatly.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I like it.  </li>
            <li>I feel it gives a kind of and alternative fashion feeling like wearing your hair up with chopsticks might.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and the clip arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find the exact clip -</li>
            <li>I like the style of this clip, but it&#x27;s honestly huge!</li>
            <li>this clip is so insanely huge!</li>
            <li>I love this hair clip.</li>
            <li>It has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to find them online.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>This claw is okay, but it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair well.</li>
            <li>Love this style clip.  </li>
            <li>Love the ease and function as well as diversity of looks.</li>
            <li>i dont even know if it is successful holding my hair because it is so large it bothers me to wear it.</li>
            <li>and it worked wonderfully; when i tried using this one to do that, my bun just comes loose</li>
            <li>but don&#x27;t expect it to hold all of your hair up in a bun or for really secure holds; in that case you&#x27;ll need to find a stronger, more heavy-duty clip.</li>
            <li>It does grip the hair nicely, and I think it looks more modern than a lot of products on the market.</li>
            <li>Holds lots of hair and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>The best thing is it holds up heavy hair without digging into your scalp or sliding out, as others do.  </li>
            <li>This hair clip provides an quick and easy way to put hair up in a bun.</li>
            <li>In the description it did not say large, but it is huge!  </li>
            <li>Other than that, great product from Goody, as always.  </li>
            <li>And they are so easy to put into your long hair, catching all the tendrils.  </li>
            <li>Holds tight and looks very nice.</li>
            <li>You will want a few of these clamps so great they come in 3 pack</li>
            <li>I think it is a fun alternative on some days.  </li>
            <li>This clip is very large.</li>
            <li>First off, this is a very large clip.  </li>
            <li>That being said, that wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting when I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Love these clips and can&#x27;t find them locally anymore.  </li>
            <li>maybe the smaller size is better?</li>
            <li>To be fair, though, it does manage to grab all of my hair at once which not many clips of this style can do.</li>
            <li>Kind of a metallic green/grey with black splotches.</li>
            <li>With this clip, I have thrown my hair up without looking in a mirror and cleaned my whole apartment</li>
            <li>Paid twice as much as when were sold in stores and NOT what was advertised.  </li>
            <li>I am stock-piling against them not being available in the future.</li>
            <li>Overall, a nice alternative to a regular pony tail holder.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace one that recently broke after many years of frequent use.</li>
            <li>I am petite, but I have a pretty big head, and you can see the edges of this clip when you are looking at me straight on.  </li>
            <li>I bought this clip years ago and needed a new one -</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the type of thing I&#x27;d wear to my job in a professional office setting.</li>
            <li>and I really feel like the visibility of the underside of this clip is not properly represented on the page, so that is why I have knocked off a star.  </li>
            <li>I bought this clip to replace some of my less attractive and outdated claw clips.</li>
            <li>and i can feel that the clip isn&#x27;t gripping very hard, so</li>
            <li>For perspective, my hair is only slightly thicker than average, slightly more than shoulder length, and straight/wavy in texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is also very cheaply-made compared to the other one; it feels like it will break with only the slightest use.</li>
            <li>overall, i love the design of this clip and how big it is (approximately 4 inches by 2.75 inches).</li>

            <li> I have long, straight, thick hair, and while it could hold all my hair, the jaws were weak and my hair easily fell out.</li>
            <li> My hair is long but silky/fine.</li>
            <li> i think if you&#x27;re using this clip to hold half of your hair up and leave half of it down, it should work fine as i have used it for that a few times.</li>
            <li> and it never really budged or let any big chunks of hair loose.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I wouldn&#x27;t wear it a lot of places due to it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, i feel like this clip that i purchased is not strong enough to really hold my hair, unless it&#x27;s only clipping a little bit.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, as I had LOVED the previous one.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it four and a half stars, but I can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> i previously used my clip that looked like this to hold my hair in a bun</li>
            <li> is a gaudy black with gold/silver splotches and a tan underside that shows when worn.  </li>
            <li> and I usually can&#x27;t keep it in a hair tie even just while I&#x27;m sitting at my desk, or my hairstyle will come undone.  </li>
            <li> (I have a lot of hair, so it&#x27;s thick and goes a bit past my shoulders, but each individual strand is silky, so it tends to slide out of hair clips, and sadly this one is no exception).</li>
            <li> Would work for someone with a lot of thick hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was just a little small.</li>
            <li> This is only clip that holds my hair up..too bad they quit selling it in stores.</li>
            <li> i had a clip of this style a few years ago and was really sad when it broke!</li>
            <li> It’s so ugly</li>
            <li> VERY unhappy.  </li>
            <li> Very, very, very unhappy that the color advertised is not the color shipped.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed!!</li>

            <li> I bought this clip to replace some of my less attractive and outdated claw clips. I like to pull my hair back with it while doing housework, washing my face, or whenever the mood strikes. I like the style of this clip, but it&#x27;s honestly huge! This isn&#x27;t the type of thing I&#x27;d wear to my job in a professional office setting. Actually, I wouldn&#x27;t wear it a lot of places due to it&#x27;s size. It does grip the hair nicely, and I think it looks more modern than a lot of products on the market. Overall, a nice alternative to a regular pony tail holder.</li>
            <li> In the description it did not say large, but it is huge!  Would work for someone with a lot of thick hair.</li>
            <li> Holds lots of hair and is comfortable to wear. The only problem I have is that they do break more&lt;br /&gt;easily than the cheapie hair clips you get at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clip. It has been my favorite for years. I would buy them out of stores until they were no longer available, which upset me greatly. I was so pleased to find them online. Shipping was quick and the clip arrived in great condition. Not I treat it with kid gloves when not in my hair. It is the only clip I can wear that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li> First off, this is a very large clip.  I am petite, but I have a pretty big head, and you can see the edges of this clip when you are looking at me straight on.  To be honest, I like it.  I feel it gives a kind of and alternative fashion feeling like wearing your hair up with chopsticks might.  I think it is a fun alternative on some days.  That being said, that wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting when I bought it.  To be fair, though, it does manage to grab all of my hair at once which not many clips of this style can do. And the grip on it is very good.  My hair is quit slippery and I usually can&#x27;t keep it in a hair tie even just while I&#x27;m sitting at my desk, or my hairstyle will come undone.  Sometimes the hair tie will just fall out.  With this clip, I have thrown my hair up without looking in a mirror and cleaned my whole apartment and it never really budged or let any big chunks of hair loose.  For perspective, my hair is only slightly thicker than average, slightly more than shoulder length, and straight/wavy in texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived on time and was in great shape.  I wish I could give it four and a half stars, but I can&#x27;t and I really feel like the visibility of the underside of this clip is not properly represented on the page, so that is why I have knocked off a star.  Other than that, great product from Goody, as always.  And well shipped.</li>
            <li> Love. Love. LOVE these!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only clip that will stay in my hair! Love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this clip exclusively for years. My hair is long but silky/fine. This is only clip that holds my hair up..too bad they quit selling it in stores.</li>
            <li> i had a clip of this style a few years ago and was really sad when it broke! so i decided to see if i could find it online and was happy when i did. unfortunately, i feel like this clip that i purchased is not strong enough to really hold my hair, unless it&#x27;s only clipping a little bit. i previously used my clip that looked like this to hold my hair in a bun and it worked wonderfully; when i tried using this one to do that, my bun just comes loose and i can feel that the clip isn&#x27;t gripping very hard, so then my bun eventually falls out.     i think if you&#x27;re using this clip to hold half of your hair up and leave half of it down, it should work fine as i have used it for that a few times. overall, i love the design of this clip and how big it is (approximately 4 inches by 2.75 inches). but don&#x27;t expect it to hold all of your hair up in a bun or for really secure holds; in that case you&#x27;ll need to find a stronger, more heavy-duty clip.</li>
            <li> This hair clip provides an quick and easy way to put hair up in a bun. Holds tight and looks very nice.</li>
            <li> This claw is okay, but it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair well. (I have a lot of hair, so it&#x27;s thick and goes a bit past my shoulders, but each individual strand is silky, so it tends to slide out of hair clips, and sadly this one is no exception).</li>
            <li> This clip is very large. I have long, straight, thick hair, and while it could hold all my hair, the jaws were weak and my hair easily fell out. No point in having a clip that can&#x27;t hold my hair!</li>
            <li> Love these clips and can&#x27;t find them locally anymore.  Shown is a tortoise brown clip, received is a gaudy black with gold/silver splotches and a tan underside that shows when worn.  VERY unhappy.  Paid twice as much as when were sold in stores and NOT what was advertised.  Very, very, very unhappy that the color advertised is not the color shipped.</li>
            <li> I bought this clip years ago and needed a new one - I was so happy to find the exact clip - it works perfectly with my fine hair - price was good and service was speedy!</li>
            <li> Love this style clip.  Unfortunately, it was just a little small.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace one that recently broke after many years of frequent use. The one that just broke was tortoiseshell, and blended in beautifully with brown hair. Thought from the picture that this one was tortoiseshell as well. Not so. It’s hideous-looking. Kind of a metallic green/grey with black splotches. It’s so ugly I’m embarrassed to wear it to work. Very disappointed, as I had LOVED the previous one. This one is also very cheaply-made compared to the other one; it feels like it will break with only the slightest use. Hideous-looking brittle plastic. VERY disappointed!! I want to find another like the one I’ve been using for years!!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sell these in the stores anymore and the prices online are going up!  The best thing is it holds up heavy hair without digging into your scalp or sliding out, as others do.  And they are so easy to put into your long hair, catching all the tendrils.  I am stock-piling against them not being available in the future.</li>
            <li> this clip is so insanely huge! i dont even know if it is successful holding my hair because it is so large it bothers me to wear it. maybe the smaller size is better?</li>
            <li> Love the ease and function as well as diversity of looks. Great clamp. You will want a few of these clamps so great they come in 3 pack</li>
