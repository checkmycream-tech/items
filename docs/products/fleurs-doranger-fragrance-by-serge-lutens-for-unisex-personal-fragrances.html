    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not overpowering, just the perfect amount to keep you guessing.)</li>
            <li>Smells delicious.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect fragrance for Spring.</li>
            <li>so I was very happy finding this deal.</li>
            <li>but I decided to try, sight unseen, this great fragrance by Serge Lutens.</li>
            <li>My FAVORITE fragrance and WHAT an amazing price!!</li>
            <li>Beautiful perfume, love it</li>
            <li>Was in perfect condition, arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Heat, sweat and humidity do not change the wonderful, fresh scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>- you get a hint of jasmine, rose &amp; tuberose.  </li>
            <li>I will buy another for travel because this is a nice size perfume to pack</li>
            <li>But there is more to it</li>
            <li>Not the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; scent of lovely orange blossom.</li>
            <li>The tuberose and white jasmine are perfectly balanced with the orange blossom, and I love how it is forever changing as it wears on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love, love love this.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume and has been for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Still love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being EDP it&#x27;s a bit strong and one needs not to &amp;#34;drench&amp;#34; in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the perfect perfume for year round use in a tropical environment.</li>
            <li>I love it, love it, and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fleurs D&#x27;oranger is now one of my favorite perfumes, right up there with Jean Duprez Bal a Versailles and Guerlain&#x27;s Samsara.</li>
            <li>And full, FULL of chemicals per box.</li>
            <li>Both customer service reps were in full agreement with me that since no disclosure on either count, funds would be returned.</li>
            <li>Its scent is a wonderful deep and heady aroma of orange blossoms and white flowers with a just a hint of spice.</li>
            <li>As always, SL fragrances disappear quickly on me, so I use them on clothes and hair rather than skin.</li>
            <li>No avant garde trickery with this, no crazy indoles or pencil shavings or hot light bulbs, just a straightforward feminine floral.</li>
            <li>This particular stock is quite recent (i believe 2012) and definitely a great purchase, compares to $120 retail.</li>
            <li>This scent is so clean and pretty</li>
            <li>Its fresh smell is not overpowering and leaving a lingering smell that everyone comments on.</li>
            <li>They were as usual, great.</li>
            <li>Price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased a sample of this online after reading its description and reviews.</li>
            <li>i love the smell, but unless i soak myself in it, it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This is the exact perfume that is available at a local boutique for $120, so that is almost a $50 savings here.</li>
            <li>only thing going for it is the bottle looks vintage, so sits on my shelf looking pretty ;)!!</li>
            <li>careful who you purchase this from - there are many counterfeits.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the orange flower much, but maybe it just balances the heavier jasmine/tuberose and keeps them from being overpowering.</li>
            <li>It lasts the whole day and into the evening.</li>
            <li>The dry down is absolutely wonderful, and on me its lasting power is about 7 hours.</li>
            <li>fragrance is long lasting and pleasing to those around me as I&#x27;ve received many compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li>This one is not quite as \\&quot;twisted\\&quot; as some of their other collaborations but it is unique.  </li>
            <li>I just sprayed a small amount and the scent is just lovely.</li>
            <li>Soft fragrance that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This is a soft, light version of florals which are often full-on powerhouse notes, so if you like tuberose but find it too heavy this is one to try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare and hard to find</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This is like putting your nose inside a bitter orange blossom; you can practically feel the pollen.  But there is more to it - you get a hint of jasmine, rose &amp; tuberose.  The tuberose is the sharp/green type, not the buttery type.  There is some citrus accent and underneath all of this is caraway &amp; civet - they make it not strictly a flower scent but a little animalic.  Serge Lutens and Christopher Sheldrake are known for throwing in a twist when they design a fragrance.  This one is not quite as \\&quot;twisted\\&quot; as some of their other collaborations but it is unique.  I would get a sample before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sillage is to arm length.  This fades on my skin within 4 hours.  I wish it lasted longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful who you purchase this from - there are many counterfeits.  I have never gotten a counterfeit when I buy \\&quot;Ships From &amp; Sold By Amazon\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I use almost exclusively 24 Faubourg by Hermes but I decided to try, sight unseen, this great fragrance by Serge Lutens. I absolutely love it! I just sprayed a small amount and the scent is just lovely. The bottle has both the splash option as well as the spray feature. This particular stock is quite recent (i believe 2012) and definitely a great purchase, compares to $120 retail.</li>
            <li> Not the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; scent of lovely orange blossom. And full, FULL of chemicals per box. One ingredient had 24 letters. It&#x27;s a powdery sweet/chemically after scent.&lt;br /&gt;Called amazon to return and they said such a product can&#x27;t be returned. I asked for evidence on their site of such disclosure. None. Also sought disclosure of the ingredients on line. None. Both customer service reps were in full agreement with me that since no disclosure on either count, funds would be returned. They were as usual, great. Stay away from such a yucky fragrance.</li>
            <li> I first purchased a sample of this online after reading its description and reviews. Fleurs D&#x27;oranger is now one of my favorite perfumes, right up there with Jean Duprez Bal a Versailles and Guerlain&#x27;s Samsara. Its scent is a wonderful deep and heady aroma of orange blossoms and white flowers with a just a hint of spice. (I smell the cumin and nutmeg but it&#x27;s not overpowering, just the perfect amount to keep you guessing.) The tuberose and white jasmine are perfectly balanced with the orange blossom, and I love how it is forever changing as it wears on my skin. The dry down is absolutely wonderful, and on me its lasting power is about 7 hours. I love it, love it, and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Beautiful perfume, love it</li>
            <li> Love, love love this.  Serge Lutens, is a genius.</li>
            <li> This is probably the most disgusting scent ever in a perfume. Smells like a heavy-chemical sunscreen scent. Amazon will not allow me to return and i would be embarassed to give it to anyone; it is that bad. Stay away!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is the quintessential orange blossom fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being EDP it&#x27;s a bit strong and one needs not to &amp;#34;drench&amp;#34; in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is long lasting and pleasing to those around me as I&#x27;ve received many compliments when wearing it.</li>

As always, SL fragrances disappear quickly on me, so I use them on clothes and hair rather than skin.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious.  Was in perfect condition, arrived quickly.  Price was very reasonable.  I will buy another for travel because this is a nice size perfume to pack and I think the bottle looks sturdy enough to take with me.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE fragrance and WHAT an amazing price!!</li>
            <li> when ever i wear this perfume everyone asks what it is, to me it smells a little like jasmine ,</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and has been for over 10 years. Its fresh smell is not overpowering and leaving a lingering smell that everyone comments on.</li>
            <li> Im sure this is fake, smells off!!! I smelt it in MeccaCosmetica but i purchase from Amazon because of price difference.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing going for it is the bottle looks vintage, so sits on my shelf looking pretty ;)!!</li>
            <li> Love this. Soft fragrance that lasts all day. I get compliments wherever I go. It is the perfect fragrance for Spring.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff so I guess so do I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the perfect perfume for year round use in a tropical environment. Heat, sweat and humidity do not change the wonderful, fresh scent of this perfume. It lasts the whole day and into the evening. And it&#x27;s not just me talking, based on the compliments I receive.</li>
            <li> i love the smell, but unless i soak myself in it, it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day. Still love it</li>
            <li> This is the exact perfume that is available at a local boutique for $120, so that is almost a $50 savings here. It&#x27;s rare and hard to find so I was very happy finding this deal. This scent is so clean and pretty and you only need a little.</li>
