            <li>It gives my skin a nice matted appearance and makeup goes on nicely over it.  </li>
            <li>and I think this is a result of heredity, taking care of my skin, using sun block and effective products like this.</li>

            <li>I have used this product for over a month now and feel it to be the best thus far.</li>
            <li>You will see lots of good reviews but manufacturer promises another bottle for free if you put a review up on the site and let them know.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>The combination is absolutely wonderful for soft, smooth, youthful looking skin!</li>

            <li>I was really excited about this serum at first--the ingredients list looked nice and simple (no harmful ingredients like citrus peel oils, which can cause burns upon exposure to sunlight), the price was great for the size, it&#x27;s formulated at the optimum concentration (20%), and I liked the consistency</li>

            <li>I think it may even reduce the fine lines.</li>

            <li>The best part about it is that I have told a few of my friends and even my mom about this product</li>
            <li>There was a phone number on the packaging to call for a free bottle, and I did so.  </li>

            <li>pretty good at first.....</li>
            <li>After buying this, she&#x27;s had good results so far.</li>
            <li>I have so many products that are &amp;#34;suppose&amp;#34; to help your skin look better and, hopefully, reduce wrinkles as much as a &amp;#34;face product&amp;#34; can.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I chose this particular serum because it provided twice the volume of most vitamin C/ hyaluronic acid serums for a better price.</li>
            <li>Laugh lines near my eyes and mouth are invisible, and the best result of all is that a deep frown line between my brows is completely smooth!</li>
            <li>I think this will be good for my skin, and it seems to be strong enough to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>I love this serum so much!</li>
            <li>I definitely will be ordering again, so glad found the perfect vitamin C serum finally!</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t expect any miracles at my age, I am pretty sure results will continue to improve the longer</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for 2 1/2 weeks, and can already see a remarkable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>i found this product and she was hesitant at first, but after 2 weeks, I was ordering more.  </li>
            <li>Someday I&#x27;ll learn not to get excited about products that make promises.</li>
            <li>I not only look more relaxed but as a consequence I am feeling more relaxed as well!</li>
            <li>I am also familiar with the curative power of vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>But so far I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>I am hoping that by the time I am finished with my first bottle, another month or so, most of my fine-lines will disappear.  </li>
            <li>The first time I opened the bottle, serum spurted from it and the contents oozed to the top preventing me from reinserting the dropper in order to reseal the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love the product after using it my face felt soft and silky, I intend to purchase more but don&#x27;t forget my free bottle</li>
            <li>Although I have not noticed any significant change in my wrinkles, my skin is noticeably softer and supple when this serum is on.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with this product when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>Many others comment on my facial skin in how nice it looks.</li>
            <li>The product was originally clear, smelled nice and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>My daughter told me my skin looked beautiful the other day and someone who knew I just had a birthday thought it was my 50th...</li>
            <li>So far I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Really helps with fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 77 and, while my skin is in pretty good shape because I&#x27;m not a sun-bather, it is 77 years old.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product that is very affordable!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an esthetician, so I&#x27;m always looking for products at a fair price that actually work.  </li>
            <li>I also like that they provide twice as much product as most of the competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am surprised by my own vanity....</li>

            <li>I am pleased with the product and it has worked very well.</li>
            <li>Threw away the bottle and it was 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>I asked for a refund and they gave me a full refund</li>
            <li>My skin is much brighter and more radiant than ever.</li>
            <li>have been using the product for over a month morning and night and already friends are commenting on how good my skin looks, ruddiness is gone and pores are smaller.  </li>
            <li>am satisfied with my results and the purchase, cost of the serum is reasonable than any other.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only good thing I can see about this product.</li>
            <li>I use Retin-A with this product and still no bad reaction.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not a bad product ive noticed my skin smoothing out from using it a couple of weeks now.</li>
            <li>Just wish they could make it smell a little more pleasant.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist previously suggested Botox injections to solve that problem, but I won&#x27;t need Botox now that I plan to continue using Advanced Vitamin C. Great value, full 2 oz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use after shaving makes the skin smooth and hydrates it very well.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use after shaving makes the skin smooth and hydrates it very well.</li>
            <li>The serum has a lightweight texture, layers nicely under my daily SPF 30 moisturizer, and mixes easily with argan oil at night.  </li>
            <li>The first one I associated easily with another vitamin C product</li>
            <li>It feels soft, and some of the fine lines seem to be getting better.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced this with my other serums.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>So unless you want to pay triple the cost or more from the typical boutique or popular brands who seem to make use of these toxins on a greater scale (higher up on the ingredient list)</li>
            <li>Feels so clean and fresh on my skin.</li>
            <li>I apply it directly to clean skin and once it has absorbed I apply a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Hope this review can help, there are so many different products, it becomes overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Received quickly in the mail after ordered.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 bottles and it came quickly.  </li>
            <li>the mild scent is almost unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are many products like this one out there, though this one provides a larger quantity then most.</li>
            <li>The vitamin C serum came quickly in mail.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a better skin texture and a healthy glow, especially when I use it in conjunction with a mild glycolic face cream.</li>
            <li>Skin gets smoother and softer, clearer and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>It did arrive quickly as promised.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have found this Vitamin C serum to be every bit as effective as other things I have used that cost more.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and will continue to keep this as part of my daily regiment.</li>
            <li>It does a great job fading my dark spots</li>
            <li>I am having good results with Vitamin C serum and am receiving compliments on my skin which hasn&#x27;t happened in a long time.  </li>
            <li>And here in Central Texas humidity, I appreciate light weight, oil-free but very effective hydration for my 50 year old skin.</li>
            <li>This is really easy to use and it works really well.</li>
            <li>This product not only did what it said it would, but it did more!</li>
            <li>My skin was smoother and more clear after just 4 nights!</li>
            <li>I am well aware of my face!</li>
            <li>THE FIRST!</li>
            <li>I get questions now about how old I am and nobody can guess, and this is a pleasant surprise for me as a busy mom with all of today&#x27;s trails.  </li>
            <li>The serum feels sticky right after application, but soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different types of creams, moisturizers but found out that anything containing vitamin c is very good for the skin.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great and it takes just a few drops to do the job.  </li>
            <li>Each bottle was shipped extremely fast, serum consistency smooth each time,</li>
            <li>This serum makes skin smooth and does really minimize wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>So far enjoying the use of the product.  </li>
            <li>I felt that using an even number (3 on each side) was easier to deal with, and 2 drops for neck, lip edges, cheeks and forehead did not seem enough to spread nicely.</li>
            <li>Skin appears fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 53 years old and love the sun.</li>
            <li>and so far I really love it.  </li>
            <li>The smell does not bother me at all-it has no artificial fragrance</li>
            <li>a more even look a young look</li>
            <li>Not only did I feel young and look young again, but people at stores and parties where even complimenting how well I looked, this stuff is truly a wonderful product, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything else to replace it with!</li>
            <li>I have noticed my smile lines and the lines on my forehead softening.</li>
            <li>So worth</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin is getting more soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I made a second apt to get it touched up again, and cancelled it bc</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;xxxx&lt;br /&gt;xxxxx&lt;br /&gt;xxxxx</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a try for those who are seeking skin irritation relief.</li>
            <li>Skin appears fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I checked the reviews before I bought it and have to say that my experience has been very positive.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m not positive but my skin looks good</li>
            <li>In a short time I have been able to see a significant change in the lines around my lips.</li>
            <li>As others have indicated, this vitamin C serum is a bit sticky at first, but absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Was taken aback at first by the smell, but that quickly dissipates.  </li>
            <li>Human immune and respiratory toxicant or allergen - strong evidence (Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics)&lt;br /&gt;Human skin toxicant or allergen - strong evidence</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you for sending the right product.</li>
            <li>This serum delivers swift results: I saw an improvement in my skin&#x27;s tone and texture right away.</li>
            <li>alot  seems  to  absorb  right into  </li>
            <li>I use this serum 3-4 times a week in the evening after cleansing and toning  right before I apply my night crème.</li>
            <li>a difference.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice fresh scent and the liquid sinks quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s contents all over your bag</li>
            <li>loss even more apparent!</li>
            <li>I liked this product because it was light in weight and hydrated into my skin almost immediately giving it a slight feeling of tightening the skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now for 4-5 weeks, and while it might be easy to convince myself that my my skin is definitely brighter and smoother, other people have asked me what I&#x27;m doing because my skin looks great</li>
            <li>I have fair skin which is very sensitive from decades of using prescription Retin-A products and from my having had several laser resurfacing treatments.  </li>
            <li>First off, let me say I am not affiliated with the company, and I rarely bother to write reviews.</li>
            <li>For people with sensitive skin, rosacea, or who choose to avoid ingredients that score as potentially or definitely *unsafe for use* on the Cosmetics Database website, you might purchase this serum as I did, expecting to be able to use it safely.  </li>
            <li>For people with sensitive skin, rosacea, or who choose to avoid ingredients that score as potentially or definitely *unsafe for use* on the Cosmetics Database website, you might purchase this serum as I did, expecting to be able to use it safely.  </li>
            <li>so keep it in a dark place and keep the cap good</li>
            <li>Upon applying, I felt the tingling and mild stinging that always accompanies pure C serum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It calms my skin down well, and feels good.</li>
            <li>They never responded to me when i called them on it, and again, I have no idea if this is now the new product being sold here or just something they do to appease those trying to get a free bottle by posting a review.</li>
            <li>I have diligently looked for a new product that can help me grow older more gracefully.</li>
            <li>Absorbing evenly and quickly without being sticky or oily.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great about this one is that it&#x27;s double the size but not double the price.  </li>
            <li>So far so good, only had this item 3 days!</li>
            <li>I use this daily and have seen great results, especially using this after derma rolling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my acne blemishes have faded and if I do get a new spot from a pimple the spot vanishes in a matter of DAYS - NOT WEEKS!!!  </li>
            <li>Makes skin very soft and smooth, and looking brighter.</li>
            <li>For best use, let it dry first before applying any other product.</li>
            <li>I do like this serum very much.  </li>
            <li>The 2oz bottle lasts about a month because you do not have to use very much.  </li>
            <li>This has more value for money since it&#x27;s twice the size of other available products.</li>
            <li>am 65 years old and wanted to freshen my skin, as well as treat fine lines, around the mouth...</li>
            <li>The amount is much more than the other products available.</li>
            <li>But then one day, I did a little google search and found out that Vitamin C is tremendous at making your skin look so much better!</li>
            <li>It stings a little on skin  but leaves it bright and radiant.</li>
            <li>the color was aready cloudy and orangy/yellow  after the first wk&lt;br /&gt;which</li>
            <li>I think the serum supposed to make my skin feel more moist but I am feeling the opposite.</li>
            <li>With continued use this product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>and I got exactly that plus a firming of the skin.</li>
            <li>Very well worth the expenditure.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and love it.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing again!! :)</li>
            <li>and I got exactly that plus a firming of the skin.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a couple of weeks and my skin is already looking more youthful and radiant.  </li>
            <li>Pores are smaller, skin looks more radiant.  </li>
            <li>Of the various Vitamin C products that I have tried with this form of Vitamin C, this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I let the serum &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; first.  </li>
            <li>I have no experience with this product, this is the first time I have purchased the item.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle a month ago.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>My skin is more even toned and my overall complexion is brighter.</li>
            <li>I have been using several different brands for the last year and this one has been the best.</li>
            <li>It appeared from the description this C serum would be the most likely to try.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for your product!</li>
            <li>Applying this serum is the first thing I do to my face in the morning and night</li>
            <li>But after using it and seeing the results I can gladly say that this is truly the thing you would want to help you feel and look younger!</li>
            <li>Did the first bottle help?</li>
            <li>definitely see a change in my skin for the better.</li>
            <li>But as with most things that are toxic that we ingest or use on a daily basis, it&#x27;s toxic at levels you would achieve over a year of use.</li>
            <li>You can even save the first dropper bottle and use it to refill.</li>
            <li>I love this product and am ordering it for the third time.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment!  </li>
            <li>I used my first bottle and like the immediate results.  </li>
            <li>I am 59 and aware of the aging process taking its toll on my skin.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>you so much for creating this product, PRI!</li>
            <li>brighter looking ,feel smoother and not expensive.</li>
            <li>If you are aging and looking to find something to do it more gracefully, add Vitamin C, Glycolic and Retinol creams to your daily routine.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>At first I did not see a difference but 30 days into it, my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many vitamin C serums over the last couple of years.</li>
            <li>I apply it twice daily and my skin appears tighter and more radiant.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully I will see more results in the next month</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, you do have to be aware of your current face &#x27;situation&#x27; to be able to notice a difference.</li>
            <li>Its not an overnight miracle, but, be consistent and it works.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I recieved was a liquid with a dropper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to buy more Vitamin C Serum for my facial care!</li>
            <li>With continued use this product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>Pretty transparently unethical on their part to leave the rest of the ingredients</li>
            <li>Pretty transparently unethical on their part to leave the rest of the ingredients</li>
            <li>and I love the way my facial skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, so I&#x27;ll probably buy this product again!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the overall results of this products.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my skin; as a result, I believe the Vitamin C serum has a lot to do with keeping my skin younger looking.</li>
            <li>but I will not give up because of that first morning when I thought it was a miracle.</li>
            <li>I love the product and especially the price-point.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s what the product is now or not, but this was the same bottle, but it had a white pump top and was more gel like, like antibacterial gel but with a pleasant floral scent.</li>
            <li>I feel like my face has less wrinkles and is more smooth.</li>
            <li>serum also incorporates ferulic acid, (sounds harsh because of the word acid, but its not, its actually great for sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you need to be realistic about its success.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth using.</li>
            <li>When using this product, make sure to only put a drop or two on a cotton swab and gently exfoliate on your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s potent yet gentle and noticeably brightens my skin and mood - a definite must-have.</li>
            <li>I do outdoor sports regularly and have been using my regular vitamin C on face with good results.</li>
            <li>Where some other products are rather gritty or sticky, this serum has a very smooth texture that&#x27;s easy to apply and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I find that the product absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves my face feeling so very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>but it really is doing the job at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use some kind of cleaning brush such as clarisonic because it can cause your pores to clog a little, but i can see the fading of the sun damage</li>
            <li>After a month I can see some positive results.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use C serum with expectations of continuing positive results.  </li>
            <li>I havent noticed much dryness or peeling and being the first serum I&#x27;ve used, I did expect this to be the case.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to exfoliate your face, this will do it pretty much on contact.</li>
            <li>I would pretty much dismiss any review that doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;Verified Purchase&amp;#34; with it.</li>
            <li>And can really see it working even after just the first application.  </li>
            <li>so I am not sure the consistency and color of this is good</li>
            <li>Enjoy getting twice the amount of other serums for a very economical price.</li>
            <li>I would rather pay more for a lesser amount of serum that is of high quality than pay for this gunk that resembles foul-smelling mucus.</li>
            <li>Bottle, Highly Concentrated 20% Vitamin C with Hyaluronic Acid for Skin Care, Look Younger and Feel Better</li>
            <li>high of a pH could have damaging effects on the skin, as well: &amp;#34;It is demonstrated that skin with pH values below 5.0 is in a better condition than skin with pH values above 5.0, as shown by measuring the biophysical parameters of barrier function, moisturization and scaling.</li>
            <li>A very good product for an unbelievable low price.  </li>
            <li>Something to help freshen up my skin and make me feel super young again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very simple and easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>and I honestly have seen less lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The contents of the bottle has not yet run out, even with using 12 large drops per day, as opposed to the 8-10 suggested.</li>
            <li>I thought that this serum would be an alternative to a pure hylauronic serum (which it contains), but its not working as well YET.</li>
            <li>but I certainly will order it again.  </li>
            <li>Large quantity.  </li>
            <li>I know that I have a big day the next day and want to look my best and helps reduce the puffy eyes and dark circles.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see what a few more weeks will do!</li>
            <li>The product smooths on very easily, and complete coverage of my face is achieved with less than a dropper full.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I began searching for a facial  product that would truly reduce fine lines and diminish wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It makes pores dissapear, skin smoother, glowing, younger, fine lines going away.  </li>
            <li>This Vitamin C Serum definitely works to decrease the fine lines and wrinkles on my face.  </li>
            <li>, I use vitamin C cream moisturizer,  it will observe it better, with out moisturizer it will dry your skin, otherwise it was a miracle for me!</li>
            <li>After using it for a week, I saw definite improvement in the fine lines around my eyes, and in the deeper wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of professional lines and have paid some good money for other products, but this by far has surpassed them all!!</li>
            <li>The mess left a bright orange stain on the porcelan bathtub: the stain could not be scrubbed off, but I finally was able to eliminate it by soaking with full-strength chlorine bleach.  </li>
            <li>I am shocked, happy, amazed and pleased.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, just using it for a few weeks got me amazing results..</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>I have absolutely noticed a difference since i&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>It really has made a difference for me.</li>
            <li>really see a differnce in the wrinkles or discolorations around the eyes</li>
            <li>It really improved the clarity and quality of my skin.  </li>
            <li>it is very drying to my skin.</li>
            <li>I have now ordered 7 bottles of this product, and can really see the results on my wife&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>This really does improve your skins texture and color.</li>
            <li>this  product is very sting and burning.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>The serum dries fast.</li>
            <li>Very sticky.</li>
            <li>The last two times I ordered the product, I received a \\&quot;bootleg\\&quot; bottle filled with what appeared to be aloe gel.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my wife, who&#x27;s been really depressed about how her skin has gotten over the years.</li>
            <li>For the reasonable price why not?</li>
            <li>The color very yellowish,</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I find that my skin reacts really well when I apply it morning and night.  </li>
            <li>None of these serums are really being sold any place else</li>
            <li>You have as much credibility as the planted reviews.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>But, it did make some deep and light wrinkles in my mother&#x27;s face go away.</li>
            <li>I researched a lot of companies and this company had the highest strength along with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>my wife really likes product</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling youthful and fresh with the glow that I had when I was 20 years old.</li>
            <li>The price at AMAZON was amazingly reasonable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has evened out my skin tone which makes my skin look so much clearer and healthier.  </li>
            <li>Exelent product, my clients see the difference compared to others products, thanks</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like tis product, still trying it out.</li>
            <li>Not only is this serum very inexpensive, it&#x27;s far better than Perricone.</li>
            <li>I thought you were much older&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is Fast absorbing, non-greasy, has no odor</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t really needed.  </li>
            <li>My opinion, works really well.</li>
            <li>And it really does lessen the deepness of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Also, the product came to me with a light yellow tint color, meaning that the product lost all of it</li>
            <li>so didn&#x27;t hold out much hope.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY REC THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>A real value.</li>
            <li>Apparently real vitamin c serum has a stinky scent.</li>
            <li>It really helped reneegize our skin.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much of the serum either.</li>
            <li>Really, nothing.</li>
            <li>Works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like how this product makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>To save myself from paying shipping again, I had hoped to get the supplier (Online Healthy Offers) to refund me without having to return the bottle, so I called their 801 number twice and only got voicemail - they never returned my calls.  </li>
            <li>and I saw better results as far as my skin being clearer, firmer, and has improved overall tone.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, many of the preservatives in this PRI serum do indeed bother my skin, which is extremely sensitive and reactive these days, and that&#x27;s the opposite of why I was buying this product.  </li>
            <li>I had a facial recently and the owner of the spa told me that vitamin C would be good for my 47-year old skin.</li>
            <li>I am so far liking the product and hope to see more results with further use.</li>
            <li>I saw there are some not so positive reviews on this particular brand</li>
            <li>After doing a lot of research on Vitamin C serums, I decided to give this a chance; not only does it contain what higher priced serums do, it was twice the amount of serum!!</li>
            <li>This like any other product must be used daily with a routine of good skin care.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because I was noticing fine lines around my mouth (smile lines) and wanted to fix some of my dark spots...</li>
            <li>Chose this rating because of dramatic difference in my skin after only a couple days,skin was noticeably brighter,tighter,and flawless looking.!!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have an immediate glow or change but from everthing I have read it can take several months for a significant change to appear</li>
            <li>I have definitely noticed a significant difference in the smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li>Most other serums are just 1 oz</li>
            <li>My review still stands below if the product is the same, but I&#x27;m not increasing the stars until they come clean about the review/free bottle scam.</li>
            <li>Improving the ability for your skin to absorb and add moisture is good too, especially before you use your typical moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty clear skin</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in the first two weeks that made a considerable difference in the appearance of my face.</li>
            <li>I look pretty old for my age.</li>
            <li>I can notice different in my skin, its clear, brighter and fine lines are getting smother.</li>
            <li>my face looks like new!</li>
            <li>package, guarantee, high quality, formulated in the U.S., and true results means I am definitely a fan of this product!</li>
            <li>Having tried many other products without much success, my doctor recommended using topical Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I think this Vitamin C serum has had more impact that previous products I have used.  </li>
            <li>While I had been enjoying that product, I couldn&#x27;t resist trying this one - half the price for twice the size!&lt;br /&gt;After a month of continuous am/pm application, scarring has faded and my skin looks brighter.  </li>
            <li>My older  sister got me started on it</li>
            <li>I love it now when people ask me my age as I look way younger than what I actually am.</li>
            <li>My decision in purchasing this particular product was that it contained both the Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid ingredients.  </li>
            <li>it dries quickly and leaves some thing like white powers.</li>
            <li>Very helpful to wait and apply to a clean and dry</li>
            <li>and I am getting constant compliments on my skin and for those that saw me before are asking me what am I doing because they say I look young and my skin looks smooth.</li>
            <li>this stuff really helps clear them up fast and you can feel it tightening your skin.</li>
            <li>And this serum also adds hyaluronic acid which can improve moisture retention and improve the absorption of the moisturizer you&#x27;re most likely following up with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;skin is even toned, brighter looking, healthy looking - don&#x27;t expect one product to do it all - basic cleansing care and moisturizing is critical</li>
            <li>I plan to keep using this particular one.  </li>
            <li>I just received my second bottle of this today and am glad to have it back in my beauty routine.  </li>
            <li>I got it mainly because I am doing home glycolic acid peels, and wanted this to use after.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m thinking the company is hoping most people will just keep the serum and not say anything once they realize the actual ingredients it contains, if they bother to read the tiny print on the bottle at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This particular brand is a value sized deal.</li>
            <li>Make certain to follow up w/ a good moisturizer as the serum makes your face feel a little dry.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I think I expected it to help with the fine lines I already have.</li>
            <li>and I have notice that those little lines are gone:).</li>
            <li>Packaging -clear clean simple.</li>
            <li>Too soon to assess, so far have not noticed much</li>
            <li>I have used over the years many different products that essentially exfoliate - usually, those more pharmaceutically driven.  </li>
            <li>Been using this product for a few weeks now and love  it.  </li>
            <li>but my skin looks fresh, brighter and overall healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Put a cream of your choice on top of the vit. c, finish by few drops of hylauronic acid serum and you will have a face like a baby in the morning.</li>
            <li>was a normal for that serum.</li>
            <li>Initially, I thought this serum was a great value, but I had to finish a different brand I had, so tried this once &amp; liked it, although I noticed a slightly unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice so far, so I can&#x27;t give a true review.  </li>
            <li>Oct, Pubmed ID 18489300)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to the company to ask about the target pH of their product, in case it&#x27;s normally supposed to be lower</li>
            <li>my co-worker asked me if I starting using different facial care cause my skin was so nice</li>
            <li>I love the consistency and it does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li>Previous bottles contained a much thicker gel product that was fabulous.</li>
            <li>This is a very high-quality facial product that when used regularly, will reveal significant results.  </li>
            <li>3 weeks isn&#x27;t much time, but I already think my little fine lines are diminished.  </li>
            <li>I then stored it in a cool, dry hall closet where I store all my toiletries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most products I&#x27;ve found are MUCH more expensive, but this serum has all of the necessary ingredients at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Every penny spent on the serum has been worth it!  </li>
            <li>I like the new pump instead of the dropper.  </li>
            <li>I also like the new texture of the product.</li>
            <li>I have paid almost $100 for Perricone vitamin C serum, so I decided to take a risk and try something new.</li>
            <li>am an African American man,  that is huge on appearance, so when I can get a product that will help me keep that youthfulness</li>
            <li>I ordered a different kind to compare the difference, although I like the other but have not used it as long as this serum, so I can not say the other is better than this one.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps those giving it a negative review already have too many wrinkles to notice a difference....or don&#x27;t truly look at their face much.</li>
            <li>Sadly, my face had turned darker and light pigmentation appeared which proved that this product just don&#x27;t work as most reviews claimed to be.</li>
            <li>I can understand trying to get reviews, and my review was pretty straightforward before I even knew how to get a free bottle, but if they&#x27;re sending you fake product to get a review, that&#x27;s just BS.</li>
            <li>I noticed after 2 weeks of use my skin felt tighter and very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>My skin was shiny and looked very young ...</li>
            <li>Easy to measure amount and mess</li>
            <li>Fine lines are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I add it last, because it seems to seal in whatever goes on first, and appears to tighten the skin.  </li>
            <li>and it still has the same consistency as when it first arrived.  </li>
            <li>completely gone!</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle of this four months ago and am now finishing my second bottle.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The next 3 bottles were a gel, in a pump bottle...not feeling anything or seeing the results I had at first.  </li>
            <li>The serum is slightly sticky , but you are supposed to apply a moisturizer over serums , so that works just fine.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen the same results like the ones I saw from the first morning of usage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because these particular (unmentioned) ingredients are considered unsafe for skin contact, I&#x27;m pasting in some info from the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database for you to consider before you decide whether to purchase this serum or not, because basing your decision on the Amazon listing alone isn&#x27;t providing the whole picture:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I figured this was an economical way to try a Vitamin C serum, and it goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li>My face is looking smooth, with less wrinkles.</li>
            <li>We tried it for a month and it&#x27;s starting to show positive results.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen any significant reduction in dark spots.</li>
            <li>my dermatologist recommended,  pat dry lightly, and apply this serum to face, neck and decolettage and, if there is any left over, to the backs of my hands.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin appear softer, and clear.</li>
            <li>Was a clear scented gel, not close to the product I ordered.</li>
            <li>I just turned 60 (people are shocked and never guess that I am 60) and I am being more and more picky with my skin care products.  </li>
            <li>Not giving up, will continue to use, so far no break outs or clogged pores.</li>
            <li>And I have noticed a marked improvement in</li>
            <li>Makes my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li>I have used various products on my face including straight vitamin C.</li>
            <li>I am 64 years old and would recommend this product for any age group that is concerned about reducing the appearance of wrinkles on their face and neck.</li>
            <li>I am 58 years old and my face is beginning to show my age.</li>
            <li>So far, its a keeper.  </li>
            <li>So far, I noticed that some brown spots around my cheeks are diminishing.</li>
            <li>So far I have not had a problem, but I don&#x27;t use it all the time.</li>
            <li>She has that glow back, it makes her really happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Complete BS.</li>
            <li>Seems like it has a lot of natural ingredients until you get to Benzyl Alcohol.</li>
            <li>and it has become a vital part of my skincare regime.</li>
            <li>Twice as much product as competitors for same price.  </li>
            <li>I am 62 years old, with some sun damage on my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft again.</li>
            <li>I  beginning to realize that Vitamin C is a big helper to gently lift sun damage, my brown spots are beginning to diminish.  </li>
            <li>I recomend you try this product if you want to have young healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li>Naturally, I will not buy from them again.  </li>
            <li>I like how it&#x27;s soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>MADE IT GREASE, DEVELOPED ACNE.</li>
            <li>At this price I am using it on underarm wobbles too, and they have smoothed out considerably.</li>
            <li>The only tricky part is the consistency, it seems that it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well</li>
            <li>After using this for around 4 weeks, the spots and marks on my face have since faded and my 36 year old skin feels rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>** UNETHICAL VENDOR \\&quot;NATURAL</li>
            <li>\\&quot;NATURAL</li>
            <li>\\&quot;NATURAL</li>
            <li>As an African-American w/ frequent hyperpigmentation from acne</li>
            <li>Its gel based and does not feel natural to me.  </li>
            <li>I have also developed acne.</li>
            <li>I am at the age when I start see my face turning old</li>
            <li>heavy,thick and feels like a coating on your face, until you sweat it off because your face cant breath, tried putting it on only at night, but really i couldn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li>So far, I think it&#x27;s doing the job I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it is important to cleanse your face well, and let dry for about 10 minutes, then apply the serum, and let dry.</li>
            <li>A few of them have lightened significantly, so it is working, but I think it is going to take a while.  </li>
            <li>If PRI stands behind their product and are reputable in the first place, all ingredients should have been listed in the Ingredients sections provided on the page -- not just the ingredients that are eye-catching to potential buyers.  </li>

            <li>face is getting back its natural glow, and no more spots :)</li>
            <li>I have been using this light serum for only two weeks and my face already looks firmer and my pores are less noticeable and my skin looks soft but not oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to a previous purchase that costs more but actually works.</li>
            <li>I can feel a slight burning which goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>The slight wrinkling that I have around my eyes have improved tremendously.</li>
            <li>This second bottle does not smell the same, does not have a dropper but a pump and is stickier than the first.</li>
            <li>I have experienced no adverse reactions from using this serum at least once per day, usually in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It is a little sticky and has a pretty strong slightly burnt orange smell.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Vitamin C Serum and found it to be helpful with fine lines and  minor skin discoloration due to age and sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>price, but not if the pH is too high for the product to actually have any effect.</li>
            <li>The fact that you get twice as much serum than the other brands and that it comes so highly recommended were the biggest deciding factors for me.  </li>
            <li>You should give it a try, there is no down side.</li>
            <li>so I shopped Amazon until I found a product that showed positive customer responses, a money back guarantee, and answers to my specific questions.</li>
            <li>I used it for many years a serum and cream of hyaluronic acid at nigth (it&#x60;s not good for use at sun ligth since it didn&#x60;t give protection).</li>
            <li>I use for many years a serum and cream of hyaluronic acid at nigth (it&#x60;s not good for use at sun ligth since it didn&#x60;t give protection).</li>
            <li>several weeks later, the top of the dropper had expanded to a round ball shape, and when I opened the bottle, it sounded like it was emitting gas.</li>
            <li>She is 45 years old and appears younger than her age, she takes care of herself, and does like to use natural products to maintain her skin.  </li>
            <li>It is thick and easy to spread.</li>
            <li>I have used several Vitamin C serums and I am so sad to say that this time bc of the good price i bought 3 of them (1 for my mom, and bf),</li>
            <li>The morning after I first applied this serum, I was shocked as to how clear and amazing my face looked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different vitamin C serums and I personally think that they are all pretty comparable.  </li>
            <li>Layering the right products retains moisture levels in my skin, resulting in less drought-ish appearance of skin.</li>
            <li>Some readers might find the article useful in understanding how serums work individually and how they interact with each other.  </li>
            <li>First impression, smell different, not bad but not pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly not a replacement for sunscreen, but I doubled the amount of the serum than normal after an extended day in the sun and it buffered the sun damage considerably!</li>
            <li>With a heart like a 25 year old, I&#x27;m not ready to look older than I feel.</li>
            <li>I have tough skin, nothing seems to give me the results that most people get, face peels don&#x27;t peel, like that.  </li>
            <li>I highly doubt they&#x27;re using the natural version as the synthetic &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34; version is widely used in skin care.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough, but I really do like the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so much firmer and the dark  age spots on my cheeks have lightened considerably.  </li>
            <li>I do not have deep wrinkles nor sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I only use it in the morning so far.</li>
            <li>(I presume from daily exposure to air), and it has developed a sharp/sour odor.  </li>
            <li>do indeed bother my skin, which is extremely sensitive and reactive these days, and that&#x27;s the opposite of why I was buying this product.  </li>
            <li>I can feel my face and it&#x27;s definitely made it healthier and really alive.</li>
            <li>With consistent use, it delivers clear, even toned skin, less visible wrinkles and a look of overall well being.  </li>
            <li>If I clean my face properly and use a face scrub, yes putting the serum on might result in a stinging sensation ( few seconds only)</li>
            <li>These results were obtained half way through the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum about month and half, after first week I can feel my skin gets smoother and softer and brighter.</li>
            <li>At first there may be some slight stinging, and if this occurs, use just once a day until your skin becomes accustom to the serum, then you can apply twice a day...</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I have only been using for a week or so because I wanted to use other product up first, but I did notice a difference in consistency, application, and absorption.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other Vitamin C Serums before, but really like this one.  </li>
            <li>wow, mom, your face looks ten years younger!</li>
            <li>My skin looks better and, although I am ultra sensitive, this isn&#x27;t irritating it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little sticky when first applied</li>
            <li>Having said that, this particular Vitamin C Serum is probably the most delicate (without the usual sting or burn upon application) that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The only negative comment I have is the smell, but the benefits are worth it!</li>
            <li>The first few times I felt a bit of a sting but now, nothing.  </li>
            <li>I apply a few drops - first thing after cleansing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about this product containing fresh vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>My skin is a little brighter and fine lines less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>If vitamin C treatment is purchased from a major cometic company, it is way more expensive.  </li>
            <li>Bought this item for my mother and other older family relatives.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C concentration added may have been 20%, but it is highly diluted by other ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Other HIGH concerns: Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs);</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old so the lines on my face are not new</li>
            <li>Then you can use your normal other skin preparations..</li>
            <li>Skin is much clearer and tight ordering my second bottle now</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and have spent a ton of time in the sun!</li>

            <li> After going through Health Food Stores and Amazon, what I found was an excellent Lab that was producing a Very high percentage of Vit. C</li>

            <li> The product does not have a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> i tried to return this product since this is regarding as a hazardous liquid  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best purchase I have ever made for myself.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a nice matted appearance and makeup goes on nicely over it.  </li>
            <li> and I think this is a result of heredity, taking care of my skin, using sun block and effective products like this.</li>
            <li> Seems effective.</li>
            <li> Nice bottle and dispenser.  </li>

            <li> You will see lots of good reviews but manufacturer promises another bottle for free if you put a review up on the site and let them know.</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> The combination is absolutely wonderful for soft, smooth, youthful looking skin!</li>

            <li> To be sincere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt better.</li>

            <li> I have had many complements</li>

            <li> I think it may even reduce the fine lines.</li>

            <li> Received this item with a HUGE bubble at the top...only to find out the contents were under pressure from the Arizona</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but even for my skin, which has been accustomed to the sloughing process, I find it sometimes to irritate causing a red look.  </li>
            <li> Can someone post the number to receive your free bottle.</li>
            <li> free 👍&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>

            <li> Apply after washing ( I use a light cleanser) skin damp and apply.</li>
            <li> Goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> Advanced Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid was the answer.</li>
            <li> This non-oily, unscented serum glides on creating a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> it makes more wrinkles when i smile.  </li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy this product like I do.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and hydrated.</li>

            <li> It will turn from a lemony creamy color to a darker brown color (almost like a light iodine color) as it oxidizes or degrades.</li>
            <li> skeptics, toxin freaks, feel free to reply.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum (2oz) - Advanced Vitamin C Serum for Face and Neck, 2oz/60ml</li>
            <li> There was number to call for free bottle</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even want a free one.</li>
            <li> The best part about it is that I have told a few of my friends and even my mom about this product</li>
            <li> There was a phone number on the packaging to call for a free bottle, and I did so.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, especially for the price you are getting a great product.</li>
            <li> Can feel the product when it is applied, dries to a smooth finish and diminishes the look of wrinkles and lines.</li>

            <li> Customer service is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This serum works great, my pores are smaller and my brown spots are going away, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> my face and neck area is also quite smooth.  </li>

            <li> pretty good at first.....</li>
            <li> After buying this, she&#x27;s had good results so far.</li>
            <li> I have so many products that are &amp;#34;suppose&amp;#34; to help your skin look better and, hopefully, reduce wrinkles as much as a &amp;#34;face product&amp;#34; can.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I chose this particular serum because it provided twice the volume of most vitamin C/ hyaluronic acid serums for a better price.</li>
            <li> Laugh lines near my eyes and mouth are invisible, and the best result of all is that a deep frown line between my brows is completely smooth!</li>
            <li> I think this will be good for my skin, and it seems to be strong enough to make a difference.  </li>
            <li> I love this serum so much!</li>
            <li> I definitely will be ordering again, so glad found the perfect vitamin C serum finally!</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t expect any miracles at my age, I am pretty sure results will continue to improve the longer</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for 2 1/2 weeks, and can already see a remarkable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> i found this product and she was hesitant at first, but after 2 weeks, I was ordering more.  </li>
            <li> Someday I&#x27;ll learn not to get excited about products that make promises.</li>
            <li> I not only look more relaxed but as a consequence I am feeling more relaxed as well!</li>
            <li> I am also familiar with the curative power of vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> But so far I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> I am hoping that by the time I am finished with my first bottle, another month or so, most of my fine-lines will disappear.  </li>
            <li> The first time I opened the bottle, serum spurted from it and the contents oozed to the top preventing me from reinserting the dropper in order to reseal the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I love the product after using it my face felt soft and silky, I intend to purchase more but don&#x27;t forget my free bottle</li>
            <li> Although I have not noticed any significant change in my wrinkles, my skin is noticeably softer and supple when this serum is on.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with this product when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> Many others comment on my facial skin in how nice it looks.</li>
            <li> The product was originally clear, smelled nice and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> My daughter told me my skin looked beautiful the other day and someone who knew I just had a birthday thought it was my 50th...</li>
            <li> So far I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Really helps with fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 77 and, while my skin is in pretty good shape because I&#x27;m not a sun-bather, it is 77 years old.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product that is very affordable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician, so I&#x27;m always looking for products at a fair price that actually work.  </li>
            <li> I also like that they provide twice as much product as most of the competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am surprised by my own vanity....</li>
            <li> A true thumbs up for this product.</li>

            <li> I am pleased with the product and it has worked very well.</li>
            <li> Threw away the bottle and it was 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> I asked for a refund and they gave me a full refund</li>
            <li> My skin is much brighter and more radiant than ever.</li>
            <li> have been using the product for over a month morning and night and already friends are commenting on how good my skin looks, ruddiness is gone and pores are smaller.  </li>
            <li> am satisfied with my results and the purchase, cost of the serum is reasonable than any other.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only good thing I can see about this product.</li>
            <li> I use Retin-A with this product and still no bad reaction.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not a bad product ive noticed my skin smoothing out from using it a couple of weeks now.</li>
            <li> Just wish they could make it smell a little more pleasant.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist previously suggested Botox injections to solve that problem, but I won&#x27;t need Botox now that I plan to continue using Advanced Vitamin C. Great value, full 2 oz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use after shaving makes the skin smooth and hydrates it very well.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use after shaving makes the skin smooth and hydrates it very well.</li>
            <li> The serum has a lightweight texture, layers nicely under my daily SPF 30 moisturizer, and mixes easily with argan oil at night.  </li>
            <li> The first one I associated easily with another vitamin C product</li>
            <li> It feels soft, and some of the fine lines seem to be getting better.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced this with my other serums.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> So unless you want to pay triple the cost or more from the typical boutique or popular brands who seem to make use of these toxins on a greater scale (higher up on the ingredient list)</li>
            <li> Feels so clean and fresh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I apply it directly to clean skin and once it has absorbed I apply a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Hope this review can help, there are so many different products, it becomes overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Received quickly in the mail after ordered.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles and it came quickly.  </li>
            <li> the mild scent is almost unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are many products like this one out there, though this one provides a larger quantity then most.</li>
            <li> The vitamin C serum came quickly in mail.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a better skin texture and a healthy glow, especially when I use it in conjunction with a mild glycolic face cream.</li>
            <li> Skin gets smoother and softer, clearer and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> It did arrive quickly as promised.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have found this Vitamin C serum to be every bit as effective as other things I have used that cost more.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and will continue to keep this as part of my daily regiment.</li>
            <li> It does a great job fading my dark spots</li>
            <li> I am having good results with Vitamin C serum and am receiving compliments on my skin which hasn&#x27;t happened in a long time.  </li>
            <li> And here in Central Texas humidity, I appreciate light weight, oil-free but very effective hydration for my 50 year old skin.</li>
            <li> This is really easy to use and it works really well.</li>
            <li> This product not only did what it said it would, but it did more!</li>
            <li> My skin was smoother and more clear after just 4 nights!</li>
            <li> I am well aware of my face!</li>
            <li> THE FIRST!</li>
            <li> I get questions now about how old I am and nobody can guess, and this is a pleasant surprise for me as a busy mom with all of today&#x27;s trails.  </li>
            <li> The serum feels sticky right after application, but soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different types of creams, moisturizers but found out that anything containing vitamin c is very good for the skin.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great and it takes just a few drops to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Each bottle was shipped extremely fast, serum consistency smooth each time,</li>
            <li> This serum makes skin smooth and does really minimize wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> So far enjoying the use of the product.  </li>
            <li> I felt that using an even number (3 on each side) was easier to deal with, and 2 drops for neck, lip edges, cheeks and forehead did not seem enough to spread nicely.</li>
            <li> Skin appears fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 years old and love the sun.</li>
            <li> and so far I really love it.  </li>
            <li> The smell does not bother me at all-it has no artificial fragrance</li>
            <li> a more even look a young look</li>
            <li> Not only did I feel young and look young again, but people at stores and parties where even complimenting how well I looked, this stuff is truly a wonderful product, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything else to replace it with!</li>
            <li> I have noticed my smile lines and the lines on my forehead softening.</li>
            <li> So worth</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin is getting more soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I made a second apt to get it touched up again, and cancelled it bc</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;xxxx&lt;br /&gt;xxxxx&lt;br /&gt;xxxxx</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth a try for those who are seeking skin irritation relief.</li>
            <li> Skin appears fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I checked the reviews before I bought it and have to say that my experience has been very positive.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not positive but my skin looks good</li>
            <li> In a short time I have been able to see a significant change in the lines around my lips.</li>
            <li> As others have indicated, this vitamin C serum is a bit sticky at first, but absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Was taken aback at first by the smell, but that quickly dissipates.  </li>
            <li> Human immune and respiratory toxicant or allergen - strong evidence (Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics)&lt;br /&gt;Human skin toxicant or allergen - strong evidence</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you for sending the right product.</li>
            <li> This serum delivers swift results: I saw an improvement in my skin&#x27;s tone and texture right away.</li>
            <li> alot  seems  to  absorb  right into  </li>
            <li> I use this serum 3-4 times a week in the evening after cleansing and toning  right before I apply my night crème.</li>
            <li> a difference.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice fresh scent and the liquid sinks quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s contents all over your bag</li>
            <li> loss even more apparent!</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it was light in weight and hydrated into my skin almost immediately giving it a slight feeling of tightening the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for 4-5 weeks, and while it might be easy to convince myself that my my skin is definitely brighter and smoother, other people have asked me what I&#x27;m doing because my skin looks great</li>
            <li> I have fair skin which is very sensitive from decades of using prescription Retin-A products and from my having had several laser resurfacing treatments.  </li>
            <li> First off, let me say I am not affiliated with the company, and I rarely bother to write reviews.</li>
            <li> For people with sensitive skin, rosacea, or who choose to avoid ingredients that score as potentially or definitely *unsafe for use* on the Cosmetics Database website, you might purchase this serum as I did, expecting to be able to use it safely.  </li>
            <li> For people with sensitive skin, rosacea, or who choose to avoid ingredients that score as potentially or definitely *unsafe for use* on the Cosmetics Database website, you might purchase this serum as I did, expecting to be able to use it safely.  </li>
            <li> so keep it in a dark place and keep the cap good</li>
            <li> Upon applying, I felt the tingling and mild stinging that always accompanies pure C serum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It calms my skin down well, and feels good.</li>
            <li> They never responded to me when i called them on it, and again, I have no idea if this is now the new product being sold here or just something they do to appease those trying to get a free bottle by posting a review.</li>
            <li> I have diligently looked for a new product that can help me grow older more gracefully.</li>
            <li> Absorbing evenly and quickly without being sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s great about this one is that it&#x27;s double the size but not double the price.  </li>
            <li> So far so good, only had this item 3 days!</li>
            <li> I use this daily and have seen great results, especially using this after derma rolling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my acne blemishes have faded and if I do get a new spot from a pimple the spot vanishes in a matter of DAYS - NOT WEEKS!!!  </li>
            <li> Makes skin very soft and smooth, and looking brighter.</li>
            <li> For best use, let it dry first before applying any other product.</li>
            <li> I do like this serum very much.  </li>
            <li> The 2oz bottle lasts about a month because you do not have to use very much.  </li>
            <li> This has more value for money since it&#x27;s twice the size of other available products.</li>
            <li> am 65 years old and wanted to freshen my skin, as well as treat fine lines, around the mouth...</li>
            <li> The amount is much more than the other products available.</li>
            <li> But then one day, I did a little google search and found out that Vitamin C is tremendous at making your skin look so much better!</li>
            <li> It stings a little on skin  but leaves it bright and radiant.</li>
            <li> the color was aready cloudy and orangy/yellow  after the first wk&lt;br /&gt;which</li>
            <li> I think the serum supposed to make my skin feel more moist but I am feeling the opposite.</li>
            <li> With continued use this product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> and I got exactly that plus a firming of the skin.</li>
            <li> Very well worth the expenditure.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and love it.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing again!! :)</li>
            <li> and I got exactly that plus a firming of the skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a couple of weeks and my skin is already looking more youthful and radiant.  </li>
            <li> Pores are smaller, skin looks more radiant.  </li>
            <li> Of the various Vitamin C products that I have tried with this form of Vitamin C, this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I let the serum &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; first.  </li>
            <li> I have no experience with this product, this is the first time I have purchased the item.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle a month ago.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> My skin is more even toned and my overall complexion is brighter.</li>
            <li> I have been using several different brands for the last year and this one has been the best.</li>
            <li> It appeared from the description this C serum would be the most likely to try.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for your product!</li>
            <li> Applying this serum is the first thing I do to my face in the morning and night</li>
            <li> But after using it and seeing the results I can gladly say that this is truly the thing you would want to help you feel and look younger!</li>
            <li> Did the first bottle help?</li>
            <li> definitely see a change in my skin for the better.</li>
            <li> But as with most things that are toxic that we ingest or use on a daily basis, it&#x27;s toxic at levels you would achieve over a year of use.</li>
            <li> You can even save the first dropper bottle and use it to refill.</li>
            <li> I love this product and am ordering it for the third time.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment!  </li>
            <li> I used my first bottle and like the immediate results.  </li>
            <li> I am 59 and aware of the aging process taking its toll on my skin.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.</li>
            <li> you so much for creating this product, PRI!</li>
            <li> brighter looking ,feel smoother and not expensive.</li>
            <li> If you are aging and looking to find something to do it more gracefully, add Vitamin C, Glycolic and Retinol creams to your daily routine.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> At first I did not see a difference but 30 days into it, my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many vitamin C serums over the last couple of years.</li>
            <li> I apply it twice daily and my skin appears tighter and more radiant.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully I will see more results in the next month</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, you do have to be aware of your current face &#x27;situation&#x27; to be able to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Its not an overnight miracle, but, be consistent and it works.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I recieved was a liquid with a dropper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to buy more Vitamin C Serum for my facial care!</li>
            <li> With continued use this product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> Pretty transparently unethical on their part to leave the rest of the ingredients</li>
            <li> Pretty transparently unethical on their part to leave the rest of the ingredients</li>
            <li> and I love the way my facial skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, so I&#x27;ll probably buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the overall results of this products.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my skin; as a result, I believe the Vitamin C serum has a lot to do with keeping my skin younger looking.</li>
            <li> but I will not give up because of that first morning when I thought it was a miracle.</li>
            <li> I love the product and especially the price-point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s what the product is now or not, but this was the same bottle, but it had a white pump top and was more gel like, like antibacterial gel but with a pleasant floral scent.</li>
            <li> I feel like my face has less wrinkles and is more smooth.</li>
            <li> serum also incorporates ferulic acid, (sounds harsh because of the word acid, but its not, its actually great for sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you need to be realistic about its success.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth using.</li>
            <li> When using this product, make sure to only put a drop or two on a cotton swab and gently exfoliate on your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s potent yet gentle and noticeably brightens my skin and mood - a definite must-have.</li>
            <li> I do outdoor sports regularly and have been using my regular vitamin C on face with good results.</li>
            <li> Where some other products are rather gritty or sticky, this serum has a very smooth texture that&#x27;s easy to apply and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I find that the product absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves my face feeling so very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> but it really is doing the job at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use some kind of cleaning brush such as clarisonic because it can cause your pores to clog a little, but i can see the fading of the sun damage</li>
            <li> After a month I can see some positive results.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use C serum with expectations of continuing positive results.  </li>
            <li> I havent noticed much dryness or peeling and being the first serum I&#x27;ve used, I did expect this to be the case.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to exfoliate your face, this will do it pretty much on contact.</li>
            <li> I would pretty much dismiss any review that doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;Verified Purchase&amp;#34; with it.</li>
            <li> And can really see it working even after just the first application.  </li>
            <li> so I am not sure the consistency and color of this is good</li>
            <li> Enjoy getting twice the amount of other serums for a very economical price.</li>
            <li> I would rather pay more for a lesser amount of serum that is of high quality than pay for this gunk that resembles foul-smelling mucus.</li>
            <li> Bottle, Highly Concentrated 20% Vitamin C with Hyaluronic Acid for Skin Care, Look Younger and Feel Better</li>
            <li> high of a pH could have damaging effects on the skin, as well: &amp;#34;It is demonstrated that skin with pH values below 5.0 is in a better condition than skin with pH values above 5.0, as shown by measuring the biophysical parameters of barrier function, moisturization and scaling.</li>
            <li> A very good product for an unbelievable low price.  </li>
            <li> Something to help freshen up my skin and make me feel super young again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very simple and easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> and I honestly have seen less lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The contents of the bottle has not yet run out, even with using 12 large drops per day, as opposed to the 8-10 suggested.</li>
            <li> I thought that this serum would be an alternative to a pure hylauronic serum (which it contains), but its not working as well YET.</li>
            <li> but I certainly will order it again.  </li>
            <li> Large quantity.  </li>
            <li> I know that I have a big day the next day and want to look my best and helps reduce the puffy eyes and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what a few more weeks will do!</li>
            <li> The product smooths on very easily, and complete coverage of my face is achieved with less than a dropper full.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I began searching for a facial  product that would truly reduce fine lines and diminish wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It makes pores dissapear, skin smoother, glowing, younger, fine lines going away.  </li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum definitely works to decrease the fine lines and wrinkles on my face.  </li>
            <li> , I use vitamin C cream moisturizer,  it will observe it better, with out moisturizer it will dry your skin, otherwise it was a miracle for me!</li>
            <li> After using it for a week, I saw definite improvement in the fine lines around my eyes, and in the deeper wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of professional lines and have paid some good money for other products, but this by far has surpassed them all!!</li>
            <li> The mess left a bright orange stain on the porcelan bathtub: the stain could not be scrubbed off, but I finally was able to eliminate it by soaking with full-strength chlorine bleach.  </li>
            <li> I am shocked, happy, amazed and pleased.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, just using it for a few weeks got me amazing results..</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> I have absolutely noticed a difference since i&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> It really has made a difference for me.</li>
            <li> really see a differnce in the wrinkles or discolorations around the eyes</li>
            <li> It really improved the clarity and quality of my skin.  </li>
            <li> it is very drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have now ordered 7 bottles of this product, and can really see the results on my wife&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> This really does improve your skins texture and color.</li>
            <li> this  product is very sting and burning.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> The serum dries fast.</li>
            <li> Very sticky.</li>
            <li> The last two times I ordered the product, I received a \\&quot;bootleg\\&quot; bottle filled with what appeared to be aloe gel.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife, who&#x27;s been really depressed about how her skin has gotten over the years.</li>
            <li> For the reasonable price why not?</li>
            <li> The color very yellowish,</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I find that my skin reacts really well when I apply it morning and night.  </li>
            <li> None of these serums are really being sold any place else</li>
            <li> You have as much credibility as the planted reviews.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> But, it did make some deep and light wrinkles in my mother&#x27;s face go away.</li>
            <li> I researched a lot of companies and this company had the highest strength along with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> my wife really likes product</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling youthful and fresh with the glow that I had when I was 20 years old.</li>
            <li> The price at AMAZON was amazingly reasonable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has evened out my skin tone which makes my skin look so much clearer and healthier.  </li>
            <li> Exelent product, my clients see the difference compared to others products, thanks</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like tis product, still trying it out.</li>
            <li> Not only is this serum very inexpensive, it&#x27;s far better than Perricone.</li>
            <li> I thought you were much older&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is Fast absorbing, non-greasy, has no odor</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t really needed.  </li>
            <li> My opinion, works really well.</li>
            <li> And it really does lessen the deepness of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Also, the product came to me with a light yellow tint color, meaning that the product lost all of it</li>
            <li> so didn&#x27;t hold out much hope.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY REC THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li> A real value.</li>
            <li> Apparently real vitamin c serum has a stinky scent.</li>
            <li> It really helped reneegize our skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much of the serum either.</li>
            <li> Really, nothing.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like how this product makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> To save myself from paying shipping again, I had hoped to get the supplier (Online Healthy Offers) to refund me without having to return the bottle, so I called their 801 number twice and only got voicemail - they never returned my calls.  </li>
            <li> and I saw better results as far as my skin being clearer, firmer, and has improved overall tone.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, many of the preservatives in this PRI serum do indeed bother my skin, which is extremely sensitive and reactive these days, and that&#x27;s the opposite of why I was buying this product.  </li>
            <li> I had a facial recently and the owner of the spa told me that vitamin C would be good for my 47-year old skin.</li>
            <li> I am so far liking the product and hope to see more results with further use.</li>
            <li> I saw there are some not so positive reviews on this particular brand</li>
            <li> After doing a lot of research on Vitamin C serums, I decided to give this a chance; not only does it contain what higher priced serums do, it was twice the amount of serum!!</li>
            <li> This like any other product must be used daily with a routine of good skin care.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I was noticing fine lines around my mouth (smile lines) and wanted to fix some of my dark spots...</li>
            <li> Chose this rating because of dramatic difference in my skin after only a couple days,skin was noticeably brighter,tighter,and flawless looking.!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have an immediate glow or change but from everthing I have read it can take several months for a significant change to appear</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a significant difference in the smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li> Most other serums are just 1 oz</li>
            <li> My review still stands below if the product is the same, but I&#x27;m not increasing the stars until they come clean about the review/free bottle scam.</li>
            <li> Improving the ability for your skin to absorb and add moisture is good too, especially before you use your typical moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty clear skin</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in the first two weeks that made a considerable difference in the appearance of my face.</li>
            <li> I look pretty old for my age.</li>
            <li> I can notice different in my skin, its clear, brighter and fine lines are getting smother.</li>
            <li> my face looks like new!</li>
            <li> package, guarantee, high quality, formulated in the U.S., and true results means I am definitely a fan of this product!</li>
            <li> Having tried many other products without much success, my doctor recommended using topical Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I think this Vitamin C serum has had more impact that previous products I have used.  </li>
            <li> While I had been enjoying that product, I couldn&#x27;t resist trying this one - half the price for twice the size!&lt;br /&gt;After a month of continuous am/pm application, scarring has faded and my skin looks brighter.  </li>
            <li> My older  sister got me started on it</li>
            <li> I love it now when people ask me my age as I look way younger than what I actually am.</li>
            <li> My decision in purchasing this particular product was that it contained both the Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid ingredients.  </li>
            <li> it dries quickly and leaves some thing like white powers.</li>
            <li> Very helpful to wait and apply to a clean and dry</li>
            <li> and I am getting constant compliments on my skin and for those that saw me before are asking me what am I doing because they say I look young and my skin looks smooth.</li>
            <li> this stuff really helps clear them up fast and you can feel it tightening your skin.</li>
            <li> And this serum also adds hyaluronic acid which can improve moisture retention and improve the absorption of the moisturizer you&#x27;re most likely following up with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;skin is even toned, brighter looking, healthy looking - don&#x27;t expect one product to do it all - basic cleansing care and moisturizing is critical</li>
            <li> I plan to keep using this particular one.  </li>
            <li> I just received my second bottle of this today and am glad to have it back in my beauty routine.  </li>
            <li> I got it mainly because I am doing home glycolic acid peels, and wanted this to use after.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m thinking the company is hoping most people will just keep the serum and not say anything once they realize the actual ingredients it contains, if they bother to read the tiny print on the bottle at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m thinking the company is hoping most people will just keep the serum and not say anything once they realize the actual ingredients it contains, if they bother to read the tiny print on the bottle at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular brand is a value sized deal.</li>
            <li> Make certain to follow up w/ a good moisturizer as the serum makes your face feel a little dry.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly</li>
            <li> I had to have a High quality product.</li>
            <li> The quality of ingredients has made this serum a &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34; for anyone in need of a high quality vitamin C serum.</li>

            <li> HIGH concerns:</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I think I expected it to help with the fine lines I already have.</li>
            <li> and I have notice that those little lines are gone:).</li>
            <li> Packaging -clear clean simple.</li>
            <li> Too soon to assess, so far have not noticed much</li>
            <li> I have used over the years many different products that essentially exfoliate - usually, those more pharmaceutically driven.  </li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few weeks now and love  it.  </li>
            <li> but my skin looks fresh, brighter and overall healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Put a cream of your choice on top of the vit. c, finish by few drops of hylauronic acid serum and you will have a face like a baby in the morning.</li>
            <li> was a normal for that serum.</li>
            <li> Initially, I thought this serum was a great value, but I had to finish a different brand I had, so tried this once &amp; liked it, although I noticed a slightly unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice so far, so I can&#x27;t give a true review.  </li>
            <li> Oct, Pubmed ID 18489300)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to the company to ask about the target pH of their product, in case it&#x27;s normally supposed to be lower</li>
            <li> my co-worker asked me if I starting using different facial care cause my skin was so nice</li>
            <li> I love the consistency and it does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Previous bottles contained a much thicker gel product that was fabulous.</li>
            <li> This is a very high-quality facial product that when used regularly, will reveal significant results.  </li>
            <li> 3 weeks isn&#x27;t much time, but I already think my little fine lines are diminished.  </li>
            <li> I then stored it in a cool, dry hall closet where I store all my toiletries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most products I&#x27;ve found are MUCH more expensive, but this serum has all of the necessary ingredients at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Every penny spent on the serum has been worth it!  </li>
            <li> I like the new pump instead of the dropper.  </li>
            <li> I also like the new texture of the product.</li>
            <li> I have paid almost $100 for Perricone vitamin C serum, so I decided to take a risk and try something new.</li>
            <li> am an African American man,  that is huge on appearance, so when I can get a product that will help me keep that youthfulness</li>
            <li> I ordered a different kind to compare the difference, although I like the other but have not used it as long as this serum, so I can not say the other is better than this one.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps those giving it a negative review already have too many wrinkles to notice a difference....or don&#x27;t truly look at their face much.</li>
            <li> Sadly, my face had turned darker and light pigmentation appeared which proved that this product just don&#x27;t work as most reviews claimed to be.</li>
            <li> I can understand trying to get reviews, and my review was pretty straightforward before I even knew how to get a free bottle, but if they&#x27;re sending you fake product to get a review, that&#x27;s just BS.</li>
            <li> I noticed after 2 weeks of use my skin felt tighter and very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> My skin was shiny and looked very young ...</li>
            <li> Easy to measure amount and mess</li>
            <li> Fine lines are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I add it last, because it seems to seal in whatever goes on first, and appears to tighten the skin.  </li>
            <li> and it still has the same consistency as when it first arrived.  </li>
            <li> completely gone!</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of this four months ago and am now finishing my second bottle.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The next 3 bottles were a gel, in a pump bottle...not feeling anything or seeing the results I had at first.  </li>
            <li> The serum is slightly sticky , but you are supposed to apply a moisturizer over serums , so that works just fine.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen the same results like the ones I saw from the first morning of usage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because these particular (unmentioned) ingredients are considered unsafe for skin contact, I&#x27;m pasting in some info from the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database for you to consider before you decide whether to purchase this serum or not, because basing your decision on the Amazon listing alone isn&#x27;t providing the whole picture:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured this was an economical way to try a Vitamin C serum, and it goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> My face is looking smooth, with less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> We tried it for a month and it&#x27;s starting to show positive results.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen any significant reduction in dark spots.</li>
            <li> my dermatologist recommended,  pat dry lightly, and apply this serum to face, neck and decolettage and, if there is any left over, to the backs of my hands.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin appear softer, and clear.</li>
            <li> Was a clear scented gel, not close to the product I ordered.</li>
            <li> I just turned 60 (people are shocked and never guess that I am 60) and I am being more and more picky with my skin care products.  </li>
            <li> Not giving up, will continue to use, so far no break outs or clogged pores.</li>
            <li> And I have noticed a marked improvement in</li>
            <li> Makes my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li> I have used various products on my face including straight vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and would recommend this product for any age group that is concerned about reducing the appearance of wrinkles on their face and neck.</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and my face is beginning to show my age.</li>
            <li> So far, its a keeper.  </li>
            <li> So far, I noticed that some brown spots around my cheeks are diminishing.</li>
            <li> So far I have not had a problem, but I don&#x27;t use it all the time.</li>
            <li> She has that glow back, it makes her really happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Complete BS.</li>
            <li> Seems like it has a lot of natural ingredients until you get to Benzyl Alcohol.</li>
            <li> and it has become a vital part of my skincare regime.</li>
            <li> Twice as much product as competitors for same price.  </li>
            <li> I am 62 years old, with some sun damage on my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft again.</li>
            <li> I  beginning to realize that Vitamin C is a big helper to gently lift sun damage, my brown spots are beginning to diminish.  </li>
            <li> I recomend you try this product if you want to have young healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I will not buy from them again.  </li>
            <li> I like how it&#x27;s soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> MADE IT GREASE, DEVELOPED ACNE.</li>
            <li> At this price I am using it on underarm wobbles too, and they have smoothed out considerably.</li>
            <li> The only tricky part is the consistency, it seems that it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well</li>
            <li> After using this for around 4 weeks, the spots and marks on my face have since faded and my 36 year old skin feels rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li> ** UNETHICAL VENDOR \\&quot;NATURAL</li>
            <li> \\&quot;NATURAL</li>
            <li> \\&quot;NATURAL</li>
            <li> As an African-American w/ frequent hyperpigmentation from acne</li>
            <li> Its gel based and does not feel natural to me.  </li>
            <li> I have also developed acne.</li>
            <li> I am at the age when I start see my face turning old</li>
            <li> heavy,thick and feels like a coating on your face, until you sweat it off because your face cant breath, tried putting it on only at night, but really i couldn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> So far, I think it&#x27;s doing the job I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I will say that it is important to cleanse your face well, and let dry for about 10 minutes, then apply the serum, and let dry.</li>
            <li> A few of them have lightened significantly, so it is working, but I think it is going to take a while.  </li>
            <li> If PRI stands behind their product and are reputable in the first place, all ingredients should have been listed in the Ingredients sections provided on the page -- not just the ingredients that are eye-catching to potential buyers.  </li>

            <li> face is getting back its natural glow, and no more spots :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this light serum for only two weeks and my face already looks firmer and my pores are less noticeable and my skin looks soft but not oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to a previous purchase that costs more but actually works.</li>
            <li> I can feel a slight burning which goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> The slight wrinkling that I have around my eyes have improved tremendously.</li>
            <li> This second bottle does not smell the same, does not have a dropper but a pump and is stickier than the first.</li>
            <li> I have experienced no adverse reactions from using this serum at least once per day, usually in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It is a little sticky and has a pretty strong slightly burnt orange smell.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Vitamin C Serum and found it to be helpful with fine lines and  minor skin discoloration due to age and sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> price, but not if the pH is too high for the product to actually have any effect.</li>
            <li> The fact that you get twice as much serum than the other brands and that it comes so highly recommended were the biggest deciding factors for me.  </li>
            <li> You should give it a try, there is no down side.</li>
            <li> so I shopped Amazon until I found a product that showed positive customer responses, a money back guarantee, and answers to my specific questions.</li>
            <li> I used it for many years a serum and cream of hyaluronic acid at nigth (it&#x60;s not good for use at sun ligth since it didn&#x60;t give protection).</li>
            <li> I use for many years a serum and cream of hyaluronic acid at nigth (it&#x60;s not good for use at sun ligth since it didn&#x60;t give protection).</li>
            <li> several weeks later, the top of the dropper had expanded to a round ball shape, and when I opened the bottle, it sounded like it was emitting gas.</li>
            <li> She is 45 years old and appears younger than her age, she takes care of herself, and does like to use natural products to maintain her skin.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and easy to spread.</li>
            <li> I have used several Vitamin C serums and I am so sad to say that this time bc of the good price i bought 3 of them (1 for my mom, and bf),</li>
            <li> The morning after I first applied this serum, I was shocked as to how clear and amazing my face looked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different vitamin C serums and I personally think that they are all pretty comparable.  </li>
            <li> Layering the right products retains moisture levels in my skin, resulting in less drought-ish appearance of skin.</li>
            <li> Some readers might find the article useful in understanding how serums work individually and how they interact with each other.  </li>
            <li> First impression, smell different, not bad but not pleasant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not a replacement for sunscreen, but I doubled the amount of the serum than normal after an extended day in the sun and it buffered the sun damage considerably!</li>
            <li> With a heart like a 25 year old, I&#x27;m not ready to look older than I feel.</li>
            <li> I have tough skin, nothing seems to give me the results that most people get, face peels don&#x27;t peel, like that.  </li>
            <li> I highly doubt they&#x27;re using the natural version as the synthetic &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34; version is widely used in skin care.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough, but I really do like the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so much firmer and the dark  age spots on my cheeks have lightened considerably.  </li>
            <li> I do not have deep wrinkles nor sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I only use it in the morning so far.</li>
            <li> (I presume from daily exposure to air), and it has developed a sharp/sour odor.  </li>
            <li> do indeed bother my skin, which is extremely sensitive and reactive these days, and that&#x27;s the opposite of why I was buying this product.  </li>
            <li> I can feel my face and it&#x27;s definitely made it healthier and really alive.</li>
            <li> With consistent use, it delivers clear, even toned skin, less visible wrinkles and a look of overall well being.  </li>
            <li> If I clean my face properly and use a face scrub, yes putting the serum on might result in a stinging sensation ( few seconds only)</li>
            <li> These results were obtained half way through the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum about month and half, after first week I can feel my skin gets smoother and softer and brighter.</li>
            <li> At first there may be some slight stinging, and if this occurs, use just once a day until your skin becomes accustom to the serum, then you can apply twice a day...</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I have only been using for a week or so because I wanted to use other product up first, but I did notice a difference in consistency, application, and absorption.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other Vitamin C Serums before, but really like this one.  </li>
            <li> wow, mom, your face looks ten years younger!</li>
            <li> My skin looks better and, although I am ultra sensitive, this isn&#x27;t irritating it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky when first applied</li>
            <li> Having said that, this particular Vitamin C Serum is probably the most delicate (without the usual sting or burn upon application) that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The only negative comment I have is the smell, but the benefits are worth it!</li>
            <li> The first few times I felt a bit of a sting but now, nothing.  </li>
            <li> I apply a few drops - first thing after cleansing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product containing fresh vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> My skin is a little brighter and fine lines less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> If vitamin C treatment is purchased from a major cometic company, it is way more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Bought this item for my mother and other older family relatives.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C concentration added may have been 20%, but it is highly diluted by other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Other HIGH concerns: Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs);</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old so the lines on my face are not new</li>
            <li> Then you can use your normal other skin preparations..</li>
            <li> Skin is much clearer and tight ordering my second bottle now</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and have spent a ton of time in the sun!</li>
            <li> With all the different vitamin C and hylauronic products on the market, it&#x27;s hard to choose the right one</li>
            <li> I find it pretty drying, and I have dry skin, so I use moisturizer over it, letting the serum sit on my skin for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews from verified purchases only, or at least click through ones that aren&#x27;t and see what else they have reviewed, or do they sound cookie cutter like other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used twice daily, face &amp; neck, for past two weeks - it is helping; I would like to wait &amp; see over several months, how this product really improves my over-all skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There has been some slight lightening of discolored spots but more noticeably, my face feels much less tight and dry, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> also take antioxidants internally and have done for a long time, but even so, this topical serum has made</li>
            <li> Was very happy to find such a large bottle of Vitmain C Serum, but when I opened it; it was very cloudy, very thick (like it curdled) and smelled worse than rotten meat :(.</li>
            <li> My skin feel a little drier than normal</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum worked well for me but burned my eyes and left tiny granules on my face when dry.  </li>
            <li> I have been a cigarette smoker most of my adult life and had really bad wrinkles all along my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Like it, just have not used it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> Also, other products I have bought were much more expensive with very little, if any, positive results.</li>
            <li> The serum was very thick in consistency, disappeared quickly into skin.</li>
            <li> can and should be used sparingly, to last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it morning and evening and find that 1 oz just doesnt last very long.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a dry film on my face which after several hrs.</li>
            <li> and when you apply it to the skin, it creates a white dry residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;so soft and younger after a few days.</li>
            <li> Also, I have put a few drops into my night moisturizer and my skin looks younger and clear in the morning.</li>
            <li> I use directly on my skin in the Cosmetics Database beforehand, but if it&#x27;s not there, I do look up the individual ingredients because I&#x27;ve gotten a chemical burn from the correct application of a product formulated with harsh preservatives, and now I&#x27;ve got permanent skin discoloration on my face as a result.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have put a few drops into my night moisturizer and my skin looks younger and clear in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Improvements in appearance, if subtle, were evident by the end of three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It may work differently on different skin types, my skin type is very dry.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a Vitamin C Serum for a long time.</li>
            <li> plus my skin is not  a sensitive skin at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that Vitamin C serums tend to be productive over a long period of use, so I&#x27;ll continue to experiment.</li>
            <li> Phenoxyethanol is naturally found in chicory root and green tea, but this is synthetic, not plant derived.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to people whose skin in not sensitive like mine.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I mean it really works.</li>
            <li> The product became yellow, the black rubber on the dropper would actually blow up like a little balloon with the bottle closed tightly, it smelled rancid and it felt very sticky when applied.</li>
            <li> I am using this and a couple of other Vitamin C products to lighten numerous sun spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> as I bough 2 bottles of this product, the other bottle never open up</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product for as long as it gives me the results that I have received!  </li>
            <li> I believe that this is due to not having a bunch of extra chemicals in the product.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be of the same quality as the other serum that I purchased.  </li>
            <li> Other MODERATE concerns:</li>
            <li> Other LOW concerns: Enhanced skin absorption</li>
            <li> Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs), Occupational hazards; Other MODERATE concerns:</li>

            <li> I have tried more expensive products and this one trumps them all!</li>
            <li> Only a few drops is needed, so it&#x27;ll last long!</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with Hyaluranic oil from Timeless and it has worked so well on my dry skin and wrinkles</li>
            <li> I have to say living in a dry desert climate and hanging out in the sand dunes</li>
            <li> Skin soaks it up in seconds, leaves no residue, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin at all.</li>
            <li> but it does dry within a minute.</li>
            <li> If your skin looks dry, you are doing some damage.</li>
            <li> No big deal because the smell only lasted a few minute.</li>
            <li> i have read is not a good indication of pure vitamin c serum&lt;br</li>
            <li> Limited evidence of immune system toxicity or allergies (National Library of Medicine HazMap)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> /&gt;that lines above my lips have diminished and two dark sun spots have almost disappeared.</li>
            <li> I used this C serum religiously and the dark spots began peeling, just the spots.  </li>
            <li> I have a dark spot on my nose that is already getting smaller and lighter.</li>
            <li> From last month to today she has less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> At first I was really skeptical about this product since it&#x27;s name wasn&#x27;t so big</li>
            <li> I stopped using it a bit and the solution turned a slight yellow from opaque-clear.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it a five stars is that it must be used with a moisturizer, as your skin feels a little dry after it is applied.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim, to see if it would reduce little lines, especially those creases around my lips.</li>
            <li> Spend a little extra and go for the OZ-</li>
            <li> A little 0.25 oz or whatever those tiny ampules hold.</li>
            <li> , the only thing I can tell you is that burn a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave my skin dry like some other vit c serums.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C seems to be a different color (lighter) than other ones I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li> I use it at least once a day, sometimes twice a day and definitely, even after just a week of using it noticed vast improvements.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as I expected</li>
            <li> It is coarse not smooth.  </li>
            <li> Not very scientific, but you get the point.  </li>
            <li> It is as expected it would be.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a thick clear gel that didn&#x27;t feel overly sticky or sting my skin).</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops to work all over your face.</li>
            <li> + if it&#x27;s not really needed?</li>
            <li> She uses it daily on her face within a few weeks you could see some results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to buy reliable stuff on Amazon from vendors.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to buy reliable stuff on Amazon from vendors.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product everyday and noticed it evened out my skin discolorations and also improved my overall skin tone.</li>
            <li> I saw an immediate result after only a few days of using this serum.</li>
            <li> Then things changed and there were inconsistencies in both the bottles and product itself.  </li>
            <li> The bottle never was exposed to the sunlight and kept in dry dark place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had tried others and no matter how careful I was, they would form crystals and be very rough when I applied those serum.  </li>
            <li> The serum, when dry, smells slightly chemical, like the way self-tanning lotion smells.  </li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am giving it only 3 stars because I was not able to try it.</li>
            <li> Its not magic, doesn&#x27;t make me look 10 years younger</li>
            <li> It was suggested to me to try this product for 30 days without any other moisturizers whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> this is not like other vitamin c serum and not like what people wrote about this.</li>
            <li> For the past 4 weeks I have been using the serum in the morning under moisturizer (twice daily irritated my skin) and have noticed&lt;br</li>
            <li> like this serum a lot, and have used other vitamin c serums.  </li>
            <li> I have used other vitamin c creams but never a serum</li>
            <li> I decided on Pri company , as you received twice the amount for the price as other companies out there..</li>
            <li> My mother has some aging wrinkles and other marks on her face and asked me to find a treatment for her.</li>
            <li> Even my kids noticed the other day and asked what I was doing.  </li>
            <li> I ordered other vitamin C, and Hyaluronic Acid solutions online, and they were &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, dry on cheeks, a little oiler around t- zone.</li>
            <li> because i ordered other vitamin c serum also and compared both very carefully.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin dry and blistered,  absolutely a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I like the texture of the serum and use it in the morning before I apply my makeup, letting it dry for a few minutes,  and also at night before bedtime.  </li>
            <li> Wow, name brand, sold in boutiques for an outrageous amount, and two of the top four ingredients are synthesized preservatives.</li>
            <li> This product DEFINITELY decreased the wrinkles in only a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a dramatic difference in the texture and look of my skin and have received several comments about my youthful glow!</li>
            <li> It also has help shed dead skin cells off my face leaving it soft and subtle to the touch.</li>
            <li> Now it changed  color which is yellow and  very runny consistency with unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> This bottle should last at least six months or longer, and I expect to reorder.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and researched possible serum for wrinkles and aging sun spots.  </li>
            <li> The dark spots are lightening and wrinkles are lessening.  </li>
            <li> My dark spots have lightened, my skin glows from this.</li>
            <li> I would continue using this product as a toner but will keep looking for another product to correct dark spots and even skin tone.</li>
            <li> Once I received this serum the color was yellow and thick.</li>
            <li> This shipment seemed watered down and I now need to apply a cream afterwards.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if they read this now that it&#x27;s down to 1 star.   </li>
            <li> I either use St. Ives moisturizing cream or Vitamin E cream, both of which I have previously used with some regularity.</li>
            <li> I use it twice on my face , some spots have disappeared and I feel slightly from Brightening</li>
            <li> Lines and wrinkles look softer and less noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These serums are expensive and i&#x27;d say that this one works just as well as some of the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> I used half of 2 oz of this serum till the one day</li>
            <li> If that is inconvenient, get another dropper and just keep a few days worth in it and leave the rest in the fridge.</li>
            <li> My oily skin don&#x27;t feels like as oily as before, less skin break out, but I do put moisturizer after the serum,over roll</li>
            <li> so you use less</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;L-ascorbic acid must be formulated at pH levels less than 3.5 to enter the skin.</li>
            <li> Pores are also less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It goes on slightly sticky, but dries within minutes.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be slightly crystalized when shaken up...</li>
            <li> I was worried that being 60 mls that it might crystallize and just be a mess.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a woman in her late sixties and have been taking care of my skin for a long time.</li>
            <li> I think the product helped lighten my dark spots just a little, but then my hyper-pigmentation was very dark from being in the sun for months.</li>
            <li> And do put the lid on tight.</li>
            <li> I feel that it has helped to keep my skin relatively tight.</li>
            <li> I have been using this morning and evening every day for a little over 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Now, when I apply lip liner, I no longer have to cope with little crevices which make the line wavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky but I will use it and pray it&#x27;s helping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed a little change in my skin every week or so.</li>
            <li> It will take a little time to notice the difference, but it will happen.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping that in time those little lines (crows feet) by my eyes will lighten and maybe disappear.  </li>
            <li> It does sting a little bit after putting it on at times.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife after she told me she&#x27;s become a little self-conscious about her skin.</li>
            <li> Every little bit helps to keep it usable.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I needed a little confidence booster.</li>
            <li> I am not sure but according to other reviews it has oxidized.</li>
            <li> All other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past are all liquid with a spoiled like smell.  </li>
            <li> noticed a little change in my skin every week or so.</li>
            <li> I am a 46 yr old woman that has started to get the a faint 11 between the brows and the a couple of slight vertical lines on the forehead.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a smell but not bad!(as stated in a few reviews)</li>
            <li> I accidentally misplaced it.</li>
            <li> It will do as promised if used everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using the OZ Naturals one to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I can see improvement in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> May work for others for me a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> If you use a few drops once or twice a day?</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of vitamin C into my night cream also.</li>
            <li> and you can notice it in just a few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel it has helped my skin just after a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still gonna keep using for a few for months just to see...</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few vitamin c serums, but non worked this well.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C has been proven to benefit skin-types that are uneven.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops is all you&#x27;ll need</li>
            <li> Its thick and sticky and just sit on my skin, not absorbing.</li>
            <li> Not sure what causes it to turn a slight color.</li>
            <li> this did it in less than 3 weeks!  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any change in my skin tho, sorry!</li>
            <li> I bought this serum in November 2013 and when I received it was  kinda slightly thick whitish cloudy liquid, as other reviewers noticed too.&lt;br /&gt;Which</li>
            <li> The bottle was advertised (as can be seen) with a dropper but both bottles I ordered arrived with a plain lid and no dropper.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks I could tell a dramatic difference in my skin appearance, and I had several close friends and family compliment a change in my skin.</li>
            <li> It has a very slight odor</li>
            <li> And after this past week I feel firmer and my dark circles have lessened!</li>
            <li> I quit using it during the day though, because I can&#x27;t put sunblock on my face without it peeling pretty bad.</li>
            <li> The odor was extremely foul &amp; the serum was an odd yellowish color with a very thick, slimy texture.</li>
            <li> A little rhyme for That ass!</li>
            <li> Product continued to slowly ooze and overflow the bottle for at least an hour, leaving a mess on both the bottle and on the bathtub where I had set it to contain the oozing mess.  </li>
            <li> and it is a little expensive, but if you use it as directed, it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Received my purchased lst week, anxious to try it out .</li>
            <li> not sure why.</li>
            <li> for the past year.  </li>
            <li> I just use lay the dropper against my skin, where the wrinkles occur, and get a small dab off of the side of the dropper.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> NOT SURE</li>
            <li> and it was so watery... not at all like any &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I could not get past the stickiness or the peeling.</li>
            <li> Not sure the caused of it.</li>
            <li> Edit: Not sure what to think anymore.</li>
            <li> Not many wrinkles, though.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this one.</li>
            <li> so I used the other brand after this one and was not impressed with the other brand at all.  </li>
            <li> but I noticed they must have changed the formula in the past couple of months.  </li>
            <li> fell asleep after applying this product (my usual nightly routine)</li>
            <li> When I initially used this product, I was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a try for past one month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, although usually just once a day.</li>
            <li> Im not sure I like it.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s in this vitamin c serum</li>
            <li> I was glowing &amp; repetitively asked my roomate if he also noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> And although I&#x27;m not so naive as to expect the reversal of a lifetime of damage, I would like to slow down the process.</li>
            <li> Some people mentioned it smells bad which is absolutely not true, smells like vitamin C, because there is no added fragrance to &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; the natural smell.</li>
            <li> Scent is very faint and not unpleasent as with other vitamin C topical cosmetics I have tried.👍</li>
            <li> I have very few wrinkles for my age</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beyond the unexpected odor, color, and texture issues mentioned in other negative reviews, which alone make the safety and efficacy of this product suspect, I wanted to mention how disappointed I was that the listed ingredients on this Amazon product page are not at all what is contained in this PRI bottle of Vitamin C serum once you receive</li>
            <li> Propylene glycol is a small organic alcohol commonly used as a skin conditioning agent.</li>
            <li> Since going thru menopause my skin has gone thru alot of changes,,,this seems to have toned down alot of problem areas,that I had never experienced  before.</li>
            <li> I am thin, but needed firming, now loosing , down to 127# with a firmer face, after 2 weeks; my son was, \\&quot;</li>
            <li> The smell of the product is not very pleasant</li>
            <li> but I bought it because my skin is just dull dull dull.</li>
            <li> but when it get any pimples i have a hard time leaving them alone.</li>
            <li> In the winter, my skin is usually dull and spoty.</li>
            <li> Hard pass.</li>
            <li> Well the bottle they sent me was pure crap.</li>
            <li> but this stinks and my mom&#x27;s and my skin look so bad, light spot appeared over my face and make it look like I have dirt on it.</li>
            <li> Try it for at least 4 weeks or six you will notice a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> At least this stuff has Ascorbic Acid as the #2 ingredient with Propylene Glycol as #3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for at least a month now.  </li>
            <li> I did write a complaint, but it was not answered.</li>
            <li> but it looks like they are slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> So tired of these kinds of shady business practices.  </li>
            <li> So tired of these kinds of shady business practices.  </li>
            <li> I use the Vitamin C serum by Serious Skin Care, and I will stick with that from now on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles....or bad skin, but I had a few, small, crows feet and started seeing a few forehead wrinkles.</li>
            <li> like  this  product,not  dramatic  change, but  helps  the skin  firm!</li>
            <li> but I got a bad batch, and they said they&#x27;d ask the lab, but never got back to me.</li>
            <li> It so bad, the serum is actually brownish!!</li>
            <li> In just two weeks these wrinkles have decreased in appearance by at least 50%.</li>
            <li> This serum arrived with the rubber in the lid in a balloon shape, the liquid is dark and my pillow looked dirty in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Ethylhexylglycerin is a glyceryl ether used as a weak preservative and skin conditioning agent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and sticky when applying</li>
            <li> Even Avalon Organics uses Benzyl Alcohol, though it&#x27;s a bit lower on the ingredient scale, but then again, vitamin C is 6th or 7th on the list behind emulsifying wax.  </li>
            <li> Was definitely tired of that</li>
            <li> I am game, and there is no shame</li>
            <li> i do not see a dramatic change on my face and neck since i do not have a problem with them.</li>
            <li> My wife used it for a month and saw dramatic decreases in wrinkles under her neck and under her eyes.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve purchased expensive vitamin C serum &amp; still doesn&#x27;t do the job!</li>
            <li> It can sting a little but nothing bad.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it arrived broken be</li>
            <li> The hyaluronic acid ingredient might gives a smoothing effect to your face but I am skeptical of it&#x27;s penetration because this product gives you the feel of a thin layer of film sitting on your face.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst product I&#x27;ve bought off Amazon to date.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BLACK SPOTS AROUND MY FACE :(</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The label on the bottle was a fake and it did not contain vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> weird part,</li>
            <li> Simply put, it was utterly disgusting.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying this product again sadly.</li>
            <li> DEPOT\\&quot; IS BLATANTLY UNETHICAL &amp; LYING TO PEOPLE.  </li>
            <li> DEPOT\\&quot; IS BLATANTLY UNETHICAL &amp; LYING TO PEOPLE.  </li>
            <li> Within the month I seriously have no lines!!</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>
            <li> they are all artificially derived glycols meant to replace parabens .</li>
            <li> Afraid to use and in box to be returned.</li>
            <li> Crazy</li>
            <li> Needless to say I will reorder when this bottle is finished!</li>
            <li> The product is sticky and it unpleasantly smells.</li>
            <li> The product had an unpleasant odor, like something burnt.  </li>
            <li> when I opened it ,it smelled bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Shocked what this product can do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that the company has changed its product.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed by this product</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This serum I hate to say sucked because everytime</li>
            <li> Do not buy this crap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy this crap again.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product since it has propylene glycol in it.....</li>
            <li> Yes, it was CHEAPER, but this stuff is terrible.  </li>
            <li> It also made me break out in a terrible hives.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the worst I ever ordered.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful and it stung my face like it was attacked by bees!</li>
            <li> However, the smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> The worst part is, the smell does not dissipate.  </li>
            <li> Yikes, this is awful stuff: discolored orange and sticky on my skin.</li>
            <li> AND I WANT A REFUND!!! :&#x27;(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> pretty good at first.....but after several months it turned orange brown color. It was sticky and smelly like it was spoiled? Expiration date is 2016?</li>
            <li> Previous bottles contained a much thicker gel product that was fabulous. This shipment seemed watered down and I now need to apply a cream afterwards. I&#x27;m disappointed that the company has changed its product.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it arrived broken be they were so good about the returning of it very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  I&#x27;m definitely ordering  another bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used over the years many different products that essentially exfoliate - usually, those more pharmaceutically driven.  This is a great product, but even for my skin, which has been accustomed to the sloughing process, I find it sometimes to irritate causing a red look.  On the flip side, that deep wrinkles just aren&#x27;t forming.  For best use, let it dry first before applying any other product.</li>
            <li> Leaves white film on the skin</li>
            <li> I love this serum!  I have absolutely noticed a difference since i&#x27;ve used it.  So have many of my friends and co-workers.  My older  sister got me started on it and it is a little expensive, but if you use it as directed, it lasts a long time.  It will always be a part of my daily facial skin care.  It&#x27;s worth it and so am I!</li>
            <li> vitamin c for face doesn&#x27;t irritate</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I&#x27;m 40 and thankfully don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but I bought it because my skin is just dull dull dull. I also had problems with red blotches. I noticed a difference with this product right away but after a month of use my skin is absolutely beautiful.  I will continue to use this product forever</li>
            <li> I bought this about four months ago and I love it. I use it in conjunction with Hyaluranic oil from Timeless and it has worked so well on my dry skin and wrinkles I bought another one and even sent the pair to my best friend who is enjoying it.  It really has made a difference for me.</li>
            <li> Did not see any change for all the hype</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> A great product! I saw change immediately. Can someone post the number to receive your free bottle. I accidentally misplaced it. For the price you receive a nice amount.</li>
            <li> bought this several mths ago&lt;br /&gt;didnt really see a differnce in the wrinkles or discolorations around the eyes&lt;br /&gt;and the color was aready cloudy and orangy/yellow  after the first wk&lt;br /&gt;which i have read is not a good indication of pure vitamin c serum&lt;br /&gt;dont know if i will buy again</li>
            <li> The bottle was advertised (as can be seen) with a dropper but both bottles I ordered arrived with a plain lid and no dropper. I am very disappointed</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. Feels so clean and fresh on my skin. My face is looking smooth, with less wrinkles. Reordered several times.</li>
            <li> Works well for my skin.  It really improved the clarity and quality of my skin.  My skin was smoother.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Read up on it and it is a great natural way of providing skin care - bottle was delivered in a timely manner and the service was very good.  So far enjoying the use of the product.  Nicely priced as well.</li>
            <li> the rubber tip split.</li>
            <li> I am giving it only 3 stars because I was not able to try it. The Ingredient list online says:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients 20% Vitamin C, 0.5% Ferulic acid, and hyaluronic acid&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottle has 15+ ingredients listed - one of which I am allergic to. So, I will have to return it.</li>
            <li> Received my purchased lst week, anxious to try it out . First impression, smell different, not bad but not pleasant. No big deal because the smell only lasted a few minute. The serum was very thick in consistency, disappeared quickly into skin. I think the serum supposed to make my skin feel more moist but I am feeling the opposite. My skin feel a little drier than normal not sure why. I have combination skin, dry on cheeks, a little oiler around t- zone. Not giving up, will continue to use, so far no break outs or clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Packaging -clear clean simple. expiration date is stamped on the bottom and easy to read👍&lt;br /&gt;Dispensing method -eye dropper. Easy to measure amount and mess free 👍&lt;br /&gt;Product formula -serum. Easy to apply. Absorbing evenly and quickly without being sticky or oily. Scent is very faint and not unpleasent as with other vitamin C topical cosmetics I have tried.👍&lt;br /&gt;Product effectiveness -outstanding👍</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as I expected</li>
            <li> I love this serum so much! The best by far and I have tried tons! My face is smoother and clearer, and NOT tacky or sticky.Try this serum it does what it says and is the best.Also customer service reps. were awesome too.I definitely will be ordering again, so glad found the perfect vitamin C serum finally!</li>
            <li> Amazing product... My skin feel&lt;br /&gt;so soft and younger after a few days.</li>
            <li> I have been using various Vitamin C products such as lotions, oils, etc. for the past year.  And I have noticed a marked improvement in my skin - people don&#x27;t believe I am 63.  Having said that, this particular Vitamin C Serum is probably the most delicate (without the usual sting or burn upon application) that I&#x27;ve used.  It seems very high-end, and I am very glad I purchased it.  Admittedly, I have only been using for a week or so because I wanted to use other product up first, but I did notice a difference in consistency, application, and absorption.  Will no doubt reorder when close to end of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been researching and reading alot about Vitamin C Serum.  I am most pleased with my purchase of Advanced Vitamin C Serum for Face and Neck.  My face skin feels brighter and softer. I am using in the AM and PM after my face is cleansed waiting 15 minutes then applying my creams. I have been using the product for almost 4 weeks now and I can see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say I am not affiliated with the company, and I rarely bother to write reviews. I&#x27;m 77 and, while my skin is in pretty good shape because I&#x27;m not a sun-bather, it is 77 years old. I ordered this on a whim, to see if it would reduce little lines, especially those creases around my lips. I have to admit, it works. I have been using this morning and evening every day for a little over 4 weeks. I use 6 generous drops each time (three on each side) covering neck, cheeks, lips edges, eye wrinkles and forehead. It dries very quickly and makes your skin feel taught. I find it pretty drying, and I have dry skin, so I use moisturizer over it, letting the serum sit on my skin for a few minutes. I either use St. Ives moisturizing cream or Vitamin E cream, both of which I have previously used with some regularity. So...the only change in my routine has been the addition of this serum. Fine lines are much less noticeable. I&#x27;m especially impressed with the way my upper lip looks. Now, when I apply lip liner, I no longer have to cope with little crevices which make the line wavy. The contents of the bottle has not yet run out, even with using 12 large drops per day, as opposed to the 8-10 suggested. I felt that using an even number (3 on each side) was easier to deal with, and 2 drops for neck, lip edges, cheeks and forehead did not seem enough to spread nicely. I plan to keep using this. While I don&#x27;t expect any miracles at my age, I am pretty sure results will continue to improve the longer I use it. I CAN see the difference.</li>
            <li> I use this when I remember. It&#x27;s a little sticky but I will use it and pray it&#x27;s helping.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for sending the right product.</li>
            <li> Ittightens your skin, bu it is very drying to my skin. Leaves a dry film on my face which after several hrs. shows wrinkles even more.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure of this product.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum is wonderful! I am a medical esthetician (graduated with honors) so I can honestly tell you this product is legitimate.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the company has wonderful customer service. This is a win win! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most powerful functions of vit. C is its role in collagen production!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will also help diminish and prevent age spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum also incorporates ferulic acid, (sounds harsh because of the word acid, but its not, its actually great for sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ferulic acid keeps vitamin c in a stabile form on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It also boots vitamin c&#x27;s sun protection and ability to neutralize free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, this serum has one of my fav ingredients, hylauronic acid! This plumps up your skin and greatly helps it absorb moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps eliminate fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its really just a great staple in my beauty/health arsenal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this company does not add any pesky/dangerous ingredients. :-)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! It&#x27;s easy to use after shaving makes the skin smooth and hydrates it very well. I mix a bit with my face cream every morning and before I sleep. With continued use this product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for 2 1/2 weeks, and can already see a remarkable difference in my skin. I have been a cigarette smoker most of my adult life and had really bad wrinkles all along my upper lip. In just two weeks these wrinkles have decreased in appearance by at least 50%. I am so thrilled with this product I have recommended it to family and friends. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> The amazing feeling that I got when I started seeing the results that I was getting was absolutely wonderful. I did it to try and get rid of the fine lines that I had and I got exactly that plus a firming of the skin. Just wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love it now when people ask me my age as I look way younger than what I actually am. It is great to have people asking me that and when I tell them they simply look awe-struck. I am in love with my results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 weeks, and wrinkles seem to be decreasing.  Added it to my regular &amp;#34;lotions and potions&amp;#34;.  I just use lay the dropper against my skin, where the wrinkles occur, and get a small dab off of the side of the dropper. I put a drop under each eye, on each side of the mouth, the forehead and neck.  I add it last, because it seems to seal in whatever goes on first, and appears to tighten the skin.  Wrinkles are not gone, but seem to be better.  I chose this because of the Hyaluronic acid it contains.  The skin seems to be brighter and clearer. If vitamin C treatment is purchased from a major cometic company, it is way more expensive.  I figured this was an economical way to try a Vitamin C serum, and it goes a very long way.  This bottle should last at least six months or longer, and I expect to reorder. The only reason I did not give it a five stars is that it must be used with a moisturizer, as your skin feels a little dry after it is applied. It may work differently on different skin types, my skin type is very dry.</li>
            <li> Great Serum. I was in a hurry so now I will revise my comment. This like any other product must be used daily with a routine of good skin care. It will do as promised if used everyday. Try it for at least 4 weeks or six you will notice a difference in your skin. Apply after washing ( I use a light cleanser) skin damp and apply. Use a good moisturizer and you will have softer skin, I do.</li>
            <li> I have used it faithfully night and morning. I am still waiting for the miraculous result I was told to expect</li>
            <li> This is a very high-quality facial product that when used regularly, will reveal significant results.  I have seen the evidence!&lt;br /&gt;It can and should be used sparingly, to last a very long time.  Very well worth the expenditure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used twice daily, face &amp; neck, for past two weeks - it is helping; I would like to wait &amp; see over several months, how this product really improves my over-all skin.  Value is very good.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Absorbs into the skin nicely.  Skin appears fresh all day.  Also, I have put a few drops into my night moisturizer and my skin looks younger and clear in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  Makes my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum is wonderful on the face and neck. It brightens my skin tone and takes away the sallow look that comes to some women with age. I use it daily and love it.</li>
            <li> i am in my 60s. I have been using this product over 45 days now. It is wonderful, my pores are reduced, ma face is firmer and mu skin is so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recomended this product</li>
            <li> Love this Vitaminc C serum. works great and does not feel greasy. Goes on so smooth. Thank you for an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! I am on my second bottle and have recommended it to anyone who has asked me what do I do to keep my skin so beautiful. I am so pleased to have seen a reduction in fine lines.  Try it - you will like it!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few weeks now and love  it.  Skin is much clearer and tight ordering my second bottle now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 and since I began using the C my skin is softer and smoother.  Its not magic, doesn&#x27;t make me look 10 years younger but my skin looks fresh, brighter and overall healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased, good bang for the buck:)</li>
            <li> I use this along with hyaluronic acid serum. The combination is absolutely wonderful for soft, smooth, youthful looking skin! I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Advanced Vitamin C Serum for Face and Neck.  I have been using this product for almost 4 weeks now.  I can feel and see the difference, my face feels softer and brighter. I use the product twice daily in the am and pm.  I am very happy with the results in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I am a 46 yr old woman that has started to get the a faint 11 between the brows and the a couple of slight vertical lines on the forehead. Within the month I seriously have no lines!! My sister saw a pic of me and asked if I had some work done. I have used a lot of professional lines and have paid some good money for other products, but this by far has surpassed them all!! So happy I found it!! Will definitely be purchasing again!! :)</li>
            <li> The product does not have a nice smell.  It&#x27;s a little sticky when first applied but then it dries.  I have been using it for two weeks and so far the results are as expected.  My skin is a little brighter and fine lines less noticeable.  I will continue to use the product to see if the results improve over time as advertised.  Just wish they could make it smell a little more pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have used up almost the entire bottle and I can say that I see a difference. I have been using it on my D&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area and the fine lines are almost unnoticeable.  The smell isn&#x27;t the best (sort of a medicinal smell) but it dissipates fairly quickly.  I will be ordering more to keep up on my results.</li>
            <li> I have used Obagi vitamin c serum for years and decided to try this.  Yes, it was CHEAPER, but this stuff is terrible.  It is like they dissolved citrus acid tablets and added water.  It is coarse not smooth.  It leaves your skin dry and blistered,  absolutely a waste of money.  Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz had suggested Vitamin C serum to help tighten the face so I tried it out.  I&#x27;ve been using about 3+ weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any benefits yet.  The first few times I felt a bit of a sting but now, nothing.  Will continue to see if I get results.</li>
            <li> I noticed a little change in my skin every week or so. Never had a pinkish glow to my skin and now it does! :)  Love love love! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Hi everyone! I have used various products on my face including straight vitamin C. I have found this Vitamin C serum to be every bit as effective as other things I have used that cost more. In fact, I think this Vitamin C serum has had more impact that previous products I have used.  I noticed after 2 weeks of use my skin felt tighter and very soft to the touch. Now that I am in my 5th week I can&#x27;t stop using it. You should give it a try, there is no down side. Someone mentioned the smell. This is the way all these products smell. You get used to it!! The smell goes away after it dries on  your face.</li>
            <li> If you had seen me before your jaw would drop. I have been using the Vitamin Serum and I mean it really works. You cannot tell that I had wrinkles which is just great. I have a match made in heaven this definitely deserves five stars.</li>
            <li> The amazing feeling that I got when I started seeing the results that I was getting was absolutely wonderful. I did it to try and get rid of the fine lines that I had and I got exactly that plus a firming of the skin. Just wonderful!</li>
            <li> Not a serum, it&#x27;s a gel.  Different formula from prior purchase.  No tingle feeling of C as in prior purchase.  :(  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> This product is very deserving of a 5 star rating!  I have only been using it for a couple of weeks and my skin is already looking more youthful and radiant.  I would definately purchase this product again :)</li>
            <li> Since starting to use this product a month ago, I can already see a difference in my skin, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using the OZ Naturals one to save a few bucks. You can&#x27;t even compate the 2 products! I would send this one back if I could. Spend a little extra and go for the OZ- it&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I needed something to help brighten my skin tone and help control acne. I started using Vitamin C Serum over a year ago.  I would definitely recommend this to everyone. In fact I&#x27;ve had compliments on my skin and referred several individuals to Vitamin C Serum. They love it too!</li>
            <li> I anticipated change in skin tone, etc. within the 30 day period; it is day 29 and I have yet to notice any difference at all.  I am very disappointed.  Will not re-order.</li>
            <li> IF ANY OF THIS SERUM IS ON THE BOTTLE IT GETS CRUSTY&lt;br /&gt;LIKE THE RETINOL NOT SURE WHAT IT DOES NOTHING FOR WRINKLES&lt;br /&gt;SORRY JUST SAYING IT LIKE IT IS DID THESE 2 AS I SAW IT ON OZ OH WELL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased vitamin C serum before but this did nothing and it was so watery... not at all like any &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician, so I&#x27;m always looking for products at a fair price that actually work.  This works!!!! Saw a similar product for $150. Well I bet this works just the same. So go ahead and try it!! For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as a gift for my wife.  She is 45 years old and appears younger than her age, she takes care of herself, and does like to use natural products to maintain her skin.  i found this product and she was hesitant at first, but after 2 weeks, I was ordering more.  I have now ordered 7 bottles of this product, and can really see the results on my wife&#x27;s face.  The fine line wrinkles have all but disappeared, her complexion is radiant.  I am happy with the results, my wife is elated.  I now  order every month.  Great product, fast ship no complaints.  I am now going to try on my face too....</li>
            <li> After a month I can see some positive results.  Pores are smaller, skin looks more radiant.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very happy w/ the results of this Vitamin C Serum. In a short time I have been able to see a significant change in the lines around my lips. Make certain to follow up w/ a good moisturizer as the serum makes your face feel a little dry. (But does the job.)</li>
            <li> Having tried a couple of competitive Vitamin C lotions, I was impressed by the viscosity of this one.  The product smooths on very easily, and complete coverage of my face is achieved with less than a dropper full. I also like that they provide twice as much product as most of the competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Improvements in appearance, if subtle, were evident by the end of three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I must confess that I am unused to doing things that attempt to make me appear younger.  I am surprised by my own vanity....</li>
            <li> My pores went from Swiss cheese to tinier than a grain of salt! It&#x27;s also evened out the tone of my skin. I have definitely noticed a dramatic difference in the texture and look of my skin and have received several comments about my youthful glow! Thank you for such a great product that is very affordable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month it&#x27;s amazing ! I will be ordering again after I run out. Thank you !</li>
            <li> Really helps with fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Since beginning to use the serum, I have had several people tell me that I look terrific.  I got my husband started using it once a day and he just had his dental hygienist compliment his healthy looking skin.  This really does improve your skins texture and color.</li>
            <li> I use it twice on my face , some spots have disappeared and I feel slightly from Brightening&lt;br /&gt;I will continue ..</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it was light in weight and hydrated into my skin almost immediately giving it a slight feeling of tightening the skin.  After using this product for four weeks, I could see a reduction in the appearance of my wrinkles.  It helped reduce the depth of my wrinkles and improved my skin tone.  My decision in purchasing this particular product was that it contained both the Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid ingredients.  I am 64 years old and would recommend this product for any age group that is concerned about reducing the appearance of wrinkles on their face and neck.</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and my face is beginning to show my age. With a heart like a 25 year old, I&#x27;m not ready to look older than I feel. That&#x27;s why I began searching for a facial  product that would truly reduce fine lines and diminish wrinkles. I tried pharmacy products, but never got the results I wanted. A physician said that the best treatment for my needs would be Vitamin C with Hyaluronic acid so I shopped Amazon until I found a product that showed positive customer responses, a money back guarantee, and answers to my specific questions. Advanced Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid was the answer. I began applying four drops morning and night 10 days ago and the results are amazing. This non-oily, unscented serum glides on creating a smooth finish. Laugh lines near my eyes and mouth are invisible, and the best result of all is that a deep frown line between my brows is completely smooth! My dermatologist previously suggested Botox injections to solve that problem, but I won&#x27;t need Botox now that I plan to continue using Advanced Vitamin C. Great value, full 2 oz. package, guarantee, high quality, formulated in the U.S., and true results means I am definitely a fan of this product!</li>
            <li> I have has a skin condition called Morgellons for over twenty years. I get skin lesions that don&#x27;t heal. I have given up hope. My husband bought this product for me. In only two days my skin is healing. I am shocked, happy, amazed and pleased. If you have any skin condition, I believe you should give this a try!!</li>
            <li> It was suggested to me to try this product for 30 days without any other moisturizers whatsoever.  Reluctantly, I did.  Too my surprise, my skin was still retianing good moisture, had elasticity and looks healthier than when I started using this product.  I have to say living in a dry desert climate and hanging out in the sand dunes I thought my skin would not weather just the Vit C Serum.  A true thumbs up for this product.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my results and the purchase, cost of the serum is reasonable than any other, excellent and worth it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using for two weeks and I really love this product! I recommend it to everyone! Try it! :D</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better. I mix it with aquaphore cream an its the best night and day face moistureiser ever! Love it</li>
            <li> I love it! Using it a month.. It stings a little on skin  but leaves it bright and radiant. I put in the fridge on nights I know that I have a big day the next day and want to look my best and helps reduce the puffy eyes and dark circles. I can&#x27;t say enough about it but,  it make my skin glow without the use of bronzers and shimmer.  It also has help shed dead skin cells off my face leaving it soft and subtle to the touch.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about 5 weeks and like the consistency of the serum.  I was worried that being 60 mls that it might crystallize and just be a mess.  I am about 3/4 of the way done with the serum and it still has the same consistency as when it first arrived.  The only area I have seen some crystallization is on the outside around the bottle opening where I have spilled some of the serum.  I like this serum  because it doesn&#x27;t smell and its consistency is that of a gel.  It is not watery.  Of the various Vitamin C products that I have tried with this form of Vitamin C, this is my favorite.  I had tried others and no matter how careful I was, they would form crystals and be very rough when I applied those serum.  I am using this and a couple of other Vitamin C products to lighten numerous sun spots on my face.  A few of them have lightened significantly, so it is working, but I think it is going to take a while.  I have tried hydroquinone serums, but they did nothing for my sun spots.  So far, its a keeper.  It is also an excellent value.</li>
            <li> I can feel the tightness of my skin. I think I expected it to help with the fine lines I already have. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I can feel a slight burning which goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very strong.  I havent noticed much dryness or peeling and being the first serum I&#x27;ve used, I did expect this to be the case.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a Vitamin C Serum for a long time. I like that it is in a 2oz. bottle and also that its affordable.</li>
            <li> I have used this Vitamin C Serum for one month and I have definitely noticed a difference.  I noticed the following changes after 3 1/2 weeks - softer skin, a luminescence to my face and neck and a smoother complexion.  It is different from anything I have ever used before.  I have been using Retin A for a year and that made a difference, but this is an additional boost with different results.  I will continue to use Retin A at night and this serum every morning.  After applying, I wait about 5 minutes before I apply moisturizer.  I let the serum &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; first.  After it is set, I don&#x27;t even know it is on my face.  It seems to disappear.  I am very pleased and will continue to keep this as part of my daily regiment.</li>
            <li> this is not like other vitamin c serum and not like what people wrote about this. this  product is very sting and burning. it doesn&#x27;t comes with a box either.  it dries quickly and leaves some thing like white powers. it makes more wrinkles when i smile.  i tried to return this product since this is regarding as a hazardous liquid  they don&#x27;t accept  it. plus my skin is not  a sensitive skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;also, this doesn&#x27;t seem  60 ml . because i ordered other vitamin c serum also and compared both very carefully.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum for a week.  I can see improvement in just a few days.  This stuff is great and it takes just a few drops to do the job.  I am hooked.</li>
            <li> I have no experience with this product, this is the first time I have purchased the item.  I will add comments at a later date.</li>
            <li> I have used it every day for a month ... I see a difference in my skin and so do friends. I recommend this serum to all. My skin seems to have a glow  and I have notice that those little lines are gone:). I will continue to use vitamin c serum.....love it!</li>
            <li> I like it.  Seems to do the trick.  I will keep using it.  My husband says I&#x27;m looking better each day</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I have tried several different types of creams, moisturizers but found out that anything containing vitamin c is very good for the skin.  It will take a little time to notice the difference, but it will happen.  I recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using vitamin c serum for 5 weeks.  I find that the product absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves my face feeling so very soft and silky.  It also appears to leave my skin looking brighter.  I am hoping that in time those little lines (crows feet) by my eyes will lighten and maybe disappear.  I will continue to use the product and hope to see further improvement.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency, smooth, and replenishing.........I really do like this and hope the fantastic results continue!  I am now a fan!  :)</li>
            <li> I use vitamin C serum for many years and this product is one of the best. Some people mentioned it smells bad which is absolutely not true, smells like vitamin C, because there is no added fragrance to &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; the natural smell. Once I put it on my face I cant smell anything at all. Skin soaks it up in seconds, leaves no residue, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin at all. If I clean my face properly and use a face scrub, yes putting the serum on might result in a stinging sensation ( few seconds only) but that is a good thing. Works even better. This serum WORKS. Vitamin C is a must for a face, this product is one of the best deals on Amazon. Put a cream of your choice on top of the vit. c, finish by few drops of hylauronic acid serum and you will have a face like a baby in the morning. Each bottle was shipped extremely fast, serum consistency smooth each time, smelled fresh and always delivered great results. Hope this review can help, there are so many different products, it becomes overwhelming.  D from Florida</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle a month ago. I really like the way it makes my face feel. I use it on my face and neck twice a day before my make up in the morning and at night when I remove my make up. My skin feels smoother, tighter. I have ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I Read many reviews for this product &amp; decided to try it for 6 weeks. The serum is quite gooey &amp; the smell isn&#x27;t as offensive as some people mentioned.  There&#x27;s a strong tingling effect each time I used it. The serum dries fast. I follow up with a good moisturizer &amp; sunscreen. So far, I noticed that some brown spots around my cheeks are diminishing. In the past, I&#x27;ve purchased expensive vitamin C serum &amp; still doesn&#x27;t do the job! Yes, I&#x27;m happy with this product &amp; intend to order more.&lt;br /&gt;Gloria W.&lt;br /&gt;Walnut Creek, CA</li>
            <li> I think that it is a great product. It does sting a little bit after putting it on at times. My face feels softer and looks better. I quit using it during the day though, because I can&#x27;t put sunblock on my face without it peeling pretty bad. So night time I always put it on my face and neck. I really like this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week and I am very happy with the way the product feels on my face, seems as good or better than the product 4 times the price, plus it has the added benefits of the Hyurlonic Acid.  I am happy and would re-order.</li>
            <li> I have used Advanced Vitamin C Serum morning and night for over 4 weeks and I  love what I am seeing in the mirror. The pores under my eyes and across the bridge of my nose appear smaller. My skin is more even toned and my overall complexion is brighter. I do not have deep wrinkles nor sensitive skin. The slight wrinkling that I have around my eyes have improved tremendously. I have found something that works and I am going to continue using this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 60 days now and see noticable results. I will continue to use! Great price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> I have been using the vitamin C serum for over a month and have noticed that my skin&#x27;s texture has improved.  I like the texture of the serum and use it in the morning before I apply my makeup, letting it dry for a few minutes,  and also at night before bedtime.  It makes my skin feel and look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on buying more of it.  I checked the reviews before I bought it and have to say that my experience has been very positive.</li>
            <li> Have been using the serum for approx 2wks and am happy with the product. Compared with another brand that I tried, this one applies more smoothly and feels better on the face. Very helpful to wait and apply to a clean and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend this product. Received quickly in the mail after ordered. Enjoy getting twice the amount of other serums for a very economical price.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using it for a week I can definatly notice an improvment in the overall complexion of my skin. Since going thru menopause my skin has gone thru alot of changes,,,this seems to have toned down alot of problem areas,that I had never experienced  before. Can&#x27;t wait to see what a few more weeks will do!</li>
            <li> you can feel this working..........I love it for the price</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product since it has propylene glycol in it.....a known harmful ingredient.  I could never see that ingredient until I bought it and saw it on the label.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  Someday I&#x27;ll learn not to get excited about products that make promises.</li>
            <li> What a great product.  I have been using it for a year and love the stuff.  It has evened out darker areas on my face and my skin tone is a lot even and smoother.</li>
            <li> So far I have not had a problem, but I don&#x27;t use it all the time. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this item are very true. It diminished some fine lines on my face. I apply it every night and it continuously doing its job. The youthful appearance of my skin was one good result. I will order more:)</li>
            <li> Very sticky. If you are looking to exfoliate your face, this will do it pretty much on contact. I will never know if it would have evened the skin tone. I could not get past the stickiness or the peeling. My moisturizer did not seem to blend well with this serum either. I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Was very happy to find such a large bottle of Vitmain C Serum, but when I opened it; it was very cloudy, very thick (like it curdled) and smelled worse than rotten meat :(. It also made me break out in a terrible hives. Will not be buying from this company again if they sell out of date product that should have been thrown away not sold.</li>
            <li> I love it! I have been using several different brands for the last year and this one has been the best. It also tightens your face which I love. I would highly recommend it. It also comes in a bigger size 2 oz. instead of 1 oz. so you get more for the price.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough, but I really do like the way it makes my skin feel.  Very smooth,  I noticed this almost immediately.</li>
            <li> A very good product for an unbelievable low price.  I bought 2 bottles and it came quickly.  I hope you enjoy this product like I do.</li>
            <li> I not only look more relaxed but as a consequence I am feeling more relaxed as well! Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I thought that this serum would be an alternative to a pure hylauronic serum (which it contains), but its not working as well YET. I think that Vitamin C serums tend to be productive over a long period of use, so I&#x27;ll continue to experiment. I&#x27;ll also add another hylauronic / kelp extract serum as I got great results from that.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and researched possible serum for wrinkles and aging sun spots.  It appeared from the description this C serum would be the most likely to try.  I began using this serum a month ago and feel I am getting results.  I feel I should continue use to it as I have incorporated it into my daily beauty routine.  Results have not been rapid but has it has only been a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Vitamin C serum for about a month. Where some other products are rather gritty or sticky, this serum has a very smooth texture that&#x27;s easy to apply and absorbs quickly. Despite the strength, there&#x27;s no burning or stinging and the mild scent is almost unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There has been some slight lightening of discolored spots but more noticeably, my face feels much less tight and dry, especially around my eyes. It&#x27;s certainly not a replacement for sunscreen, but I doubled the amount of the serum than normal after an extended day in the sun and it buffered the sun damage considerably!</li>
            <li> when I opened it ,it smelled bad. didn&#x27;t use it, &amp; sent it back. would not recommend this product.would purchase  again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best purchase I have ever made for myself. The even skin tone and tightness on my face is noticeable. My husband compliments my looks every day now, and he didn&#x27;t know I was using the serum. Thanks for your product!</li>
            <li> Its a great vitamin serum for its price. i do not see a dramatic change on my face and neck since i do not have a problem with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 and love this stuff. The price is very reasonable for 2oz and the results are great. I use this on my face, neck, hands, chest, shoulders and arms. My face etc. look great, but the results on my hands are awesome. The lines, roughness, and discoloration on my hands have noticeably improved. These results were obtained half way through the first bottle. I am purchasing this serum again for myself and for a friend to try.    UPDATE: Though I loved this product and used it for a period of time, I will not reorder. The last two times I ordered the product, I received a \\&quot;bootleg\\&quot; bottle filled with what appeared to be aloe gel. The label on the bottle was a fake and it did not contain vitamin C serum. Amazon refunded my money after I returned the bottles. I never found out how this happened, or if it was investigated. Kudos to Amazon for taking care of it&#x27;s customers.</li>
            <li> Been using this serum for a month and skin is now more even toned.  I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the smoothness and firmness of my skin too. Skin has a very clean feel to it.  I like to use this product on my neck also.  I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I was noticing fine lines around my mouth (smile lines) and wanted to fix some of my dark spots... i LOVE this product, it has worked so great for me and faded the lines and also evened out my complexion!  I use it at least once a day, sometimes twice a day and definitely, even after just a week of using it noticed vast improvements.  I have had this product now for about 5 weeks and I could not be happier and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and value. Substantial brightening and&lt;br /&gt;thickening of skin ( bouncier skin as one reviewer so aptly&lt;br /&gt;said). I used after lactic peel and noticed skin healed more&lt;br /&gt;quickly. I refrigerated serum after opening to help protect&lt;br /&gt;product integrity.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!! Makes skin very soft and smooth, and looking brighter. Is my regular AM and PM face and hands product. Lines and wrinkles look softer and less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;It has been 3 weeks and I am getting constant compliments on my skin and for those that saw me before are asking me what am I doing because they say I look young and my skin looks smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pleasure to write this review. I have diligently looked for a new product that can help me grow older more gracefully. I&#x27;m 53 years old and love the sun. Whoops! I wish I knew what I know now 35 years ago about sun damage. It was the 70&#x27;s....that&#x27;s the best answer I&#x27;ve got. Anyhow, this vitamin serum has helped moisturize my face and neck. My skin is smooth and hydrated. Applying this serum is the first thing I do to my face in the morning and night and if i need a mid-day &amp;#34;freshen up.&amp;#34; I use this product with a derma roller which allows the serum to penetrate deeper into my skin.I hope this is helpful to those who are searching for a good skin care product. PS I am Warrens wife as of one week ago. He tells me often that I&#x27;m beautiful. Many others comment on my facial skin in how nice it looks.</li>
            <li> There are many products like this one out there, though this one provides a larger quantity then most. I love that, I&#x27;m also loving the results. I bought it for my wife, who&#x27;s been really depressed about how her skin has gotten over the years. After buying this, she&#x27;s had good results so far. Her skin is much more nice. She has that glow back, it makes her really happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results were great, so far it&#x27;s just amazing. My wife is so happy I got this for her, did a lot of research and found out this is the BEST i could find online.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my mom. gave her 2 bottles and today i asked her how it was and she said it was great. From last month to today she has less wrinkles. i will be buying more of this for her.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks and so far I really love it.  It gives my skin a nice matted appearance and makeup goes on nicely over it.  3 weeks isn&#x27;t much time, but I already think my little fine lines are diminished.  I&#x27;m blemish prone and this doesn&#x27;t cause me to have breakouts either.  I use it morning and night, 3 drops for each application, and it seems the bottle will last for quite some time.  I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I did not see any change in my skin . I used it every day for a month . May work for others for me a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a very good serum of vitamin C and not expensive. I used it for many years a serum and cream of hyaluronic acid at nigth (it&#x60;s not good for use at sun ligth since it didn&#x60;t give protection). By morning I use the serum and cream of vitamin C. To be sincere I change time to time the branch of the products, The results have been very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and I have to say that this thing actually works! I actually feel and look younger and the wrinkles I once had are completely gone! At first I was really skeptical about this product since it&#x27;s name wasn&#x27;t so big and it&#x27;s something that is applied to my face. But after using it and seeing the results I can gladly say that this is truly the thing you would want to help you feel and look younger!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different vitamin C serums and I personally think that they are all pretty comparable.  I&#x27;ve been using this one for a month and have noticed that they fine lines around my eyes are staying away.  I say staying away because they started to diminish with the use of different brand serums.  What&#x27;s great about this one is that it&#x27;s double the size but not double the price.  These serums are expensive and i&#x27;d say that this one works just as well as some of the more expensive ones.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I opted for a second bottle. Did the first bottle help? Honestly, I&#x27;m not positive but my skin looks good and I&#x27;ll attribute a percentage to the vitamin C. I will keep it up as I&#x27;m 59 and will take any help I can get. For the reasonable price why not?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  There was a visible different within a week of use.  This has become a staple in my skincare regiment.</li>
            <li> i love the serum!  Make sure you use some kind of cleaning brush such as clarisonic because it can cause your pores to clog a little, but i can see the fading of the sun damage</li>
            <li> I have noticed a smoother skin tone since I started using the Vitamin C Serum.  I have recommended this to my friends.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum has really improved the clarity and tone of my skin, giving it a more uniform appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I also take antioxidants internally and have done for a long time, but even so, this topical serum has made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice fresh scent and the liquid sinks quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s contents all over your bag when travelling!&lt;br /&gt;And discount makes it great value!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using  Vitamin C Serum. It has made my skin appear softer, and clear. I would buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I really, really, really love this one... has worked the best so far... will order again!!</li>
            <li> I used half of 2 oz of this serum till the one day I noticed that the consistency of the serum has changed. I bought this serum in November 2013 and when I received it was  kinda slightly thick whitish cloudy liquid, as other reviewers noticed too.&lt;br /&gt;Which is I assumed was a normal for that serum. Now it changed  color which is yellow and  very runny consistency with unpleasant odor. On a bottle It says its still good till 10/2015. The bottle never was exposed to the sunlight and kept in dry dark place.&lt;br /&gt;I would never risk to put this stuff on my face after that metamorphose and actually would never advice  to anyone to buy this crappy serum.</li>
            <li> Really good product and pricing- definitely see a change in my skin for the better. I would recommend it highly</li>
            <li> The color very yellowish, as I used it on my face with my palm, it made my palm color also become yellowish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weird part, as I bough 2 bottles of this product, the other bottle never open up but the cap/cover expanded like a balloon. Not sure the caused of it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife after she told me she&#x27;s become a little self-conscious about her skin. Her skin looks smoother than before and she also tells me she agrees, so no issues here.</li>
            <li> The product did not like or feel as the one I bought from the cosmetologist&lt;br /&gt;I could not use it&lt;br /&gt;Would never recommend to anybody to use</li>
            <li> Item packaged well, arrived promptly and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;Serum is moisturizing, and texture feels good on the skin; not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> For the past 4 weeks I have been using the serum in the morning under moisturizer (twice daily irritated my skin) and have noticed&lt;br /&gt;that lines above my lips have diminished and two dark sun spots have almost disappeared. My daughter told me my skin looked beautiful the other day and someone who knew I just had a birthday thought it was my 50th...I&#x27;m 60, so I think the serum is helping!</li>
            <li> My skin is beginning to show signs of my age with wrinkles.  One day after watching Dr. Oz, the show discussed how a vitamin C serum could help with my problem.  I checked out Amazon&#x27;s many options to buy a vitamin C serum and, in the end, I decided to purchase this one.  The fact that you get twice as much serum than the other brands and that it comes so highly recommended were the biggest deciding factors for me.  What a deal!  I will say that I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Every penny spent on the serum has been worth it!  I will continue to use this product for as long as it gives me the results that I have received!  Thank you for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday but it helps a lot with clearing up any monthly caused break outs fast.  I have pretty clear skin but when it get any pimples i have a hard time leaving them alone. this stuff really helps clear them up fast and you can feel it tightening your skin.</li>
            <li> I think the product helped lighten my dark spots just a little, but then my hyper-pigmentation was very dark from being in the sun for months. I stopped using it a bit and the solution turned a slight yellow from opaque-clear.  Not sure what causes it to turn a slight color.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  The consistency is a combination of liquid and gel so it is not runny and goes where you apply it.  The smell does not bother me at all-it has no artificial fragrance but the smell is fine.  I find that my skin reacts really well when I apply it morning and night.  I have sensitive skin and I do not have breakouts or redness.  I use Retin-A with this product and still no bad reaction.&lt;br /&gt;I like how my skin looks brighter, more even toned.  I have very few wrinkles for my age and I think this is a result of heredity, taking care of my skin, using sun block and effective products like this.</li>
            <li> So far so good, only had this item 3 days!</li>
            <li> Edit: Not sure what to think anymore. If you&#x27;ll notice on your package they give you an 800 number to call to get a free bottle. They ask for a review and to show them the review, and they&#x27;ll send you a free bottle. Well the bottle they sent me was pure crap. Was a clear scented gel, not close to the product I ordered. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s what the product is now or not, but this was the same bottle, but it had a white pump top and was more gel like, like antibacterial gel but with a pleasant floral scent. Complete BS. I can understand trying to get reviews, and my review was pretty straightforward before I even knew how to get a free bottle, but if they&#x27;re sending you fake product to get a review, that&#x27;s just BS. So my review rating is dropping to one star. They never responded to me when i called them on it, and again, I have no idea if this is now the new product being sold here or just something they do to appease those trying to get a free bottle by posting a review. My review still stands below if the product is the same, but I&#x27;m not increasing the stars until they come clean about the review/free bottle scam. We&#x27;ll see if they read this now that it&#x27;s down to 1 star.   I would pretty much dismiss any review that doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;Verified Purchase&amp;#34; with it. None of these serums are really being sold any place else so you figure it out. I&#x27;ve used this for a bit now. I believe it does help. Do see a difference around the crows feet, forehead and under the eyes. It&#x27;s not rocket science the effects Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid can have for the skin. Antioxidants are good. Improving the ability for your skin to absorb and add moisture is good too, especially before you use your typical moisturizer.  People mention Polypropylene Glycol as a toxin. Well guess what folks, all of these off brand serums have it under some name. Don&#x27;t see the PG term in ingredients, well look for Phenoxyethanol. Same thing. they are all artificially derived glycols meant to replace parabens . Phenoxyethanol is naturally found in chicory root and green tea, but this is synthetic, not plant derived. It&#x27;s a preservative against mold, yeast and what not. Is it a toxin? It can be, if you bathe your face in it multiple times a day. If you use a few drops once or twice a day? Probably not. But as with most things that are toxic that we ingest or use on a daily basis, it&#x27;s toxic at levels you would achieve over a year of use. Meaning, you&#x27;d have to use the amount you use over a year on a daily basis for it to actually be toxic. Not very scientific, but you get the point.  AND....[[ASIN:B00095W7D4 SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic]]&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;---This stuff, I got after getting a peel. A little 0.25 oz or whatever those tiny ampules hold. Looked and smelled no different than this stuff. Started as whitish yellow serum and turned yellowish brown over time just like this stuff. Now go look at the ingredients. The top ingredient is water. Ingredients two and four are both the &amp;#34;dangerous toxins&amp;#34; people here whine about: ethoxydiglycol and polypropylene glycol. Wow, name brand, sold in boutiques for an outrageous amount, and two of the top four ingredients are synthesized preservatives. At least this stuff has Ascorbic Acid as the #2 ingredient with Propylene Glycol as #3. And it has Ferulic Acid, just like they do. Has Triethanolamine, supposedly a toxin to buffer the PH. It&#x27;s not known to be carcinogenic. But it can have toxic effects on the body, of course it&#x27;s probably in levels way beyond what you&#x27;re putting on your face. And this serum also adds hyaluronic acid which can improve moisture retention and improve the absorption of the moisturizer you&#x27;re most likely following up with. Maybe you should drop $130 on PerriconeMD&#x27;s serum. Seems like it has a lot of natural ingredients until you get to Benzyl Alcohol. I highly doubt they&#x27;re using the natural version as the synthetic &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34; version is widely used in skin care. Even Avalon Organics uses Benzyl Alcohol, though it&#x27;s a bit lower on the ingredient scale, but then again, vitamin C is 6th or 7th on the list behind emulsifying wax.  So unless you want to pay triple the cost or more from the typical boutique or popular brands who seem to make use of these toxins on a greater scale (higher up on the ingredient list) these are your best option. Read the reviews from verified purchases only, or at least click through ones that aren&#x27;t and see what else they have reviewed, or do they sound cookie cutter like other reviews.  I would recommend keeping it refrigerated. It will turn from a lemony creamy color to a darker brown color (almost like a light iodine color) as it oxidizes or degrades. If that is inconvenient, get another dropper and just keep a few days worth in it and leave the rest in the fridge. You can even save the first dropper bottle and use it to refill. And do put the lid on tight. Every little bit helps to keep it usable.  All in all,  this stuff seems like the best bang for the buck. Have bought twice and will buy again.  skeptics, toxin freaks, feel free to reply. You have as much credibility as the planted reviews.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Vitamin C Serums before, but really like this one.  It is thick and easy to spread. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and am ordering it for the third time. My skin is brighter, firmer and the wrinkles have noticeably diminished. I started using it on my hands and neck too and am please with the results.  I use it morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at the pool this week and a couple of friends were talking about Botox and fillers. I mentioned that I was thinking about it, and they both said that I didn’t need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m very happy with the results I am getting and it has become a vital part of my skincare regime.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Just received my second bottle today and I&#x27;m even happier now that it&#x27;s in a pump! This product keeps my skin plump by providing the vehicle (the hyaluronic acid) to get the moisture from my lotions in my cells and the tone even from the vitamin C. It&#x27;s amazing and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is one of the worst I ever ordered. It came OK, but the quality of the product is questionable. The product is sticky and it unpleasantly smells.</li>
            <li> Great Price. Need more time to evaluate effectiveness. Seems to keep my skin more hydrated. I will be able to judge it better during the winter months when my skin is dryer.</li>
            <li> Like it, just have not used it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> I believe they changed the formula. The first one I associated easily with another vitamin C product so i was convinced it was actually what it says it is. This second bottle does not smell the same, does not have a dropper but a pump and is stickier than the first.</li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C Serum! My skin looks so much better since I started to use it. I use it in combination with the micro needle roller that I purchased, and because the needle depth is the smallest size, the Vitamin C does not sting. This product is perfect, does not cause me to break out. I believe that this is due to not having a bunch of extra chemicals in the product. Just what is listed on the label, no preservatives. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it! Telling everyone I know about this serum.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use it morning and night. Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum about month and half, after first week I can feel my skin gets smoother and softer and brighter. My oily skin don&#x27;t feels like as oily as before, less skin break out, but I do put moisturizer after the serum,over roll, I am pretty happy about this vitamin c serum product.</li>
            <li> Great quality and value priced.  Twice as much product as competitors for same price.  Easy to dispense and apply.  Seems effective.</li>
            <li> Would give zero stars if I could. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT! Initially, I thought this serum was a great value, but I had to finish a different brand I had, so tried this once &amp; liked it, although I noticed a slightly unpleasant odor. I then stored it in a cool, dry hall closet where I store all my toiletries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to use it again several weeks later, the top of the dropper had expanded to a round ball shape, and when I opened the bottle, it sounded like it was emitting gas. The odor was extremely foul &amp; the serum was an odd yellowish color with a very thick, slimy texture. Simply put, it was utterly disgusting. I threw it out, as I had bought it in Feb &amp; didn&#x27;t want to bother w/expense of sending back &amp; fighting for a refund. I would rather pay more for a lesser amount of serum that is of high quality than pay for this gunk that resembles foul-smelling mucus.</li>
            <li> I suspect this has a sunless tanning ingredient. because I noticed that my skin was turning orange, especially my fingers from applying the serum.</li>
            <li> After doing a lot of research on Vitamin C serums, I decided to give this a chance; not only does it contain what higher priced serums do, it was twice the amount of serum!! I&#x27;ve been using it now for 4-5 weeks, and while it might be easy to convince myself that my my skin is definitely brighter and smoother, other people have asked me what I&#x27;m doing because my skin looks great and I look relaxed. I love this stuff and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This review is from: Vitamin C Serum (2oz) - Advanced Vitamin C Serum for Face and Neck, 2oz/60ml Bottle, Highly Concentrated 20% Vitamin C with Hyaluronic Acid for Skin Care, Look Younger and Feel Better (Bonus Size) (Misc.)</li>
            <li> Fast shipment!  The smell of the product is not very pleasant but it&#x27;s a great vitamin c serum and comparable to others. This has more value for money since it&#x27;s twice the size of other available products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is clearer, smoother and more hydrated since using this product.  I recommend it for those who need a boost to their skin.</li>
            <li> The best product for your face... I love it and i recommended to all my friends</li>
            <li> I do like this serum very much.  I used my first bottle and like the immediate results.  I ordered a different kind to compare the difference, although I like the other but have not used it as long as this serum, so I can not say the other is better than this one.  But if it helps anyone I just received my second bottle of this serum and very happy I have it.  I saw there are some not so positive reviews on this particular brand but I truly love this serum, the cost and the amount it comes in.  Good luck in your choices.</li>
            <li> I am having good results with Vitamin C serum and am receiving compliments on my skin which hasn&#x27;t happened in a long time.  The dark spots are lightening and wrinkles are lessening.  It is not overnight miracle but, honestly, the best results come with continuous and consistent use and that is my experience.  I will continue to use C serum with expectations of continuing positive results.  The company had good customer service, prompt reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several different types of C serum and this is the strongest which makes it work for me. I have tough skin, nothing seems to give me the results that most people get, face peels don&#x27;t peel, like that.  I did a test on the brown spots on my cheeks. they seemed to be getting darker every day.  I used this C serum religiously and the dark spots began peeling, just the spots.  I think that is quite remarkable.  The spots are getting lighter.  This product works for me.</li>
            <li> it works.&lt;br /&gt;simple.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t use after shaving, though - ouch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;skin is even toned, brighter looking, healthy looking - don&#x27;t expect one product to do it all - basic cleansing care and moisturizing is critical&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff is a great compliment to a decent care regimen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;human skin loves vitamin c - science backs it up</li>
            <li> I love vitamin c it makes my face look nice a more even look a young look and I know it will look better with time</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s done anything, but it feels good.</li>
            <li> I like the new pump instead of the dropper.  I also like the new texture of the product.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum has become a daily part of my after swim/sun/shower repertoire. I am 59 and aware of the aging process taking its toll on my skin. I am also familiar with the curative power of vitamin C.  And although I&#x27;m not so naive as to expect the reversal of a lifetime of damage, I would like to slow down the process. The serum feels sticky right after application, but soaks in quickly. I&#x27;ve used it for a month and need to use it for a longer test period to actually recommend it. But so far I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now. I can see some difference. You can feel it working on your skin. I was using Retin A but like this better. A great price for this 2 oz size.</li>
            <li> Skin smoother and firmer in just 3 weeks! Also using phytoceramides which I started at the same time as the vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The vitamin C serum came quickly in mail.  It is as expected it would be.  Nice bottle and dispenser.  The smell is not the greatest but seems to be working for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> This product not only did what it said it would, but it did more! Not only did I feel young and look young again, but people at stores and parties where even complimenting how well I looked, this stuff is truly a wonderful product, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything else to replace it with!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I&#x27;ve used it twice per day and it has resurfaced and brightened my skin.  The Vitamin C Serum has even made the skin on my neck look and feel more supple.</li>
            <li> I ordered Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic acid because I had read about the moisturizing properties of hyaluronic acid and the antioxidant properties of Vitamin C.  I have used the product for about 2 months.  When you apply the product you can feel the hyaluronic acid absorb into the skin so you can actually feel it working.  To make it work even better you can use moisturizer after the product is applied.  There is also a softness to the skin and a smoothness of texture.  I am pleased with the product and it has worked very well.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found this product.  I am 62 years old, with some sun damage on my face.  I have been using this serum for about a month, and my face seems to have a youthful glow.  It feels soft, and some of the fine lines seem to be getting better.  What is really great, is the price, the volume, and it works.  Madge</li>
            <li> I had some acne scars on my face before using this. Not many wrinkles, though. After using this for a couple of weeks, my scars have faded to almost nothing and my skin does look a lot younger and smoother. I feel more confident with myself now. When using this product, make sure to only put a drop or two on a cotton swab and gently exfoliate on your skin. Wash off after about 5 minutes. That&#x27;s what I did anyways.</li>
            <li> This serum I hate to say sucked because everytime I used it whatever I put over it would ball up and not absorb. Used alone it leaves a white residue of something. There was number to call for free bottle and I didn&#x27;t even want a free one.</li>
            <li> This serum arrived with the rubber in the lid in a balloon shape, the liquid is dark and my pillow looked dirty in the morning.  Afraid to use and in box to be returned.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a good serum of vitamin C and not expensive. I use for many years a serum and cream of hyaluronic acid at nigth (it&#x60;s not good for use at sun ligth since it didn&#x60;t give protection). By morning I use the serum and cream of vitamin C. To be sincere I change time to time the branch of the products, The results hav been good till now.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent.  Does not leave my skin dry like some other vit c serums.</li>
            <li> I received this product the next day after buying it and after a month using it (it seems that it will last another one) my face looks like new!</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my mother and other older family relatives. This works pretty well. Of course, one could not expect it to get rid of all wrinkles. But, it did make some deep and light wrinkles in my mother&#x27;s face go away. It works, but do not expect it to work perfectly of course!</li>
            <li> Having recently changed my lifestyle, losing weight and getting back into shape..&lt;br /&gt;I needed a little confidence booster. Something to help freshen up my skin and make me feel super young again.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product under my eyes, and around my neck/ mouth lines. Let me tell you, just using it for a few weeks got me amazing results.. My skin is so soft again. AND I&#x27;ve received so many compliments! I&#x27;ve never felt better. I would totally recommenced this to anyone needing a pick me up!</li>
            <li> A couple of months ago, I started getting wrinkles on my face (mid-life problems!) and I realised I wasn&#x27;t going to retain my handsome young face and perfect skin. It was a wake-up call for me, and I needed to find a way to stop these wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I talked to friends, doctors and even dermatologists, but to no avail. But then one day, I did a little google search and found out that Vitamin C is tremendous at making your skin look so much better! There was a link on the site for this Amazon listing, so I clicked onto it and bought a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived, I opened up the box and put it in the bathroom to use on the evening. I&#x27;ve been using it once a day for a couple of weeks and it&#x27;s performed miracles on my skin. It&#x27;s tighter, smoother, clearer and looking as good as it used to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for creating this product, PRI!</li>
            <li> It arrived well packaged and on time.  Haven&#x27;t used a Vitamin C Serum prior to this one but I certainly will order it again.  Very happy with the product and the value!</li>
            <li> The product works great! My skin is noticeably clearer and tighter.</li>
            <li> I am 33 and using this product for 3 weeks. I can notice different in my skin, its clear, brighter and fine lines are getting smother. Overall great product is great</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended liquid vitamin C for my face. I researched a lot of companies and this company had the highest strength along with a reasonable price. I have not been disappointed. I have been using this product a month and already can tell an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> my wife really likes product</li>
            <li> I have heard about Vitamin C Serums before and how good they can be for the skin, but I never had much luck until I found this product. This Vitamin C serum is different from anything I have ever tried before. It makes me skin completely radiant and beautiful. After using this product, my skin actually glows, it is incredible. The best part about it is that I have told a few of my friends and even my mom about this product and now they are in love with it to! It really works just as good as you would hope it would. If you have fine lines or discoloration, this product is your saving grace. You will never know how you ever lived without it. I take this serum everywhere I go, even if I am going for a weekend trip, this serum is going with me. This product is truly amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for more gorgeous looking skin.</li>
            <li> This came way before they said it would . I like the way it goes on and there is no buring on my face .</li>
            <li> This is great for my skin...absorbs well and moisturizes without making it oily.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Sometimes, price indicates quality.  I bought this based on reviews and price.  The Vitamin C concentration added may have been 20%, but it is highly diluted by other ingredients.  I am going back to the Obagi product.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and was in good shape.  I have only used it twice so far, so I can&#x27;t give a true review.  It is a little sticky and has a pretty strong slightly burnt orange smell.  There was a phone number on the packaging to call for a free bottle, and I did so.  I got a call on my answering machine yesterday that I will return.  I think this will be good for my skin, and it seems to be strong enough to make a difference.  So far, so good!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful and it stung my face like it was attacked by bees! Threw away the bottle and it was 3/4 full. I use the Vitamin C serum by Serious Skin Care, and I will stick with that from now on.</li>
            <li> I have so many products that are &amp;#34;suppose&amp;#34; to help your skin look better and, hopefully, reduce wrinkles as much as a &amp;#34;face product&amp;#34; can. Once I heard of the Vitamin C Serum containing Hyaluronic Acid and how well it worked, I researched many providers and found this one to be the best deal, along with an extremely huge amount of positive reviews. I have used this product for over a month now and feel it to be the best thus far. Also, other products I have bought were much more expensive with very little, if any, positive results. I have never written a review, but feel everyone should try this Vitamin C Serum. It works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for 23 days, 2x daily.  I  like this serum a lot, and have used other vitamin c serums.  I plan to keep using this particular one.  I feel my skin is tighter, looks brighter, and it feels moist.  There is a need for sunscreen because the vitamin c makes your skin susceptible to the sun.  No worries there, just put on sunscreen over the top of the serum, then moisturizer.  I picked this serum after research because it is a bigger bottle, it is  contains 20% vitamin C, and it had good reviews.  Jayne</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum  make my face and neck younger looking,  brighter looking ,feel smoother and not expensive.I love this product I&#x27;m happy and would re-order it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Vitamin C serum for just about a month now. I can&#x27;t honestly say that it&#x27;s a miracle cure for lines and wrinkles, and there have been amazing overnight results, but I can say that I am seeing steady progress. I have noticed my smile lines and the lines on my forehead softening. I am 54 years old so the lines on my face are not new so it will take some time to correct them. I would say &amp;#34;give it a try&amp;#34; and give it some time.</li>
            <li> Once I received this serum the color was yellow and thick. I am not sure but according to other reviews it has oxidized. It&#x27;s very thick and sticky when applying but it does dry within a minute. I am not sure about this one. I have used other vitamin c creams but never a serum so I am not sure the consistency and color of this is good, that is why I gave it 2 stars. I really don&#x27;t see any change in my skin tho, sorry!</li>
            <li> This is THE best product I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried just about all of them!  With all the different vitamin C and hylauronic products on the market, it&#x27;s hard to choose the right one but this is it. It leaves my skin feeling youthful and fresh with the glow that I had when I was 20 years old. Wish I had taken before and after pics just so you could see the difference.</li>
            <li> Good product, great value. If you want a potent Vitamin C Serum. I apply a few drops - first thing after cleansing. Despite some initial stickiness,  it absorbs well. Then I apply a day or night cream. Layering the right products retains moisture levels in my skin, resulting in less drought-ish appearance of skin. If your skin looks dry, you are doing some damage. I have noticed a better skin texture and a healthy glow, especially when I use it in conjunction with a mild glycolic face cream. I  beginning to realize that Vitamin C is a big helper to gently lift sun damage, my brown spots are beginning to diminish.  If you are aging and looking to find something to do it more gracefully, add Vitamin C, Glycolic and Retinol creams to your daily routine.</li>
            <li> I have used the Vitamin C Serum for 2 mths. I didn&#x27;t have an immediate glow or change but from everthing I have read it can take several months for a significant change to appear so I will continue to use it and see if I get the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I was on a search for a Vit. C of a quality that I could mix with Hyaluronic Acid to create a mixture that I had read about. The qualities I demanded were (I thought) easy to find. I had to have a High quality product. It had to be in a brown bottle; for protection against degredation. After going through Health Food Stores and Amazon, what I found was an excellent Lab that was producing a Very high percentage of Vit. C AND the Lab knew enough to put Hyaluronic Acid in the mix. The price at AMAZON was amazingly reasonable. THE SEARCH AT AN END...I have used this PRODUCT ever since. Even though I was told to contact them with problems...I NEVER HAD A NEED.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum is an Awesome Product.  I have been using it for over a month and the results are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;It has evened out my skin tone which makes my skin look so much clearer and healthier.  I have had many complements&lt;br /&gt;from friends about how nice my skin looks.  I recomend you try this product if you want to have young healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of this four months ago and am now finishing my second bottle.  I have fair skin which is very sensitive from decades of using prescription Retin-A products and from my having had several laser resurfacing treatments.  I have experienced no adverse reactions from using this serum at least once per day, usually in the morning.  I use a cleanser my dermatologist recommended,  pat dry lightly, and apply this serum to face, neck and decolettage and, if there is any left over, to the backs of my hands. I then apply a sunscreen formulated for combination skin.  People can react very differently to any given product but I have had no problems with this serum.  I believe that it has evened out discoloration and given my skin a brighter, younger look.  I think it may have shrunk pores.  It has a very slight odor but I do not find it disagreeable.  The current issue of Allure magazine (August 2014) has an article on layering serums and oils.  Some readers might find the article useful in understanding how serums work individually and how they interact with each other.  I intend to order a third bottle of this shortly and expect to continue to use it as part of my regular routine.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Like every woman, I wanted to have a younger looking skin. I heard that vitamin C serum is good for that. I decided to give this one a try since you get more for your money. I have been following the directions and using it day and night following with a face moisturizer. At first I did not see a difference but 30 days into it, my skin is glowing. I don’t see a huge difference on my wrinkles but it looks like they are slowly fading away. I am hoping that by the time I am finished with my first bottle, another month or so, most of my fine-lines will disappear.  I will get it again.</li>
            <li> this is the best vitamin c serum i have. my skin is gettin brighter and softer.  It helps to reduce pigments on my face too</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in January and loved it.  In the meantime, I had ordered another brand to try so I used the other brand after this one and was not impressed with the other brand at all.  I just received my second bottle of this today and am glad to have it back in my beauty routine.  I will make sure to keep it in stock at all times.  Crazy but you can feel it working when you put it on.  I just turned 60 (people are shocked and never guess that I am 60) and I am being more and more picky with my skin care products.  This is a required part of my beauty routine...</li>
            <li> I have been using the vitamin C serum for a while now. Now like the way it makes my skin feel. I believe it has brightened my complexion and I am pleased with the results. I only use it in the morning so far.</li>
            <li> Looked at many vit C serums,, decided on this one based on reviews. It gives your skin a good tingle when you put it on. I got it mainly because I am doing home glycolic acid peels, and wanted this to use after. It calms my skin down well, and feels good. I used it am and pm.</li>
            <li> It was ok but I noticed they must have changed the formula in the past couple of months.  I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> This leaves an orange residue on my skin.  It does not absorb well.</li>
            <li> I am 66 I used the bottle continuously for a month ... My skin was shiny and looked very young ... I am completely pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Very effective C product.  My skin was smoother and more clear after just 4 nights!</li>
            <li> Exelent product, my clients see the difference compared to others products, thanks</li>
            <li> I am using this product with micro needling and anti wrinkle cream. It was suggested to use Vitamin C Serum after needling so that is what I am using. I put a few drops of vitamin C into my night cream also.</li>
            <li> Only used once so I can not review the product.&lt;br /&gt;Only once because the top had a defect and syphoned all over my counter &amp; floor.&lt;br /&gt;I do hope this company replaces this product</li>
            <li> I like this product and my face love it too!</li>
            <li> Most of the Vitamin C serums on the market come in 1 ounce bottles.  I have been using it morning and evening and find that 1 oz just doesnt last very long.  This product seems to be of the same quality as the other serum that I purchased.  My skin seems to be smoother expecially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Vitamin C Serum and Hyaluronic Acid..putting the two in one is awesome! You get the best of both working for you to fight the signs of aging, Vitamin C is a collagen wonder, and Hyaluronic Acid is one of the very best moisturizes! I believe you got it going on!&lt;br /&gt;Dawn</li>
            <li> We tried it for a month and it&#x27;s starting to show positive results. It had removed the fine wrinkles. My skin feels softer and my pores are smaller. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This serum delivers swift results: I saw an improvement in my skin&#x27;s tone and texture right away. It&#x27;s potent yet gentle and noticeably brightens my skin and mood - a definite must-have.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a month with no visible difference to my skin at all. Quite disappointed by this product</li>
            <li> I tried it.  The first time I opened the bottle, serum spurted from it and the contents oozed to the top preventing me from reinserting the dropper in order to reseal the bottle.  The product had an unpleasant odor, like something burnt.  Product continued to slowly ooze and overflow the bottle for at least an hour, leaving a mess on both the bottle and on the bathtub where I had set it to contain the oozing mess.  The mess left a bright orange stain on the porcelan bathtub: the stain could not be scrubbed off, but I finally was able to eliminate it by soaking with full-strength chlorine bleach.  To save myself from paying shipping again, I had hoped to get the supplier (Online Healthy Offers) to refund me without having to return the bottle, so I called their 801 number twice and only got voicemail - they never returned my calls.  Naturally, I will not buy from them again.  I guess one star is the lowest possible rating, otherwise I would have given zero.</li>
            <li> I agree with WhitneyP&#x27;s review. (&amp;#34;... it arrived oxidized (yellow), goopy, poorly mixed, and with a foul smell. I also noticed that the serum doesn&#x27;t actually absorb into the skin, but instead sits on the surface with a sticky texture.&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got a bad batch. It smelled like Chinese takeout (which I like to eat but not wear on my face!). I can&#x27;t comment on the results of using it because after I tried it once, I sent it back. I will continue searching for a (pleasant smelling and effective) Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> For the price and quality this is the best C serum listed on Amazon. I used OZ Naturals before trying PRI. This one is thicker so you use less and I saw better results as far as my skin being clearer, firmer, and has improved overall tone.</li>
            <li> The product is fabulous, very easy to use and you don&#x27;t need a lot.  I noticed a difference in the first two weeks that made a considerable difference in the appearance of my face. I would recommend this product, especially for the price you are getting a great product.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product ive noticed my skin smoothing out from using it a couple of weeks now.</li>
            <li> Did not notice markable improvement</li>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve only used it for 4 days now, but I can see immediately that is working to smooth my tired skin.  This serum is silky smooth!  I feel like I&#x27;ve had a face lift already as it immediately tightens your skin on application. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Product arrived undamaged in the mail and used shortly after. Feels very good where I applied it and have high hopes that it will produce good results. Will follow this up in a week or two to update. So says my wife and I must admit she is looking good.</li>
            <li> I really like tis product, still trying it out. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Too soon to assess, so far have not noticed much</li>
            <li> I love the product after using it my face felt soft and silky, I intend to purchase more but don&#x27;t forget my free bottle</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this serum at first--the ingredients list looked nice and simple (no harmful ingredients like citrus peel oils, which can cause burns upon exposure to sunlight), the price was great for the size, it&#x27;s formulated at the optimum concentration (20%), and I liked the consistency (it&#x27;s a thick clear gel that didn&#x27;t feel overly sticky or sting my skin). However, I decided to pH test the serum at home and it came out at around 6.5! Vitamin C products should be formulated at a pH of below 3.5, and ideally around 3.0, in order to have any benefits for the skin. &amp;#34;L-ascorbic acid must be formulated at pH levels less than 3.5 to enter the skin. Maximal concentration for optimal percutaneous absorption was 20%.&amp;#34; (Pinnell et al., Dermatol Surg 2001 Feb, Pubmed ID 11207686)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This high of a pH could have damaging effects on the skin, as well: &amp;#34;It is demonstrated that skin with pH values below 5.0 is in a better condition than skin with pH values above 5.0, as shown by measuring the biophysical parameters of barrier function, moisturization and scaling. The effect of pH on adhesion of resident skin microflora was also assessed; an acid skin pH (4-4.5) keeps the resident bacterial flora attached to the skin, whereas an alkaline pH (8-9) promotes the dispersal from the skin.&amp;#34; (Lambers et al., Int J Cosmet Sci 2006 Oct, Pubmed ID 18489300)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to the company to ask about the target pH of their product, in case it&#x27;s normally supposed to be lower but I got a bad batch, and they said they&#x27;d ask the lab, but never got back to me. I asked for a refund and they gave me a full refund instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price, but not if the pH is too high for the product to actually have any effect.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a woman in her late sixties and have been taking care of my skin for a long time. Most people wouldn&#x27;t believe my age if I told them (I tell no one).&lt;br /&gt;I use this serum at night. I feel that it has helped to keep my skin relatively tight. One must remember that this is not a face lift so you need to be realistic about its success.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many vitamin C serums over the last couple of years. I have paid almost $100 for Perricone vitamin C serum, so I decided to take a risk and try something new. Not only is this serum very inexpensive, it&#x27;s far better than Perricone. My skin is much brighter and more radiant than ever. The quality of ingredients has made this serum a &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34; for anyone in need of a high quality vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I received this product very quickly after I place the order.  I have been using this light serum for only two weeks and my face already looks firmer and my pores are less noticeable and my skin looks soft but not oily. You only need a few drops to work all over your face. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results with long-term use. I would highly recommend this product.  Love! Love! Love it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> There are several vitamin c serum products on Amazon, so I researched and read reviews on all..I decided on Pri company , as you received twice the amount for the price as other companies out there..&lt;br /&gt;I am 65 years old and wanted to freshen my skin, as well as treat fine lines, around the mouth...&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for a month, and I am very happy to say that it works..My skin is softer and brighter, and I notice a difference in those fine lines...&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it is important to cleanse your face well, and let dry for about 10 minutes, then apply the serum, and let dry.Then you can use your normal other skin preparations..At first there may be some slight stinging, and if this occurs, use just once a day until your skin becomes accustom to the serum, then you can apply twice a day...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product and much better than many at twice and three times the price..</li>
            <li> Received this item with a HUGE bubble at the top...only to find out the contents were under pressure from the Arizona heat.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t appreciate how the seller didn&#x27;t collect payment for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is tacky.&lt;br /&gt;I fell asleep after applying this product (my usual nightly routine) and I woke up with the pillow fibers all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;This product also burns my skin a bit- I haven&#x27;t experienced this with my other serums.&lt;br /&gt;Not quite sure what to say regarding results because I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in skin as yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using the vitamin C for 3 weeks now.  Its a great product.</li>
            <li> like  this  product,not  dramatic  change, but  helps  the skin  firm!</li>
            <li> I look pretty old for my age. It&#x27;s disheartening when someone says &amp;#34;Oh I thought you were much older&amp;#34;. Was definitely tired of that so I purchased this bottle. I like how it&#x27;s soft on the skin. The vitamin helped me out greatly with eliminating most of the wrinkles I have.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY, DAMAGED MY SKIN. MADE IT GREASE, DEVELOPED ACNE. I HAVE BLACK SPOTS AROUND MY FACE :(</li>
            <li> This product is amazing it has reduced the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It It is Fast absorbing, non-greasy, has no odor and you can notice it in just a few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you are looking for a cheaper product, don&#x27;t bother, this is the best for it&#x27;s price and beats all other competitors!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that&#x27;s effective in improving your skin and face. Skin feels like a baby once I&#x27;ve used it! Pores are also less noticeable. Only a few drops is needed, so it&#x27;ll last long! I&#x27;m simply loving this product. So worth it&#x27;s price. Recommended for all!</li>
            <li> This stuff seemed to be good quality and for the price, it seems to be a good deal.  However, i have since discovered that vitamin C makes me break out and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just this formula.  I also tried Paula&#x27;s Choice vitamin C serum and similarly broke out.  If you know you don&#x27;t break out from using vitamin C, this is pretty good quality if you&#x27;re on a budget!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Serum. It has out preformed my expectations. After using it for several weeks I feel my face is firmer. I also  see improvements in the fine lines</li>
            <li> I have been using this for only a couple of weeks and my skin looks brighter and the wrinkles are smoother.</li>
            <li> vitamin c serum  helps promote collagen production  tingly to the skin.  can feel it working. apply squalane after makes a difference great product</li>
            <li> I started using this product on my face about two months ago.  I apply it twice daily and my skin appears tighter and more radiant.  The 2oz bottle lasts about a month because you do not have to use very much.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C Serum.  I feel it has helped my skin just after a few days.  I love how it feels and I am sure others will also.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now. I have noticed that my skin is getting more soft and supple. Hopefully I will see more results in the next month so I can do an update to this review.</li>
            <li> After using this for 5 weeks, I am seeing results.  I like to use it on my face and neck before i go to sleep and the next morning, my skin looks and feels refreshed.</li>
            <li> i like  this  vitamin c  serum  alot  seems  to  absorb  right into  my  skin  non  greasy  feeling  have  high hopes  for  this  product</li>
            <li> As others have indicated, this vitamin C serum is a bit sticky at first, but absorbs quickly.  I apply it directly to clean skin and once it has absorbed I apply a moisturizer.  My skin tone and texture has improved.  This bottle is double the size and priced comparable to smaller bottles.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I heard about this combo of products from Ellen....and figured I&#x27;d give it a try! Well, I can definitely notice a difference. I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles....or bad skin, but I had a few, small, crows feet and started seeing a few forehead wrinkles. This product DEFINITELY decreased the wrinkles in only a short amount of time. I use this product morning and night, and you ony need about 5-6 drops for your entire face and neck! I used another brand that was gone within two weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you do have to be aware of your current face &#x27;situation&#x27; to be able to notice a difference. Perhaps those giving it a negative review already have too many wrinkles to notice a difference....or don&#x27;t truly look at their face much. I am well aware of my face! In fact, I have gotten Botox once before....I made a second apt to get it touched up again, and cancelled it bc it wasn&#x27;t really needed.  Of course, Botox would make a more noticeable difference, but why pay $400+ if it&#x27;s not really needed?</li>
            <li> perfect in every way,my skin just takes it right in,i have combination skin and this works best</li>
            <li> When I initially used this product, I was not impressed.  After a week of use, I began to see the difference.  My pores are shrinking and my skin is glowing.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When I received my product, it was leaking out all around the bottle.  I did decide to use it and found that the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth as well as neck area have deffinetly diminished</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe i didn&#x27;t know about this product before.  It is amazing.  And can really see it working even after just the first application.  It makes pores dissapear, skin smoother, glowing, younger, fine lines going away.  Wonderful product!  Even my facialist agrees and swears by it!  Terrific product i will never be without!</li>
            <li> I &#x27;v. Been using this product for about 8 months for my hyper pigmentation. My opinion, works really well. My dark spots have lightened, my skin glows from this. Its not an overnight miracle, but, be consistent and it works. I ordered 12 this time, since it&#x27;s always out of stock!</li>
            <li> My 50-yr-old daughter turned me onto this.  She had even sent me her before and after picture --amazing.  I&#x27;ve been using it for at least a month now.  This is one great product.  And it really does lessen the deepness of wrinkles. I even use it on my fingernails, cuticle, etc.  What a difference this product has made.  The incredible dryness is now gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product containing fresh vitamin C.  The first bottle I recieved was a liquid with a dropper. It did cake up, and crystalize on the neck of the bottle.  I felt it tingle when applied, and my skin looked luminous.  The next 3 bottles were a gel, in a pump bottle...not feeling anything or seeing the results I had at first.  Probably on to something else.  No one can answer why the formula change.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love the texture and how it makes my skin feel. It hydrates, it tightens and helps even my skin tone. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference.  I&#x27;m still gonna keep using for a few for months just to see...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and my skin looks brighter but I haven&#x27;t seen any significant reduction in dark spots. I would continue using this product as a toner but will keep looking for another product to correct dark spots and even skin tone.</li>
            <li> I started using this serum for about 2 weeks and already, as the result, my skin begin to show clarity. My acne scars are recover and my overall face skin is brighter, at work my co-worker asked me if I starting using different facial care cause my skin was so nice :) LOVE this stuff! I&#x27;m planning to buy more Vitamin C Serum for my facial care!</li>
            <li> My mother has some aging wrinkles and other marks on her face and asked me to find a treatment for her. I dug up some solutions on amazon for a budget and I stumped on this as one of them and my mom has been thanking me since. She uses it daily on her face within a few weeks you could see some results. It&#x27;s very simple and easy to use as well. Her skin is now much smoother and has a nice glow to it, this serum is simply awesome.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product. Price was a consideration, and quality is a bonus. Can feel the product when it is applied, dries to a smooth finish and diminishes the look of wrinkles and lines. Face looks firmer and smoother. At this price I am using it on underarm wobbles too, and they have smoothed out considerably. Will def buy this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brand&#x27;s serum for the value size but it arrived oxidized (yellow), goopy, poorly mixed, and with a foul smell. I also noticed that the serum doesn&#x27;t actually absorb into the skin, but instead sits on the surface with a sticky texture.</li>
            <li> Using this with exercise and Raspberry Ketones. I had plateaued on wt. loss so I needed help! So, with this I look better and makes wt. loss even more apparent! It helped my cheeks, crows feet and neck&#x3D;this did it in less than 3 weeks!  I am thin, but needed firming, now loosing , down to 127# with a firmer face, after 2 weeks; my son was, \\&quot; wow, mom, your face looks ten years younger! What did you do, I just saw you a month ago!\\&quot;  YEAH!! I turn 60 next week so this is a must!!</li>
            <li> The results of using this product are great. However, the smell is horrible. It smells like a really cheap bottle of vitamins. The worst part is, the smell does not dissipate.  I won&#x27;t be buying this product again sadly.</li>
            <li> I do outdoor sports regularly and have been using my regular vitamin C on face with good results. Based on reviews on Amazon I bought this a try for past one month. Sadly, my face had turned darker and light pigmentation appeared which proved that this product just don&#x27;t work as most reviews claimed to be. My friends &amp; co worker also noticed my face got darker in just one month from switching to this product. The hyaluronic acid ingredient might gives a smoothing effect to your face but I am skeptical of it&#x27;s penetration because this product gives you the feel of a thin layer of film sitting on your face. As for maintaining brighter siin from the benefit of Vitamin C from this brand? Nope!!</li>
            <li> I have use this product twice a day, at night before going to bed and in the morning before my day cream. I really liked the results. In the winter, my skin is usually dull and spoty. I felt that this winter, it was better, more smooth. I think it may even reduce the fine lines. It can sting a little but nothing bad. The only tricky part is the consistency, it seems that it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well but I guess it still works!</li>
            <li> I really love this Serum.  I had shaded marks and lines on my face and neck.  After using this for around 4 weeks, the spots and marks on my face have since faded and my 36 year old skin feels rejuvenated.  I get questions now about how old I am and nobody can guess, and this is a pleasant surprise for me as a busy mom with all of today&#x27;s trails.  I am confident that I will continue using this product in my years to come.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Large quantity.  Shipped promptly.  This vitamin C seems to be a different color (lighter) than other ones I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li> I chose this particular serum because it provided twice the volume of most vitamin C/ hyaluronic acid serums for a better price. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, although usually just once a day. It goes on slightly sticky, but dries within minutes. Although I have not noticed any significant change in my wrinkles, my skin is noticeably softer and supple when this serum is on. And here in Central Texas humidity, I appreciate light weight, oil-free but very effective hydration for my 50 year old skin. I&#x27;m going to try to use it twice a day and report back...</li>
            <li> Do not buy this crap. It&#x27;s smells like stinky feet and when you apply it to the skin, it creates a white dry residue on the skin. This is by far the worst product I&#x27;ve bought off Amazon to date. I&#x27;ll never buy this crap again. Also, the product came to me with a light yellow tint color, meaning that the product lost all of it&#x27;s potency before it was even delivered. Avoid this product and the company.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few vitamin c serums, but non worked this well. I recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my face for about 10 weeks.  I put it on at night, and it seems to make my skin feel smooth when I wake up, but I can&#x27;t really tell a remarkable difference in my skin&#x27;s quality.  I&#x27;m about halfway through the bottle, and the serum has turned a yellow color (I presume from daily exposure to air), and it has developed a sharp/sour odor.  The serum, when dry, smells slightly chemical, like the way self-tanning lotion smells.  Also, the dropper/lid leaks around the top of the bottle, causing a crusty residue on the bottle that needs to be cleaned often.  I will use this up but will probably look for a different Vitamin C product next time around.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is absolutely essential to prevent UV damage on your skin, and it also reverses the damage done. Most products I&#x27;ve found are MUCH more expensive, but this serum has all of the necessary ingredients at a reasonable price. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum definitely works to decrease the fine lines and wrinkles on my face.  I am thrilled with it.  It is soothing and feels wonderful going on and I honestly have seen less lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to revise my review of this Serum because I found out that if Vitamin C Serum is yellow it has oxydized.  My serum was yellow when I got it.  I discarded it and purchased another brand.</li>
            <li> took a while to get used to...but turned out to be really good. I will definitely recommend this product. it gets an A</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s talk facts: this vitamin C serum works. This serum makes skin smooth and does really minimize wrinkles. Actually,  some on my forehead went away. Customer service is fantastic. Great price. Works. It&#x27;s a win win.</li>
            <li> This serum works well for me, even cleared up my acne! Works better than retin A.  but I should say you always have to use moisturizer after it dries on your skin, I use vitamin C cream moisturizer,  it will observe it better, with out moisturizer it will dry your skin, otherwise it was a miracle for me!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! It&#x27;s easy to use after shaving makes the skin smooth and hydrates it very well. I mix a bit with my face cream every morning and before I sleep. With continued use this product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> I love it! It absorbs very quickly, does not leave your skin sticky at all. My skin looks good, it helps to prevent pimples. No smell at all.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. I use it twice a day along with a face cream. I would recommend it to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better and, although I am ultra sensitive, this isn&#x27;t irritating it! Worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;xxxx&lt;br /&gt;xxxxx&lt;br /&gt;xxxxx</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum is better than others I have tried. I initially bought it because it is double the size of anything else out there. After using it for a week, I saw definite improvement in the fine lines around my eyes, and in the deeper wrinkles on my forehead. I can&#x27;t think of a better review than that. This product works!</li>
            <li> This serum works great, my pores are smaller and my brown spots are going away, I would recommend this product. In fact my sister ordered some and she loves it</li>
            <li> EDIT:  ** UNETHICAL VENDOR \\&quot;NATURAL PRODUCTS DEPOT\\&quot; AND POSSIBLY COMPANY AS WELL -- SEE COMMENTS SECTION **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the unexpected odor, color, and texture issues mentioned in other negative reviews, which alone make the safety and efficacy of this product suspect, I wanted to mention how disappointed I was that the listed ingredients on this Amazon product page are not at all what is contained in this PRI bottle of Vitamin C serum once you receive it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.................................................................................................................................................................&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s listed on Amazon in the \\&quot;Ingredients\\&quot; section as of 03/15/14:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: 20% Vitamin C, 0.5% Ferulic acid, and hyaluronic acid&lt;br /&gt;.................................................................................................................................................................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Here are the ACTUAL ingredients as listed on the bottle itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Aqua (Deionized water), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Propylene Glycol, Triethanolamine,&lt;br /&gt;Ferulic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, d-Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerine, EDTA.&lt;br /&gt;..................................................................................................................................................................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because these particular (unmentioned) ingredients are considered unsafe for skin contact, I&#x27;m pasting in some info from the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database for you to consider before you decide whether to purchase this serum or not, because basing your decision on the Amazon listing alone isn&#x27;t providing the whole picture:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&gt;  About PROPYLENE GLYCOL:  Propylene glycol is a small organic alcohol commonly used as a skin conditioning agent. It has been associated with irritant and allergic contact dermatitis as well as contact urticaria in humans; these sensitization effects can be manifested at propylene glycol concentrations as low as 2%.

HIGH concerns: Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs); Other MODERATE concerns: Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive); Other LOW concerns: Enhanced skin absorption, Data gaps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to look up the stuff I use directly on my skin in the Cosmetics Database beforehand, but if it&#x27;s not there, I do look up the individual ingredients because I&#x27;ve gotten a chemical burn from the correct application of a product formulated with harsh preservatives, and now I&#x27;ve got permanent skin discoloration on my face as a result.  Unfortunately, many of the preservatives in this PRI serum do indeed bother my skin, which is extremely sensitive and reactive these days, and that&#x27;s the opposite of why I was buying this product.  I believed it was \\&quot;clean\\&quot; when I bought it based on the listing of ingredients.  For people with sensitive skin, rosacea, or who choose to avoid ingredients that score as potentially or definitely *unsafe for use* on the Cosmetics Database website, you might purchase this serum as I did, expecting to be able to use it safely.  But because of this bait-and-switch in only listing the commendable ingredients on the listing page -- and not the entire contents in the serum -- I now have to return it and find something else to use that is what it says it is.  Anyway, I&#x27;m thinking the company is hoping most people will just keep the serum and not say anything once they realize the actual ingredients it contains, if they bother to read the tiny print on the bottle at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheesh.  It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to buy reliable stuff on Amazon from vendors.  I just got a counterfeit Shu Uemura eyelash curler on Amazon that doesn&#x27;t work properly.  Gotta return that and now this, too.  So tired of these kinds of shady business practices.  If PRI stands behind their product and are reputable in the first place, all ingredients should have been listed in the Ingredients sections provided on the page -- not just the ingredients that are eye-catching to potential buyers.  Pretty transparently unethical on their part to leave the rest of the ingredients out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***  PLEASE SEE THE EXCHANGE IN MY COMMENTS SECTION -- THIS COMPANY &amp;/OR VENDOR \\&quot;NATURAL PRODUCTS DEPOT\\&quot; IS BLATANTLY UNETHICAL &amp; LYING TO PEOPLE.  ***s in this PRI serum do indeed bother my skin, which is extremely sensitive and reactive these days, and that&#x27;s the opposite of why I was buying this product.

But because of this bait-and-switch in only listing the commendable ingredients on the listing page -- and not the entire contents in the serum -- I now have to return it and find something else to use that is what it says it is.  Anyway, I&#x27;m thinking the company is hoping most people will just keep the serum and not say anything once they realize the actual ingredients it contains, if they bother to read the tiny print on the bottle at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheesh.  It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to buy reliable stuff on Amazon from vendors.  I just got a counterfeit Shu Uemura eyelash curler on Amazon that doesn&#x27;t work properly.  Gotta return that and now this, too.  So tired of these kinds of shady business practices.  If PRI stands behind their product and are reputable in the first place, all ingredients should have been listed in the Ingredients sections provided on the page -- not just the ingredients that are eye-catching to potential buyers.  Pretty transparently unethical on their part to leave the rest of the ingredients out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***  PLEASE SEE THE EXCHANGE IN MY COMMENTS SECTION -- THIS COMPANY &amp;/OR VENDOR \\&quot;NATURAL PRODUCTS DEPOT\\&quot; IS BLATANTLY UNETHICAL &amp; LYING TO PEOPLE.  ***</li>
            <li> I have reviewed this before.  It is great and I love the way my facial skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> Skin gets smoother and softer, clearer and more vibrant. Love this product. Good value for the money. I am about to get it again.</li>
            <li> Chose this rating because of dramatic difference in my skin after only a couple days,skin was noticeably brighter,tighter,and flawless looking.!!!! Absolutely LOVE this product and recommend this  to everyone.... also this is a 2 oz bottle when most are less ,so more product for your money!!!! 5 STARS</li>
            <li> I ordered this Serum after watching a Dr. Oz show saying that Vitamin C Serum is the best for getting rid of wrinkles.  I am 73 so didn&#x27;t hold out much hope.  After about 5 weeks of using this every day I can&#x27;t believe it but my wrinkles are really not as deep as they used to be.  Even my kids noticed the other day and asked what I was doing.  I do not like the smell of this Serum but it really is doing the job at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be slightly crystalized when shaken up...Im not sure I like it. .I see no diff. in my skin so far.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it again..</li>
            <li> This product works! I have definitely noticed a significant difference in the smoothness of my skin. The only negative comment I have is the smell, but the benefits are worth it! I have used this product for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;linha</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum worked well for me but burned my eyes and left tiny granules on my face when dry.  But it was effective. My crow&#x27;s feet and wrinkles were temporarily lifted, so I used some water and wiped the granules off my face, then applied some make-up.  I had heard a dermatologist on Dr. Oz recommend Vit. C + hydraulic for ageless skin, and I must say, this serum worked for me.  Will use it again.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle of this serum.  As an African-American w/ frequent hyperpigmentation from acne this is a must have....... I HIGHLY REC THIS PRODUCT!  The bottle size is absolutely awesome for the price!!  Most other serums are just 1 oz and you&#x27;ll be charged an obscene amount for something that&#x27;ll only last a month or so.  Vitamin C has been proven to benefit skin-types that are uneven.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my acne blemishes have faded and if I do get a new spot from a pimple the spot vanishes in a matter of DAYS - NOT WEEKS!!!  Give it a try! It does not cure acne of course but if you want assistance with spots GET THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I received on time.  I am testing it, so I don&#x27;t know yet the results, the only thing I can tell you is that burn a little bit.  I wil tell you later the results.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin care product out there. It has the perfect amount of vitamin C to restore my skin, and make me look and feel much younger. The bottle is the perfect size and can fit anywhere I need it to. And my favorite part about this product is that it reverse the signs of aging which I can confirm is true. Best skin care product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product.  I use it pre daytime moisturizer and night moisturizer.  I believe it makes those products perform better!  With consistent use, it delivers clear, even toned skin, less visible wrinkles and a look of overall well being.  A real value. I have tried more expensive products and this one trumps them all!</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s in this vitamin c serum but it&#x27;s like none I&#x27;ve tried before. Its gel based and does not feel natural to me.  All other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past are all liquid with a spoiled like smell.  This has no odor. Apparently real vitamin c serum has a stinky scent.</li>
            <li> Vit c and hyaluronic acid combo should help with fine lines and smoother skin&lt;br /&gt;Will use and monitor for improvement</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of serums and this one is great! I love the consistency and it does not feel heavy.It has a little bit of a smell but not bad!(as stated in a few reviews) I live in Florida and have spent a ton of time in the sun! This product has visibly reduced my sun spots! I would recommend it for fine lines as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vitamin C Serum for 4 weeks now and I am very satisfied with the result. When I started using the product, I also started taking vitamin C 500 mg tablet daily. My fine lines were reduced and I have a clearer, brighter complexion. I could feel the tightening effect on my skin and my family and friends commented my face is glowing and radiant. I will continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend it to people whose skin in not sensitive like mine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product everyday and noticed it evened out my skin discolorations and also improved my overall skin tone. I would continue using it and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. Works great on acne prone skin. There&#x27;s an overall improvement into skin. Will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> I ordered other vitamin C, and Hyaluronic Acid solutions online, and they were &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect ratio of Vitamin C, and Hyaluronic Acid combination for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My face is getting back its natural glow, and no more spots :)&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this.</li>
            <li> My skinn feel moist and I see the difference</li>
            <li> I have been using it for one week and my skin feels softer.</li>
            <li> My mom and I purchased the Vitamin C Serum to add to our daily facial routine. Man what a difference it made to our skin! It really helped reneegize our skin. I can feel my face and it&#x27;s definitely made it healthier and really alive.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for close to a month on my &#x27;senior&#x27; skin.  Was taken aback at first by the smell, but that quickly dissipates.  I&#x27;ve found that it especially softens the lines around my mouth area,  my face and neck area is also quite smooth.  Vitamin C serums/creams  have always been a boon for my skin, and this larger size, is a boon to my pocketbook.  Plan to keep using this product in my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this serum when I was about to reorder the Oz Naturals 20% Vitamin C serum.  While I had been enjoying that product, I couldn&#x27;t resist trying this one - half the price for twice the size!&lt;br /&gt;After a month of continuous am/pm application, scarring has faded and my skin looks brighter.  The serum has a lightweight texture, layers nicely under my daily SPF 30 moisturizer, and mixes easily with argan oil at night.  Needless to say I will reorder when this bottle is finished!</li>
            <li> have been using the product for over a month morning and night and already friends are commenting on how good my skin looks, ruddiness is gone and pores are smaller.  wish I would have found it sooner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now. I feel like my face has less wrinkles and is more smooth. I like the orangey smell and the way my skin feels. This the first vitamin C skin product I bought, usually I just buy a moisturizer (whatever is on sale). I had a facial recently and the owner of the spa told me that vitamin C would be good for my 47-year old skin. I use this, then another moisturizer over it. I don&#x27;t see any sunspots getting lighter, but I hope that with continued use of this product I&#x27;ll see more results. Shipping was fast, so I&#x27;ll probably buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I have used this product daily for a month and saw results almost instantly!  My skin feels so much firmer and the dark  age spots on my cheeks have lightened considerably.  I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone seeking a fresher look!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use after shaving makes the skin smooth and hydrates it very well. It&#x27;s been a week and I am very happy with the way the product feels on my face. Shocked what this product can do. If you have any skin condition, I believe you should give this a try!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is Awesome! When you get grown heterosexual men telling you your skin looks good then you know you are doing something right.&lt;br /&gt;I am an African American man,  that is huge on appearance, so when I can get a product that will help me keep that youthfulness I am game, and there is no shame, you know what I&#x27;m saying?  A little rhyme for That ass! 5 stars on that ass!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.  Time will tell if the 20% Vitamin C will do the job.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Skin feels softer and smooth. I had heard many good things about vitamin C serum, and decided to give this brand a try. I am so far liking the product and hope to see more results with further use.</li>
            <li> Having tried many other products without much success, my doctor recommended using topical Vitamin C.  After using one bottle, I am happy to report my Rosacea has improved remarkably.  I think it&#x27;s worth a try for those who are seeking skin irritation relief.</li>
            <li> I saw an immediate result after only a few days of using this serum. After 4 weeks I could tell a dramatic difference in my skin appearance, and I had several close friends and family compliment a change in my skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the overall results of this products.</li>
            <li> No such thing as a miracle but it does do a good job.</li>
            <li> My wife used it for a month and saw dramatic decreases in wrinkles under her neck and under her eyes. Will make this purchase again for her, as she loves this product and so do her friends!</li>
            <li> This has shown great results on my skin. My skin feels so much better and looks a lot better than it did before using this. The wrinkles that I had on my face are now going away and most of them are gone. This is really easy to use and it works really well. This is one of the best skin products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Yikes, this is awful stuff: discolored orange and sticky on my skin. There was an option for a free bottle if I called an 800 number. Hard pass. I&#x27;ve used it for three months without results. I&#x27;m going back to a previous purchase that costs more but actually works.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for 4 weeks now and i am already seeing a change. I have a dark spot on my nose that is already getting smaller and lighter. That&#x27;s just what i was hoping for. The serum is slightly sticky , but you are supposed to apply a moisturizer over serums , so that works just fine.  You don&#x27;t need to use much of the serum either. It goes a long way. So far I love this product!  Kim C</li>
            <li> I bought these serums recently (3 of them, for my mom and bf). I have used several Vitamin C serums and I am so sad to say that this time bc of the good price i bought 3 of them (1 for my mom, and bf), but this stinks and my mom&#x27;s and my skin look so bad, light spot appeared over my face and make it look like I have dirt on it. I have also developed acne. It so bad, the serum is actually brownish!! I DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND AND I WANT A REFUND!!! :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with this product when I first started using it. The product was originally clear, smelled nice and went on smoothly. Then things changed and there were inconsistencies in both the bottles and product itself.  The product became yellow, the black rubber on the dropper would actually blow up like a little balloon with the bottle closed tightly, it smelled rancid and it felt very sticky when applied. I did write a complaint, but it was not answered. I would rate it a big fat ZERO if I could.</li>
            <li> The bottle says use twice a day. However, I had severe drying of the skin. Therefore, I switched to once a day. I think it gave a brighter look to the skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Absorbs into the skin nicely. Skin appears fresh all day. Also, I have put a few drops into my night moisturizer and my skin looks younger and clear in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with my results and the purchase, cost of the serum is reasonable than any other.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a little change in my skin every week or so. Never had a pinkish glow to my skin and now it does! :) Love love love! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am at the age when I start see my face turning old so I grabbed a bottle of this and I&#x27;ve seen what it can do by making my skin fresher and nicer. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this product. My skin is clearer, my skin tone has improved, and my skin looks brighter. I use this daily and have seen great results, especially using this after derma rolling. I am on my second bottle!</li>
            <li> I use this serum 3-4 times a week in the evening after cleansing and toning  right before I apply my night crème. Just a few drops is all you&#x27;ll need so the bottle should last you several months. My skin drinks it in to the last drop.  It&#x27;s like a glass of orange juice for my face!  I get so many compliments on my skin; as a result, I believe the Vitamin C serum has a lot to do with keeping my skin younger looking.</li>
            <li> I tried the Vitamin C Serum and found it to be helpful with fine lines and  minor skin discoloration due to age and sun exposure.  I would recommend your trying this product.</li>
            <li> The morning after I first applied this serum, I was shocked as to how clear and amazing my face looked.  THE FIRST! I was glowing &amp; repetitively asked my roomate if he also noticed a difference. He too, saw the difference in my skins clarity. I am 24 and still have acne here and there, and am still left with acne scars. I hoped this was the answer to my prayers, as I have tried everything from imported creams to acid peels... I&#x27;m still applying this every night but I haven&#x27;t seen the same results like the ones I saw from the first morning of usage. It has been 1 week but I will not give up because of that first morning when I thought it was a miracle. I will try to update after I use up my bottle to see if it has saved my skin or not...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using DermaRestore from the same company, for stretch marks and scars, seems working, trusting them with my future...</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and can see a difference in my skin. I love the product and especially the price-point. Shopping around, I haven&#x27;t found one that meets my requirements in quality and affordability. Vitamin C is incredible for the skin. Don&#x27;t settle for cheap creams. This one will give you the results you look for in a Vitamin C topical treatment! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this for months and noticed no results whatsoever. Is there anything in that jar? Really, nothing. My face does not even tingle and there is 20% Vitamin C. I hear it is really great for your skin. Will have to try something else. You will see lots of good reviews but manufacturer promises another bottle for free if you put a review up on the site and let them know.</li>
            <li> heavy,thick and feels like a coating on your face, until you sweat it off because your face cant breath, tried putting it on only at night, but really i couldn&#x27;t see any difference. I will continue to use rapid wrinkle remover, stick to what you know works</li>
            <li> So far, I think it&#x27;s doing the job I wanted it to.  Need a couple more weeks to be sure!</li>
            <li> Order was delayed and tracking device did not function.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> There are lots of vitamin c serum products on Amazon, so I researched and read reviews on all and this product was my favourite with the most affordable price. A bottle lasted a month which I shared with my husband. The amount is much more than the other products available. I immediately saw results within 2 weeks of use. It makes your skin glow and more taut.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my skin. Started seeing difference after a month. Skin looks younger</li>
            <li> It does a great job fading my dark spots</li>
            <li> Great product! I have used several different brands of C serum from Amazon. The last one I bought was most definitely a fake. This particular brand is a value sized deal. It was colorless and not oxidized at all. Upon applying, I felt the tingling and mild stinging that always accompanies pure C serum.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this last month. Have tried using it but just does not meet expectations at all. Its thick and sticky and just sit on my skin, not absorbing. Leaving my face sticky and discolored all day, It has actually stained a couple neck opening on my shirts.  I just can&#x27;t bring myself to use it any longer. Doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.  It did arrive quickly as promised. That&#x27;s the only good thing I can see about this product.</li>
            <li> I really like how this product makes my skin feel. It does start to turn color so keep it in a dark place and keep the cap good so air doesn&#x27;t get to it. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> A light gel serum feels good and smooth after I put it on. And after this past week I feel firmer and my dark circles have lessened!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF, THE STRENGTH IS GOOD, EASY TO USE WITH THE DROPPER, THIS DOES HELP THE AGING ON THE SKIN, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.  ALWAYS SHIPPED QUICKLY AND PRICED VERY FAIRLY!</li>
