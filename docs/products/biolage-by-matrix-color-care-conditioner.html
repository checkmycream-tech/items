            <li>Favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Was looking for the shampoo and conditioner all over for a better price but found it here.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>but I happened to use this product and fell in love with it,  </li>
            <li>Love love love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>What I love most about it is the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>Most conditioners I&#x27;ve tried never work.</li>
            <li>My hair felt 100% better after just one use.  </li>
            <li>I love Biolage.</li>
            <li>As suspected, the new bottle worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>The slip is the best out there, the scent is lightly fresh floral but not over the top, and my hair was very soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and shiny all day long (not to mention it smells WONDERFUL)</li>
            <li>great for keeping your hair soft and strong.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love Biolage and this was a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>However, not as good as Matrix sleek look the bottle with the Orange which makes hair look much smoother.</li>
            <li>for the conditioner in general, it&#x27;s as great as all the Matrix Biolage products.</li>
            <li>the next day the shine was just beautiful.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth and easy to style.  </li>
            <li>This does a great job of color care and smells nice &amp; clean, so it doesn&#x27;t clash with perfumes or other hair products.</li>
            <li>There is a bar code sticker on top of where the real bar code is or should be.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t condition my hair at all, full of tangles when washed.  </li>
            <li>I really did see that the dye held on for longer and maintained its color more fully with this.</li>
            <li>but yet it feels nice &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>and I love the color care conditioner in particular.</li>
            <li>First, I need it to be smooth and non-tangling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled in general with the Matrix Biolage line</li>
            <li>I just keep coming back for more!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it without being able to completely comb it</li>
            <li>its worth it ...</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Well, they&#x27;re right.</li>
            <li>This gets the job done right.</li>
            <li>I have a full foil job on my hair, and I really don&#x27;t like when it fades or turns brassy.</li>
            <li>Everyone is different, but this product really works on my hair and I love it!</li>
            <li>Sure enough, mine did.</li>
            <li>So if you have the extra money, this one worked even better for me</li>
            <li>I also now gently color it with a temporary six-week hair color to enjoy different colors with the season and to soften the short brilliant-white hair that seems to enjoy my hairline :).</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job of keeping my hair soft and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well recommended.</li>
            <li>Have tried many others but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>This works great for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>my hair feels pretty damaged</li>
            <li>only stuff i will use love it.</li>
            <li>Super smooth and soft,  healthy and shiny - minimal tangling.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all shampoos and conditioners and this is the only one that helps keep my hair shiny, full of body, makes the color last longer, and is super light on my hair!</li>
            <li>Been using biolage for years and like the clean and soft feel after rinsing hair with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, it does the best it can with my coarse horse hair...does a better job than almost any other product...a little expensive but worth it...really keeps the color in your hair too.  </li>
            <li>After using it, my hair was dry and unmanageable, flying away with static.</li>
            <li>Until recently I donated it to charity each time it hit waist length, so keeping the hair full and healthy was of critical importance to me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>When I use this conditioner it makes it SOOOO much easier to comb out.</li>
            <li>not the real product...garbage</li>
            <li>If you have thick curly hair, you know that conditioning and detangling is THE most important part of the whole process.</li>
            <li>Ended up throwing away the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>This means I have two different, important needs to manage with my hair.</li>
            <li>It rinses out well and really makes a difference with my curly hair, which needs lots of moisture.  </li>
            <li>I use the real product from the salon</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell whether or not it&#x27;s really protecting my color or working to preserve it, but I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair super soft, I haven&#x27;t tried leaving this product in my hair overnight, but I have high hopes that it could work as an overnight treatment.</li>
            <li>Conditioner Leave-In Conditioner&amp;#34; and it has left my feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I try a number of hair products to keep my hair clean and long.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this product, uses it all the time, not to heavy on the hair, and makes the hair feel more manageable after use.</li>
            <li>The smell is not the same and my hair is more dry and tangled after I use it.  </li>
            <li>Second, I want to ensure the color stays full and rich for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>I have used biolage products the last 10 years and this is the first bottle I have been unsatisfied with.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product from Amazon before without a problem, but the most recent bottle I received is a completely different formula and scent and does not properly condition my hair at all.</li>
            <li>Works well, cheap enough, lasts a long time, no worries when combing tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Biolage Matrix Color Care Conditioner for many years and after using this bottle, my hair was extremely hard to come through and felt like a straw nest.  </li>
            <li>your hair is soft smoothe and it  promotesnreviatization andcolor retention</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the real product for years, it always works and this is definitely not it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have natural kinky curly, non color treated, 3c/4a hair.</li>
            <li>and WOW I was blown away.</li>
            <li>I also found that with the last two you didn&#x27;t need so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>shampoo makes my hair soft and manageable while maintaining my hair color.</li>
            <li>My hair got so hard that I had to used a different  product to be able to manage my hair.  </li>
            <li>Really helps with dry skalp.</li>
            <li>Also, they sell a General Value Product of this at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for about $6 - $9 bucks that works just as well.</li>
            <li>not sure it is true Biology...</li>
            <li>I have searched the market for a very long time looking for a conditioner that actually moisturizes my hair, and I gotta say - this stuff REALLY works.</li>
            <li>Great texture - not too thick, not too thin.</li>
            <li>Really disappointed, used Color Care for years, great product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even thinking about it deliberately - I just realized at some point that usually I&#x27;d have to have done a fresh dye by this point in the cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The closest detanglers I&#x27;ve found to this that are less expensive are the TRESemme Naturals Nourishing Moisture and the Renpure Organics Argan Oil Luxurious Conditioners - both around 6 - 8 bucks for a good amount.</li>
            <li>The smell and texture are completely different from the other Biolage products I&#x27;ve used and my hair has been unusually tangled and dry after continued use.</li>

            <li> and I can barely run a brush or comb through it when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> This was absolutely not the same Biolage conditioner I buy at the store.  </li>
            <li> I also have an oily-ish scalp, dry ends and baby fine hair, so it&#x27;s a terrible balance of moisture for my dye job and volume for my fine</li>
            <li> This is not true Biolage, this conditioner left my hair feeling dry and coarse and smelled like a bunch of chemicals.</li>

            <li> If hair this long gets tangled, it&#x27;s not a pretty sight.</li>
            <li> I finger detangle my wet hair under running water in sections, then apply this conditioner and finish detangling with a wide toothed comb.</li>
            <li> It is thick and when I apply it to my hair it feels soft and conditioning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need a lot; a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> In the past I have bought the knock-offs from Sallys because I thought there was no difference.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried all shampoos and conditioners and this is the only one that helps keep my hair shiny, full of body, makes the color last longer, and is super light on my hair!</li>
            <li> Using this product has helped me manage my color treated hair so much better.  It also helps with making your keratin treatments last longer!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it does the best it can with my coarse horse hair...does a better job than almost any other product...a little expensive but worth it...really keeps the color in your hair too.  Does what it says it does...I love it.</li>
            <li> It is a good product. However, not as good as Matrix sleek look the bottle with the Orange which makes hair look much smoother.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product, uses it all the time, not to heavy on the hair, and makes the hair feel more manageable after use.</li>
            <li> Anyone who knows anything abt Biolage knows this is a good product. It does its job conditioning your hair and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Of course this is a great product.  For me the biggest deal is the big size and low cost.</li>
            <li> Biolage has been in my famoly for over 15  yrs. your hair is soft smoothe and it  promotesnreviatization andcolor retention</li>
            <li> This does not smell like Biolage or feel like Biolage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this b4 that I got from somewhere elce,not the same product.</li>
            <li> This product is defective and probably fake. I agree with the reviews below saying the same thing. I tried to use this product and it didn&#x27;t go on my hair - I applied more and more and it felt like there was nothing there. After using it, my hair was dry and unmanageable, flying away with static. I&#x27;ve used the real product for years, it always works and this is definitely not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that another reviewer mentioned that their salon told them that fake products have stickers over the bar code and after being told, she checked and saw that was the case with her product. I went and checked and -- yup, mine too. There is a bar code sticker on top of where the real bar code is or should be. Totally sketchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy this product from Amazon again, and am disappointed that Amazon carries fraudulent products -- especially after multiple reviews saying as much. Totally decimates my confidence in their trustworthiness as a company. How do I know anything else I buy here is a legitimate product? No quality control over their listings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend anyone who need this product buy it from a salon. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is FAKE!!! I have been using this conditioner for 7 years. It is thick and when I apply it to my hair it feels soft and conditioning. This one was thin and made my hair brittle. I had to use a lot of leave in conditioner to get a comb through my hair. I just went and bought the &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; conditioner at Rite Aid and it is COMPLETELY different! What a scam...DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have midback length thick hair and am constantly struggling with tangels. It is at its worst when my hair is wet/just out of the shower. When I use this conditioner it makes it SOOOO much easier to comb out. My hair is smooth and shiny all day long (not to mention it smells WONDERFUL) This is my goto product...I just keep coming back for more!</li>
            <li> After a month of skeptism I decided to read the reviews and low and behold others have also written about this product being a fake. Well, they&#x27;re right. I&#x27;ve used the same shampoo and conditioner for years so the second I started using this I knew something was up. The smell and texture are completely different from the other Biolage products I&#x27;ve used and my hair has been unusually tangled and dry after continued use. I compared this bottle with the &amp;#34;exact&amp;#34; same one I bought from the salon and there are a ton of differences (aside from the texture and smell) with the label, barcode, serial number and even the logo.  Do NOT buy. Take it from me!</li>
            <li> This was absolutely not the same Biolage conditioner I buy at the store.  The packaging looked the same, but smelled differently and did nothing to actually condition my hair.  Felt like a scam!</li>
            <li> This believe this is a fake.  I have used this conditioner for years from my salon.  I decided to save a buck and order online.  The smell is not the same and my hair is more dry and tangled after I use it.  I took it to my salon to compare.  I was told that fake products have a sticker barcode over the original barcode.  Sure enough, mine did.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this shampoo</li>
            <li> Love that I can find deals on Amazon bc the salon will always try to squeeze every cent from ur wallet. This makes my hair super soft, I haven&#x27;t tried leaving this product in my hair overnight, but I have high hopes that it could work as an overnight treatment. Great for chemically colored hair</li>
            <li> not the real product...garbage</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this conditioner...not sure it is true Biology...it doesn&#x27;t condition my hair at all, full of tangles when washed.  I have used biolage products the last 10 years and this is the first bottle I have been unsatisfied with.</li>
            <li> Very Bad, packing label marked Color Care, bottle marked Color Last. Color Last is like putting axle grease on your hair. Very Bad. Matrix has lost it, avoid at all cost&#x27;s. Really disappointed, used Color Care for years, great product.</li>
            <li> I swim in chlorinated water about 3 times per week.  Biolage keeps my hair supple.  Chlorine is nasty and has a tendency to dry out hair.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T LIKE IT CUZ IT CONTAINS ALCOHOL WHICH MAKES MY HAIR DRY. I SWITCHED TO A DIFFERENT BRAND WHICH HAS NO CHEMICALS IN IT</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky curly, non color treated, 3c/4a hair. I tried this one because it was on sale and WOW I was blown away. The slip is the best out there, the scent is lightly fresh floral but not over the top, and my hair was very soft. If you have thick curly hair, you know that conditioning and detangling is THE most important part of the whole process. This gets the job done right. I finger detangle my wet hair under running water in sections, then apply this conditioner and finish detangling with a wide toothed comb. I don&#x27;t even need a lot; a little goes a long way. After rinsing, I did a twist out with just coconut oil and KimmayTube Leave In (recipe on YouTube)and the next day the shine was just beautiful. It&#x27;s a bit expensive but it&#x27;s probably the best at effortless detangling that I&#x27;ve tried. The closest detanglers I&#x27;ve found to this that are less expensive are the TRESemme Naturals Nourishing Moisture and the Renpure Organics Argan Oil Luxurious Conditioners - both around 6 - 8 bucks for a good amount. I also found that with the last two you didn&#x27;t need so much. So if you have the extra money, this one worked even better for me so try it and see if it makes your hair as happy as it did mine.</li>
            <li> This is not true Biolage, this conditioner left my hair feeling dry and coarse and smelled like a bunch of chemicals. I was trying to save a trip to the store by ordering it on here, I&#x27;ll never do it again. Ended up throwing away the whole bottle. Money down the drain. Literally.</li>
            <li> Great product for color treated hair! Great scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally grown my hair out to a decent&lt;br /&gt;length, but am having problems conditioning&lt;br /&gt;it without being able to completely comb it&lt;br /&gt;though my hair before rinsing.  Not only does&lt;br /&gt;Biolage by Matrix solve that problem, it also&lt;br /&gt;is great for keeping your hair soft and strong.&lt;br /&gt;This product may be a little pricey for some,&lt;br /&gt;but its worth it ... You can&#x27;t beat the results!</li>
            <li> I grow my hair out to waist length. I also now gently color it with a temporary six-week hair color to enjoy different colors with the season and to soften the short brilliant-white hair that seems to enjoy my hairline :). This means I have two different, important needs to manage with my hair. First, I need it to be smooth and non-tangling. If hair this long gets tangled, it&#x27;s not a pretty sight. Second, I want to ensure the color stays full and rich for as long as possible. I try to minimize the extra chemicals I use when possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled in general with the Matrix Biolage line and I love the color care conditioner in particular. I try a number of hair products to keep my hair clean and long. Until recently I donated it to charity each time it hit waist length, so keeping the hair full and healthy was of critical importance to me. I tested out product after product to see which worked best. Matrix Biolage&#x27;s line shone every time. So when I began coloring my hair, I wanted to see how their specialized product compared. I admit I&#x27;m a little cynical that these sorts of &amp;#34;versions&amp;#34; make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised. I really did see that the dye held on for longer and maintained its color more fully with this. I wasn&#x27;t even thinking about it deliberately - I just realized at some point that usually I&#x27;d have to have done a fresh dye by this point in the cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the conditioner in general, it&#x27;s as great as all the Matrix Biolage products. Pleasant smell. Great texture - not too thick, not too thin. It does a fantastic job of keeping my hair soft and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well recommended.</li>
            <li> I have tried every conditioner on the market, and this is the only one that works for me.  I color my hair, so it gets dry.  I use the Matrix Color Care conditioner and shampoo together.  It makes my hair feel soft and healthy.  Everyone is different, but this product really works on my hair and I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and find it just as reliable as in the past!</li>
            <li> Favorite. Conditioner. Ever.</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner.</li>
            <li> received on time and item is as expected thank you!</li>
            <li> Been using biolage for years and like the clean and soft feel after rinsing hair with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I have a full foil job on my hair, and I really don&#x27;t like when it fades or turns brassy. I also have an oily-ish scalp, dry ends and baby fine hair, so it&#x27;s a terrible balance of moisture for my dye job and volume for my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo makes my hair soft and manageable while maintaining my hair color. LOVE it! You won&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> Works well, not perfect.</li>
            <li> This does a great job of color care and smells nice &amp; clean, so it doesn&#x27;t clash with perfumes or other hair products. It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down but yet it feels nice &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s conditioner. It shows up on my door step like clockwork! It&#x27;s the very same product sold in salons, just cheaper and arrives at my doorstep.</li>
            <li> Was looking for the shampoo and conditioner all over for a better price but found it here.  Savings of about $14...which is great.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.  It rinses out well and really makes a difference with my curly hair, which needs lots of moisture.  Conditions without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a Joico fan but I happened to use this product and fell in love with it,  if recommend thus highly as it was resonably priced and free shipping always is da best</li>
            <li> Love love love this conditioner.  Have tried many others but always come back to this one. It leaves my hair silky smooth and easy to style.  Try it.</li>
            <li> awesome!  I have used it for a while &amp; can no longer find in to purchase in my area.</li>
            <li> the packaging makes you want to question whether this is a legit product or not......it might be a imitation or somethign based on the packaging...</li>
            <li> Good product, have used for years. Would recommend for anyone with colored hair. Really helps with dry skalp. Try it and see.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t prove it but I think this is fake product. I use the real product from the salon and it&#x27;s great. This stuff was like putting water on my hair. There is no way this is the same product.</li>
            <li> Great price for quality product !!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd or 3rd time using Biolage.  I love it.  What I love most about it is the way it smells.  I can&#x27;t tell whether or not it&#x27;s really protecting my color or working to preserve it, but I have no complaints.  Definitely a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> This appears to be a fake product.  I&#x27;ve used Biolage Matrix Color Care Conditioner for many years and after using this bottle, my hair was extremely hard to come through and felt like a straw nest.  I used it for a week and then decided to buy another one from the store because I could not stand it anymore.  As suspected, the new bottle worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> bought this for daughter. she loves it and stores dont seem to carry it anymore</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly, and colored hair that is extremely dry. Most conditioners I&#x27;ve tried never work. I have searched the market for a very long time looking for a conditioner that actually moisturizes my hair, and I gotta say - this stuff REALLY works. If you have thick hair, this stuff will lock into it and bathe it in moisture. You can feel it moisturizing almost instantaneously. I don&#x27;t think I will ever have to buy another conditioner again. Also, they sell a General Value Product of this at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for about $6 - $9 bucks that works just as well. I leave the Biolage Conditioner in for about 3-5 minutes, towel-dry my hair, then use this with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s &amp;#34;The Conditioner Leave-In Conditioner&amp;#34; and it has left my feeling soft and smooth. Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all for me.  My hair got so hard that I had to used a different  product to be able to manage my hair.  Not saying that this is a bad product...just didn&#x27;t work  for ME.</li>
            <li> Works well, cheap enough, lasts a long time, no worries when combing tangled hair.  Liked it. will buy again and</li>
            <li> Produce did not seem to be the same as prior purchases.</li>
            <li> is this real or fake ? doesn&#x27;t seem to small the same as the Biolage I am used too, my hair seems heavy and weighed down also.</li>
            <li> This works great for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I love Biolage and this was a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for color treated hair.  After spending literally hours in the salon getting highlights and lowlights my hair feels pretty damaged and I can barely run a brush or comb through it when it&#x27;s wet.  This product instantly resolved that problem!  My hair felt 100% better after just one use.  Super smooth and soft,  healthy and shiny - minimal tangling.  LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> As others have posted - there is something wrong with this product.  It smells differently from what I&#x27;ve bought at authorized resellers, and seems to be a fraudulent version.  Makes my hair seem like I never even used any conditioner. Very disappointed and now don&#x27;t trust any Biolage product on Amazon.  Bummer b/c I love Biolage.</li>
            <li> only stuff i will use love it.</li>
            <li> I tried the biology shampoo which I purchased at Sam&#x27;s but  they didn&#x27;t have the conditioner.  In the past I have bought the knock-offs from Sallys because I thought there was no difference.  Believe me, there is a difference.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells!</li>
            <li> While the product performs as expected, the smell is off, which would lead me to believe the product is either very old or not authentic.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from Amazon before without a problem, but the most recent bottle I received is a completely different formula and scent and does not properly condition my hair at all.</li>
            <li> super nourishing conditioner, works well with  coloured hair as well as heat damaged hair, great pricing as well, will probably repurchase</li>
