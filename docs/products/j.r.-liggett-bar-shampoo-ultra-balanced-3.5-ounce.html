            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE this shampoo bar!</li>
            <li>It was more moisture than I needed for my very fine hair, but it would probably be great for someone with thicker or dryer hair.</li>
            <li>Amazing shampoo, love it!</li>
            <li>hair has soooooo much volume and feels wonderful to touch!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and has great body and shine.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li>It also has a good lather if that is important to you.</li>
            <li>but I must say, the one time I used it my hair looked wonderful and was very shiny and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>Awesome shampoo my hair feels healthy and so soft</li>
            <li>felt awesome and got the natural editorial wavy beach hair :)</li>
            <li>Excellent, love the lush lather.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Rinses out better than bottle soaps.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it has more body</li>
            <li>It relieved my itchy scalp and the static went away.  </li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li>you are going to try one, be sure to try the Ultra Balanced Bar</li>
            <li>I love JR Liggett bar soap.</li>
            <li>(sometimes I would also get that waxy feeling if I didn&#x27;t rinse well), so it&#x27;d probably be better for those with shorter hair.</li>
            <li>Love to travel with it.</li>
            <li>Nothing works better than the J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is OK</li>
            <li>Also not too sure it&#x27;s really safe for color treatments.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the JR Liggett Bar Shampoo line.</li>
            <li>My dandruff has improved as well-- just make sure to spend some time massaging the shampoo into your scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This bar lasts a long time and works so great!  </li>
            <li>then i found this version of it and it blew the original version out of the water!</li>
            <li>I was able to transition easily.</li>
            <li>I am quite happy with this shampoo bar so far!</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful lather and gets my hair extra clean.</li>
            <li>Great natural shampoo</li>
            <li>This shampoo is really alkaline and not so good for my colored hair.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo, as well as the Original version.</li>
            <li>They have other &amp;#34;blends&amp;#34; and I found this suits my needs the best.  </li>
            <li>It tangles easily and this bar amplified that.</li>
            <li>It is incredible for packing for a long trip.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair &amp; using this seems to pump up the volume.</li>
            <li>and it is looking fine and healthier than it did when I used this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li>great natural product that is great for flying and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>My hair does feel clean when I use it, but it does not stay clean for more than 2 days.</li>
            <li>While this one was very mild, it didn&#x27;t work as well for me as the original formula.</li>
            <li>All in one product when you need to travel light.  </li>
            <li>so I do have to use a light conditioner afterwards</li>
            <li>This shampoo bar is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I gave the bar to my daughter who has experienced similar results.</li>
            <li>, so far it still looks good 3.5 days after washing.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer the original formula, but this one is great too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Does leave my hair with more static than normal.</li>
            <li>for me:  , easy combing, relieves itchy scalp and helps reduce hair loss (from my experience), bar is easy to use, hair feels clean, and eliminated static; lasted a decent amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>After using this product for two weeks, she said she saw significant improvements in reduction of</li>
            <li>It would not even get my hands clean, let alone my hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair clean without that chemical feeling.  </li>
            <li>The ultra balanced kind seems to be more emollient than the regular bar, so you don&#x27;t need a conditioner.</li>
            <li>Bought this to travel with...word to the wise: keep it dry or you will lose the bar very quickly.....</li>
            <li>It is pure and leaves my hair with a very clean smell.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo mainly because there aren&#x27;t any of the FDA approved toxins and poisons in it.</li>
            <li>But for some reason my scalp grows quickly offended by it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a good value for such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>i was so excited the first time around when i found jr liggetts shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I know it&#x27;s completely toxin-free, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>for reference: My hair was straight, fine</li>
            <li>I placed an order for a different kind.</li>
            <li>My scalp is sensitive and many pores are clogged.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the scent is nice, not heavy, just very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it will get greasy (hoping this will change over time as my hair gets more used to natural shampoos)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>, you can actually hold on to it, as it is a nice square compact size.</li>
            <li>This is a handy way to carry shampoo when traveling to several countries--no hassles at the airport.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not as dry and fly away as it normally is after washing.</li>
            <li>I got my bar and tried it right away.</li>
            <li>: I rub it 3 or 4 times over my wet hair, and I get a very satisfying lather.</li>
            <li>If you find it discouraging at first, stick with it because it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good product, only used once so far.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of static, and I was looking for something that would not dry out my scalp and retain moisture.</li>
            <li>for me:  left too much oil on my scalp and made my hair oily, my hair did not always &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, it would be nice if the bar came with a storage device for the shower</li>
            <li>Wonderful alternative to harsh chemicals in regular shampoo!</li>
            <li>I would much rather use an all natural product and have to wash my hair more often.</li>
            <li>it felt like I couldn&#x27;t really get all of my hair covered in it, but it improved with each use and quickly it lathered up in my hair like no body&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>This product did not work for my sensitive skin, scalp, and fine hair.</li>
            <li>Which is fine with me considering that this shampoo is all natural.</li>
            <li>First shampoo bar I used was J.R. Liggetts Hemp and Tea Tree oil one.</li>
            <li>It does burn if it gets in your eyes but no more than the soaps of my childhood - and you can successfully keep it out of your eyes.</li>
            <li>hair was really damaged but with this shampoo I&#x27;ve seen improvement in my hair and feels softer already!</li>
            <li>Just so everyone is aware, you need to give your hair and scalp time to adjust to this product.</li>
            <li>No two bars are exactly alike.  </li>
            <li>The peppermint is my second favorite.</li>
            <li>and the seller shipped it fast!</li>
            <li>I tried rinsing with hot water to help it out</li>
            <li>Now my hair is slightly wavy, fine (but thicker) and it&#x27;s shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>and she said this product really helped her a lot, too!</li>
            <li>Seems to lather a little more easily than the Jojoba bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works especially well for easily cleaning off suntan lotion which otherwise would take many runs of traditional chemical laden soap.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this as I&#x27;d much rather use natural products &amp; I love being able to cut down on products.</li>
            <li>but my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy in a long time.  </li>
            <li>shipping on item was pretty fast for chaotic holiday season, around 4 days.</li>
            <li>but it makes me so sad because this bar lathers AMAZINGLY!!</li>
            <li>I bought it to try out the recipe and see if it worked well with my hair before I made a large batch for myself.</li>
            <li>Will certainly purchase again and</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and leaves my hair feeling very clean with no soapy residue.</li>
            <li>I have short fine hair.</li>
            <li>I do have extremely thick curly hair, so may work better for people with fine or straight hair.</li>
            <li>- really.</li>
            <li>It is light weight solid</li>
            <li>no matter how much I rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>did lather up really well</li>
            <li>and it is absolutely incredible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much easier to use than liquid shampoo.</li>
            <li>so I was really hopeful but for me this just won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t seem to help much.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something cheap and simple to shower with, this it it.</li>
            <li>recommended this to a friend who had very oily hair</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my hair had more volume with this shampoo than any other.  </li>
            <li>I like this bar, however will return to the original formula on next purchase.</li>
            <li>My hair is less greasy, fuller, and just better looking in every way.</li>
            <li>out from the oils in this particular formula.</li>
            <li>This is unfortunate because it has such wonderful oils featured in its ingredients.</li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo bar, and will only use these in the future.  </li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling clean and soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This soap does seem to leave a little residue on the hair and it is a lot more noticeable on longer hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and clean without all the chemicals in regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>For those of you without multiple soap allergies, this shampoo in a bar is worth a try.</li>
            <li>All done with a small amount of this product, thereby making it last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I bought this JR Liggett Bar Shampoo as a result of the research I did for people with normal and wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li>(it dissolved faster than it normally would have I think).</li>
            <li>keep it right outside the shower door on it&#x27;s smallest side standing up,&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>I used it for over a month when I was in New Zealand.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new shampoo bar-</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair, which was drying out and is coarser from going gray, very soft and moistened.</li>
            <li>Not a big problem as the bars are affordable priced in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pleased, as usual, with Liggett products.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft once dry</li>
            <li>Before this I had oily, fine hair where I had to wash everyday.</li>
            <li>Tea tree version leaves scalp slightly tingly and clean feeling&lt;</li>
            <li>Hair is so soft you won&#x27;t need moisturizer</li>
            <li>and it will strip your skin and hair of its natural moisture.</li>
            <li>I just purchased this bar and have used it 5 times so far.</li>
            <li>No need to use conditioner any longer - hair is soft</li>
            <li>There is no way I could use this anywhere near my face.  </li>
            <li>As you know, when a child is still growing their hair you have to sunscreen up the head, which can be a real pain to wash out of the hair later.</li>
            <li>I like to use extra conditioner on my hair, but if I am traveling and don&#x27;t have that luxury, then I dont worry about it too much with this product.</li>
            <li>It cleans without stripping and leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Later in the week, I realized I really needed to shave my legs, and I was out of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with this product, which does not speak to its quality, is that I go through a bar much faster than the manufacturer claims.  </li>
            <li>but I know to expect that until my scalp is used to the change from the shampoo with lots of chemicals to something natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using their products for nearly a year</li>
            <li>I frequently suffered from dandruff and I had a lot of breakage of my hair strands.</li>
            <li>Could probably use a little oil after to calm down, but don&#x27;t want to make fine hair greasy</li>
            <li>Hair looked much less in volume, a highly noticeable loss which I believe was caused by the sodium hydroxide which is lye, like the stuff that was originally used to straighten African hair.</li>
            <li>I typically spend about $50 on shower products (body wash, shampoo, conditioner) within the same time frame, so this is a huge savings for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because I&#x27;ve used some other bar shampoos in the past, and I liked the old-timey packaging.</li>
            <li>My normally oily hair only needs to be washed 2 times per week, and I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I had to get right back in the shower as soon as it was dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in the middle of the transition process, about six weeks in and only starting my second bar, but already my dry and flaky scalp is incredibly better.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using bar shampoos for years in my personal quest to try to eliminate as much plastic in my life as possible.</li>
            <li>The soap itself left my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I do follow up my shampoo with a diluted apple-cider vinegar rinse, and I have soft water: these two things seem to make a big difference.</li>
            <li>My roots were usually soft if I rinsed well enough</li>
            <li>I am a recent convert from LUSH products who I have found have gotten away from the initial spirit in which that company was founded and sold itself as.</li>
            <li>Really surprised how much lather you get from such a little amount used.</li>
            <li>I tried doing various other no poo methods and nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several days in a row &amp; have switched back to the the old standard bottle of liquid shampoo.</li>
            <li>Having thin hair, I&#x27;ve always struggled with my hair going flat, and have used many volumizing shampoos and products.  </li>
            <li>I also felt my hair was much stronger, which may help with less hair loss.  </li>
            <li>really like the idea of less plastic bottles in the landfill as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Because I have hard water in my neighborhood, I use a quick vinegar rinse after shampooing with this bar, but it is not necessary.  </li>

            <li> but it does a great job of cleaning your hair.</li>
            <li> It creates great sudsy bubbles and cleans my hair squeaky.  </li>
            <li> great value, great product.</li>
            <li> I use at home, but is a great alternative when traveling.</li>
            <li> I DO like this bar for its very nice treatments to your hair:  </li>
            <li> and this shampoo is very nice for her.</li>
            <li> and this gave me the most wonderful body without using ANY conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, very mild and a great value.</li>
            <li> This should work great for many hair types.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling great even without conditioner : )</li>
            <li> I love these shampoo bars and the ultra balanced is great.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo bar!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been able to successfully space out my washings</li>
            <li> I love this soap!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo bar!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo bar!</li>
            <li> It was more moisture than I needed for my very fine hair, but it would probably be great for someone with thicker or dryer hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo, love it!</li>
            <li> hair has soooooo much volume and feels wonderful to touch!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and has great body and shine.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> It also has a good lather if that is important to you.</li>
            <li> but I must say, the one time I used it my hair looked wonderful and was very shiny and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo my hair feels healthy and so soft</li>
            <li> felt awesome and got the natural editorial wavy beach hair :)</li>
            <li> Excellent, love the lush lather.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Rinses out better than bottle soaps.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it has more body</li>
            <li> It relieved my itchy scalp and the static went away.  </li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li> you are going to try one, be sure to try the Ultra Balanced Bar</li>
            <li> I love JR Liggett bar soap.</li>
            <li> (sometimes I would also get that waxy feeling if I didn&#x27;t rinse well), so it&#x27;d probably be better for those with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Love to travel with it.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better than the J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is OK</li>
            <li> Also not too sure it&#x27;s really safe for color treatments.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the JR Liggett Bar Shampoo line.</li>
            <li> My dandruff has improved as well-- just make sure to spend some time massaging the shampoo into your scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This bar lasts a long time and works so great!  </li>
            <li> then i found this version of it and it blew the original version out of the water!</li>
            <li> I was able to transition easily.</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with this shampoo bar so far!</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful lather and gets my hair extra clean.</li>
            <li> Great natural shampoo</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really alkaline and not so good for my colored hair.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo, as well as the Original version.</li>
            <li> They have other &amp;#34;blends&amp;#34; and I found this suits my needs the best.  </li>
            <li> It tangles easily and this bar amplified that.</li>
            <li> It is incredible for packing for a long trip.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair &amp; using this seems to pump up the volume.</li>
            <li> and it is looking fine and healthier than it did when I used this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li> great natural product that is great for flying and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair does feel clean when I use it, but it does not stay clean for more than 2 days.</li>
            <li> While this one was very mild, it didn&#x27;t work as well for me as the original formula.</li>
            <li> All in one product when you need to travel light.  </li>
            <li> so I do have to use a light conditioner afterwards</li>
            <li> This shampoo bar is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I gave the bar to my daughter who has experienced similar results.</li>
            <li> , so far it still looks good 3.5 days after washing.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the original formula, but this one is great too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Does leave my hair with more static than normal.</li>
            <li> for me:  , easy combing, relieves itchy scalp and helps reduce hair loss (from my experience), bar is easy to use, hair feels clean, and eliminated static; lasted a decent amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> After using this product for two weeks, she said she saw significant improvements in reduction of</li>
            <li> It would not even get my hands clean, let alone my hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair clean without that chemical feeling.  </li>
            <li> The ultra balanced kind seems to be more emollient than the regular bar, so you don&#x27;t need a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Bought this to travel with...word to the wise: keep it dry or you will lose the bar very quickly.....</li>
            <li> It is pure and leaves my hair with a very clean smell.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo mainly because there aren&#x27;t any of the FDA approved toxins and poisons in it.</li>
            <li> But for some reason my scalp grows quickly offended by it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a good value for such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> i was so excited the first time around when i found jr liggetts shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I know it&#x27;s completely toxin-free, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> for reference: My hair was straight, fine</li>
            <li> I placed an order for a different kind.</li>
            <li> My scalp is sensitive and many pores are clogged.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the scent is nice, not heavy, just very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it will get greasy (hoping this will change over time as my hair gets more used to natural shampoos)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> , you can actually hold on to it, as it is a nice square compact size.</li>
            <li> This is a handy way to carry shampoo when traveling to several countries--no hassles at the airport.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not as dry and fly away as it normally is after washing.</li>
            <li> I got my bar and tried it right away.</li>
            <li> : I rub it 3 or 4 times over my wet hair, and I get a very satisfying lather.</li>
            <li> If you find it discouraging at first, stick with it because it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product, only used once so far.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of static, and I was looking for something that would not dry out my scalp and retain moisture.</li>
            <li> for me:  left too much oil on my scalp and made my hair oily, my hair did not always &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, it would be nice if the bar came with a storage device for the shower</li>
            <li> Wonderful alternative to harsh chemicals in regular shampoo!</li>
            <li> I would much rather use an all natural product and have to wash my hair more often.</li>
            <li> it felt like I couldn&#x27;t really get all of my hair covered in it, but it improved with each use and quickly it lathered up in my hair like no body&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li> you very much</li>
            <li> This product did not work for my sensitive skin, scalp, and fine hair.</li>
            <li> Which is fine with me considering that this shampoo is all natural.</li>
            <li> First shampoo bar I used was J.R. Liggetts Hemp and Tea Tree oil one.</li>
            <li> It does burn if it gets in your eyes but no more than the soaps of my childhood - and you can successfully keep it out of your eyes.</li>
            <li> hair was really damaged but with this shampoo I&#x27;ve seen improvement in my hair and feels softer already!</li>
            <li> Just so everyone is aware, you need to give your hair and scalp time to adjust to this product.</li>
            <li> No two bars are exactly alike.  </li>
            <li> The peppermint is my second favorite.</li>
            <li> and the seller shipped it fast!</li>
            <li> I tried rinsing with hot water to help it out</li>
            <li> Now my hair is slightly wavy, fine (but thicker) and it&#x27;s shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> and she said this product really helped her a lot, too!</li>
            <li> Seems to lather a little more easily than the Jojoba bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works especially well for easily cleaning off suntan lotion which otherwise would take many runs of traditional chemical laden soap.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this as I&#x27;d much rather use natural products &amp; I love being able to cut down on products.</li>
            <li> but my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy in a long time.  </li>
            <li> shipping on item was pretty fast for chaotic holiday season, around 4 days.</li>
            <li> but it makes me so sad because this bar lathers AMAZINGLY!!</li>
            <li> I bought it to try out the recipe and see if it worked well with my hair before I made a large batch for myself.</li>
            <li> Will certainly purchase again and</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and leaves my hair feeling very clean with no soapy residue.</li>
            <li> I have short fine hair.</li>
            <li> I do have extremely thick curly hair, so may work better for people with fine or straight hair.</li>
            <li> - really.</li>
            <li> It is light weight solid</li>
            <li> no matter how much I rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> did lather up really well</li>
            <li> and it is absolutely incredible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much easier to use than liquid shampoo.</li>
            <li> so I was really hopeful but for me this just won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t seem to help much.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something cheap and simple to shower with, this it it.</li>
            <li> recommended this to a friend who had very oily hair</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my hair had more volume with this shampoo than any other.  </li>
            <li> I like this bar, however will return to the original formula on next purchase.</li>
            <li> My hair is less greasy, fuller, and just better looking in every way.</li>
            <li> out from the oils in this particular formula.</li>
            <li> This is unfortunate because it has such wonderful oils featured in its ingredients.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo bar, and will only use these in the future.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling clean and soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This soap does seem to leave a little residue on the hair and it is a lot more noticeable on longer hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and clean without all the chemicals in regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> For those of you without multiple soap allergies, this shampoo in a bar is worth a try.</li>
            <li> All done with a small amount of this product, thereby making it last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I bought this JR Liggett Bar Shampoo as a result of the research I did for people with normal and wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> (it dissolved faster than it normally would have I think).</li>
            <li> keep it right outside the shower door on it&#x27;s smallest side standing up,&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> I used it for over a month when I was in New Zealand.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new shampoo bar-</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair, which was drying out and is coarser from going gray, very soft and moistened.</li>
            <li> Not a big problem as the bars are affordable priced in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pleased, as usual, with Liggett products.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super soft once dry</li>
            <li> Before this I had oily, fine hair where I had to wash everyday.</li>
            <li> Tea tree version leaves scalp slightly tingly and clean feeling&lt;</li>
            <li> Hair is so soft you won&#x27;t need moisturizer</li>
            <li> and it will strip your skin and hair of its natural moisture.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this bar and have used it 5 times so far.</li>
            <li> No need to use conditioner any longer - hair is soft</li>
            <li> There is no way I could use this anywhere near my face.  </li>
            <li> As you know, when a child is still growing their hair you have to sunscreen up the head, which can be a real pain to wash out of the hair later.</li>
            <li> I like to use extra conditioner on my hair, but if I am traveling and don&#x27;t have that luxury, then I dont worry about it too much with this product.</li>
            <li> It cleans without stripping and leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Later in the week, I realized I really needed to shave my legs, and I was out of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with this product, which does not speak to its quality, is that I go through a bar much faster than the manufacturer claims.  </li>
            <li> but I know to expect that until my scalp is used to the change from the shampoo with lots of chemicals to something natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using their products for nearly a year</li>
            <li> I frequently suffered from dandruff and I had a lot of breakage of my hair strands.</li>
            <li> Could probably use a little oil after to calm down, but don&#x27;t want to make fine hair greasy</li>
            <li> Hair looked much less in volume, a highly noticeable loss which I believe was caused by the sodium hydroxide which is lye, like the stuff that was originally used to straighten African hair.</li>
            <li> I typically spend about $50 on shower products (body wash, shampoo, conditioner) within the same time frame, so this is a huge savings for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve used some other bar shampoos in the past, and I liked the old-timey packaging.</li>
            <li> My normally oily hair only needs to be washed 2 times per week, and I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I had to get right back in the shower as soon as it was dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the middle of the transition process, about six weeks in and only starting my second bar, but already my dry and flaky scalp is incredibly better.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using bar shampoos for years in my personal quest to try to eliminate as much plastic in my life as possible.</li>
            <li> The soap itself left my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I do follow up my shampoo with a diluted apple-cider vinegar rinse, and I have soft water: these two things seem to make a big difference.</li>
            <li> My roots were usually soft if I rinsed well enough</li>
            <li> I am a recent convert from LUSH products who I have found have gotten away from the initial spirit in which that company was founded and sold itself as.</li>
            <li> Really surprised how much lather you get from such a little amount used.</li>
            <li> I tried doing various other no poo methods and nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several days in a row &amp; have switched back to the the old standard bottle of liquid shampoo.</li>
            <li> Having thin hair, I&#x27;ve always struggled with my hair going flat, and have used many volumizing shampoos and products.  </li>
            <li> I also felt my hair was much stronger, which may help with less hair loss.  </li>
            <li> really like the idea of less plastic bottles in the landfill as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Because I have hard water in my neighborhood, I use a quick vinegar rinse after shampooing with this bar, but it is not necessary.  </li>
            <li> I have used this once so far and because of what other reviews stated, I did not use a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> however, it does last a long time if you keep it away from running water.  </li>
            <li> I found that using it twice during a shower left it soft but a little gooey-feeling.</li>
            <li> I would suggest an apple cider vinegar rinse the first few times you use it if transition from conventional shampoo to avoid the funky hair syndrome.</li>
            <li> I read where this was not supposed to suds in hard water and maybe it doesn&#x27;t as much as some might want</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I think it has to do with the acv and how long I&#x27;m leaving it in</li>
            <li> This company has been around a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my baby in the bath, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> We are going on a long backpack trip</li>
            <li> word of warning: the first time I used the product, my hair was in such bad condition from dying and overall treatment, that it was actually kind of difficult to use this</li>
            <li> Once its starts to rinset my hair feels dry and frail</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dry, with this shampoo</li>
            <li> This shampoo bar does clean hair well, but after about twelve hours my hair seemed to have a waxy feel &amp; became difficult to pull a comb through.</li>
            <li> So I was very sorry not to be able to use it.  </li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical (terrified) of using soap on my super-fine hair, but I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I live in Wisconsin and even with the hard water in our area</li>
            <li> I originally started using the original shampoo formula because I had terrible skin reactions to all hair products.</li>
            <li> and it was very dry when I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I set it in its case (just a regular walmart travel soap case and it was still wet and the bottom half of the soap liquefied in the dish.</li>
            <li> These little bars last forever too!</li>
            <li> We ended up using the bar to wash our hands, which given the price, seems like such a waste.</li>
            <li> This stuff is bad, and causes hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;Since stopping the use of this bar, I am washing with water only and using a boar brush to clean it</li>
            <li> I also have dry and frizzy hair - this shampoo makes my hair feel smoother and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be trying some of their other bars soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan to use this as shampoo for my baby girl due in April.</li>
            <li> I am trying the other bars to see if the balance my hair needs is in another bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying their other formulas.</li>
            <li> tried one other of Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars (Jojoba &amp; Peppermint)</li>
            <li> Every other day during the hotter months and each time I work out or sweat from yard work or indoor projects regardless of season.  </li>
            <li> You can also use it as shaving soap, but it doesn&#x27;t lather up like other shaving soaps.</li>
            <li> Ever since I received one of these shampoo bars as a gift, I haven&#x27;t used any other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> And a little of this soap goes a very long way</li>
            <li> I have really REALLY long hair (down to my butt), and I&#x27;m not sure if that maybe made it difficult for the shampoo to rinse out, but I more often than not experienced a waxy buildup in my hair, usually the last 6 inches of my hair, which would make my hair actively sticky, the knots were a nightmare and there was always lint in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have medium-long very thick slightly wavy hair that has had a crazy frizz problem this winter so far that no shampoo has been able to tame!</li>
            <li> Use one bar for shampoo, face wash, and body soap if you&#x27;d like...really cuts down on products!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is a lot less oily now</li>
            <li> I lost less hair when combing my hair out with this bar, and I would recommend it for that.</li>
            <li> this shampoo bar gives me less of the &amp;#34;waxies&amp;#34; than the castile soap and shikaki rinse.</li>
            <li> Melts slightly in shower if not fully out of stream of water (even slightest spray melts the bars).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a month and a half</li>
            <li> It has bounce, less frizz, and it&#x27;s softer and healthier.</li>
            <li> I use this with a little baking soda, rinse then finish off with a 1:4 spray of acv and water and then rinse again.</li>
            <li> a little tray</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair</li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> but I still wash everyday because I workout heavily at the gym.</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair without cleaning my roots, even though I tried my hardest to work it into them.</li>
            <li> I ordered this bar in an attempt to get a sudsy shampoo feeling without using the harsh detergent-based and chemical ridden shampoos on store shelves.  </li>
            <li> and i have to stop using for a few days.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly oilier than usual</li>
            <li> I have dry, thick, gray hair that loses moisture if I shampoo too often.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this products, and am terribly disappointed!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t rinse it because it was so tangled and too thick to even get water to the underneath.</li>
            <li> I have thick locs (dread locs for those who do not understand) .</li>
            <li> It was reeeeaaallly hard to work a lather out of it and a little painful on your hands due to the square shape.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the results and it was very difficult to comb out my wet hair after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin but lots of it so in a way thick.</li>
            <li> In situations like these, I usually use a failed shampoo or conditioner anyway, so I figured why not try out the bar?</li>
            <li> however it makes my hair nearly impossible to brush while wet.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, so oily-looking hair is an issue.  </li>
            <li> It was weird to get use to a shampoo bar</li>

            <li> Well I sorta hate it.</li>
            <li> I used these for about 7 months and my hair had thinned and looked awful.</li>
            <li> It smells HORRIBLE.  </li>

            <li> I was so sorry to be allergic to this (terrible itching of scalp and body) but I must say, the one time I used it my hair looked wonderful and was very shiny and easy to manage.  So I was very sorry not to be able to use it.  For those of you without multiple soap allergies, this shampoo in a bar is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Been using Liggetts for about 5 years now and will use nothing else. I originally started using the original shampoo formula because I had terrible skin reactions to all hair products. I&#x27;ve had no problems in years because I stuck with Liggetts! I have short fine hair. I wash my hair everyday and I never need conditioner. Love it!</li>
            <li> This bar soap is the best.  It is incredible for packing for a long trip.  Lasts a long time.  I used it for over a month when I was in New Zealand.  Still had some left when I came home.  The I realized it was easier at home too.  So, I stopped fighting with bottles that kept falling into the bathtub.  Now it is the only thing I used at home or on the road.  Does a great job of cleaning.  Rinses out better than bottle soaps.  It is just a great product!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo bar! Lasts a long time and leaves my hair feeling very clean with no soapy residue.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product, only used once so far. My hair is not as dry and fly away as it normally is after washing. Also because it is mostly white I noticed no yellowing, something I have to watch for with all hair products. Shoulder length hair so I don&#x27;t wash every day, so far it still looks good 3.5 days after washing.</li>
            <li> This should work great for many hair types.</li>
            <li> I recently started using shampoo bars and apple cider vinegar for my hair cleansing routine. First shampoo bar I used was J.R. Liggetts Hemp and Tea Tree oil one. It was weird to get use to a shampoo bar but once I learned how to use it I didn&#x27;t mind. The next bar I choose to try was this Ultra Balanced bar. Well I sorta hate it. My hair is thin but lots of it so in a way thick. It tangles easily and this bar amplified that. I couldn&#x27;t rinse it because it was so tangled and too thick to even get water to the underneath. I don&#x27;t know why this one does this but it makes me so sad because this bar lathers AMAZINGLY!! Once its starts to rinset my hair feels dry and frail I&#x27;ve actually gotten damage from trying to stick with this bar. I placed an order for a different kind. I now have to repair some hair and go forth.</li>
            <li> I use this with a little baking soda, rinse then finish off with a 1:4 spray of acv and water and then rinse again. I tried doing various other no poo methods and nothing really worked. My hair was either too oily and/or waxy. I tried it for a max of 15 days. Before that I was using a 70% organic shampoo. So I would say that my hair wasn&#x27;t in shock when I tried this shampoo bar. I was able to transition easily. The method I&#x27;m using now keeps my hair looking great. Sometimes it has more body and I&#x27;m still trying to figure that out lol. I think it has to do with the acv and how long I&#x27;m leaving it in but I&#x27;m still experimenting. I def. recommend. I&#x27;m going to be trying some of their other bars soon.&lt;br /&gt;PS Before this I had oily, fine hair where I had to wash everyday. My hair is a lot less oily now but I still wash everyday because I workout heavily at the gym.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, very mild and a great value. I&#x27;m still in the middle of the transition process, about six weeks in and only starting my second bar, but already my dry and flaky scalp is incredibly better. I plan to use this as shampoo for my baby girl due in April. Recommended!</li>
            <li> My scalp is sensitive and many pores are clogged. This company has been around a long time. I use the bar sparingly with only 1 application per washing. Hair is so soft you won&#x27;t need moisturizer - really. I found that using it twice during a shower left it soft but a little gooey-feeling. Shampoo only once.</li>
            <li> very different then regular shampoo.  Great for camping</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo, as well as the Original version. Cleans great, lathers well, and feels great after the rinse. All done with a small amount of this product, thereby making it last a good amount of time. It is light weight solid so it travels well whether you are backpacking or flying. Best part- no chemicals for you or the environment. It does burn if it gets in your eyes but no more than the soaps of my childhood - and you can successfully keep it out of your eyes. You also can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Bought this to travel with...word to the wise: keep it dry or you will lose the bar very quickly.....I set it in its case (just a regular walmart travel soap case and it was still wet and the bottom half of the soap liquefied in the dish. I would suggest a soap case that has raised parts for drainage. The soap itself left my hair very soft and manageable. I would suggest an apple cider vinegar rinse the first few times you use it if transition from conventional shampoo to avoid the funky hair syndrome.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super soft once dry and I&#x27;ve been able to successfully space out my washings however it makes my hair nearly impossible to brush while wet. Could be just my hair though</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical (terrified) of using soap on my super-fine hair, but I&#x27;m so glad I tried it. My hair is less greasy, fuller, and just better looking in every way. I do follow up my shampoo with a diluted apple-cider vinegar rinse, and I have soft water: these two things seem to make a big difference. And a little of this soap goes a very long way: I rub it 3 or 4 times over my wet hair, and I get a very satisfying lather.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo my hair feels healthy and so soft</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a shampoo bar since Burt&#x27;s Bees stopped making theirs. I tried some I found here on Amazon and they were horrid, left my hair feeling sludgey no matter how much I rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;I was attracted to the packaging on this, to tell the truth, then the reviews. I got my bar and tried it right away. My hair, with regular shampoos, has waves, with this bar, I have Shirley temple, bouncy curls! My hair feels clean and has great body and shine. Oh, and the scent is nice, not heavy, just very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I am a happy customer and will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It leaves my hair, which was drying out and is coarser from going gray, very soft and moistened. I just feel cleaner from head to toe with smoother, softer skin and hair...and I know it&#x27;s completely toxin-free, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo mainly because there aren&#x27;t any of the FDA approved toxins and poisons in it. It is pure and leaves my hair with a very clean smell. My hair is naturally dry, with this shampoo I don&#x27;t even need a conditioner. It is great for camping or out-door enthusiasts, because it is so light-weight and compact. I use it at home, as well.</li>
            <li> i like this product.  i don&#x27;t have oily hair anymore.  hair looks healthier than ever.  just wish it was cheaper.  however, it does last a long time if you keep it away from running water.  get a soap saver...they go together</li>
            <li> I bought this JR Liggett Bar Shampoo as a result of the research I did for people with normal and wavy/curly hair. I get a lot of static, and I was looking for something that would not dry out my scalp and retain moisture. It definately makes your hair retain moisture.  Sometimes it did not &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; out from the oils in this particular formula. It relieved my itchy scalp and the static went away.  I also noticed I had greasy roots after a day or two.  I DO like this bar for its very nice treatments to your hair:  I lost less hair when combing my hair out with this bar, and I would recommend it for that. I also felt my hair was much stronger, which may help with less hair loss.  I am trying the other bars to see if the balance my hair needs is in another bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros for me:  , easy combing, relieves itchy scalp and helps reduce hair loss (from my experience), bar is easy to use, hair feels clean, and eliminated static; lasted a decent amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Cons for me:  left too much oil on my scalp and made my hair oily, my hair did not always &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, it would be nice if the bar came with a storage device for the shower (it dissolved faster than it normally would have I think).</li>
            <li> wonderful all purpose bar soap.... serves for shaving, shampoo, body scrub. NO Fragrance. Lots of foam if you work it between your hands. I do all I can to avoid plastic bottles and chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li> This bar lasts a long time and works so great!  I look forward to trying their other formulas. Seems to help with scalp issues.</li>
            <li> Great natural shampoo</li>
            <li> This burns my skin and leaves a &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling. This soap is very basic in pH and it will strip your skin and hair of its natural moisture. This is unfortunate because it has such wonderful oils featured in its ingredients. This product did not work for my sensitive skin, scalp, and fine hair. I still swear by WEN Cleansing Conditioner for washing and conditioning hair.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;My hair was really damaged but with this shampoo I&#x27;ve seen improvement in my hair and feels softer already! I only wash it 1 or 2 a week and even yesterday that I went into the ocean  after I came out my hair felt awesome and got the natural editorial wavy beach hair :)</li>
            <li> Just so everyone is aware, you need to give your hair and scalp time to adjust to this product. I live in Wisconsin and even with the hard water in our area this shampoo bar gives me less of the &amp;#34;waxies&amp;#34; than the castile soap and shikaki rinse. I still use a citric acid rinse with the Ligget, but now i&#x27;m hooked! I love the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo bar, and will only use these in the future.  I personally prefer the original formula, but this one is great too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I love this shampoo bar. I bought it to try out the recipe and see if it worked well with my hair before I made a large batch for myself. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this bar and have used it 5 times so far. I also purchased the tea tree one so I could alternate and see how they felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great lather (although we have a water softener in our house which may help with this)&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves my hair with a &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling, yet not stripped if that makes sense&lt;br /&gt;- No need to use conditioner any longer - hair is soft&lt;br /&gt;- Use one bar for shampoo, face wash, and body soap if you&#x27;d like...really cuts down on products!&lt;br /&gt;- I have extremely fine hair &amp; using this seems to pump up the volume. Unlike some - I still do have to wash my hair every day or else it will get greasy (hoping this will change over time as my hair gets more used to natural shampoos)&lt;br /&gt;- Tea tree version leaves scalp slightly tingly and clean feeling&lt;br /&gt;- Affordable! Under $7 for a product that is multi-purpose and can last 10+ weeks? I typically spend about $50 on shower products (body wash, shampoo, conditioner) within the same time frame, so this is a huge savings for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Does leave my hair with more static than normal. Could probably use a little oil after to calm down, but don&#x27;t want to make fine hair greasy&lt;br /&gt;- Melts slightly in shower if not fully out of stream of water (even slightest spray melts the bars). Not a big problem as the bars are affordable priced in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - I am very happy with the purchase. I will continue to use this as I&#x27;d much rather use natural products &amp; I love being able to cut down on products.</li>
            <li> I have been reading about the NO POO (shampoo) movement and decided to try the Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bar.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the idea of less plastic bottles in the landfill as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried one other of Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars (Jojoba &amp; Peppermint) first.&lt;br /&gt;It did lather up really well but I DID NEED to condition afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this bar (Ultra Balanced) is even better!!!&lt;br /&gt;I just used it and it is absolutely incredible.&lt;br /&gt;Lathering up was outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I did NOT condition afterwards just to see what would happen.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has soooooo much volume and feels wonderful to touch!!!&lt;br /&gt;So now I will save on conditioners as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I don&#x27;t keep the bar where water splashing from the shower will hit it.&lt;br /&gt;I keep it right outside the shower door on it&#x27;s smallest side standing up,&lt;br /&gt;in a little tray so it doesn&#x27;t dissolve from the water spray constantly hitting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to try one, be sure to try the Ultra Balanced Bar first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did not purchase the two bars off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love JR Liggett bar soap. I&#x27;d been using the Jojoba and Peppermint bar but read great reviews for this Balanced one and bought one. It seems to make my sometimes unruly hair manageable, and I don&#x27;t need conditioner. Seems to lather a little more easily than the Jojoba bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased, as usual, with Liggett products.</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money.  It would not even get my hands clean, let alone my hair.  It does not lather at all and would never work on my hair.</li>
            <li> Great value. Leaves hair soft and clean without all the chemicals in regular shampoo. Really surprised how much lather you get from such a little amount used.</li>
            <li> I used these for about 7 months and my hair had thinned and looked awful. This bar left a residue in my hair which gummed up my brushes. Hair looked much less in volume, a highly noticeable loss which I believe was caused by the sodium hydroxide which is lye, like the stuff that was originally used to straighten African hair. This stuff is bad, and causes hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;Since stopping the use of this bar, I am washing with water only and using a boar brush to clean it and it is looking fine and healthier than it did when I used this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li> Two bars give me six months of hair washing.  I wash hair twice a week in winter.  Every other day during the hotter months and each time I work out or sweat from yard work or indoor projects regardless of season.  I have dry, thick, gray hair that loses moisture if I shampoo too often.  I only apply once.  No rinse, repeat. For commercial airplane travel you do not have to put it in your plastic security bag.  Great for camping, hardcore road trips, and Amtrak journeys.  Can be used for shaving in a pinch and on the body.  All in one product when you need to travel light.  Leaves hair clean without that chemical feeling.  Leaves it &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; and conditioned.  I believe it contains lye(Sodium Hydroxide) -- just the way they made &amp;#34;old-fashioned&amp;#34; soaps.  Burns a bit if you get it in your eyes. Bars are not shaped or cut in a uniform fashion.  No two bars are exactly alike.  I assume this is part of the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; production.  I have been using this &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; for two years. They have other &amp;#34;blends&amp;#34; and I found this suits my needs the best.  The peppermint is my second favorite.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to fragrance, so I thought I could use this bar as a shampoo alternative.  Not so.  It smells HORRIBLE.  There is no way I could use this anywhere near my face.  I had such high hopes for this products, and am terribly disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo bar! It has a wonderful lather and gets my hair extra clean. I have very thick coarse hair so I do have to use a light conditioner afterwards but my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy in a long time.  I&#x27;ve had it a month and a half and I still have 3/4 of a bar left.  It lasts FOREVER! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Really great shampoo bar. I use it on my baby in the bath, it goes a long way. It works especially well for easily cleaning off suntan lotion which otherwise would take many runs of traditional chemical laden soap. As you know, when a child is still growing their hair you have to sunscreen up the head, which can be a real pain to wash out of the hair later.</li>
            <li> I read where this was not supposed to suds in hard water and maybe it doesn&#x27;t as much as some might want but it does a great job of cleaning your hair. So much easier to use than liquid shampoo. I  like the size of the bar, you can actually hold on to it, as it is a nice square compact size. Love it! Don&#x27;t ever want to go back to regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am a recent convert from LUSH products who I have found have gotten away from the initial spirit in which that company was founded and sold itself as. I needed a new shampoo bar- and this is it. I have thick locs (dread locs for those who do not understand) . This lathers well- only one wash and rinse needed. I like to use extra conditioner on my hair, but if I am traveling and don&#x27;t have that luxury, then I dont worry about it too much with this product. Will certainly purchase again and and the seller shipped it fast!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really alkaline and not so good for my colored hair.  Maybe if you have oily hair this might do the trick.  We are going on a long backpack trip so I was really hopeful but for me this just won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have been using J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bar products for over two years now, and I have given each of their different types of formulas a try. While this one was very mild, it didn&#x27;t work as well for me as the original formula. It was more moisture than I needed for my very fine hair, but it would probably be great for someone with thicker or dryer hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using bar shampoos for years in my personal quest to try to eliminate as much plastic in my life as possible. The problem with most products is they leave your hair feeling weird or stripped. I found this product to be excellent. It cleans without stripping and leaves my hair feeling soft. It also has a good lather if that is important to you.</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo bar! Leaves hair feeling great even without conditioner : )</li>
            <li> Wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic deal&lt;br /&gt;Deliver the shipment on time&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to cooperate with you again&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve used some other bar shampoos in the past, and I liked the old-timey packaging. Tried it out on my hair, and my hair has never been greasier! I had to get right back in the shower as soon as it was dry. Later in the week, I realized I really needed to shave my legs, and I was out of shaving cream. In situations like these, I usually use a failed shampoo or conditioner anyway, so I figured why not try out the bar? My legs have never had a closer shave than this! I might end up buying some just for shaving.</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo, love it!</li>
            <li> I have bought this shampoo for my daughter. She has allergy  for  liquid shampoo.  and this shampoo is very nice for her.</li>
            <li> Excellent, love the lush lather.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever! It cleans your hair without stripping the oils.</li>
            <li> I have really REALLY long hair (down to my butt), and I&#x27;m not sure if that maybe made it difficult for the shampoo to rinse out, but I more often than not experienced a waxy buildup in my hair, usually the last 6 inches of my hair, which would make my hair actively sticky, the knots were a nightmare and there was always lint in my hair. I tried rinsing with hot water to help it out but it didn&#x27;t seem to help much. My roots were usually soft if I rinsed well enough (sometimes I would also get that waxy feeling if I didn&#x27;t rinse well), so it&#x27;d probably be better for those with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> This bar did nothing for me. It was reeeeaaallly hard to work a lather out of it and a little painful on your hands due to the square shape. Dried out my hair without cleaning my roots, even though I tried my hardest to work it into them. I do have extremely thick curly hair, so may work better for people with fine or straight hair.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something cheap and simple to shower with, this it it. You can wash your hair and body with this shampoo bar. You can also use it as shaving soap, but it doesn&#x27;t lather up like other shaving soaps. I would recommend this to anyone with short hair. This soap does seem to leave a little residue on the hair and it is a lot more noticeable on longer hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this bar in an attempt to get a sudsy shampoo feeling without using the harsh detergent-based and chemical ridden shampoos on store shelves.  This shampoo bar is fantastic.  It creates great sudsy bubbles and cleans my hair squeaky.  Because I have hard water in my neighborhood, I use a quick vinegar rinse after shampooing with this bar, but it is not necessary.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this once so far and because of what other reviews stated, I did not use a conditioner.  I was not pleased with the results and it was very difficult to comb out my wet hair after shampooing.  I will try it again and use conditioner next time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best. Love to travel with it.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo bar, I have been using it for years.  My normally oily hair only needs to be washed 2 times per week, and I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner.  The only issue I have with this product, which does not speak to its quality, is that I go through a bar much faster than the manufacturer claims.  I probably end up using 8 bars per year, and I have mid length hair.  The ultra balanced kind seems to be more emollient than the regular bar, so you don&#x27;t need a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Awesome! LIGGETS KEEP DOING YOUR THANG. I love these shampoo bars and the ultra balanced is great.</li>
            <li> Wonderful alternative to harsh chemicals in regular shampoo! Left my hair feeling clean and soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a shampoo product that I could travel with without hassle. This shampoo bar does clean hair well, but after about twelve hours my hair seemed to have a waxy feel &amp; became difficult to pull a comb through. I&#x27;ve used it several days in a row &amp; have switched back to the the old standard bottle of liquid shampoo. I gave the bar to my daughter who has experienced similar results. We ended up using the bar to wash our hands, which given the price, seems like such a waste. Cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i was so excited the first time around when i found jr liggetts shampoo. then i found this version of it and it blew the original version out of the water! great natural product that is great for flying and lasts a long time. great value, great product.</li>
            <li> Ever since I received one of these shampoo bars as a gift, I haven&#x27;t used any other shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of oil, so your scalp doesn&#x27;t overproduce oil and make your hair oily.  I have thin hair, so oily-looking hair is an issue.  I also noticed that my hair had more volume with this shampoo than any other.  Having thin hair, I&#x27;ve always struggled with my hair going flat, and have used many volumizing shampoos and products.  Nothing works better than the J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars.</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with this shampoo bar so far! I&#x27;ve been using it 3 days, with an apple cider vinegar/water rinse afterwards. My hair is slightly oilier than usual but I know to expect that until my scalp is used to the change from the shampoo with lots of chemicals to something natural. I have medium-long very thick slightly wavy hair that has had a crazy frizz problem this winter so far that no shampoo has been able to tame! The frizz has gone with this shampoo bar so yay!</li>
            <li> I like this bar, however will return to the original formula on next purchase. My hair tends to be oily, I must wash daily, with this version I appear as if I have skipped a day or two/ . shipping on item was pretty fast for chaotic holiday season, around 4 days. would purchase from this seller again</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo ever!  I have very fine, thin hair and this gave me the most wonderful body without using ANY conditioner.  will definitely use this from now on.</li>
            <li> This is a handy way to carry shampoo when traveling to several countries--no hassles at the airport.  The shampoo is OK and I didn&#x27;t need conditioner.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the liquid shampoo and conditioner I use at home, but is a great alternative when traveling.</li>
            <li> But for some reason my scalp grows quickly offended by it and i have to stop using for a few days. Also not too sure it&#x27;s really safe for color treatments.</li>
            <li> My hair does feel clean when I use it, but it does not stay clean for more than 2 days. Which is fine with me considering that this shampoo is all natural. I would much rather use an all natural product and have to wash my hair more often. I also have dry and frizzy hair - this shampoo makes my hair feel smoother and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the JR Liggett Bar Shampoo line. I&#x27;ve been using their products for nearly a year and I have seen the biggest change in my hair. It has bounce, less frizz, and it&#x27;s softer and healthier. These little bars last forever too! It&#x27;s such a good value for such an amazing product. I&#x27;ll never go back to regular shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for reference: My hair was straight, fine and it was very dry when I started using this product. I frequently suffered from dandruff and I had a lot of breakage of my hair strands. Now my hair is slightly wavy, fine (but thicker) and it&#x27;s shiny and healthy. My dandruff has improved as well-- just make sure to spend some time massaging the shampoo into your scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this to a friend who had very oily hair and she said this product really helped her a lot, too! She said that if she washed her hair in the morning, by the evening she looked like she needed to wash her hair again. After using this product for two weeks, she said she saw significant improvements in reduction of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of warning: the first time I used the product, my hair was in such bad condition from dying and overall treatment, that it was actually kind of difficult to use this product-- it felt like I couldn&#x27;t really get all of my hair covered in it, but it improved with each use and quickly it lathered up in my hair like no body&#x27;s business. If you find it discouraging at first, stick with it because it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
