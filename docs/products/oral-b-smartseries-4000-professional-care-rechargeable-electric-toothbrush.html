    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This product is excellent.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Smart-series is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>I researched what would be the best product for my needs.  </li>
            <li>I determined this was the best choice.</li>
            <li>best comparison I can make is to describe this as the cordless version of the brush your dentist uses.</li>
            <li>This is a great tooth-brush!</li>
            <li>One of the best brushes on the market and recommended by our dentist.</li>
            <li>My results from using this 4000 series toothbrush were immediate and impressive.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is awesome.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of power, and the timer is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>In that respect, the Smartseries 4000 performs with the best of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>5 stars because it does an excellent job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>so this was great to hear.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>a great buy.</li>
            <li>My husband works out of town and this is great for him to take the brush to/from work each week.</li>
            <li>I was perfectly happy with the 1000, but I had the opportunity to acquire the 4000</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great toothbrush, should $100 be within your budget to spend.</li>
            <li>Costco has a great return policy and they stick it to the manufacture.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as great though.</li>
            <li>and they were very nice and credited my card with the $20.  </li>
            <li>Thus, the scam was successful.  </li>
            <li>however, the product is good</li>
            <li>to polish mode to get it to behave more like the 1000 (which is ideally what I want).  </li>
            <li>But with this brush, I was getting drool despite maintaining a good seal.</li>
            <li>to the rebate, I don&#x27;t buy things just because there is a good deal going on</li>
            <li>It works and it feels good to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What impressed me was how CLEAN my teeth were.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great feature, but they need to work on putting it in a better location and making it more visible in bright bathroom</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great feature, but they need to work on putting it in a better location and making it more visible in bright bathroom</li>
            <li>Product is good, easy to use, good quality, compact.</li>
            <li>brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>My dentist is thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I started using the 4000 a couple of weeks before my latest cleaning/checkup, and this time the hygienist remarked on how good my teeth looked.</li>
            <li>And there are ways to save on brushheads, if you&#x27;re resourceful.</li>
            <li>And there are ways to save on brushheads, if you&#x27;re resourceful.</li>
            <li>The charging stand is nice and you can remove the holding case that attaches to it if you&#x27;re worried about counter space.</li>
            <li>* Increased confidence about being efficient and effective about brushing teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice if you&#x27;re taking this on trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ergonomic, nice feeling in the hand.</li>
            <li>I have been using the 4000 for a couple months now and have found it to work just as good (if not even slightly better) than the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The timed beeping system to organize brushing in the four quadrants of the mouth was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>The vibrations were kind of rattling my skull and toothpaste was flying everywhere...</li>
            <li>The brush heads do a marvelous job, but they are not cheap.a marvelous job, but they are not cheap.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best toothbrush I have ever used!</li>
            <li>It is the most effective brush I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Both my dentist and I are very impressed with this 4000 Professional care product.  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice if it came with more than 1 brush</li>
            <li>This is much more tidy.  </li>
            <li>and so far it has been perfect.  </li>
            <li>My dentist is excellent and has always told me that since I take such good care manually the effect would always be better and more thorough than with an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The plaque removal here is superb and my sensitive teeth have improved more with this brush than with any desensitizing paste I have used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for cleaning teeth, but the charge runs out quickly and it takes a couple of days to recharge it.</li>
            <li>The difference I noticed, is that the whitening has been even on both my top and bottom rows of teeth.</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare brushes for years and wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to change brands.  </li>
            <li>I have always been more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have had an Oral B electric toothbrush for more than 5 years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The vibrations of the sonicares are, i feel, more controlled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall i would say the Sonicares perform better, but often break.</li>
            <li>I am noticing better feeling gums and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>Vendors of electric toothbrushes follow the razor-blade business: most of their profits come from the replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Selectable modes: I love this feature.</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>so cute),</li>
            <li>Might be worthwhile to use that mode once a week ....&lt;</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the toothbrush, I haven&#x27;t tried all the settings yet, but I will at some time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>The Sonicare brush vibrated from side to side, which I have always like much better than the brushes that rotate in a circle</li>
            <li>The charge has never lasted more than 10-11 uses of two minutes apiece.  </li>
            <li>I love it - before</li>
            <li>I love electric toothbrushes and have been using them for years.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner after using this brush, and though I still need to floss I can tell that this brush is doing a more thorough job of cleaning between my teeth.</li>
            <li>One charge lasts better than a week--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got more power, but it&#x27;s also louder.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a great toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Make sure you remember to charge.</li>
            <li>and you want us consumers to pay an exorbitant amount so our families will have a more santitized enviroment.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I found the battery life to be outstanding.</li>
            <li>Love that</li>
            <li>Ahhh, I love that feeling of clean, sparkly teeth as I am sure we all do!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a good amount of scrub, but doesn&#x27;t come on too strong, it cleans out all the cracks and crevices quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>All of them do a great job and is way better than normal brushing</li>
            <li>Is a very real upgrade resulting from refining that which was already good?</li>
            <li>like I am beating up my mouth although my teeth do feel very clean</li>
            <li>It works perfectly and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li>First the good things.</li>
            <li>(Scam--When you submit the original UPC, you no longer have a copy!)</li>
            <li>Aside from that, the sensitive cycle was good for my toddler son (but I ended up getting him his own electric brush).</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with the old one, and was happy to have the chance to get this newer version of this trusted tooth brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I found after using the Smart-series was a deeper cleaning, a \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; of clean that I didn&#x27;t get from the Sonicare, and brighter, cleaner, teeth!  </li>
            <li>The Deep Clean mode was especially effective at removing my plaque (I checked) and the whitening mode made a noticeable difference even faster than the item description says!</li>
            <li>Between the two, they both do a great job of getting your teeth feeling very clean, sonicare may do it very slightly better, but both are MUCH better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, arrived as described and works great.  </li>
            <li>feel this unit is well worth the money, and does an exceptional job of keeping all areas of your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>The travel case worked fine on an overnight trip--just popped out the brush part of the toothbrush and was able to store and fit everything easily.</li>
            <li>I had some coffee staining on my top 2 front teeth that I thought wouldn&#x27;t go away and in about 4 days they are significantly faded.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure the toothbrush works great -- if I could only get it to charge.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunate...</li>
            <li>It is compact and will be  easy to take when I travel.</li>
            <li>Again, Amazon has made it easy to return, and they have promised me a refund once they receive the unit.  </li>
            <li>The product is efficient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>You can see it reflected in the mirror or sink basin easily.  </li>
            <li>Makes your brushing easy and it feels soothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the easiest to fix, I think the brush is way to strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other good things about the 4000 model is that it comes with a handy case for traveling and the stand has a storage rack to hold several toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>I decided recently to have a change because while the Pulsonic has been great, I wanted something more advanced.</li>
            <li>Winning features of the 4000 include a good timer, which has audible and pulse notifications for each quadrant of the mouth; NiMH batteries (SO much better than NiCads); selectable modes for sensitive, normal, and polish; and a handy travel case.</li>

            <li>The first time I used this, I didn&#x27;t think I liked it.</li>
            <li>A pressure alarm light that is easily visible has been added.</li>
            <li>Also, the Pulsonic did not do a great job at the back of your teeth, so I wanted something that worked 360.</li>
            <li>This gets a 5 star from me, great product for the money that will last years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s been two weeks now, and I can confidently tell you that this electric toothbrush was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Oral B, for this fantastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It does a great job cleaning, and even has \\&quot;beeps\\&quot; to let you know when to switch to a different area of the teeth.</li>
            <li>i like because it can fit in your mouth easier) and Oral B uses a circular shape.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic, highly-customizable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Well, this brush confirmed what I was saying.</li>
            <li>It has multipe settings and that is great if you want to do some whitening occasionally.  </li>
            <li>The top speed is plenty powerful</li>
            <li>/&gt;Replacement heads aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>Instead what I got was a nice bright, white smile.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush really is the total package and the best you can do at under $100.</li>
            <li>, I believe the sonic cleaning of the Sonicare was superior to the cleaning action of the Smart-series.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B continues to advance their product development in both materials and performance features, though even their most basic products also tend to be good performers, and at bargain</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this new purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very impressed that the deep clean mode wasn&#x27;t too intense.  </li>
            <li>That it is rechargeable is very useful.</li>
            <li>NiMH batteries are free of memory effect, can be charged generally hundreds of times without any loss of capacity, and are good long-lasting performers.</li>
            <li>The advertisement stated that you would receive a $20.00 rebate providing you submitted a receipt and the original UPC.  </li>
            <li>I followed the rules: submitted the receipt and the original UPC.  </li>
            <li>I received a form letter that a rebate would not be forthcoming as I had not submitted the original UPC.  </li>
            <li>Sent in the rebate form, receipt, and the original UPC bar code (just like the rebate form showed), and I too got a letter stating they have not received the UPC code and to send it in.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say it is absolutely necessary to upgrade from the Healthy Clean Precision 1000, which I also own.  </li>
            <li>Your mouth is just so clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>currently have the Oral-B 1000 Professional Care and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>In general I have been very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>I thought I had achieved nirvana with the Sonicare series because I constantly received good comments from my dentist during cleanings.  </li>
            <li>travel case included: This is cool if you like to take your Oral-B brush with you.</li>
            <li>The owner&#x27;s manual claims that a full charge will give you 20 uses of two minutes each use.  </li>
            <li>Full charge occurred some time after that during the night.  </li>
            <li>However, there are two features of this toothbrush that really send it to the top of the heap of all the toothbrushes I have owned.</li>
            <li>own the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush and now the 4000.</li>
            <li>As I have sensitive teeth, I also liked it that the toothbrush has a pressure sensor in order to keep me from over brushing.  </li>
            <li>The others I&#x27;ve used ran through the full cycle then turned off.</li>
            <li>When I got the 4000, I wondered if there would be a true difference between these two models.</li>
            <li>flossing brush head action works nicely.</li>
            <li>What a surprise this has been, it feels a lot more comfortable, yet more powerful at the same time.</li>
            <li>Both gave an excellent clean, but I will have to admit, the 4000 gave a squeak better clean especially in areas that the 1000 seems to have trouble</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh and my teeth are sparkly clean.</li>
            <li>Still, the brush performs up to my expectations, so the clean teeth and feeling are worth the price.</li>
            <li>Overall, though, this is an excellent electric toothbrush, and if you can afford it and the ongoing replacement brush cost, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Overall, though, this is an excellent electric toothbrush, and if you can afford it and the ongoing replacement brush cost, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>We upgraded from an older Braun electric toothbrush and are totally satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The next best thing to going to your dental hygenist daily.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their oral health :)</li>
            <li>Of course you can do a quick one or a more thorough one, but the normal default cleaning is two minutes.  </li>
            <li>While replacement brushheads are pricey too, taking great care of your teeth is critically important, both for overall health AND for saving the costs of needing to have dental problems fixed.</li>
            <li>While replacement brushheads are pricey too, taking great care of your teeth is critically important, both for overall health AND for saving the costs of needing to have dental problems fixed.</li>
            <li>We were very pleased with it, and when it would no longer hold a charge I automatically looked for a current Oral B model.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The Oral-B 4000 has much more power than my old toothbrush and gives a deeper clean.  </li>
            <li>I cannot quantify it, but it does clean better, not a little bit, but a lot.</li>
            <li>Whether using the deep clean mode or the one for sensitive teeth both have improved my oral hygiene greatly.  </li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush worked well, charged easily, didn&#x27;t take up too much space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It might just be me, but I&#x27;m just not crazy about it even though it works adequately.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Oral-B 4000 toothbrush is not inexpensive, but on the positive side, it does a simply fantastic job cleaning your teeth, and it is better than older/cheaper Oral-B electric toothbrushes in pretty much every aspect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Oral-B 4000 toothbrush is not inexpensive, but on the positive side, it does a simply fantastic job cleaning your teeth, and it is better than older/cheaper Oral-B electric toothbrushes in pretty much every aspect.</li>
            <li>This brush helps me clean the back teeth very easily, though.  </li>
            <li>Your teeth feel very smooth after ever session with the Oral-B Professional Care products.</li>
            <li>The new  spare toothbrush holder is better thought out and works much better than the old &#x27;stand up&#x27; one.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>But it does clean my teeth very well!</li>
            <li>The old Braun unit was very quiet, and just had a pleasant humming sound.</li>
            <li>Oral-B makes a fine quality toothbrush and they last for many years.</li>
            <li>This is just another great brush in the long line of Oral-B electric brushes that we&#x27;ve used, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, both the old and new model do an exceptional job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>Great product, use it everyday and it wears like iron.</li>
            <li>The vibration is comfortable and massaging, but I also feel like it&#x27;s really getting the job done.</li>
            <li>It has a light that goes on to warn you when you&#x27;re using too much pressure.</li>
            <li>It works well, and you can tell it&#x27;s got a powerful motor.</li>
            <li>And I appreciate the travel case on those rare occasions that I am out of town.</li>
            <li>I really love the Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The 4000 can use most of the replacement heads that Oral-B markets, but comes with their Floss Action brush head.</li>
            <li>For the price an extra brush or two would have been nice.</li>
            <li>Seems to do a more thorough job in a shorter amount of time than sawing away with my old manual.</li>
            <li>that is worth</li>
            <li>You can figure that out on your own without paying an extra price tag.</li>
            <li>If you have a lower grade toothbrush than this one and want more polishing, you might give the Floss Action head a go.  </li>
            <li>Worth Every Penney, do yourself a favor and get one today.</li>
            <li>This is much more of a loud buzz.</li>
            <li>Cleans (fresh from the dentist clean)&lt;br /&gt;*Fast</li>
            <li>This is a handy feature for either family use or keeping different style heads on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I found the Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Rechargeable Toothbrush to be very comfortable in my hand, not too heavy, and very easy to manipulate in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything else about this electric toothbrush I found to be very user friendly as well.  </li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;ve used other tooth brushes and I know that you have to maintain a good seal</li>
            <li>You can lay 4 brushes in the brush station at the right, which has a pivoting lid to protect them from dust and sink splashes.</li>
            <li>You can lay 4 brushes in the brush station at the right, which has a pivoting lid to protect them from dust and sink splashes.</li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush hands down provides the best teeth cleaning and polish outside of the dentists office.</li>
            <li>a small amount of toothpaste does a great job.</li>
            <li>B003UKM9CO Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush]] and the Smartseries 4000 obviously has many more options and advantages over this brush - but is also almost twice as expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Factor into your pricing decision that Oral-B might not honor the frustration free packaging bar code; maybe a new guy was working on mine.</li>
            <li>I LOVE not having to worry about having extra fresh batteries on hand or hoping there are some charged up rechargeable batteries on hand when the batteries give out or start losing juice like I did with the battery operated</li>
            <li>You also get a nice travel case, which is a huge plus because every time I took my sonicare on vacation, I would have to bring it with my carry on or else the on button would also get pushed in the suitcase and end up basically dead by the time I arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I simply wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth it or not.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to see different models accommodating different budgets.</li>
            <li>I feel that the Oral B cleans your gums a bit better because it is more wide and can reach your gums, even when you&#x27;re not trying to, just when you&#x27;re normally brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>I suspect that there is better drying with the flat-laying brush storage (better airflow storing them horizontally vs vertically in previous brush stations), but counter space is at a premium in my bathroom, so the large footprint is a detraction.&lt;br</li>

            <li>It has a nice timer which beeps every 30 second for you to switch to different points or quadrants and cleaning the brushhead is easy too.</li>
            <li>can actually feel the difference while brushing and all my teeth feel squeeky clean smooth when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li>First of all let me start off by saying that between two to three years ago I bought the Oral-B Pulsonic from Amazon and have been using it since.</li>
            <li>but I am not convinced it is as effective at flossing as I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li>I bought one at announcement and when I opened it I was pleased by several differences:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li>I used it I found out that the improvements were more than skin deep.</li>
            <li>The first shipment came, as always, speedily with Amazo Prime.  </li>
            <li>I love the 4 different settings and the travel case for on the go use!</li>
            <li>whole family can use one toothbrush like this as long as each have their own brush heads.  </li>
            <li>We  have owned different Oral B power toothbrushes over the years with the latest being the 1000.  </li>
            <li>I also think the design helps me do a better job of cleaning my back teeth</li>
            <li>The price was much better than in local stores too...</li>
            <li>It cleans your teeth pretty well.</li>
            <li>Why exactly?</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush of this caliber</li>
            <li>You either have to memorize how many times to press the button to move to a different setting, or turn it off to look at the settings on the handle.  </li>
            <li>This is not a huge issue, because the gray display area is good and gives you all notifications that you would need.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product and have already recommended it to a few friends looking for a new electric brush.</li>
            <li>Clearly this sensor is very useful.</li>
            <li>The advertised $20 rebate however is a complete scam, i cut out all the UPC codes, including the shipping box one and sent all 5 to Oral B. Got a form letter stating I didn&#x27;t provide original UPC barcodes.</li>
            <li>But the bright lights of the bathroom were the biggest challenge to seeing the red LED on the back.</li>
            <li>But the bright lights of the bathroom were the biggest challenge to seeing the red LED on the back.</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed coming from the Pulsonic was how large it was in comparison.</li>
            <li>This continued to be the case even on the special setting for those with sensitive teeth, and even after I allowed time to adjust to the sensation.</li>
            <li>In addition there were some positive functional changes.&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li>have most recently been using the Oral-B Vitality electric toothbrush and a somewhat older Oral-B A348 ProCare.</li>
            <li>I had an older oral b electric toothbrush (5000 model) that lasted me a good few years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Charge lasts forever; there are many features that make the brush highly customizable; and you can buy lots of different toothbrush heads and find the one that works for you</li>
            <li>On the downside, the charge/storage station has a pretty large counter footprint, and the over-pressure indicator LED is a bit hard to see in bright bathroom lighting.</li>
            <li>On the downside, the charge/storage station has a pretty large counter footprint, and the over-pressure indicator LED is a bit hard to see in bright bathroom lighting.</li>
            <li>This one is so easy to maneuver for deep and thourough cleaning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;JUST TO ALERT PEOPLE WHO SEND FOR THE REBATE - My order came in a brown cardboard box with a large adhesive label with the UPC code</li>
            <li>This one seems to polish just a bit better than the Precision, which is good, but I thought it might be only due to the head that comes with it being the &#x27;Floss Action&#x27; design, which has these little plastic paddles that are supposed to get in between teeth, but also offer a better polishing experience in my mind.  </li>
            <li>The 4000 is improves on pretty much every aspect of use of these 2 older brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the red light that flashes when you are applying too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very helpful.  </li>
            <li>I really like the brush tray.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed I didn&#x27;t need to pull out my plaque remover as much.  </li>
            <li>If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line.</li>
            <li>I like this one especially for the pressure warning light.  </li>
            <li>so I was very nervous about giving this brush a shot.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Smartseries 4000 toothbrush is a really well designed toothbrush.</li>
            <li>then you will need to purchase the 4000, there is a gentle mode.  </li>
            <li>so I cannot imagine really needing anything</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the stand that much because it comes apart when I move it, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the beeps that help you time your brushing are very helpful, and I like having the ability to switch modes.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really need these bells and whistles, but they don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>I like the intensity of the brushing (not TOO much and a red light flashes when it senses you are applying too much pressure).</li>
            <li>so am very</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve really thought of everything on this.</li>
            <li>However, despite the claim that it&#x27;s \\&quot;gentle on teeth</li>
            <li>The last Sonicare tooth brush I bought had a brush holder that fit 4 heads</li>
            <li>so there isn&#x27;t much I can do about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I must say I can really notice the difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband is jealous, he wants one of these too now.</li>
            <li>one thing I really like is that this brush keeps on going once you reach the two minute mark.  </li>
            <li>So if I want to spend a few more seconds on a couple of back teeth just to make sure I don&#x27;t have to turn this on again.  </li>
            <li>The first problem is that when you start up the toothbrush it&#x27;s pretty loud and noticeable.</li>
            <li>I purchased my most recent professional series over 6 years ago.</li>
            <li>We debated between buying this one or the next model up (the 5000 series) but decided it was not worth the higher price and found out it probably was a good decision.</li>
            <li>Rather than brush solely with a regular toothbrush or one of the older electric models that never worked that well for me, I&#x27;m now a strong believer in this technology.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are several things I like better about this unit, compared to the old one I have.</li>
            <li>The little toothbrushes that fit on the unit last a long time, so the set up represents an excellent value overall.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t as much food stuck better dental crowns and my gums as there was when I used other toothbrushes, even though I&#x27;m a dedicated flosser, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Particularly, it really gets the back side of the front teeth clean, all the way to the gum line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I really care about, though, is how clean my teeth feel and look after regular brushing.</li>
            <li>My teeth definitely feel clean when I finish brushing my teeth with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Not so much that I didn&#x27;t get used to it quickly, but enough that I noticed.  </li>
            <li>After 2 hours there was a few minor blinkings of the charging light, but the unit would only read the bottom light of 4 - nothing more.  </li>
            <li>Smartseries 4000 stands near the top of the product line, and offers all but one feature that is found only on the model 5000 toothbrush (namely, the \\&quot;Wireless Smartguide\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>This one is interesting with multiple levels of bristles (giving a 3D cleaning action), as well as 4 soft blade-like cleaners.</li>
            <li>Brushing was as effective as with an ordinary toothbrush.</li>
            <li>story short, with the rebate it might have been worth it, without it, it certainly wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Sonicare uses a more oval shape that is smaller than a regular toothbrush(which</li>
            <li>However, it surprised me because when the  red light started blinking, the brushing was as vigorous as when I had just charged it.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Does it really make a difference when cleaning and is it worth the extra bucks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this brush, especially if you are coming from another brush, first time users, I would also recommend it as it&#x27;s easy to use and there is a soft mode on this brush so you can start brushing your teeth at a slower speed before moving to the fast speed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>All in all, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Low-end Oral-B brushes can be had for under $20, but paying a little more for an upscale model still makes sense because it comes with a stronger battery that lasts longer and cleans faster.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bells and whistles are nice; timers during brushing and also a warning if you&#x27;re brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>main warning I&#x27;d like possible consumers to know is Oral B rebate offers are difficult at best and maybe a scam.</li>
            <li>Along with standard mode, which presumably most people will use most of the time, there is also a polish mode that will help remove those tough coffee/tea/cola stains and help remove plaque.</li>
            <li>I give it my highest recommendation and for people with sensitive teeth and gums finding a product that really works and helps means a lot.</li>
            <li>The slimmer oval shape of the sonicares do not do this when you&#x27;re doing a normal brushing.</li>
            <li>I think--when I&#x27;ve triggered it most of the time, but the location makes me wonder if I&#x27;m missing it</li>
            <li>I also liked the various settings and often used the \\&quot;Daily Clean\\&quot; setting in which the toothbrush stops and beeps so that you get the proper amount of brushing in all 4 quadrants of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>but if I happen to find a deal for something I&#x27;m planning to buy, I will normally use it.</li>
            <li>and I can definitely tell you that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the extra dollars?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this toothbrush and hope that it lasts as long as my previous Oral-B toothbrush did.</li>
            <li>It can reach back of your mouth easily as well as inside and outside.</li>
            <li>As such I usually give up pretty quickly and turn to a soft toothbrush instead which works fine enough but rarely feels as thorough as an electric one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great cleaning action: I have used Oral-B electric brushes for many years now, and usually get pretty good reports at the dentist, though with several fixed bridges I tend to get about 1 small cavity each year.</li>
            <li>results from using this toothbrush are enormous and noticeable right away.</li>
            <li>Daily Clean has been the only one we&#x27;ve really used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has different modes: Daily Clean, Sensitive, Whitening, Deep Clean.</li>
            <li>The brush head still looks and feels new, I have noticed a substantial difference in whitening when compared to my Oral-B Pulsonic.</li>
            <li>When the brand new 4000 series came out it piqued my invest.</li>
            <li>this an entirely new and revolutionary product for cleaning your teeth?</li>
            <li>I had been thinking about getting a new brush for a while.</li>
            <li>so I thought it was time to get a new one.</li>
            <li>I figured that was something that I had to live with.</li>
            <li>I never really thought much about brushing my teeth in general, but now I actually look forward to that perfectly fresh and clean feeling after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>because I set it on the charge cord when I get the red low charge light, and the elapsed time I observed that the re-charge lights are still flashing is 13 hours.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use any of the fancy additional settings, just the basic 2-minute, and it cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>It is a light next to the feature you are currently selecting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>; red light is constantly going off when the tooth brush is on, even when it&#x27;s not in my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With my Pulsonic I could say that I was brushing too hard, because sometimes after brushing I would notice that certain teeth in my mouth, were more sensitive than the others, I noticed this especially when I drank something either really hot or cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My gums have come back to new life a healthy pink and are no longer sensitive.  </li>
            <li>, I do not have that problem at all, this is most likely due to the fact that this brush has a long head and it&#x27;s really easy, if you want to brush the back of your teeth.</li>
            <li>For people first converting to an electric toothbrush, especially kids, this is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>If you are sharing the device with others in your household who may not have the same gum sensitivity as yourself, again, I recommend version 3000 or higher since you may not fully understand others&#x27; sensitivity levels.  </li>
            <li>Plus the 3000 model (or higher) comes with a covered container for holding multiple brushes which will prevent the family from misplacing or swapping the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Note for me that the grip of the 1000/3000 feels better in the hand as well due to its smaller size compared to the 4000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>compared both the 1000 and the 4000 using the same exact brush head.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both going to get your teeth exceptionally clean, and if you&#x27;re going to have a metaphorical aneurism when your sonicare breaks, it might be a lesser disappoint to get a oral b. I&#x27;ve owned my oral b&#x27;s for over a year now, and have not had one break-yet.o spend as the bottom line.</li>

I&#x27;ve owned my oral b&#x27;s for over a year now, and have not had one break-yet.</li>
            <li>I felt my mouth clean and fresh a little different than brushing manually.</li>
            <li>I only changed out because the rechargeable  battery on the old one was finally giving out, and wasn&#x27;t accessible to replace.  </li>
            <li>If you find the initial cost a little too high, the 3000 seems to provide most of the features, but at a lower cost.d.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you find the initial cost a little too high, the 3000 seems to provide most of the features, but at a lower cost.</li>
            <li>With the Oral-B Pulsonic, it was only making the front top and front bottom teeth look clean, whereas it was doing a poor job on the sides of my teeth.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare never seem to brush hard enough, whereas the top setting on this brush is exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>This causes the brush head to wear faster but, more importantly, pushing too hard slows down the spin of the brush head which decreases the effectiveness of the brush.</li>
            <li>So, I decided to order a new one before my old one dies completely.  </li>
            <li>The 4000 though gives you different modes as well as a easily seen red light letting you know if you are pushing too hard.</li>
            <li>In the long run, it represents a better value, particularly if the user is impatient (e.g. a young kid).</li>
            <li>One of his reasons was that the vibrating action of the Sonicare brushes loosens fillings.  </li>
            <li>A sensitive cycle has been added.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally sold on the Oral-B, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Till the Oral B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care electric brush that is.  </li>
            <li>some people have sensitive gums and may not like that you cannot control the Oral B to stay away from the gums, however it gets the job done all at once.</li>
            <li>With the 4000, I can just set the mode to Sensitive (indicated by a feather LED ...</li>
            <li>I use the sensitive skin head, and it has done wonders for my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>the 4000 series essentially makes that dummy proof as a giant red light comes on when you are pressing to firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care electric toothbrush since June, 2012.  </li>
            <li>Before the Floss Action, I was hooked on the Dual Action which I used with the Precision.  </li>
            <li>you have sensitive gums</li>
            <li>One of the biggest problems I have with electronic toothbrushes is that my teeth are way too sensitive</li>
            <li>you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need those extra feedback lights, and often I have to change the 4000</li>
            <li>to charge frequently</li>
            <li>I bought this and was surprised when my teeth hurt after just one brushing.</li>
            <li>B00132FUNG Water Pik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li>My old toothbrush was the  [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I purchased the 4000 model because I didn&#x27;t really need the timer of the 5000 model and it looked very similar.</li>
            <li>It still works, but I had been thinking there may be something better with the advance of technology the last few years.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive gums, then I recommend the more expensive versions (3000 or higher) since they have sensitivity settings.  </li>
            <li>only thing I did not like as well about this one compared to the old one is that this new unit is louder than the old one.</li>
            <li>it even say on their website that there is an LCD and shows a model on the site (The same exact model actually) with an LCD built in, so there is some type of communication error somewhere.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really used anything other than the main one.</li>
            <li>This is probably the single thing about Oral-B toothbrushes that I have disliked most.</li>
            <li>The 3 green re-charging lights go off after a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it also beeps 4 times during the 2 minutes that it runs; this feature of the brush is meant to guide you on how long to brush each quadrant of your mouth, the upper left, the upper right, the lower left and the lower right quadrants.</li>
            <li>I really put a lot of effort into taking care of my teeth and gums but for some reason I&#x27;ve always been plagued by sensitive teeth and due to bruxism have receding gums that are also sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the same one for 10 years, never needed to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I would not recommend purchasing the floss action heads if you have sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;While there is an in handle display in the 4000, it is not a digital display.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Timer consistently resets after use: Both of my other brushes just never seem to reset themselves after use.</li>
            <li>The holder for other \\&quot;heads\\&quot; makes it useful for families to all use together (though this unit only comes with one brush...</li>
            <li>had a tough time justifying buying a new brush when I had one that worked fine.</li>
            <li>This is a little different as a red light blinks when you turn it on/off if the battery needs to be recharged.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m brushing, but it&#x27;s part of the general  behavior</li>
            <li>The Battery Life apparently lasts two weeks (according to the manual) and that is at 2 brushes per day for two minutes.</li>
            <li>If your Oral B is several years old, you may want to consider upgrading.</li>
            <li>Our last one was about 10-12 years old and failing</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one annoyance for me with the 4000 is that I accidentally change the mode instead of turning off the brush from time to time because the button are close enough to do this.&lt;br /&gt;While I recommend the Oral B 4000, I would suggest using the 1000 if you do not have sensitive or stained teeth.</li>
            <li>* Getting rid of plaque on back teeth surfaces along gum line - could not do it with old toothbrush.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I can still remember the epic difference between my regular toothbrush and this.</li>
            <li>Never have I looked back to brushing the old way once this baby came into my life.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone else has already covered the specs, so I will just say that after using this toothbrush twice daily, every day, my teeth now have the \\&quot;professionally cleaned\\&quot; feeling every day.</li>
            <li>by the third time I was completely adjusted to the device and no longer having that problem, but be prepared if you&#x27;ve never used one.  </li>
            <li>When I say comfortable I mean as in the way it feels in your hand.</li>
            <li>This model also comes with this lovely little plastic holder for 4 heads and a little lid to keep them dust-free.  </li>
            <li>(I only got the heavy duty cleaning one), but fortunately I had some of the regular ones left.</li>
            <li>This brush also has a red notification light that flashes, if you are brushing your teeth too hard, and it has helped me a lot.</li>
            <li>There is actually a red light that comes on if you are burshing too hard.  </li>
            <li>It will make your life easy when you feel lazy to brush especially after a long day.</li>
            <li>This is so small, that at first I thought I had received a battery operated unit by mistake!  </li>
            <li>First, the toothbrush contains a timer that not only counts down the total duration of the time you should allot to brushing your teeth</li>
            <li>, I noticed that it also cut down much of the debris removed when I floss afterwards.</li>
            <li>The standard two minute cycle with beeps every 30 seconds has been augmented with a &#x27; deep cleaning&#x27; cycle that simply uses the same brushing action with a three minute cycle and beeps every 45 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace another (old) Oral B brush whose batteries finally gave out after long years of use.  </li>
            <li>My last toothbrush was ten years old and I would expect this one to last just as long.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little bit cheaper, not by too much, but enough to give you something to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This product is excellent.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Smart-series is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> I researched what would be the best product for my needs.  </li>
            <li> I determined this was the best choice.</li>
            <li> best comparison I can make is to describe this as the cordless version of the brush your dentist uses.</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth-brush!</li>
            <li> One of the best brushes on the market and recommended by our dentist.</li>
            <li> My results from using this 4000 series toothbrush were immediate and impressive.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of power, and the timer is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> In that respect, the Smartseries 4000 performs with the best of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars because it does an excellent job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> so this was great to hear.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> a great buy.</li>
            <li> My husband works out of town and this is great for him to take the brush to/from work each week.</li>
            <li> I was perfectly happy with the 1000, but I had the opportunity to acquire the 4000</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great toothbrush, should $100 be within your budget to spend.</li>
            <li> Costco has a great return policy and they stick it to the manufacture.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as great though.</li>
            <li> and they were very nice and credited my card with the $20.  </li>
            <li> Thus, the scam was successful.  </li>
            <li> however, the product is good</li>
            <li> to polish mode to get it to behave more like the 1000 (which is ideally what I want).  </li>
            <li> But with this brush, I was getting drool despite maintaining a good seal.</li>
            <li> to the rebate, I don&#x27;t buy things just because there is a good deal going on</li>
            <li> It works and it feels good to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What impressed me was how CLEAN my teeth were.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great feature, but they need to work on putting it in a better location and making it more visible in bright bathroom</li>

            <li> brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> My dentist is thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I started using the 4000 a couple of weeks before my latest cleaning/checkup, and this time the hygienist remarked on how good my teeth looked.</li>
            <li> And there are ways to save on brushheads, if you&#x27;re resourceful.</li>
            <li> And there are ways to save on brushheads, if you&#x27;re resourceful.</li>
            <li> The charging stand is nice and you can remove the holding case that attaches to it if you&#x27;re worried about counter space.</li>
            <li> * Increased confidence about being efficient and effective about brushing teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice if you&#x27;re taking this on trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ergonomic, nice feeling in the hand.</li>
            <li> I have been using the 4000 for a couple months now and have found it to work just as good (if not even slightly better) than the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The timed beeping system to organize brushing in the four quadrants of the mouth was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> The vibrations were kind of rattling my skull and toothpaste was flying everywhere...</li>
            <li> The brush heads do a marvelous job, but they are not cheap.a marvelous job, but they are not cheap.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best toothbrush I have ever used!</li>
            <li> It is the most effective brush I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Both my dentist and I are very impressed with this 4000 Professional care product.  </li>
            <li> It would have been nice if it came with more than 1 brush</li>
            <li> This is much more tidy.  </li>
            <li> and so far it has been perfect.  </li>
            <li> My dentist is excellent and has always told me that since I take such good care manually the effect would always be better and more thorough than with an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The plaque removal here is superb and my sensitive teeth have improved more with this brush than with any desensitizing paste I have used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for cleaning teeth, but the charge runs out quickly and it takes a couple of days to recharge it.</li>
            <li> The difference I noticed, is that the whitening has been even on both my top and bottom rows of teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare brushes for years and wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to change brands.  </li>
            <li> I have always been more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have had an Oral B electric toothbrush for more than 5 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The vibrations of the sonicares are, i feel, more controlled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall i would say the Sonicares perform better, but often break.</li>
            <li> I am noticing better feeling gums and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> Vendors of electric toothbrushes follow the razor-blade business: most of their profits come from the replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Selectable modes: I love this feature.</li>
            <li> Just love it.</li>
            <li> so cute),</li>
            <li> Might be worthwhile to use that mode once a week ....&lt;</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the toothbrush, I haven&#x27;t tried all the settings yet, but I will at some time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare brush vibrated from side to side, which I have always like much better than the brushes that rotate in a circle</li>
            <li> The charge has never lasted more than 10-11 uses of two minutes apiece.  </li>
            <li> I love it - before</li>
            <li> I love electric toothbrushes and have been using them for years.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner after using this brush, and though I still need to floss I can tell that this brush is doing a more thorough job of cleaning between my teeth.</li>
            <li> One charge lasts better than a week--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got more power, but it&#x27;s also louder.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Make sure you remember to charge.</li>
            <li> and you want us consumers to pay an exorbitant amount so our families will have a more santitized enviroment.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I found the battery life to be outstanding.</li>
            <li> Love that</li>
            <li> Ahhh, I love that feeling of clean, sparkly teeth as I am sure we all do!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a good amount of scrub, but doesn&#x27;t come on too strong, it cleans out all the cracks and crevices quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> All of them do a great job and is way better than normal brushing</li>
            <li> Is a very real upgrade resulting from refining that which was already good?</li>
            <li> like I am beating up my mouth although my teeth do feel very clean</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li> First the good things.</li>
            <li> (Scam--When you submit the original UPC, you no longer have a copy!)</li>
            <li> Aside from that, the sensitive cycle was good for my toddler son (but I ended up getting him his own electric brush).</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with the old one, and was happy to have the chance to get this newer version of this trusted tooth brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I found after using the Smart-series was a deeper cleaning, a \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; of clean that I didn&#x27;t get from the Sonicare, and brighter, cleaner, teeth!  </li>
            <li> The Deep Clean mode was especially effective at removing my plaque (I checked) and the whitening mode made a noticeable difference even faster than the item description says!</li>
            <li> Between the two, they both do a great job of getting your teeth feeling very clean, sonicare may do it very slightly better, but both are MUCH better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, arrived as described and works great.  </li>
            <li> feel this unit is well worth the money, and does an exceptional job of keeping all areas of your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The travel case worked fine on an overnight trip--just popped out the brush part of the toothbrush and was able to store and fit everything easily.</li>
            <li> I had some coffee staining on my top 2 front teeth that I thought wouldn&#x27;t go away and in about 4 days they are significantly faded.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the toothbrush works great -- if I could only get it to charge.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunate...</li>
            <li> It is compact and will be  easy to take when I travel.</li>
            <li> Again, Amazon has made it easy to return, and they have promised me a refund once they receive the unit.  </li>
            <li> The product is efficient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> You can see it reflected in the mirror or sink basin easily.  </li>
            <li> Makes your brushing easy and it feels soothing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the easiest to fix, I think the brush is way to strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other good things about the 4000 model is that it comes with a handy case for traveling and the stand has a storage rack to hold several toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> I decided recently to have a change because while the Pulsonic has been great, I wanted something more advanced.</li>
            <li> Winning features of the 4000 include a good timer, which has audible and pulse notifications for each quadrant of the mouth; NiMH batteries (SO much better than NiCads); selectable modes for sensitive, normal, and polish; and a handy travel case.</li>

            <li> The first time I used this, I didn&#x27;t think I liked it.</li>
            <li> A pressure alarm light that is easily visible has been added.</li>
            <li> Also, the Pulsonic did not do a great job at the back of your teeth, so I wanted something that worked 360.</li>
            <li> This gets a 5 star from me, great product for the money that will last years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s been two weeks now, and I can confidently tell you that this electric toothbrush was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Oral B, for this fantastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It does a great job cleaning, and even has \\&quot;beeps\\&quot; to let you know when to switch to a different area of the teeth.</li>
            <li> i like because it can fit in your mouth easier) and Oral B uses a circular shape.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic, highly-customizable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Well, this brush confirmed what I was saying.</li>
            <li> It has multipe settings and that is great if you want to do some whitening occasionally.  </li>
            <li> The top speed is plenty powerful</li>
            <li> /&gt;Replacement heads aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> Instead what I got was a nice bright, white smile.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush really is the total package and the best you can do at under $100.</li>
            <li> , I believe the sonic cleaning of the Sonicare was superior to the cleaning action of the Smart-series.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B continues to advance their product development in both materials and performance features, though even their most basic products also tend to be good performers, and at bargain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this new purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very impressed that the deep clean mode wasn&#x27;t too intense.  </li>
            <li> That it is rechargeable is very useful.</li>
            <li> NiMH batteries are free of memory effect, can be charged generally hundreds of times without any loss of capacity, and are good long-lasting performers.</li>
            <li> The advertisement stated that you would receive a $20.00 rebate providing you submitted a receipt and the original UPC.  </li>
            <li> I followed the rules: submitted the receipt and the original UPC.  </li>
            <li> I received a form letter that a rebate would not be forthcoming as I had not submitted the original UPC.  </li>
            <li> Sent in the rebate form, receipt, and the original UPC bar code (just like the rebate form showed), and I too got a letter stating they have not received the UPC code and to send it in.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it is absolutely necessary to upgrade from the Healthy Clean Precision 1000, which I also own.  </li>
            <li> Your mouth is just so clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> currently have the Oral-B 1000 Professional Care and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> In general I have been very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> I thought I had achieved nirvana with the Sonicare series because I constantly received good comments from my dentist during cleanings.  </li>
            <li> travel case included: This is cool if you like to take your Oral-B brush with you.</li>
            <li> The owner&#x27;s manual claims that a full charge will give you 20 uses of two minutes each use.  </li>
            <li> Full charge occurred some time after that during the night.  </li>
            <li> However, there are two features of this toothbrush that really send it to the top of the heap of all the toothbrushes I have owned.</li>
            <li> own the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush and now the 4000.</li>
            <li> As I have sensitive teeth, I also liked it that the toothbrush has a pressure sensor in order to keep me from over brushing.  </li>
            <li> The others I&#x27;ve used ran through the full cycle then turned off.</li>
            <li> When I got the 4000, I wondered if there would be a true difference between these two models.</li>
            <li> flossing brush head action works nicely.</li>
            <li> What a surprise this has been, it feels a lot more comfortable, yet more powerful at the same time.</li>
            <li> Both gave an excellent clean, but I will have to admit, the 4000 gave a squeak better clean especially in areas that the 1000 seems to have trouble</li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh and my teeth are sparkly clean.</li>
            <li> Still, the brush performs up to my expectations, so the clean teeth and feeling are worth the price.</li>
            <li> Overall, though, this is an excellent electric toothbrush, and if you can afford it and the ongoing replacement brush cost, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Overall, though, this is an excellent electric toothbrush, and if you can afford it and the ongoing replacement brush cost, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> We upgraded from an older Braun electric toothbrush and are totally satisfied.  </li>
            <li> The next best thing to going to your dental hygenist daily.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their oral health :)</li>
            <li> Of course you can do a quick one or a more thorough one, but the normal default cleaning is two minutes.  </li>
            <li> While replacement brushheads are pricey too, taking great care of your teeth is critically important, both for overall health AND for saving the costs of needing to have dental problems fixed.</li>
            <li> While replacement brushheads are pricey too, taking great care of your teeth is critically important, both for overall health AND for saving the costs of needing to have dental problems fixed.</li>
            <li> We were very pleased with it, and when it would no longer hold a charge I automatically looked for a current Oral B model.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The Oral-B 4000 has much more power than my old toothbrush and gives a deeper clean.  </li>
            <li> I cannot quantify it, but it does clean better, not a little bit, but a lot.</li>
            <li> Whether using the deep clean mode or the one for sensitive teeth both have improved my oral hygiene greatly.  </li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush worked well, charged easily, didn&#x27;t take up too much space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It might just be me, but I&#x27;m just not crazy about it even though it works adequately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Oral-B 4000 toothbrush is not inexpensive, but on the positive side, it does a simply fantastic job cleaning your teeth, and it is better than older/cheaper Oral-B electric toothbrushes in pretty much every aspect.</li>

            <li> This brush helps me clean the back teeth very easily, though.  </li>
            <li> Your teeth feel very smooth after ever session with the Oral-B Professional Care products.</li>
            <li> The new  spare toothbrush holder is better thought out and works much better than the old &#x27;stand up&#x27; one.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> But it does clean my teeth very well!</li>
            <li> The old Braun unit was very quiet, and just had a pleasant humming sound.</li>
            <li> Oral-B makes a fine quality toothbrush and they last for many years.</li>
            <li> This is just another great brush in the long line of Oral-B electric brushes that we&#x27;ve used, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, both the old and new model do an exceptional job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> Great product, use it everyday and it wears like iron.</li>
            <li> The vibration is comfortable and massaging, but I also feel like it&#x27;s really getting the job done.</li>
            <li> It has a light that goes on to warn you when you&#x27;re using too much pressure.</li>
            <li> It works well, and you can tell it&#x27;s got a powerful motor.</li>
            <li> And I appreciate the travel case on those rare occasions that I am out of town.</li>
            <li> I really love the Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The 4000 can use most of the replacement heads that Oral-B markets, but comes with their Floss Action brush head.</li>
            <li> For the price an extra brush or two would have been nice.</li>
            <li> Seems to do a more thorough job in a shorter amount of time than sawing away with my old manual.</li>
            <li> that is worth</li>
            <li> You can figure that out on your own without paying an extra price tag.</li>
            <li> If you have a lower grade toothbrush than this one and want more polishing, you might give the Floss Action head a go.  </li>
            <li> Worth Every Penney, do yourself a favor and get one today.</li>
            <li> This is much more of a loud buzz.</li>
            <li> Cleans (fresh from the dentist clean)&lt;br /&gt;*Fast</li>
            <li> This is a handy feature for either family use or keeping different style heads on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I found the Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Rechargeable Toothbrush to be very comfortable in my hand, not too heavy, and very easy to manipulate in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything else about this electric toothbrush I found to be very user friendly as well.  </li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;ve used other tooth brushes and I know that you have to maintain a good seal</li>
            <li> You can lay 4 brushes in the brush station at the right, which has a pivoting lid to protect them from dust and sink splashes.</li>
            <li> You can lay 4 brushes in the brush station at the right, which has a pivoting lid to protect them from dust and sink splashes.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush hands down provides the best teeth cleaning and polish outside of the dentists office.</li>
            <li> a small amount of toothpaste does a great job.</li>
            <li> B003UKM9CO Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush]] and the Smartseries 4000 obviously has many more options and advantages over this brush - but is also almost twice as expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Factor into your pricing decision that Oral-B might not honor the frustration free packaging bar code; maybe a new guy was working on mine.</li>
            <li> I LOVE not having to worry about having extra fresh batteries on hand or hoping there are some charged up rechargeable batteries on hand when the batteries give out or start losing juice like I did with the battery operated</li>
            <li> You also get a nice travel case, which is a huge plus because every time I took my sonicare on vacation, I would have to bring it with my carry on or else the on button would also get pushed in the suitcase and end up basically dead by the time I arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I simply wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth it or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to see different models accommodating different budgets.</li>
            <li> I feel that the Oral B cleans your gums a bit better because it is more wide and can reach your gums, even when you&#x27;re not trying to, just when you&#x27;re normally brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> I suspect that there is better drying with the flat-laying brush storage (better airflow storing them horizontally vs vertically in previous brush stations), but counter space is at a premium in my bathroom, so the large footprint is a detraction.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It has a nice timer which beeps every 30 second for you to switch to different points or quadrants and cleaning the brushhead is easy too.</li>
            <li> can actually feel the difference while brushing and all my teeth feel squeeky clean smooth when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li> First of all let me start off by saying that between two to three years ago I bought the Oral-B Pulsonic from Amazon and have been using it since.</li>
            <li> but I am not convinced it is as effective at flossing as I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> I bought one at announcement and when I opened it I was pleased by several differences:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> I used it I found out that the improvements were more than skin deep.</li>
            <li> The first shipment came, as always, speedily with Amazo Prime.  </li>
            <li> I love the 4 different settings and the travel case for on the go use!</li>
            <li> whole family can use one toothbrush like this as long as each have their own brush heads.  </li>
            <li> We  have owned different Oral B power toothbrushes over the years with the latest being the 1000.  </li>
            <li> I also think the design helps me do a better job of cleaning my back teeth</li>
            <li> The price was much better than in local stores too...</li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth pretty well.</li>
            <li> Why exactly?</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush of this caliber</li>
            <li> You either have to memorize how many times to press the button to move to a different setting, or turn it off to look at the settings on the handle.  </li>
            <li> This is not a huge issue, because the gray display area is good and gives you all notifications that you would need.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product and have already recommended it to a few friends looking for a new electric brush.</li>
            <li> Clearly this sensor is very useful.</li>
            <li> The advertised $20 rebate however is a complete scam, i cut out all the UPC codes, including the shipping box one and sent all 5 to Oral B. Got a form letter stating I didn&#x27;t provide original UPC barcodes.</li>
            <li> But the bright lights of the bathroom were the biggest challenge to seeing the red LED on the back.</li>
            <li> But the bright lights of the bathroom were the biggest challenge to seeing the red LED on the back.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed coming from the Pulsonic was how large it was in comparison.</li>
            <li> This continued to be the case even on the special setting for those with sensitive teeth, and even after I allowed time to adjust to the sensation.</li>
            <li> In addition there were some positive functional changes.&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> have most recently been using the Oral-B Vitality electric toothbrush and a somewhat older Oral-B A348 ProCare.</li>
            <li> I had an older oral b electric toothbrush (5000 model) that lasted me a good few years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Charge lasts forever; there are many features that make the brush highly customizable; and you can buy lots of different toothbrush heads and find the one that works for you</li>
            <li> On the downside, the charge/storage station has a pretty large counter footprint, and the over-pressure indicator LED is a bit hard to see in bright bathroom lighting.</li>
            <li> On the downside, the charge/storage station has a pretty large counter footprint, and the over-pressure indicator LED is a bit hard to see in bright bathroom lighting.</li>
            <li> This one is so easy to maneuver for deep and thourough cleaning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;JUST TO ALERT PEOPLE WHO SEND FOR THE REBATE - My order came in a brown cardboard box with a large adhesive label with the UPC code</li>
            <li> This one seems to polish just a bit better than the Precision, which is good, but I thought it might be only due to the head that comes with it being the &#x27;Floss Action&#x27; design, which has these little plastic paddles that are supposed to get in between teeth, but also offer a better polishing experience in my mind.  </li>
            <li> The 4000 is improves on pretty much every aspect of use of these 2 older brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the red light that flashes when you are applying too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very helpful.  </li>
            <li> I really like the brush tray.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed I didn&#x27;t need to pull out my plaque remover as much.  </li>
            <li> If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line.</li>
            <li> I like this one especially for the pressure warning light.  </li>
            <li> so I was very nervous about giving this brush a shot.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Smartseries 4000 toothbrush is a really well designed toothbrush.</li>
            <li> then you will need to purchase the 4000, there is a gentle mode.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot imagine really needing anything</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the stand that much because it comes apart when I move it, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the beeps that help you time your brushing are very helpful, and I like having the ability to switch modes.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need these bells and whistles, but they don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I like the intensity of the brushing (not TOO much and a red light flashes when it senses you are applying too much pressure).</li>
            <li> so am very</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve really thought of everything on this.</li>
            <li> However, despite the claim that it&#x27;s \\&quot;gentle on teeth</li>
            <li> The last Sonicare tooth brush I bought had a brush holder that fit 4 heads</li>
            <li> so there isn&#x27;t much I can do about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I must say I can really notice the difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband is jealous, he wants one of these too now.</li>
            <li> one thing I really like is that this brush keeps on going once you reach the two minute mark.  </li>
            <li> So if I want to spend a few more seconds on a couple of back teeth just to make sure I don&#x27;t have to turn this on again.  </li>
            <li> The first problem is that when you start up the toothbrush it&#x27;s pretty loud and noticeable.</li>
            <li> I purchased my most recent professional series over 6 years ago.</li>
            <li> We debated between buying this one or the next model up (the 5000 series) but decided it was not worth the higher price and found out it probably was a good decision.</li>
            <li> Rather than brush solely with a regular toothbrush or one of the older electric models that never worked that well for me, I&#x27;m now a strong believer in this technology.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are several things I like better about this unit, compared to the old one I have.</li>
            <li> The little toothbrushes that fit on the unit last a long time, so the set up represents an excellent value overall.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t as much food stuck better dental crowns and my gums as there was when I used other toothbrushes, even though I&#x27;m a dedicated flosser, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Particularly, it really gets the back side of the front teeth clean, all the way to the gum line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I really care about, though, is how clean my teeth feel and look after regular brushing.</li>
            <li> My teeth definitely feel clean when I finish brushing my teeth with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not so much that I didn&#x27;t get used to it quickly, but enough that I noticed.  </li>
            <li> After 2 hours there was a few minor blinkings of the charging light, but the unit would only read the bottom light of 4 - nothing more.  </li>
            <li> Smartseries 4000 stands near the top of the product line, and offers all but one feature that is found only on the model 5000 toothbrush (namely, the \\&quot;Wireless Smartguide\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> This one is interesting with multiple levels of bristles (giving a 3D cleaning action), as well as 4 soft blade-like cleaners.</li>
            <li> Brushing was as effective as with an ordinary toothbrush.</li>
            <li> story short, with the rebate it might have been worth it, without it, it certainly wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Sonicare uses a more oval shape that is smaller than a regular toothbrush(which</li>
            <li> However, it surprised me because when the  red light started blinking, the brushing was as vigorous as when I had just charged it.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Does it really make a difference when cleaning and is it worth the extra bucks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this brush, especially if you are coming from another brush, first time users, I would also recommend it as it&#x27;s easy to use and there is a soft mode on this brush so you can start brushing your teeth at a slower speed before moving to the fast speed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> All in all, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Low-end Oral-B brushes can be had for under $20, but paying a little more for an upscale model still makes sense because it comes with a stronger battery that lasts longer and cleans faster.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bells and whistles are nice; timers during brushing and also a warning if you&#x27;re brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> main warning I&#x27;d like possible consumers to know is Oral B rebate offers are difficult at best and maybe a scam.</li>
            <li> Along with standard mode, which presumably most people will use most of the time, there is also a polish mode that will help remove those tough coffee/tea/cola stains and help remove plaque.</li>
            <li> I give it my highest recommendation and for people with sensitive teeth and gums finding a product that really works and helps means a lot.</li>
            <li> The slimmer oval shape of the sonicares do not do this when you&#x27;re doing a normal brushing.</li>
            <li> I think--when I&#x27;ve triggered it most of the time, but the location makes me wonder if I&#x27;m missing it</li>
            <li> I also liked the various settings and often used the \\&quot;Daily Clean\\&quot; setting in which the toothbrush stops and beeps so that you get the proper amount of brushing in all 4 quadrants of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> but if I happen to find a deal for something I&#x27;m planning to buy, I will normally use it.</li>
            <li> and I can definitely tell you that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the extra dollars?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this toothbrush and hope that it lasts as long as my previous Oral-B toothbrush did.</li>
            <li> It can reach back of your mouth easily as well as inside and outside.</li>
            <li> As such I usually give up pretty quickly and turn to a soft toothbrush instead which works fine enough but rarely feels as thorough as an electric one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great cleaning action: I have used Oral-B electric brushes for many years now, and usually get pretty good reports at the dentist, though with several fixed bridges I tend to get about 1 small cavity each year.</li>
            <li> results from using this toothbrush are enormous and noticeable right away.</li>
            <li> Daily Clean has been the only one we&#x27;ve really used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has different modes: Daily Clean, Sensitive, Whitening, Deep Clean.</li>
            <li> The brush head still looks and feels new, I have noticed a substantial difference in whitening when compared to my Oral-B Pulsonic.</li>
            <li> When the brand new 4000 series came out it piqued my invest.</li>
            <li> this an entirely new and revolutionary product for cleaning your teeth?</li>
            <li> I had been thinking about getting a new brush for a while.</li>
            <li> so I thought it was time to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I figured that was something that I had to live with.</li>
            <li> I never really thought much about brushing my teeth in general, but now I actually look forward to that perfectly fresh and clean feeling after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because I set it on the charge cord when I get the red low charge light, and the elapsed time I observed that the re-charge lights are still flashing is 13 hours.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use any of the fancy additional settings, just the basic 2-minute, and it cleans very well.  </li>
            <li> It is a light next to the feature you are currently selecting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ; red light is constantly going off when the tooth brush is on, even when it&#x27;s not in my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With my Pulsonic I could say that I was brushing too hard, because sometimes after brushing I would notice that certain teeth in my mouth, were more sensitive than the others, I noticed this especially when I drank something either really hot or cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My gums have come back to new life a healthy pink and are no longer sensitive.  </li>
            <li> , I do not have that problem at all, this is most likely due to the fact that this brush has a long head and it&#x27;s really easy, if you want to brush the back of your teeth.</li>
            <li> For people first converting to an electric toothbrush, especially kids, this is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> If you are sharing the device with others in your household who may not have the same gum sensitivity as yourself, again, I recommend version 3000 or higher since you may not fully understand others&#x27; sensitivity levels.  </li>
            <li> Plus the 3000 model (or higher) comes with a covered container for holding multiple brushes which will prevent the family from misplacing or swapping the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Note for me that the grip of the 1000/3000 feels better in the hand as well due to its smaller size compared to the 4000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> compared both the 1000 and the 4000 using the same exact brush head.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both going to get your teeth exceptionally clean, and if you&#x27;re going to have a metaphorical aneurism when your sonicare breaks, it might be a lesser disappoint to get a oral b. I&#x27;ve owned my oral b&#x27;s for over a year now, and have not had one break-yet.o spend as the bottom line.</li>

I&#x27;ve owned my oral b&#x27;s for over a year now, and have not had one break-yet.</li>
            <li> I felt my mouth clean and fresh a little different than brushing manually.</li>
            <li> I only changed out because the rechargeable  battery on the old one was finally giving out, and wasn&#x27;t accessible to replace.  </li>
            <li> If you find the initial cost a little too high, the 3000 seems to provide most of the features, but at a lower cost.d.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you find the initial cost a little too high, the 3000 seems to provide most of the features, but at a lower cost.</li>
            <li> With the Oral-B Pulsonic, it was only making the front top and front bottom teeth look clean, whereas it was doing a poor job on the sides of my teeth.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare never seem to brush hard enough, whereas the top setting on this brush is exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> This causes the brush head to wear faster but, more importantly, pushing too hard slows down the spin of the brush head which decreases the effectiveness of the brush.</li>
            <li> So, I decided to order a new one before my old one dies completely.  </li>
            <li> The 4000 though gives you different modes as well as a easily seen red light letting you know if you are pushing too hard.</li>
            <li> In the long run, it represents a better value, particularly if the user is impatient (e.g. a young kid).</li>
            <li> One of his reasons was that the vibrating action of the Sonicare brushes loosens fillings.  </li>
            <li> A sensitive cycle has been added.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally sold on the Oral-B, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Till the Oral B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care electric brush that is.  </li>
            <li> some people have sensitive gums and may not like that you cannot control the Oral B to stay away from the gums, however it gets the job done all at once.</li>
            <li> With the 4000, I can just set the mode to Sensitive (indicated by a feather LED ...</li>
            <li> I use the sensitive skin head, and it has done wonders for my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> the 4000 series essentially makes that dummy proof as a giant red light comes on when you are pressing to firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care electric toothbrush since June, 2012.  </li>
            <li> Before the Floss Action, I was hooked on the Dual Action which I used with the Precision.  </li>
            <li> you have sensitive gums</li>
            <li> One of the biggest problems I have with electronic toothbrushes is that my teeth are way too sensitive</li>
            <li> you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need those extra feedback lights, and often I have to change the 4000</li>
            <li> to charge frequently</li>
            <li> I bought this and was surprised when my teeth hurt after just one brushing.</li>
            <li> B00132FUNG Water Pik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> My old toothbrush was the  [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I purchased the 4000 model because I didn&#x27;t really need the timer of the 5000 model and it looked very similar.</li>
            <li> It still works, but I had been thinking there may be something better with the advance of technology the last few years.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive gums, then I recommend the more expensive versions (3000 or higher) since they have sensitivity settings.  </li>
            <li> only thing I did not like as well about this one compared to the old one is that this new unit is louder than the old one.</li>
            <li> it even say on their website that there is an LCD and shows a model on the site (The same exact model actually) with an LCD built in, so there is some type of communication error somewhere.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t really used anything other than the main one.</li>
            <li> This is probably the single thing about Oral-B toothbrushes that I have disliked most.</li>
            <li> The 3 green re-charging lights go off after a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it also beeps 4 times during the 2 minutes that it runs; this feature of the brush is meant to guide you on how long to brush each quadrant of your mouth, the upper left, the upper right, the lower left and the lower right quadrants.</li>
            <li> I really put a lot of effort into taking care of my teeth and gums but for some reason I&#x27;ve always been plagued by sensitive teeth and due to bruxism have receding gums that are also sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the same one for 10 years, never needed to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I would not recommend purchasing the floss action heads if you have sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;While there is an in handle display in the 4000, it is not a digital display.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Timer consistently resets after use: Both of my other brushes just never seem to reset themselves after use.</li>
            <li> The holder for other \\&quot;heads\\&quot; makes it useful for families to all use together (though this unit only comes with one brush...</li>
            <li> had a tough time justifying buying a new brush when I had one that worked fine.</li>
            <li> This is a little different as a red light blinks when you turn it on/off if the battery needs to be recharged.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brushing, but it&#x27;s part of the general  behavior</li>
            <li> The Battery Life apparently lasts two weeks (according to the manual) and that is at 2 brushes per day for two minutes.</li>
            <li> If your Oral B is several years old, you may want to consider upgrading.</li>
            <li> Our last one was about 10-12 years old and failing</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one annoyance for me with the 4000 is that I accidentally change the mode instead of turning off the brush from time to time because the button are close enough to do this.&lt;br /&gt;While I recommend the Oral B 4000, I would suggest using the 1000 if you do not have sensitive or stained teeth.</li>
            <li> * Getting rid of plaque on back teeth surfaces along gum line - could not do it with old toothbrush.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I can still remember the epic difference between my regular toothbrush and this.</li>
            <li> Never have I looked back to brushing the old way once this baby came into my life.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone else has already covered the specs, so I will just say that after using this toothbrush twice daily, every day, my teeth now have the \\&quot;professionally cleaned\\&quot; feeling every day.</li>
            <li> by the third time I was completely adjusted to the device and no longer having that problem, but be prepared if you&#x27;ve never used one.  </li>
            <li> When I say comfortable I mean as in the way it feels in your hand.</li>
            <li> This model also comes with this lovely little plastic holder for 4 heads and a little lid to keep them dust-free.  </li>
            <li> (I only got the heavy duty cleaning one), but fortunately I had some of the regular ones left.</li>
            <li> This brush also has a red notification light that flashes, if you are brushing your teeth too hard, and it has helped me a lot.</li>
            <li> There is actually a red light that comes on if you are burshing too hard.  </li>
            <li> It will make your life easy when you feel lazy to brush especially after a long day.</li>
            <li> This is so small, that at first I thought I had received a battery operated unit by mistake!  </li>
            <li> First, the toothbrush contains a timer that not only counts down the total duration of the time you should allot to brushing your teeth</li>
            <li> , I noticed that it also cut down much of the debris removed when I floss afterwards.</li>
            <li> The standard two minute cycle with beeps every 30 seconds has been augmented with a &#x27; deep cleaning&#x27; cycle that simply uses the same brushing action with a three minute cycle and beeps every 45 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace another (old) Oral B brush whose batteries finally gave out after long years of use.  </li>
            <li> My last toothbrush was ten years old and I would expect this one to last just as long.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little bit cheaper, not by too much, but enough to give you something to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d have to say regardless of all the other benefits the sensitive tooth cleaning cycle is enough to get me to switch completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrush certainly cleans very well, the small round toothbrush head gets into the the rounded corners and edges of my teeth.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is an extremely noticeable difference between  it and the battery powered toothbrushes I&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving this toothbrush a try as I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now and have no issues with sensitivity when I use that mode.</li>
            <li> Well, I let my husband test it out first since I wanted to test the pressure alarm--I&#x27;ve been telling him forever that he brushes too hard...</li>
            <li> I will not be buying another electric toothbrush from Oral B; the risk is not worth it.[[ASIN:B007VXJK6E Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> My only negative comment is that you can&#x27;t really see the different settings while you are brushing.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know how well it lasts....</li>
            <li> I took the toothbrush on a 12 day trip and it lasted that long despite only being rated for 10 days.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush especially if you tend to brush your teeth for too short a time or press too hard as I do.</li>
            <li> I tried it out for a few more days and they got worse.</li>
            <li> few minor cons--this brush is heavier than the old one I was using.  </li>
            <li> so I know how long to brush each \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> No matter how careful you are to fully discharge periodically, they always get that \\&quot;memory effect\\&quot; and you lost total charge capacity.</li>
            <li> The charger holder is a big flimsy but that&#x27;s not much of a concern for me.</li>
            <li> The battery in it started dying after a few brushes and the toothbrush was looking old</li>
            <li> Long ago I went with Sonicare at my dentist&#x27;s suggestion.  </li>
            <li> Minor annoyance.  </li>
            <li> For folks that don&#x27;t like as firm or rough a brush, there&#x27;s enough settings to tone it down, but I have found that most brushes don&#x27;t have a setting firm enough rather than delicate enough.</li>
            <li> In fact, they&#x27;re slightly more expensive than the Sensonic replacement heads I used previously.</li>
            <li> second minder for moving to other sections of your teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other electric toothbrushes that also have the concept of a brush cycle, a beep, series of beeps, difference in the brush, whatever, that informs you to switch to a different area of your mouth.</li>
            <li> It has multiple settings from soft to hard, and a setting for &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another feature that distinguishes the 4000 from less expensive electric brushes is multiple brushing modes: a sensitive mode reduces speed/pressure and a polish mode for extra cleaning action (along with standard mode).</li>
            <li> It is so different, heavier, larger that I am not comfortable with it yet.&lt;br /&gt;Feels</li>
            <li> Second, the upper handle of the brush glows red when you push the brush against your teeth too hard.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a small thing, but who wants to look at a mess on their kitchen counter?&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t usually do that, and I attribute it to the improved cleaning action of the 4000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but I attribute it somehow to the shape or action or ergonomics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Timers now provide audible beeps as well as the previously used pulse notification, and there is a visible red indicator LED to let you know to EASE UP on the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Half the time I only saw it in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Half the time I only saw it in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I find that red light glows a lot when I brush my teeth, but I am finding that it is glowing less and less.</li>
            <li> With the Pulsonic when it was on, it was very low volume, I&#x27;d say at least half as loud.</li>
            <li> further recommend you order at least two different kinds of heads</li>
            <li> It allows you to have a few different brushes at your disposal.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush with the hope of sharpening my teeth akin to Christopher Walken in Sleepy Hollow.  </li>
            <li> There is a nice base to store your brushhead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Visible indicator for over-pressure: When you are getting too distracted and bearing down too hard, a red LED on the back of the handle lights.</li>
            <li> I had been curious about electric toothbrushes for awhile now, but had never purchased one... mostly due to the cost.</li>
            <li> Ours was getting a little long in the tooth (no pun intended)</li>
            <li> --my jaw is small and there&#x27;s not a lot of space around my back molars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what that does, but after using this model I can&#x27;t see the screen being necessary.</li>
            <li> The other thing I wasn&#x27;t prepared for, is that it whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have custom whitening trays from the dentist, and I was about due to use them (I use them once a year),</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush head that comes with this unit has odd little paddles and different bristles, and is a little rough on my gums, so I use a spare one I had for my 10+ year-old Oral-B electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Opening the handle will destroy the appliance and invalidate the warranty.\\&quot;  As little charge as I get on this, I wonder if it will last for the two years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very careful and always was leaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought that if this kind of tooth brush was painful then I either need to stop pushing so hard or buy softer heads.  </li>
            <li> I mentioned earlier that it was hard to brush behind my teeth with the Pulsonic, with this new brush</li>
            <li> This was a plus for me since I saw that I had been brushing too hard at the very back of my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Is</li>
            <li> The charging base itself is flatter and more attractive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charging base has been redesigned, and looks nicer and more streamlined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I noticed that the battery in the Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush I&#x27;ve had for two years seems to be wearing down as it will start laboring even before the battery icon starts to blink, indicating it needs to be charged.  </li>
            <li> I had a slight problem when setting the toothbrush up.</li>
            <li> It seems to me that polishing would aid in bacteria-resistance since you are smoothing the surface so less bacteria could get in and reside, leading to cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> Stopped working after less than a year.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s fully functional, I don&#x27;t feel like I can give it less than 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Which is odd, because the rebate offer and PDF documentation for the toothbrush was on its Amazon product page.</li>
            <li> I tend to use mine a little longer than they recommend, and (shhhhh)</li>
            <li> I tend to use mine a little longer than they recommend, and (shhhhh)</li>
            <li> I lost my warranty paper already since I was firmly believing the Oral-B&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> The battery indicator lights would not blink (indicating charging), and the unit remained dead.  </li>
            <li> So maintaining them is not cheap.</li>
            <li> After just a few weeks using the Oral-B Smartseries 4000</li>
            <li> /&gt;Three stars for the sucky battery life and lack of ability to replace without destroying the unit.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months now</li>
            <li> I typically have been getting a little over 2 weeks per charge with the 4000, though that is at once/day use and usually on \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The cord attachment was sort of hidden in the box, so I was relieved!  </li>
            <li> I tend to get a little distracted while brushing (replaying that argument with the boss this afternoon), and I sometimes bear down too hard.</li>
            <li> -pressure LED is a little hard to see: I did have some trouble seeing the LED indicator for over-pressure.</li>
            <li> -pressure LED is a little hard to see: I did have some trouble seeing the LED indicator for over-pressure.</li>
            <li> So buyers whose teeth are touchy or who react badly to pressure within the mouth area may want to seek a different model, or perhaps stick to traditional brushing.</li>
            <li> I like the oral-b styling (small brush) because I have a small mouth.  </li>
            <li> All the Oral-B brushes I have had in the past used NiCad batteries.</li>
            <li> The heads usually come with color-coded rings at the bottom</li>
            <li> so I usually end up reeling in pain by the end of the brush cycle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand what is wrong with the Oral-B people that they are saying I submitted an invalid UPC since that was the only thing on the box!!</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding an electric toothbrush that thoroughly cleans my teeth without leaving my mouth and gums sore.</li>
            <li> that you don&#x27;t need to brush that hard with an electric brush, but he pooh poohed me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard for me to spend $100 plus on a toothbrush, so</li>
            <li> I also like the pressure indicator that lets you know if you&#x27;re pushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I was also always a bit confused how firm I should hold the brush against my teeth and</li>
            <li> Seems that this has also happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like Oral B has a serious quality review issue going</li>
            <li> Two out of two malfunctioning units indicate a serious lapse.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who is serious about their dental hygiene should consider getting one of these.  </li>
            <li> When i use the Oral B&#x27;s i can feel the vibrating in my head and my vision gets a little weird while i&#x27;m brushing, the sonicares do not do this.</li>
            <li> The small oscillating brush reaches those tough to get to problem areas like behind your rear teeth, and the inward side of all your teeth.</li>
            <li> Unlike the old charging base, there is no where for gunk to pool and become unwashable.</li>
            <li> Other electric toothbrushes I have used were painful for me and not effective.  </li>
            <li> Also, using this on your tongue gets stuff out that is pretty nasty but also liberating.</li>
            <li> I also think the pressure indicator is a little awkwardly placed.  </li>
            <li> With regular use of the Oral-B electric toothbrush my gums are healthier and my visits to the dentist for cleanings are no longer bloody.</li>
            <li> handle recharges by simply parking it in the base unit when not in use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it would not take a charge - not in one hour, not in two hours, not overnight.  </li>
            <li> However, the is something obviously wrong with Oral B&#x27;s quality management.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Case seemed weird, so I pitched it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong and your teeth will thank you.</li>
            <li> 4000 looks, feels, and acts like a expensive dental machine.</li>
            <li> The brush automatically compensates by cutting off pulsing (the 3D cleaning effect) too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NiMH batteries:</li>
            <li> Not outright painful, just weird.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> and gums,\\&quot; I found brushing with it unpleasant.</li>
            <li> For one person, thats not so bad, but when you have a family of four, thats $50</li>
            <li> I hate NiCads.</li>
            <li> There is nothing to plug in, it is inductively coupled, so just setting it on the base unit</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush heads are VERY expensive for the sonicares!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First of all let me start off by saying that between two to three years ago I bought the Oral-B Pulsonic from Amazon and have been using it since. I decided recently to have a change because while the Pulsonic has been great, I wanted something more advanced. Also, the Pulsonic did not do a great job at the back of your teeth, so I wanted something that worked 360. Out of the box you receive the 4000 Brush, Traveler case, a tooth brush head, charger/stand, and an area on the side of the stand (pictured) that you can store extra toothbrush heads. The first thing that I noticed coming from the Pulsonic was how large it was in comparison. The Pulsonic is only on 3/4 of the size of this toothbrush. What a surprise this has been, it feels a lot more comfortable, yet more powerful at the same time. When I say comfortable I mean as in the way it feels in your hand. The Battery Life apparently lasts two weeks (according to the manual) and that is at 2 brushes per day for two minutes. This makes it quite battery efficient, I got about a week out of the Pulsonic at twice a day so this was great to hear. I mentioned earlier that it was hard to brush behind my teeth with the Pulsonic, with this new brush, I do not have that problem at all, this is most likely due to the fact that this brush has a long head and it&#x27;s really easy, if you want to brush the back of your teeth. This brush also has a red notification light that flashes, if you are brushing your teeth too hard, and it has helped me a lot. With my Pulsonic I could say that I was brushing too hard, because sometimes after brushing I would notice that certain teeth in my mouth, were more sensitive than the others, I noticed this especially when I drank something either really hot or cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is any cons on this product I will give you two. The first problem is that when you start up the toothbrush it&#x27;s pretty loud and noticeable. With the Pulsonic when it was on, it was very low volume, I&#x27;d say at least half as loud. The second problem, and an issue another reviewer brought up is that there is no LCD screen, despite the fact that it says there is one. This is not a huge issue, because the gray display area is good and gives you all notifications that you would need. Still though, Oral-B has to do something about this it even say on their website that there is an LCD and shows a model on the site (The same exact model actually) with an LCD built in, so there is some type of communication error somewhere. Overall, I highly recommend this brush, especially if you are coming from another brush, first time users, I would also recommend it as it&#x27;s easy to use and there is a soft mode on this brush so you can start brushing your teeth at a slower speed before moving to the fast speed. This gets a 5 star from me, great product for the money that will last years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*EDIT: 7/5/12*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s been two weeks now, and I can confidently tell you that this electric toothbrush was worth every penny. The brush head still looks and feels new, I have noticed a substantial difference in whitening when compared to my Oral-B Pulsonic. The difference I noticed, is that the whitening has been even on both my top and bottom rows of teeth. With the Oral-B Pulsonic, it was only making the front top and front bottom teeth look clean, whereas it was doing a poor job on the sides of my teeth. This toothbrush really is the total package and the best you can do at under $100. I may update again in the future, to let you know how it is all coming along.</li>
            <li> Great product, use it everyday and it wears like iron.</li>
            <li> I thought this was supposed to have an digital display. According to the oral-b website. Thinking about exchanging this to the 5000</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best toothbrush I have ever used! The vibration is comfortable and massaging, but I also feel like it&#x27;s really getting the job done. The Deep Clean mode was especially effective at removing my plaque (I checked) and the whitening mode made a noticeable difference even faster than the item description says! Thank you, Oral B, for this fantastic toothbrush. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their oral health :)</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. It works well, and you can tell it&#x27;s got a powerful motor. It does a great job cleaning, and even has \\&quot;beeps\\&quot; to let you know when to switch to a different area of the teeth. The holder for other \\&quot;heads\\&quot; makes it useful for families to all use together (though this unit only comes with one brush...others will need to be purchased separately). Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This Electric Toothbrush was recommended by my Dentist.  One of his reasons was that the vibrating action of the Sonicare brushes loosens fillings.  I have used Sonicare brushes for years and wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to change brands.  My current Sonicare wouldn&#x27;t take a charge anymore so I had to make a decision.  I am very pleased with this Oral-B.  It seems to do everything it claims but I am not convinced it is as effective at flossing as I expected it to be.  During the short time I had to use a regular toothbrush, I noticed my teeth were getting yellower.  Since, I am using this electric toothbrush my \\&quot;pearly whites\\&quot; are back to being to being just that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral B toothbrushes for years now. I have always been more than satisfied. I purchased my most recent professional series over 6 years ago. I&#x27;ve always watched them and from appearances, nothing seemed to change. I was wrong! When the brand new 4000 series came out it piqued my invest. I bought one at announcement and when I opened it I was pleased by several differences:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The new  spare toothbrush holder is better thought out and works much better than the old &#x27;stand up&#x27; one.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The charging base itself is flatter and more attractive.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Unlike the old charging base, there is no where for gunk to pool and become unwashable. Sounds like a small thing, but who wants to look at a mess on their kitchen counter?&lt;br /&gt;When I used it I found out that the improvements were more than skin deep. This is a better toothbrush. I cannot quantify it, but it does clean better, not a little bit, but a lot. In addition there were some positive functional changes.&lt;br /&gt;1.  The standard two minute cycle with beeps every 30 seconds has been augmented with a &#x27; deep cleaning&#x27; cycle that simply uses the same brushing action with a three minute cycle and beeps every 45 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;2.  A separate polishing cycle has been added.&lt;br /&gt;3. A sensitive cycle has been added. For people first converting to an electric toothbrush, especially kids, this is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;4.  A pressure alarm light that is easily visible has been added. This was a plus for me since I saw that I had been brushing too hard at the very back of my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Is this an entirely new and revolutionary product for cleaning your teeth? No. Is a very real upgrade resulting from refining that which was already good? Yes. If your Oral B is several years old, you may want to consider upgrading.</li>
            <li> This one is definitely a step up from my cheaper Oral-B electric brush!  I like that it has an adjustable timer so I know how long to brush each \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot;.  Very helpful.  I also like that it uses the same brush attachments as my now defunct/cheaper Oral-B so that I don&#x27;t have to go out and buy a different brush attachment.  And I appreciate the travel case on those rare occasions that I am out of town.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for over a month and its terrific. My mouth feels fresh and my teeth are sparkly clean. I really like the brush tray. It allows you to have a few different brushes at your disposal. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I saw another review where, out of the box, the unit did not charge at all.  Seems that this has also happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like Oral B has a serious quality review issue going on.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the toothbrush works great -- if I could only get it to charge.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunate...</li>
            <li> With regular use of the Oral-B electric toothbrush my gums are healthier and my visits to the dentist for cleanings are no longer bloody.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. It is the most effective brush I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not care for is it pauses briefly every 45 seconds or so and this aggravates me.</li>
            <li> I like the oral-b styling (small brush) because I have a small mouth.  It is compact and will be  easy to take when I travel.</li>
            <li> after only 3 months usage, it stop charging, can anyone tell me how to fix it?? I lost my warranty paper already since I was firmly believing the Oral-B&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have had an Oral B electric toothbrush for more than 5 years.  We were very pleased with it, and when it would no longer hold a charge I automatically looked for a current Oral B model.  I  chose the 4000.  The first shipment came, as always, speedily with Amazo Prime.  Unfortunately, it would not take a charge - not in one hour, not in two hours, not overnight.  The battery indicator lights would not blink (indicating charging), and the unit remained dead.  When I reported this to Amazon I had a replacement unit on the way within the same day, and I was given prepaid shipping labels to return the malfunctioning unit.  The replacement Oral B 4000 arrived yesterday.  After 2 hours there was a few minor blinkings of the charging light, but the unit would only read the bottom light of 4 - nothing more.  The unit did manage a 2-minute brushing last evening, but today it would not charge during the day, and this evening it only ran 30 seconds!  Again, Amazon has made it easy to return, and they have promised me a refund once they receive the unit.  However, the is something obviously wrong with Oral B&#x27;s quality management.  Two out of two malfunctioning units indicate a serious lapse.  I will not be buying another electric toothbrush from Oral B; the risk is not worth it.[[ASIN:B007VXJK6E Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Philips Sonicare brushes for years and decided to try the Oral-B Smart-series after my Sonicare brush malfunctioned.  I thought I had achieved nirvana with the Sonicare series because I constantly received good comments from my dentist during cleanings.  I was wrong.  The Oral-B Smart-series is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit, I believe the sonic cleaning of the Sonicare was superior to the cleaning action of the Smart-series.  What I found after using the Smart-series was a deeper cleaning, a \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; of clean that I didn&#x27;t get from the Sonicare, and brighter, cleaner, teeth!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I immediately noticed I didn&#x27;t need to pull out my plaque remover as much.  I also noticed a tingle after completion of the brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist has also noticed that my teeth are cleaner between checkups.  I&#x27;m totally sold on the Oral-B, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really put a lot of effort into taking care of my teeth and gums but for some reason I&#x27;ve always been plagued by sensitive teeth and due to bruxism have receding gums that are also sensitive.  My dentist is excellent and has always told me that since I take such good care manually the effect would always be better and more thorough than with an electric toothbrush.  Till the Oral B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care electric brush that is.  When I saw this brush I showed all the info on it to my dentist and he told me I should take a try with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And thank God I did.  Other electric toothbrushes I have used were painful for me and not effective.  This one is so easy to maneuver for deep and thourough cleaning.  Whether using the deep clean mode or the one for sensitive teeth both have improved my oral hygiene greatly.  I was very impressed that the deep clean mode wasn&#x27;t too intense.  My dentist is thrilled.  My gums have come back to new life a healthy pink and are no longer sensitive.  And my teeth?  The plaque removal here is superb and my sensitive teeth have improved more with this brush than with any desensitizing paste I have used.  My dentist said it is because the brush is doing what it needs to do and not stressing the teeth by using a faster speed that is just not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else about this electric toothbrush I found to be very user friendly as well.  Both my dentist and I are very impressed with this 4000 Professional care product.  I give it my highest recommendation and for people with sensitive teeth and gums finding a product that really works and helps means a lot.</li>
            <li> I have owned the Sonicare Flexcare sonic electric toothbrushes the last 3 years and they break about once a year. After this last time, i thought i would give Oral B a try to see how they hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush heads are very different. Sonicare uses a more oval shape that is smaller than a regular toothbrush(which i like because it can fit in your mouth easier) and Oral B uses a circular shape. I feel that the Oral B cleans your gums a bit better because it is more wide and can reach your gums, even when you&#x27;re not trying to, just when you&#x27;re normally brushing your teeth. The slimmer oval shape of the sonicares do not do this when you&#x27;re doing a normal brushing. I feel as though this could be a plus or a con depending on the individual. some people have sensitive gums and may not like that you cannot control the Oral B to stay away from the gums, however it gets the job done all at once. Between the two, they both do a great job of getting your teeth feeling very clean, sonicare may do it very slightly better, but both are MUCH better than a regular toothbrush. I could never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibrations of the sonicares are, i feel, more controlled. When i use the Oral B&#x27;s i can feel the vibrating in my head and my vision gets a little weird while i&#x27;m brushing, the sonicares do not do this. This was the biggest issue for me when using the Oral B&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a bit annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads are VERY expensive for the sonicares! I buy mine from costco, and i spend about $50 for 7 brush heads. For one person, thats not so bad, but when you have a family of four, thats $50+ every 6 months. So maintaining them is not cheap. Oral B is about $40 for 8. They&#x27;re a little bit cheaper, not by too much, but enough to give you something to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i would say the Sonicares perform better, but often break. While the Oral B are cheaper, and last longer. If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line. They&#x27;re both going to get your teeth exceptionally clean, and if you&#x27;re going to have a metaphorical aneurism when your sonicare breaks, it might be a lesser disappoint to get a oral b. I&#x27;ve owned my oral b&#x27;s for over a year now, and have not had one break-yet.o spend as the bottom line. They&#x27;re both going to get your teeth exceptionally clean, and if you&#x27;re going to have a metaphorical aneurism when your sonicare breaks, it might be a lesser disappoint to get a oral b.

            <li> Ahhh, I love that feeling of clean, sparkly teeth as I am sure we all do! I really love the Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  I had a slight problem when setting the toothbrush up. I thought the unit was dead on arrival, but it took about 15 minutes for the green light to begin flashing. If I had taken the time to read the instructions, I would have known that.  Within two days of use, I noticed my teeth getting cleaner and cleaner. I could feel it!  I love the 4 different settings and the travel case for on the go use! Solid 5 stars here!</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is an extremely noticeable difference between  it and the battery powered toothbrushes I&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can actually feel the difference while brushing and all my teeth feel squeeky clean smooth when I&#x27;m finished. After just a few weeks using the Oral-B Smartseries 4000 I am noticing better feeling gums and whiter teeth. There isn&#x27;t as much food stuck better dental crowns and my gums as there was when I used other toothbrushes, even though I&#x27;m a dedicated flosser, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I LOVE not having to worry about having extra fresh batteries on hand or hoping there are some charged up rechargeable batteries on hand when the batteries give out or start losing juice like I did with the battery operated toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definite winner you must have!</li>
            <li> The product is efficient and easy to use.  However, the product was advertised to the consusmer in a faulty manner.  The advertisement stated that you would receive a $20.00 rebate providing you submitted a receipt and the original UPC.  (Scam--When you submit the original UPC, you no longer have a copy!) I followed the rules: submitted the receipt and the original UPC.  I received a form letter that a rebate would not be forthcoming as I had not submitted the original UPC.  Thus, the scam was successful.  I was tempted to return the unit....however, the product is good and I have decided never to purchase any product made by Oral B. This purchase was made through Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  I bought it to replace another (old) Oral B brush whose batteries finally gave out after long years of use.  I like this one especially for the pressure warning light.  I would recommend this brush to anyone who may be in the market.</li>
            <li> Vendors of electric toothbrushes follow the razor-blade business: most of their profits come from the replacement brush heads. Low-end Oral-B brushes can be had for under $20, but paying a little more for an upscale model still makes sense because it comes with a stronger battery that lasts longer and cleans faster. In the long run, it represents a better value, particularly if the user is impatient (e.g. a young kid).</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral-B Smartseries 4000 rechargeable toothbrush for several weeks now. In general I have been very pleased with its performance. Oral-B continues to advance their product development in both materials and performance features, though even their most basic products also tend to be good performers, and at bargain prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smartseries 4000 stands near the top of the product line, and offers all but one feature that is found only on the model 5000 toothbrush (namely, the \\&quot;Wireless Smartguide\\&quot;). The 4000 can use most of the replacement heads that Oral-B markets, but comes with their Floss Action brush head. This one is interesting with multiple levels of bristles (giving a 3D cleaning action), as well as 4 soft blade-like cleaners. Positioned on the outer edges, presumably they perform extra floss-like cleaning of that area at the gumline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature that distinguishes the 4000 from less expensive electric brushes is multiple brushing modes: a sensitive mode reduces speed/pressure and a polish mode for extra cleaning action (along with standard mode). Timers now provide audible beeps as well as the previously used pulse notification, and there is a visible red indicator LED to let you know to EASE UP on the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have most recently been using the Oral-B Vitality electric toothbrush and a somewhat older Oral-B A348 ProCare. The 4000 is improves on pretty much every aspect of use of these 2 older brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the PROS and CONS I observed during use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great cleaning action: I have used Oral-B electric brushes for many years now, and usually get pretty good reports at the dentist, though with several fixed bridges I tend to get about 1 small cavity each year. I started using the 4000 a couple of weeks before my latest cleaning/checkup, and this time the hygienist remarked on how good my teeth looked. She doesn&#x27;t usually do that, and I attribute it to the improved cleaning action of the 4000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timer consistently resets after use: Both of my other brushes just never seem to reset themselves after use. I&#x27;ll turn the brush on, and 20 seconds later it gives me the \\&quot;end of cycle\\&quot; pulse. Huh? The 4000 has never messed up the timing. After each use, it resets itself to a zero point for next brush session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Selectable modes: I love this feature. Just love it. I tend to get a little distracted while brushing (replaying that argument with the boss this afternoon), and I sometimes bear down too hard. With the 4000, I can just set the mode to Sensitive (indicated by a feather LED ... so cute), and I don&#x27;t tear up my gums. Along with standard mode, which presumably most people will use most of the time, there is also a polish mode that will help remove those tough coffee/tea/cola stains and help remove plaque. Might be worthwhile to use that mode once a week ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visible indicator for over-pressure: When you are getting too distracted and bearing down too hard, a red LED on the back of the handle lights. The brush automatically compensates by cutting off pulsing (the 3D cleaning effect) too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NiMH batteries: All the Oral-B brushes I have had in the past used NiCad batteries. I hate NiCads. This is probably the single thing about Oral-B toothbrushes that I have disliked most. No matter how careful you are to fully discharge periodically, they always get that \\&quot;memory effect\\&quot; and you lost total charge capacity. Not an issue here. NiMH batteries are free of memory effect, can be charged generally hundreds of times without any loss of capacity, and are good long-lasting performers. I typically have been getting a little over 2 weeks per charge with the 4000, though that is at once/day use and usually on \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storage/travel case included: This is cool if you like to take your Oral-B brush with you. A fitted plastic shell for storing the 4000 with room for 2 brushheads is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large footprint for storage/charging station: The charging station takes up a lot of counter space. The footprint is about 5.5 x 4 inches. You can lay 4 brushes in the brush station at the right, which has a pivoting lid to protect them from dust and sink splashes. The charging station is located on the left. I suspect that there is better drying with the flat-laying brush storage (better airflow storing them horizontally vs vertically in previous brush stations), but counter space is at a premium in my bathroom, so the large footprint is a detraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushheads are pricey: Well, they always have been. I tend to use mine a little longer than they recommend, and (shhhhh) sometimes I use generic alternatives, both of which help reduce costs. I just noticed that you can get brushheads via Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program, so I think I&#x27;ll check that out too as a possible money-saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over-pressure LED is a little hard to see: I did have some trouble seeing the LED indicator for over-pressure. It could be brighter. And its location might use some tweaking. Sometimes my hand covered it as I held the toothbrush (maybe adding a LED on the front too would help). But the bright lights of the bathroom were the biggest challenge to seeing the red LED on the back. Half the time I only saw it in the mirror. It&#x27;s a great feature, but they need to work on putting it in a better location and making it more visible in bright bathroom lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B 4000 toothbrush is not inexpensive, but on the positive side, it does a simply fantastic job cleaning your teeth, and it is better than older/cheaper Oral-B electric toothbrushes in pretty much every aspect. While replacement brushheads are pricey too, taking great care of your teeth is critically important, both for overall health AND for saving the costs of needing to have dental problems fixed. And there are ways to save on brushheads, if you&#x27;re resourceful. Winning features of the 4000 include a good timer, which has audible and pulse notifications for each quadrant of the mouth; NiMH batteries (SO much better than NiCads); selectable modes for sensitive, normal, and polish; and a handy travel case. On the downside, the charge/storage station has a pretty large counter footprint, and the over-pressure indicator LED is a bit hard to see in bright bathroom lighting. Overall, though, this is an excellent electric toothbrush, and if you can afford it and the ongoing replacement brush cost, I definitely recommend it. If you find the initial cost a little too high, the 3000 seems to provide most of the features, but at a lower cost.d.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large footprint for storage/charging station: The charging station takes up a lot of counter space.

            <li> I am pleased with the toothbrush, I haven&#x27;t tried all the settings yet, but I will at some time. It would have been nice if it came with more than 1 brush (I only got the heavy duty cleaning one), but fortunately I had some of the regular ones left. For the price an extra brush or two would have been nice.</li>
            <li> I researched what would be the best product for my needs.  I determined this was the best choice. It works perfectly and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic, highly-customizable toothbrush. I use the sensitive skin head, and it has done wonders for my sensitive gums. I used to be an agressive brusher, and some of the roots of my teeth are now showing. I have had a hard time finding an electric toothbrush that thoroughly cleans my teeth without leaving my mouth and gums sore. This is the one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charge lasts forever; there are many features that make the brush highly customizable; and you can buy lots of different toothbrush heads and find the one that works for you best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I had been thinking about getting a new brush for a while. I have had an Oral-B Sonicare for about 4 years. It still works, but I had been thinking there may be something better with the advance of technology the last few years. The Sonicare brush vibrated from side to side, which I have always like much better than the brushes that rotate in a circle so I was very nervous about giving this brush a shot. All I can say is, WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is amazing. The Sonicare never seem to brush hard enough, whereas the top setting on this brush is exactly what I hoped it would be. I was also always a bit confused how firm I should hold the brush against my teeth and the 4000 series essentially makes that dummy proof as a giant red light comes on when you are pressing to firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best comparison I can make is to describe this as the cordless version of the brush your dentist uses. It&#x27;s that swirling brush that leaves your teeth feeling like you just left Dr. Dental&#x27;s office each day. For folks that don&#x27;t like as firm or rough a brush, there&#x27;s enough settings to tone it down, but I have found that most brushes don&#x27;t have a setting firm enough rather than delicate enough. This brush solves that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some complaints about the handle, the charger, etc. I can&#x27;t imagine why people could even complain as it&#x27;s the last thing I would notice nor do I think either are a problem. The charging stand is nice and you can remove the holding case that attaches to it if you&#x27;re worried about counter space. You also get a nice travel case, which is a huge plus because every time I took my sonicare on vacation, I would have to bring it with my carry on or else the on button would also get pushed in the suitcase and end up basically dead by the time I arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a tough time justifying buying a new brush when I had one that worked fine. I couldn&#x27;t be happier I took a chance as I firmly believe this brush will leave me much healthier teeth. I have to believe the Oral-B brand will last as my brush from 4 years ago is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care electric toothbrush since June, 2012.  The charge has never lasted more than 10-11 uses of two minutes apiece.  The owner&#x27;s manual claims that a full charge will give you 20 uses of two minutes each use.  That&#x27;s two times what I actually get.  AND, it takes in excess of 13 hours for the brush to fully charge.  I say 13+ hours because I set it on the charge cord when I get the red low charge light, and the elapsed time I observed that the re-charge lights are still flashing is 13 hours.  Full charge occurred some time after that during the night.  The 3 green re-charging lights go off after a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head that comes with this unit has odd little paddles and different bristles, and is a little rough on my gums, so I use a spare one I had for my 10+ year-old Oral-B electric toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t really use any of the fancy additional settings, just the basic 2-minute, and it cleans very well.  I only changed out because the rechargeable  battery on the old one was finally giving out, and wasn&#x27;t accessible to replace.  WARNING, if you open the battery compartment before the warranty is up, the instruction booklet states, \\&quot;Caution! Opening the handle will destroy the appliance and invalidate the warranty.\\&quot;  As little charge as I get on this, I wonder if it will last for the two years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars for the sucky battery life and lack of ability to replace without destroying the unit.  But it does clean my teeth very well!</li>
            <li> Faster and easier than manual brush. Seems to do a more thorough job in a shorter amount of time than sawing away with my old manual.</li>
            <li> We are a family of Oral B electronic tooth brush users. I have the 3000 and the kids each have a 1000. For the extra money the only thing I see that is worth any added expense is the carrying case. My husband works out of town and this is great for him to take the brush to/from work each week. Everything else is essentially the same as my 3000. Longer cleaning cycle means it beeps at 45 seconds and not 30. So what? You can figure that out on your own without paying an extra price tag. I say buy the 3000.</li>
            <li> Anyone who is serious about their dental hygiene should consider getting one of these.  I won&#x27;t say it is absolutely necessary to upgrade from the Healthy Clean Precision 1000, which I also own.  This one seems to polish just a bit better than the Precision, which is good, but I thought it might be only due to the head that comes with it being the &#x27;Floss Action&#x27; design, which has these little plastic paddles that are supposed to get in between teeth, but also offer a better polishing experience in my mind.  Before the Floss Action, I was hooked on the Dual Action which I used with the Precision.  If you have a lower grade toothbrush than this one and want more polishing, you might give the Floss Action head a go.  It seems to me that polishing would aid in bacteria-resistance since you are smoothing the surface so less bacteria could get in and reside, leading to cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your whole family can use one toothbrush like this as long as each have their own brush heads.  The heads usually come with color-coded rings at the bottom so you know whose is whose.  This model also comes with this lovely little plastic holder for 4 heads and a little lid to keep them dust-free.  I love it - before, I was setting my head on a piece of tissue in the medicine cabinet.  This is much more tidy.  This is a great tooth-brush!</li>
            <li> We upgraded from an older Braun electric toothbrush and are totally satisfied.  One of the best brushes on the market and recommended by our dentist.</li>
            <li> I love electric toothbrushes and have been using them for years. Ours was getting a little long in the tooth (no pun intended) so we wanted to try this one. Well, I let my husband test it out first since I wanted to test the pressure alarm--I&#x27;ve been telling him forever that he brushes too hard...that you don&#x27;t need to brush that hard with an electric brush, but he pooh poohed me. Well, this brush confirmed what I was saying. YES! Aside from that, the sensitive cycle was good for my toddler son (but I ended up getting him his own electric brush). This is just another great brush in the long line of Oral-B electric brushes that we&#x27;ve used, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for cleaning teeth, but the charge runs out quickly and it takes a couple of days to recharge it.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Smartseries 4000 toothbrush is a really well designed toothbrush. That it is rechargeable is very useful. The toothbrush certainly cleans very well, the small round toothbrush head gets into the the rounded corners and edges of my teeth. My teeth definitely feel clean when I finish brushing my teeth with this toothbrush. However, there are two features of this toothbrush that really send it to the top of the heap of all the toothbrushes I have owned. First, the toothbrush contains a timer that not only counts down the total duration of the time you should allot to brushing your teeth but it also beeps 4 times during the 2 minutes that it runs; this feature of the brush is meant to guide you on how long to brush each quadrant of your mouth, the upper left, the upper right, the lower left and the lower right quadrants. Second, the upper handle of the brush glows red when you push the brush against your teeth too hard. I have a tendency to push the toothbrush too close against my teeth. This causes the brush head to wear faster but, more importantly, pushing too hard slows down the spin of the brush head which decreases the effectiveness of the brush. Needless to say, I find that red light glows a lot when I brush my teeth, but I am finding that it is glowing less and less. Clearly this sensor is very useful. I highly recommend this brush especially if you tend to brush your teeth for too short a time or press too hard as I do.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I have had OralB for over 25 years now.  Our last one was about 10-12 years old and failing so we knew it was time for an update.  We could not be happier with our purchase.  There is actually a red light that comes on if you are burshing too hard.  You can see it reflected in the mirror or sink basin easily.  It has multipe settings and that is great if you want to do some whitening occasionally.  We could not be happier with our purchase.  We also like the storage unit that holds up to 4  brush heads.  We debated between buying this one or the next model up (the 5000 series) but decided it was not worth the higher price and found out it probably was a good decision.</li>
            <li> We  have owned different Oral B power toothbrushes over the years with the latest being the 1000.  I have no complaints with the 1000 it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When determining if one should purchase the 4000 or the 1000, one needs to look at the additional features the 4000 provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive gums then you will need to purchase the 4000, there is a gentle mode.  Additionally, I would not recommend purchasing the floss action heads if you have sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;While there is an in handle display in the 4000, it is not a digital display.  It is a light next to the feature you are currently selecting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not see any difference when using the polishing mode in the 4000, however, I do not have stains to determine if the feature works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one annoyance for me with the 4000 is that I accidentally change the mode instead of turning off the brush from time to time because the button are close enough to do this.&lt;br /&gt;While I recommend the Oral B 4000, I would suggest using the 1000 if you do not have sensitive or stained teeth.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after less than a year. Going to give Phillips a try to see if their product will last longer.</li>
            <li> Oral-B makes a fine quality toothbrush and they last for many years. My last toothbrush was ten years old and I would expect this one to last just as long.</li>
            <li> My results from using this 4000 series toothbrush were immediate and impressive. The top speed is plenty powerful so I cannot imagine really needing anything faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits I&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;* Getting rid of plaque on back teeth surfaces along gum line - could not do it with old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;* Not worrying about harming gums because the brush stop and beeps when I press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;* Polished feeling of teeth after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;* Increased confidence about being efficient and effective about brushing teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;* I don&#x27;t like the stand that much because it comes apart when I move it, so I don&#x27;t move it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results from using this toothbrush are enormous and noticeable right away. Rather than brush solely with a regular toothbrush or one of the older electric models that never worked that well for me, I&#x27;m now a strong believer in this technology.</li>
            <li> One of the biggest problems I have with electronic toothbrushes is that my teeth are way too sensitive so I usually end up reeling in pain by the end of the brush cycle. As such I usually give up pretty quickly and turn to a soft toothbrush instead which works fine enough but rarely feels as thorough as an electric one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have to say regardless of all the other benefits the sensitive tooth cleaning cycle is enough to get me to switch completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive teeth I highly recommend giving this toothbrush a try as I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now and have no issues with sensitivity when I use that mode.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was an upgrade from a less-expensive Oral-B model that I used for several years before it finally quit on me.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this new purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B 4000 has much more power than my old toothbrush and gives a deeper clean.  My teeth feel cleaner after using this brush, and though I still need to floss I can tell that this brush is doing a more thorough job of cleaning between my teeth. My teeth look whiter and my gums look healthier. I also think the design helps me do a better job of cleaning my back teeth--my jaw is small and there&#x27;s not a lot of space around my back molars.  This brush helps me clean the back teeth very easily, though.  I&#x27;ve found the beeps that help you time your brushing are very helpful, and I like having the ability to switch modes.  One charge lasts better than a week--nice if you&#x27;re taking this on trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few minor cons--this brush is heavier than the old one I was using.  Not so much that I didn&#x27;t get used to it quickly, but enough that I noticed.  It&#x27;s got more power, but it&#x27;s also louder.  I also think the pressure indicator is a little awkwardly placed.  I&#x27;ve seen it--I think--when I&#x27;ve triggered it most of the time, but the location makes me wonder if I&#x27;m missing it sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only feature the 5000 has that this brush doesn&#x27;t is the wireless display screen.  I&#x27;m not sure what that does, but after using this model I can&#x27;t see the screen being necessary. I&#x27;m very pleased with this toothbrush and hope that it lasts as long as my previous Oral-B toothbrush did.</li>
            <li> Unbeatable! The next best thing to going to your dental hygenist daily.  I have been using the same one for 10 years, never needed to buy a new one.  I switch the brush out every 3 months or so.  I can still remember the epic difference between my regular toothbrush and this. a small amount of toothpaste does a great job. Worth Every Penney, do yourself a favor and get one today.</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel very smooth after ever session with the Oral-B Professional Care products. The question is which one to get? If you have sensitive gums, then I recommend the more expensive versions (3000 or higher) since they have sensitivity settings.  If you are sharing the device with others in your household who may not have the same gum sensitivity as yourself, again, I recommend version 3000 or higher since you may not fully understand others&#x27; sensitivity levels.  Plus the 3000 model (or higher) comes with a covered container for holding multiple brushes which will prevent the family from misplacing or swapping the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush and now the 4000. I was perfectly happy with the 1000, but I had the opportunity to acquire the 4000 so I thought why not? The 4000 though gives you different modes as well as a easily seen red light letting you know if you are pushing too hard. I didn&#x27;t really need these bells and whistles, but they don&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;ve always thought that if this kind of tooth brush was painful then I either need to stop pushing so hard or buy softer heads.  That&#x27;s just me, but I know others prefer having the feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard for me to spend $100 plus on a toothbrush, so if money is a concern, I recommend the 1000 or the 3000. I don&#x27;t really need those extra feedback lights, and often I have to change the 4000 to polish mode to get it to behave more like the 1000 (which is ideally what I want).  Note for me that the grip of the 1000/3000 feels better in the hand as well due to its smaller size compared to the 4000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I further recommend you order at least two different kinds of heads so you can figure out the style you like. The 4000 does come with one head, and this is the type that integrates some sort of rubber/plastic in addition to having bristles (e.g., FlossAction). I think I prefer the heads that are made up of only traditional bristles but heads with the added plastic do seem to polish more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you get Braun or Phillips, do your teeth a favor and get a power toothbrush. Once you use these power toothbrushes, you&#x27;ll never want to go back to the manual way.</li>
            <li> I have had the earlier version of this Braun electric toothbrush for ten years. I have been pleased with the old one, and was happy to have the chance to get this newer version of this trusted tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, both the old and new model do an exceptional job of cleaning your teeth. The small oscillating brush reaches those tough to get to problem areas like behind your rear teeth, and the inward side of all your teeth. Particularly, it really gets the back side of the front teeth clean, all the way to the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle recharges by simply parking it in the base unit when not in use. There is nothing to plug in, it is inductively coupled, so just setting it on the base unit keeps it charged up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several things I like better about this unit, compared to the old one I have. The charging base has been redesigned, and looks nicer and more streamlined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not like as well about this one compared to the old one is that this new unit is louder than the old one. The old Braun unit was very quiet, and just had a pleasant humming sound. This is much more of a loud buzz. The reason I only gave this one four stars is because of the noise level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel this unit is well worth the money, and does an exceptional job of keeping all areas of your teeth clean. The little toothbrushes that fit on the unit last a long time, so the set up represents an excellent value overall.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome. It&#x27;s ergonomic, nice feeling in the hand. I like the intensity of the brushing (not TOO much and a red light flashes when it senses you are applying too much pressure). There are three different settings but I haven&#x27;t really used anything other than the main one. I had some coffee staining on my top 2 front teeth that I thought wouldn&#x27;t go away and in about 4 days they are significantly faded. The charger holder is a big flimsy but that&#x27;s not much of a concern for me. The travel case worked fine on an overnight trip--just popped out the brush part of the toothbrush and was able to store and fit everything easily. Overall this is a great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This is so small, that at first I thought I had received a battery operated unit by mistake!  The cord attachment was sort of hidden in the box, so I was relieved!  It has plenty of power, and the timer is wonderful!  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know how well it lasts....</li>
            <li> I noticed that the battery in the Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush I&#x27;ve had for two years seems to be wearing down as it will start laboring even before the battery icon starts to blink, indicating it needs to be charged.  So, I decided to order a new one before my old one dies completely.  This is a little different as a red light blinks when you turn it on/off if the battery needs to be recharged.  However, it surprised me because when the  red light started blinking, the brushing was as vigorous as when I had just charged it.  My purchase also qualified for a rebate so am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST TO ALERT PEOPLE WHO SEND FOR THE REBATE - My order came in a brown cardboard box with a large adhesive label with the UPC code - I cut that off (in the bottom left-hand corner of the rebate form, it does say to do that) and sent it in with the rebate form and my invoice - all of that was returned to me with a form letter that stated that the UPC I submitted was \\&quot;not valid\\&quot; for the rebate offer!  I e-mailed Amazon and they were very nice and credited my card with the $20.  I don&#x27;t understand what is wrong with the Oral-B people that they are saying I submitted an invalid UPC since that was the only thing on the box!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months now and I don&#x27;t know how I was brushing my teeth without it! This electric toothbrush hands down provides the best teeth cleaning and polish outside of the dentists office. Once you go with an electric tootbrush, you cant go back. This tooth brush will remind you when to move on to the next section of teeth and will let you know when your 2 mins is up.They&#x27;ve really thought of everything on this. This is a must buy for your dental hygiene.  4.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Really Cleans (fresh from the dentist clean)&lt;br /&gt;*Fast (2 mins is all you need)&lt;br /&gt;*30 second minder for moving to other sections of your teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Initial Charge takes a while (10 hours +)&lt;br /&gt;*Need to charge frequently</li>
            <li> I bought this and was surprised when my teeth hurt after just one brushing. I tried it out for a few more days and they got worse. I had to stop using it. I sent it back as it was guaranteed, but never got my money back. If you want to try it, get it at a store so you can take it back if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> The specs are there for you to see, and I&#x27;ll just say that the Oral-B Smartseries 4000 lives up to each of them. I have been using the 4000 for a couple months now and have found it to work just as good (if not even slightly better) than the [[ASIN:B00132FUNG Water Pik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush]] I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bells and whistles are nice; timers during brushing and also a warning if you&#x27;re brushing too hard. What I really care about, though, is how clean my teeth feel and look after regular brushing. In that respect, the Smartseries 4000 performs with the best of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement heads aren&#x27;t cheap. In fact, they&#x27;re slightly more expensive than the Sensonic replacement heads I used previously. Still, the brush performs up to my expectations, so the clean teeth and feeling are worth the price. Overall, I can definitely recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush worked well, charged easily, didn&#x27;t take up too much space in the bathroom. Brushing was as effective as with an ordinary toothbrush. The timed beeping system to organize brushing in the four quadrants of the mouth was a nice touch. However, despite the claim that it&#x27;s \\&quot;gentle on teeth and gums,\\&quot; I found brushing with it unpleasant. Not outright painful, just weird. This continued to be the case even on the special setting for those with sensitive teeth, and even after I allowed time to adjust to the sensation. So buyers whose teeth are touchy or who react badly to pressure within the mouth area may want to seek a different model, or perhaps stick to traditional brushing. Otherwise, this is a solid purchase.</li>
            <li> Product is good, easy to use, good quality, compact. The advertised $20 rebate however is a complete scam, i cut out all the UPC codes, including the shipping box one and sent all 5 to Oral B. Got a form letter stating I didn&#x27;t provide original UPC barcodes. So don&#x27;t get sucked in to a rebate, they don&#x27;t honor it.</li>
            <li> Makes your brushing easy and it feels soothing. It can reach back of your mouth easily as well as inside and outside. It has a nice timer which beeps every 30 second for you to switch to different points or quadrants and cleaning the brushhead is easy too. There is a nice base to store your brushhead. It will make your life easy when you feel lazy to brush especially after a long day. It has four modes for brushing which helps in adjusting for people with sensitivity. Make sure you remember to charge. I felt my mouth clean and fresh a little different than brushing manually.</li>
            <li> I found the Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Rechargeable Toothbrush to be very comfortable in my hand, not too heavy, and very easy to manipulate in my mouth.  I also liked the various settings and often used the \\&quot;Daily Clean\\&quot; setting in which the toothbrush stops and beeps so that you get the proper amount of brushing in all 4 quadrants of your mouth.  As I have sensitive teeth, I also liked it that the toothbrush has a pressure sensor in order to keep me from over brushing.  My old toothbrush was the  [[ASIN:B003UKM9CO Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush]] and the Smartseries 4000 obviously has many more options and advantages over this brush - but is also almost twice as expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great toothbrush, should $100 be within your budget to spend.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, arrived as described and works great.  Been using it for over two weeks and so far it has been perfect.  The price was much better than in local stores too...</li>
            <li> Just bought the Oral B electric tooth brush from Costco.  When I opened the box, there were two tooth brush units and three heads. I was looking for the tooth brush head holder, but there was none in the box.  I called Oral B and the lady said they are not included with a lot of models and you have to purchase them separately for $8.99 + shipping.  Now, we have 4 people in the family, so what do I do with the extra heads?  The last Sonicare tooth brush I bought had a brush holder that fit 4 heads and there were plastic caps that you put over the brissels for sanitary reasons.  Guess I&#x27;ll just use these brushes for a month or so and then take them back for a return and let P&amp;G eat them.  Costco has a great return policy and they stick it to the manufacture.  Wake up P&amp;G, it&#x27;s just a molded plastic that costs you maybe $.5 to make and you want us consumers to pay an exorbitant amount so our families will have a more santitized enviroment.  Hope one of their exec&#x27;s see this rant and does something about it.</li>
            <li> This is just a note that Oral-B did not honor my rebate.&lt;br /&gt;I sent in the bar code sticker on the box and they sent me a letter back saying I didn&#x27;t send in the proper UPC.  Well they have my bar code so there isn&#x27;t much I can do about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Factor into your pricing decision that Oral-B might not honor the frustration free packaging bar code; maybe a new guy was working on mine.</li>
            <li> Never have I looked back to brushing the old way once this baby came into my life.  Hygienist says she could tell a big difference too.  Case seemed weird, so I pitched it.  But everything else rocks.</li>
            <li> First the good things. It works. In fact, I found the battery life to be outstanding. I took the toothbrush on a 12 day trip and it lasted that long despite only being rated for 10 days. It cleans your teeth pretty well. I also like the pressure indicator that lets you know if you&#x27;re pushing too hard. Because it&#x27;s fully functional, I don&#x27;t feel like I can give it less than 3 stars. But here&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t get more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the brush cycle. I&#x27;ve used other electric toothbrushes that also have the concept of a brush cycle, a beep, series of beeps, difference in the brush, whatever, that informs you to switch to a different area of your mouth. This toothbrush has that too and it works. Then it keeps working. The others I&#x27;ve used ran through the full cycle then turned off. This one, just kept going. You have to manually switch it off before it will stop. It&#x27;s not a big deal since I know what part of my teeth I&#x27;m brushing, but it&#x27;s part of the general  behavior that I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, drool. Again, I&#x27;ve used other tooth brushes and I know that you have to maintain a good seal or you&#x27;ll spray things everywhere and/or drool all over your chest. But with this brush, I was getting drool despite maintaining a good seal. I was very careful and always was leaking. Why exactly? I&#x27;m not sure, but I attribute it somehow to the shape or action or ergonomics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the easiest to fix, I think the brush is way to strong. If I were to continue using this, I&#x27;d need a softer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might just be me, but I&#x27;m just not crazy about it even though it works adequately.</li>
            <li> My dentist had been urging me to replace my Sonicare with this Oral-B model, so I&lt;br /&gt;finally did.  It is so different, heavier, larger that I am not comfortable with it yet.&lt;br /&gt;Feels like I am beating up my mouth although my teeth do feel very clean after.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t rave about it at this point!</li>
            <li> This is a decent toothbrush. It&#x27;s on par with my Sonicare, but cost 50% more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main warning I&#x27;d like possible consumers to know is Oral B rebate offers are difficult at best and maybe a scam. This item offered a mail in rebate, which I completed thoroughly, knowing how these things work. I got a letter saying the rebate wasn&#x27;t for the toothbrush I purchased. Which is odd, because the rebate offer and PDF documentation for the toothbrush was on its Amazon product page. It had a \\&quot;this item is eligible for\\&quot; promotion drop down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, with the rebate it might have been worth it, without it, it certainly wasn&#x27;t. I will likely not purchase another Oral B toothbrush based on my experience.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush of this caliber and I must say I can really notice the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone else has already covered the specs, so I will just say that after using this toothbrush twice daily, every day, my teeth now have the \\&quot;professionally cleaned\\&quot; feeling every day. Love that feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a good amount of scrub, but doesn&#x27;t come on too strong, it cleans out all the cracks and crevices quickly and efficiently. I never really thought much about brushing my teeth in general, but now I actually look forward to that perfectly fresh and clean feeling after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and have already recommended it to a few friends looking for a new electric brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush with the hope of sharpening my teeth akin to Christopher Walken in Sleepy Hollow.  Instead what I got was a nice bright, white smile.  Whatever.</li>
            <li> I had an older oral b electric toothbrush (5000 model) that lasted me a good few years. The battery in it started dying after a few brushes and the toothbrush was looking old so I thought it was time to get a new one. I purchased the 4000 model because I didn&#x27;t really need the timer of the 5000 model and it looked very similar. It&#x27;s not as great though. I don&#x27;t know if I just have a defective one or what but the &amp;#34;brushing too hard&amp;#34; red light is constantly going off when the tooth brush is on, even when it&#x27;s not in my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the rebate, I don&#x27;t buy things just because there is a good deal going on but if I happen to find a deal for something I&#x27;m planning to buy, I will normally use it. I purchased this item which came in the Amazon Frustration-Free packaging. Sent in the rebate form, receipt, and the original UPC bar code (just like the rebate form showed), and I too got a letter stating they have not received the UPC code and to send it in.</li>
            <li> I had been curious about electric toothbrushes for awhile now, but had never purchased one... mostly due to the cost. I simply wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth it or not. Well, I got this one and I can definitely tell you that it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;m at the point now, where I want to buy one for everyone in my family! I tend to get tooth sensitivity, bleeding gums, plaque buildup, etc, you know the drill. I figured that was something that I had to live with. The first time I used this, I didn&#x27;t think I liked it. The vibrations were kind of rattling my skull and toothpaste was flying everywhere... by the third time I was completely adjusted to the device and no longer having that problem, but be prepared if you&#x27;ve never used one.  What impressed me was how CLEAN my teeth were.  My teeth were like glass, this thing can remove plaque buildup after a couple uses that I thought only the dentist could get. Also, using this on your tongue gets stuff out that is pretty nasty but also liberating. Your mouth is just so clean afterwards.  The other thing I wasn&#x27;t prepared for, is that it whitens your teeth. I have custom whitening trays from the dentist, and I was about due to use them (I use them once a year), when I got this toothbrush. Now I feel like I can hold off, because I have noticed visible whitening. That&#x27;s something I wasn&#x27;t prepared for.  My husband is jealous, he wants one of these too now. I suppose I should get him one. All in all, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Long ago I went with Sonicare at my dentist&#x27;s suggestion.  Got this Oral B and have to say it is giving my Sonicare a run for the money.  I like the feel of it.  I like the red light that flashes when you are applying too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 30 second alert is similar in both units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I really like is that this brush keeps on going once you reach the two minute mark.  The Sonicare stops.  So if I want to spend a few more seconds on a couple of back teeth just to make sure I don&#x27;t have to turn this on again.  I just continue.  I like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They probably do a similar job in cleaning.  Over the years I have benefitted from using this type of brush.  One plus is that you need to do the 2 minute cleaning.  Of course you can do a quick one or a more thorough one, but the normal default cleaning is two minutes.  It works and it feels good to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong and your teeth will thank you.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of all of Oral-B&#x27;s rechargeable toothbrushes. It&#x27;s great to see different models accommodating different budgets. All of them do a great job and is way better than normal brushing alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently have the Oral-B 1000 Professional Care and am very happy with it. When I got the 4000, I wondered if there would be a true difference between these two models. Does it really make a difference when cleaning and is it worth the extra bucks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared both the 1000 and the 4000 using the same exact brush head. Both gave an excellent clean, but I will have to admit, the 4000 gave a squeak better clean especially in areas that the 1000 seems to have trouble with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4000 looks, feels, and acts like a expensive dental machine. It has a light that goes on to warn you when you&#x27;re using too much pressure. Every 15 seconds it will pause and do a *beep* (1, 2, 3, then 4 beeps) alerting you how close you&#x27;re getting to the 2 minute mark. It also has different modes: Daily Clean, Sensitive, Whitening, Deep Clean. Daily Clean has been the only one we&#x27;ve really used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Th flossing brush head action works nicely. Not only do I feel it massaging my gums (which is something my hygienist recommends I do), I noticed that it also cut down much of the debris removed when I floss afterwards. It&#x27;s doing something right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other good things about the 4000 model is that it comes with a handy case for traveling and the stand has a storage rack to hold several toothbrush heads. This is a handy feature for either family use or keeping different style heads on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4000 is indeed the luxurious creme-de-la-creme of Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Is it worth the extra dollars? Yes, I think so. Everything on 4000 model is upgraded from the 1000 model with extra features added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only potential drawback to buying any of the Oral B electric toothbrushes is the price of the replacement heads. The brush heads do a marvelous job, but they are not cheap.a marvelous job, but they are not cheap.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this electric toothbrush.  Every 30 seconds it beeps so you know you should move to a different quadrant of your mouth.  It has multiple settings from soft to hard, and a setting for &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34;.  My only negative comment is that you can&#x27;t really see the different settings while you are brushing.  You either have to memorize how many times to press the button to move to a different setting, or turn it off to look at the settings on the handle.  If you look while you are brushing, the paste splatters everywhere.  Minor annoyance.  5 stars because it does an excellent job cleaning teeth.</li>
