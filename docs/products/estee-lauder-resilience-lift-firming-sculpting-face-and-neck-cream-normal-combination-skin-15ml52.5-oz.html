            <li>Now, I just opened my fourth container and it is not the same and is filled with something else...</li>
            <li>It CLEARLY states you are receiving five bottles not one.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>sizes that generally come with the &amp;#34;free gift&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I read the description and was clear that I would be receiving a number of the smaller .5 oz jars.  </li>
            <li>Ordered the five sample jars which equals the large jar at half the price.</li>

            <li> Harsh everyday on winter skin, need to alternate with moisturizing version.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. Although I&#x27;m just 24, I&#x27;ve got dark circles under my eyes from lack of sleep due to working 24/7. I haven&#x27;t found a cream that fixes up my baggy/dark eyes better than this one. I bought this originally at Ulta, and was so nervous about how this would work for me because it&#x27;s so absolutely expensive. BUT I love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years. It&#x27;s nearly perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking I was getting the large jar and it turned out to be 5 small jars.  You have to look very, very closely to see that it isn&#x27;t one large jar.  Clearly, they intended to deceive the customer or the photo would have shown 5 small jars.  It also seems to have been shipped from somewhere outside the US, even though the return address is PA.  The box has words covering the back that seem to be in Chinese.</li>
            <li> Awesome product my skin looks great</li>
            <li> always primo....i cant get it too often in my city and amazon is at least 20% less expensive</li>
            <li> Best night cream ever!</li>
            <li> Although it came in 5 different containers the product was still the same.  I love love love this lotion and hope I can continue to afford to use it for a very long time.  It makes my skin feel so nice.  This was a very economical way to get this product.</li>
            <li> I meant to say how great this cream is for my 85 year old skin.</li>
            <li> This is a excellent product. I&#x27;ve used it for years. I get a much better price from Amazon. A 2.5. Bottle last me almost a year. When I first started using it people asked what had I done the change in my skin was noticeable. I&#x27;m Almost 60 and people much younger than me think Im younger than them. Love este lauder</li>
            <li> Came on time but it did not smell the same and color and texture are different. Very unlikely to purchase online again. Would like to return but may not be worth the hassle to return.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Prompt return when had inquiry. It CLEARLY states you are receiving five bottles not one. (previous reviewer shouldn&#x27;t have been confused.) medium size bottles. Same amount as FULL SIZE for half the price!!! Extremely cheap. They also put a little sample perfume as a gift. Wow. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> used it for years and love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love Estee Lauder Resilience Lift! It makes my skin soft and smooth, and even-toned. I simply can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother-in-law....she used it in the past and loved how it works....It is a bit expensive but I guess if it works....</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product for my mom and I believe she has gotten great results because she keeps asking me to order it for her.  I know that she likes its moisturizing qualities and non-greasy-ness (sorry I know that&#x27;s not a word).  I have to say though that I don&#x27;t know how much of the results are from the Estee Lauder cream and how much is plain genetics. My mom has always startled people with her true age for as long as I can remember. She is currently in her late 60&#x27;s and younger men (under 40) still hit on her all the time. I myself get carded on a regular basis (I&#x27;m 42) and people think she&#x27;s my sister all the time. Please know I&#x27;m not trying to brag at all just trying put the cream&#x27;s abilities in perspective for others. It does have a great texture and feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> Good product...would order again.</li>
            <li> These were sample size jars which amounted to a total of 2.5 ounces, the size of one, which I thought I was purchasing....a little misleading</li>
            <li> Great product and good price</li>
            <li> You may get a couple that are actually Resilience Lift, but only 3 of the 5 that I received appeared to be resilience lift.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this at the end of July, 2014.  I got my 5 small &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; sizes that generally come with the &amp;#34;free gift&amp;#34; that Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder runs a couple time of year.  I opened the first one and was pleased that I got a deal as it was the same consistency, color, smell of the product I buy at Macy&#x27;s.  Again, upon opening my second and third container, all was well.  Now, I just opened my fourth container and it is not the same and is filled with something else... different smell, consistency and color.  I opened my fifth container to also find that it is not resilience lift either and is a different smell, consitency from my fourth container.  What a dissappointment.</li>
            <li> Best cream ever.  Ordered the five sample jars which equals the large jar at half the price.</li>
            <li> Did not appear to be the real thing compared to original product we have.</li>
            <li> Amazing wrinkle, tone cream ever</li>
            <li> Its a good item. However I asked for the larger one. You sent me five small.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!  Makes my foundation go on flawlessly; not too greasy, firms up my &amp;#34;fine lines,&amp;#34; is the best moisturizer Estee Lauder makes!</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I&#x27;m not sure how some people thought they would be receiving larger jars of this product.  I read the description and was clear that I would be receiving a number of the smaller .5 oz jars.  I received exactly what I ordered in a very speedy manner.  I&#x27;ve used Estee Lauder Resilience Lift for decades and that is exactly what I received.  This is a Great Amazon Seller!!  Thank you for your speedy shipping, speedy response and pleasant interactions!!</li>
            <li> The company mis represented the size and contents of the product.</li>
            <li> Really makes a positive difference to the tone and texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> What a deal. Little jars of the best face cream. Great for travel. I&#x27;m 100 and look 75 because I&#x27;ve used this cream for decades. Just kidding. It is great, though.</li>
            <li> My Estée Lauder Resilience arrived in a timely manner and it is perfect!  It is five .5 oz. jars which equals one 2.5 oz. jar.  This has caused confusion with some customers but I found it well stated.  Resilience Lift is a wonderful product which makes the skin feel youthful.  I have used it for years and will continue to use the product and this vendor for a nice cost saving.</li>
            <li> If you thought you were getting a good deal on a full sized jar of this moisturizer, you are mistaken. It is 6 jars of the gift with purchase .5oz jars. Yeah it equals out to be the same amount, but they mislead you into thinking you are getting the bigger jar. I am keeping it because I don&#x27;t want to waste my time returning it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than half a year. Nothing compares to it. It does worth every cent of it. It makes my skin very smooth and relaxed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for years and didn&#x27;t use it much as it was a sample...then one day I ran out of my normal moisturizer and started using it.  I absolutely love this stuff.  Its my go to moisturizer now.!</li>
            <li> needs time to see results</li>
