            <li> If you are observant you will notice that the heading for this product says it is 3/4 inch (unless this changes at some point), but the details say it is 1 inch. I was not that observant and ordered it thinking it was 3/4 inch. It was not. I returned it without trying it. I give it 3 stars because I have to give it something.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. This flat iron does wonders for my hair. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Great buy! I bought as a gift for someone. I purchased as a gift for a birthday per they request for the item. I seem to be fond on the product.</li>
            <li> i really like this iron but it has a thick handle which is harder to grip and i have dropped it on several occasions almost burning myself.</li>
            <li> I immediately returned this flat iron. The description says 3/4 inch. It&#x27;s really 1 inch. I&#x27;m confused by the misleading and incorrect description.</li>
            <li> I do hair professionally and I love this flat iron.And the price is good Thanks Laila Ali</li>
            <li> Did not last long heating element went out after 10 uses! Sorry not worth it... Look for something else.. smh</li>
            <li> Love this! Straightener works in minutes and leaves my hair so soft and smooth, I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this expected it to be awesome which it is. I will be buying more of this line of hair care products.</li>
            <li> the flatiron is good! i like everything about it, exept for the fact of how i had to re straighten alot of peices of hair a few times, but it gets the job done, i just wish it was not so time consuming.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and warm up very quickly. Convenient to carry on travel for performance. A nice product!</li>
            <li> It works. Wish it got the hair a little smoother. I got this for 17.00$ on a lightening deal so I shouldn&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I say &amp;#34;reportedly&amp;#34; because I bought this for my daughter.  She has used it for several months and it is holding up just fine.  A good straightener for a modest price.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent flat iron. Serves it purpose.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this flat iron ! It heats very quickly and is great for curling and straightening hair !</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great!!! I have used a lot of flat irons in my 15 years of hair styling.  With this tool you can get close to the root and create flawless curls.  The housing of the plates don&#x27;t have a ridge that create a crease in the weft of hair you&#x27;re ironing.  The settings and automatic shut off are great also.</li>
