            <li>I would recommend this to friends however they should package the product way better.</li>

            <li>These inks and way better</li>
            <li>I will for sure buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li>Thicker means more Glycerin.</li>
            <li>This can be used on top of colors to keep them from drying out.</li>
            <li>Add just a drop or 2 of \\&quot; Bill&#x27;s Miracle Water \\&quot; on top of each color.</li>
            <li>just add some witch hazel or better yet \\&quot;</li>
            <li>This is why their are so many allergic reactions to some pigments REDS &amp; BLUES.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>hopefully it will stick better than PRIZM, MOMS, or the now defunked</li>
            <li>This ink is top notch.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and look great after healed.</li>
            <li>Great bold crisp colors might buy the rest of the colors and will buy more when I run out.</li>

            <li>Nice size bottles and vibrant colors!</li>
            <li>Very bright  intense colour, only inks better in my opinion are Intenze colours, but you cannot beat Starbrites for value</li>
            <li>Items are accurate in description.</li>
            <li>but do realize that it is not intenze ink, but the colors are nice they dont fade much.</li>
            <li>information on how tattoo ink is made below &amp; advanced techniques.</li>
            <li>They go in the skin smooth &amp; hold up well.</li>
            <li>* - coat skin with a \\&quot;light coat\\&quot; of A&amp;D ointment.</li>
            <li>then place powder in shaker &amp; dust lightly over skin.</li>
            <li>then place powder in shaker &amp; dust lightly over skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i got this ink thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Advantages - Popping Bright Colors, since its an Acrylic (ie) like automotive paint it will generally hold up well.</li>

            <li>The black is very good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s self for special effects on tattoo areas a</li>
            <li>Let Cool &amp; bottle.</li>
            <li>Holds color and bold outline.</li>
            <li>The ink came quick.</li>
            <li>Two tattoos down and came out great.</li>
            <li>First off there is No FDA approved ink!</li>
            <li>Nice red</li>
            <li>Medical Grade Glycerin, Some people also add rose water this helps with redness as does witch-hazel.</li>
            <li>all the time, they are worth the money</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, plus it was shipped to me very quickly.</li>
            <li>This ink comes right out of the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can make your own Ink from Power Pigment: &amp; a carrier solution - I want to start with the different types of ink first.</li>

            <li>- You can make your own Ink from Power Pigment: &amp; a carrier solution - I want to start with the different types of ink first.</li>
            <li>They have been used a lot since I got them and the colors go in the skin easy, they are thick, and they stay bright after they heal.</li>
            <li>all the places down here in south Louisana use starbrite or eternal good ink cost money</li>
            <li>And for the price you can&#x27;t beat it came very fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very very pissed</li>
            <li>superfast shipping and item was exactly as described</li>
            <li>I just wish there would have been a Bright green, teal</li>
            <li>The only thing i dislike is that the packaging could be better.</li>
            <li>These were purchased for my son&#x27;s first tattooing kit and he uses them</li>
            <li>These inks are nice and vivid, deep colors.  </li>
            <li>each of these does: medical grade glycerin, thickens the mixture &amp; helps to keeps it moist &amp; helps deliver ink &amp; reduces bruising as well as reduces inflammation of the skin that causes scaliness, itching and rashes; rose water is a natural healer for the skin, helps prevent inflammation,anti-septic &amp; anti bacteria properties.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I do not know much about tattoos or the ink used to do them.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it just gets so much easier.</li>
            <li>Too much glycerin &amp; the Ink become oily.</li>
            <li>&amp; it just gets so much</li>
            <li>&amp; it just gets so much</li>
            <li>shipper ships fast.</li>
            <li>bit.&lt;br /&gt;The info that you are really wanting to learn from the review section?&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li>No broken bottles.</li>
            <li>that if far better than any Chinese ink.</li>
            <li>The glycerin keeps it thick &amp; moist, alcohol &amp; witch-hazel are also good to help with germ &amp; fungus prevention.</li>
            <li>Although, I am excited to try the red.</li>
            <li>also.&lt;br /&gt;Great set at a decent price with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Red does not stick as nice as you would want from a high end red, but if you beat it in long enough you will get it to stick for the most part.</li>
            <li>typically Witch-Hazel or Alcohol or even both plus Sterile Water or Distilled Water,Sterile Water is better IMO &amp; required in NY.</li>
            <li>(ie) dry no ink or water &amp; lightly go over area where the desired effect is to be placed.</li>
            <li>(ie) dry no ink or water &amp; lightly go over area where the desired effect is to be placed.</li>
            <li>No it means it has less alcohol &amp; more water &amp; mainly Glycerin that will keep it moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>We have used for years: Medical Grade  Sterile Water, Medical Grade Glycerin, Which-Hazel, medical grade rose water..  </li>
            <li>Do this on Practice Skin &amp; First several times before trying it on a client or friend.</li>

            <li>I also mixed the colors to create a medium purple using the same so called Royal Blue and Bright pink.</li>
            <li>still good my only thing was the white and blue turned lumpy, shook them up but was a little nervous to use still but the colors I did use were</li>
            <li>i ,ve been ordering these half ounce sets for a while,and i broke down and got me the big 1 oz bottles,starbrite goes along ways because most color are thick enough to cut with witch hazel,it goes in bright and stays bright,i love the ink,and another one grade down ink is immortal,its a couple dollars cheaper and oz,but</li>
            <li>(clear liquid floating on hardened pigment).&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>arrived early and delivered just as promised in ad here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional and tell you what, these inks are NOT.</li>
            <li>cuz I ended up with 2 yellows an no black.</li>
            <li>Next Practice this several times on Practice Skin First, once mastered</li>
            <li>Next Practice this several times on Practice Skin First, once mastered</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Eternal Ink and Mother&#x27;s Ink previously, and Starbrite is right at that level.  </li>
            <li>an blue, got to experiment with the white so not to shabby decent buy.</li>
            <li>As well as \\&quot; Bill&#x27;s Miracle Solution \\&quot; Makes a great cutting solution for Grey-</li>
            <li>Thin Inks more Water &amp; or Alcohol, &amp; or Witch-Hazel .  </li>
            <li>the seal wasn&#x27;t on securely and the lid wasn&#x27;t closed all the way so half of my royal blue leaked out.</li>
            <li>The tribal black in this order seems to be a dark purple unlike a more black</li>

            <li> First off there is No FDA approved ink!</li>
            <li> Nice red</li>
            <li> Medical Grade Glycerin, Some people also add rose water this helps with redness as does witch-hazel.</li>
            <li> all the time, they are worth the money</li>

            <li> These inks are nice and vivid, deep colors.  </li>
            <li> each of these does: medical grade glycerin, thickens the mixture &amp; helps to keeps it moist &amp; helps deliver ink &amp; reduces bruising as well as reduces inflammation of the skin that causes scaliness, itching and rashes; rose water is a natural healer for the skin, helps prevent inflammation,anti-septic &amp; anti bacteria properties.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I do not know much about tattoos or the ink used to do them.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> have always liked the results I get from this ink, not all colors are the best from this brand but most are solid bright colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Eternal Ink and Mother&#x27;s Ink previously, and Starbrite is right at that level.  I&#x27;m very happy with the tattoos that I&#x27;ve produced with this product, and the way the colors heal in the skin.  Good stuff.  All of the bottles came in tact with no leaks.  Some of the bottles had a factory seal, and others had an ink cup in them, but either way no leaks.  Just ordered another set of 25 colors.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best ink i have used and i have used them all so if your looking for good ink then look no further,HERE IT IS!!!!</li>
            <li> Great bold crisp colors might buy the rest of the colors and will buy more when I run out. thanks</li>

            <li> This ink goes into the skin very nicely. This is a great buy. I highly recommend, plus it was shipped to me very quickly.</li>
            <li> Small bottles but still good my only thing was the white and blue turned lumpy, shook them up but was a little nervous to use still but the colors I did use were very nice loved the pink an blue, got to experiment with the white so not to shabby decent buy.</li>
            <li> Star rite is the best ink to purchase for your tattooing experience. Items arrived as described great buy for the price</li>

            <li> ink flows well and stays as brite in the skin as it was in the bottle. arrived early and delivered just as promised in ad here. will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li> Color goes in good and easy to work with.  Colors stay bright for a good while.  Would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> 100% Authentic. Product is as described and a great price. Great product top of the line.  I would reccomend this item to others.</li>
            <li> Been using these for awhile now, nice bright pigment, non fading. The black is very good. Nice red also.&lt;br /&gt;Great set at a decent price with fast shipping. I would/will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this ink for my son who is in a tattoo artist internship.  He has been pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This ink is total s***! Every tattoo I&#x27;ve done with it has faded like crazy. I&#x27;m very very pissed I got this</li>
            <li> First quality ink that I have used in my tattooing career, and Starbrites have been excellent for any type and color of skin. Very bright  intense colour, only inks better in my opinion are Intenze colours, but you cannot beat Starbrites for value</li>
            <li> This starbrite ink i swear by. Holds color and bold outline. Issues somehow the black ink i received with this order had somehow dried out and became a paste. So otherwise the rest are great and still using to this day i did have to re-order my black and i went with the 1oz Jet black outline. The tribal black in this order seems to be a dark purple unlike a more black</li>
            <li> Love starbrite ink. Was a lil disappointed when I recieved the 7 pk cuz I ended up with 2 yellows an no black. Didnt bother sending it back for black tho.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this last week. The colors look great in the bottle and even when poured into the cups but when put in the skin are absolutely hideous! I haven&#x27;t tried them all and am afraid to! Just tried Starbrite&#x27;s so called &amp;#34;Royal Blue&amp;#34; and it came out an UGLY medium blue gray when inked into the skin. I also mixed the colors to create a medium purple using the same so called Royal Blue and Bright pink. Again, looked absolutely fantastic in the cup and like crap once in the skin. The colors separated and inked in all variantes. I&#x27;m a professional and tell you what, these inks are NOT. I really thought these were a good deal on price and quality. I&#x27;m very disappointed and surprised that this product has such high ratings, it doesn&#x27;t get mine.</li>
            <li> superfast shipping and item was exactly as described</li>
            <li> Great sealed quality products ALWAYS go with INKS MADE IN USA! I haven&#x27;t put them to use yet as I am waiting for other equipment before proceeding. These inks exp in 2016 so that is gives me enough time to put them to use. I just wish there would have been a Bright green, teal, purple those are some extra colors I must order soon. Oh yeah don&#x27;t forget to order Jet Black Outliner too!</li>
            <li> Nice size bottles and vibrant colors! I will also recommend this product to my fellow artists. Works like a charm even though it sounds thin in the bottle when shaken.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars because Starbrite is good quality ink. The only thing i dislike is that the packaging could be better. I received this product today opened it and seen that one of the ink leaked out the seal wasn&#x27;t on securely and the lid wasn&#x27;t closed all the way so half of my royal blue leaked out. I would recommend this to friends however they should package the product way better.</li>
            <li> No. Just go pay to get a tattoo done.</li>
            <li> this is good ink I&#x27;ll will have to to get more. Do y&#x27;all have anymore colors? I&#x27;m glad i got this ink thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Very nice pigments... easy to work with compared to others I have tried. I will definitely buy again when the time comes.</li>
            <li> This is a Great product got this for my son and he was pleased said just what he needed thanks so much .</li>
            <li> This ink comes right out of the skin. Dont even waste your time with it. THe ink will fade in a day</li>
            <li> Starbrite is great ink. Colors last blacks stay black.  I buy mums and starbrite nothing else. You get what you pay for when it comes to tattoo ink and most don&#x27;t find out until ink hits the skin.</li>
            <li> These inks are nice and vivid, deep colors.  Seems to be of good quality.  So far so good.  Two tattoos down and came out great.</li>
            <li> These inks and way better then anything I have used before, they arrived on time and all were sealed. They have been used a lot since I got them and the colors go in the skin easy, they are thick, and they stay bright after they heal. I will for sure buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li> These inks are solid but a bit overrated for the price, i was expecting a thicker smoother stick than these provide. They go in good they stick good, but they are not as bright as some of the more high end colors when healed. However for the price this is a fantastic deal and you get good ink that if far better than any Chinese ink. Red does not stick as nice as you would want from a high end red, but if you beat it in long enough you will get it to stick for the most part.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift.  I do not know much about tattoos or the ink used to do them.  The person that received it loved it.  He said it was very vivid ink and the best he has had yet.</li>
            <li> Star Brite Inks Nice Quality. Good Price Goes in the Skin well holds well. A great company. Always buy quality Tattoo inks.&lt;br /&gt;Educational information on how tattoo ink is made below &amp; advanced techniques. Star Brite Inks are in palette.  Star Brite Makes great Whites Yellows &amp; Greens. They go in the skin smooth &amp; hold up well. These Colors can be a problem for some Tattoo Artist. But Using Star-Brite, Eternal, Mom&#x27;s Can Change that for you. *  Bill *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  **  How Tattoo INK is Made.  **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tattoo Ink is Powder Pigment Plus a Carrier Solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Powder Pigment : Check out Alla-Prima ink- John Montgomery &amp; Joshua Carlton&#x27;s Company &amp; National Tattoo supply, They both carry Powder Pigment &amp; Ink. 2 ways to answer this Ink is typically drawing Ink, Like for outlining. &amp; pigment is Color. Also to me the proper way is Powder is the Pigment &amp; can be made into liquid Tattoo ink by a process. You need a Blender, to mix it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can make your own Ink from Power Pigment: &amp; a carrier solution - I want to start with the different types of ink first. Understand this &amp; it just gets so much easier. First off there is No FDA approved ink! Next Do not use distilled water for Ink. Its for car batteries. We have used for years: Medical Grade  Sterile Water, Medical Grade Glycerin, Which-Hazel, medical grade rose water..  a mixture of these.  \\&quot; Rubbing  Alcohol  is a no no, Glycerol Alcohol, you use the alcohol that is in Vodka ( gly pro) \\&quot;.  Tattoo Ink is not Ink it is a Power Pigment suspended in a carrier solution. The Carrier Solution does 4 things 1.) keeps the ink evenly mixed. 2.) Disinfects. 3.) Provides for even flow for distribution.  4.) Gives the ink its constancy, (ie) Thick, Thin . Thin Inks more Water &amp; or Alcohol, &amp; or Witch-Hazel .  Thicker means more Glycerin. Too much glycerin &amp; the Ink become oily. &amp; if you see a crystallization forming on the bottle after it is left out open. Typically it is the Alcohol drying out in the air just add some witch hazel &amp; your back in business. Now I have heard some say I left the cap out all night &amp; the ink is still wet. That means its the best. No it means it has less alcohol &amp; more water &amp; mainly Glycerin that will keep it moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Carrier solution: typically Witch-Hazel or Alcohol or even both plus Sterile Water or Distilled Water,Sterile Water is better IMO &amp; required in NY.

            <li> These were purchased for my son&#x27;s first tattooing kit and he uses them all the time, they are worth the money</li>
            <li> great color nice I highly recommend. Items are accurate in description. shipper ships fast. Inks are bright when finish tats heal I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t read these reviews hoping to learn how to use the product. If you ordered these, you should already know how to use them. If you don&#x27;t, go study a bit.&lt;br /&gt;The info that you are really wanting to learn from the review section?&lt;br /&gt;Yeah all good.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped out well before their expiration date (don&#x27;t have to worry about them expiring before I get the chance to use them).&lt;br /&gt;The bottles came &amp;#34;shrink wrapped&amp;#34; together, mailed in a bubble wrap &amp;#34;envelope&amp;#34;. No broken bottles. No spillage. They appear to be well mixed, not settled or separated (clear liquid floating on hardened pigment).&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I only gave it four stars is, it is what is. I haven&#x27;t used them yet (will probably do a separate review for the ink company its self. This is a review for ordering and shipping. Although, I am excited to try the red. hopefully it will stick better than PRIZM, MOMS, or the now defunked SuperiorInk.)&lt;br /&gt;But it got four stars for the fact that it was well packaged, came in good condition, the shipping was spot on (only took a couple days to get here), and was a good value.</li>
            <li> Am very happy with this product. The ink came quick. I have only used the blue and black so far and it looks great!</li>
            <li> Nice colors for practice</li>
            <li> just for practicing on fruit and not for human skin! Faded looking on skin.......</li>
            <li> These are the best ink&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever had used on me! Colors are super bright and look exceptional when healed! I do not have any &amp;#34;skincandy&amp;#34; tattoo&amp;#34;s to compare with but am very pleased with these!</li>
            <li> This ink is top notch. The colors stay vibrant bright and stay put. Good ink. It won&#x27;t let you down</li>
            <li> i ,ve been ordering these half ounce sets for a while,and i broke down and got me the big 1 oz bottles,starbrite goes along ways because most color are thick enough to cut with witch hazel,it goes in bright and stays bright,i love the ink,and another one grade down ink is immortal,its a couple dollars cheaper and oz,but it fairly good ink in most colors,but if you, got the money get starbrite like i said you can cut it mix it and its sterizied. crazy rick</li>
            <li> I like everything about this ink and my clients are very impressed with the colors and quality. I will not go to anyone else for ink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was amazing. Product was in my mailbox within a few days of placing the order. I rated 5 stars because I have no complaints!</li>
