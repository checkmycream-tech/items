            <li>The best soap for athletes or anyone who partakes in physical activity.</li>
            <li>Good soap and smells good but didn&#x27;t clear the skin condition as promoted.</li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>I feel this claim is both truthful and misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: What bothers me the most, is that the packaging warns that it \\&quot;may antidote homeopathic medication\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>For more information: http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love the way it lathers.  </li>
            <li>Great value and the bar lasts much longer than Dr. So&amp;so&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure that the soap cleared it up.  </li>
            <li>sure if this soap had anything to do with my Hyperlinear Palm Eczema</li>
            <li>Outstanding antibacterial properties.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Truthfully, I was a skeptic, but I am now a believer.</li>
            <li>addition, the soap sits better that way on soap saver.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a bit OCD :)</li>
            <li>Best soap I have ever used, its clearing up a skin problem I had over 25 years , some thing the Doctors was totally clueless about ,</li>
            <li>This worked better than any soap or cream her doctor or aesthetician recommended.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a fannow, too, said it worked better than the Cetaphil that his doctor recommended.</li>
            <li>With age and diabetes, I&#x27;ve become more susceptible to fungal skin infections and this has been</li>
            <li>I continue to love this soap, so does my husband 😊</li>
            <li>My man and I totally love this soap.</li>
            <li>Net Rush gives the best price</li>
            <li>So glad to find a anti fungal soap</li>
            <li>The best soap to use to prevent a rash from spreading or any thing thats make look like a rash especially ring worms.</li>

            <li>Although I&#x27;m not a wrestler.&lt;br /&gt;Although I have no issues that are mentioned here, this is the most healing and procective soap that I have found.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I went to the doctor, and after my copay, I ended up spending way more money than I would have buying 4 more bars of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Good smelling soap, keeps me clean and itch free.</li>
            <li>This product helped my daughter so much!!!!  </li>
            <li>I remember when I first bought this soap it was amazing but there seems to be an inconsistency in the tea tree oil or ingredients because sometimes it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Nice smell and feels clean but could not tell it did anything for my athletes foot.</li>
            <li>Good soap, makes you feel SUPER clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working great so far, don&#x27;t know what the end result will be.</li>
            <li>They can&#x27;t be another medicated soap available with better results.</li>
            <li>I use your soap on my feet and they look great and feel soft.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is a great natural resource, but it can be harmful.</li>
            <li>I bought the soap after reading all the good reviews and I know that tea tree oil can be very healing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really working but smells good.</li>
            <li>Even if you&#x27;re not a fighter or not in a gym everyday, this is a great product that leaves all of the GOOD bacteria on your skin without drying it out or adding chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Helps keep their skin clean and healthy</li>
            <li>Only thing good about it is that it smells nice.</li>
            <li>This soap smells so strong.</li>
            <li>The smell was strong with the tea tree</li>
            <li>This soap leaves you feeling very clean and has a clean scent.</li>
            <li>It makes you clean and feel clean!</li>
            <li>This soap lathers up nicely, has a pleasant smell and lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>It smells fine (light tea tree oil scent)</li>
            <li>my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>However, the soap is still fabulous because of it&#x27;s gentleness on skin with added anti-microbial activity.  </li>
            <li>The soap is great to shower up with after a workout, especially for wrestlers.</li>
            <li>Fantastic soap.  </li>
            <li>Great, kills jock itch when used daily.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this soap, it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>N can&#x27;t seem to keep you funky free.</li>
            <li>The soap rinses off easily and leaves a clean feeling without drying my skin.</li>
            <li>Effective yet gentle.  </li>
            <li>, I hope it will remain available.</li>
            <li>Great soap, especially when we travel</li>
            <li>So far so good at keeping the fungal away..</li>
            <li>that, but good so far.</li>
            <li>It takes away all bacteria and fungus as well as good smelling and making your skin soft.</li>
            <li>This soap is very useful in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell and if you find it to strong, the odor fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I mainly bought this because I grapple, and I wanted to avoid catching staph or ringworm....</li>
            <li>Very refreshing smell and makes myself, and most likely yourself feel invigorated, and clean after a morning shower.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good general family soap to keep in the shower.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;a significant help.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>So far, I am very pleased with this soap.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully because we keep clean mats but for the quality and price</li>
            <li>It lathers well and rinses completely clean.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, this soap doesn&#x27;t just claim to get you clean, and I feel the product artfully leads a consumers to believe the soap can do things that it can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>lathers up well and leaves me squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Smells clean.</li>
            <li>You skin is truley clean after using this soap.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin really clean.</li>
            <li>and I feel squeaky clean after showering.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap, smells great, natural and moisturizing too.</li>
            <li>Each bas lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be very effective with jock itch.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This is a great soap, the use of which is being advertised in a way too limited fashion.  </li>
            <li>Heard this was the best of the best for a multitude of skin issues, and within a few days of using this not only had it cleared up, it hasn&#x27;t come back since!</li>
            <li>I love this product so much and will continue to use it on my son, and myself, for maintenance.</li>
            <li>I play full contact sports and trade a lot of body sweat with others.</li>
            <li>disclaimer worries me a bit, but after searching the web it seems to be a CYA statement, more than a real worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>helped me out in my acne fight, also good for private parts</li>
            <li>I hope it keeps up the good work, I will definitely write an update after the summer-</li>
            <li>Dries your skin out a bit, funky mint petroleum smell, but not bad in any way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Irish with a very fair complexion and VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I get back acne a lot and this soap is the best thing i&#x27;ve found to manage my acne but not dry the hell out of my skin.</li>
            <li>fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The combination of these things took care of it quickly - in a week it seemed and voila~</li>
            <li>used for ring worm cleared it up quickly</li>
            <li>It is also recommended by many high level grapplers to help fight off skin infections.</li>
            <li>I was extremely hesitant to purchase this soap but after researching figured it would be a good fit.</li>
            <li>I first bought this for $25.50, this time i got it for $20.50, which basically means I got one bar free.</li>
            <li>Clean refreshing natural scent,</li>
            <li>Also, leaves my skin feeling very soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>This soap smells okay and has effective doses of natural ingredients known to keep gross ass s</li>
            <li>and I do think my skin has been more clear, without increasing the dryness.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Guys, this is absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li>Its absolutely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>that I always get it with no packing slips and it&#x27;s always in some kind of different bag.</li>
            <li>Natural oils provide a safe alternative antibacterial solution.  </li>
            <li>But you get what you pay for and it is worth</li>
            <li>It would be worth you buying this and keeping it on hand --just in case.  </li>
            <li>Had to go to dermatologist and he prescribed a powerful ointment and wearing gloves at night with the ointment.  </li>
            <li>really worth the price</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of that pure castile clean feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very clean 53 year old person</li>
            <li>very strong initially when used but doesn&#x27;t linger after use.  </li>
            <li>The antimicrobial activity is great for the feet in preventing the usual days end smell, and also for the groin in stabilizing the microbial balance.  </li>
            <li>so I make sure I use ALL of it before going on to the next bar, but it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Also a very reasonable price for a pack of five.</li>
            <li>Recommend the product very much.</li>
            <li>particularly like it since it&#x27;s simple and without trying to put everything in it, an unfortunately popular and counterproductive effort in products these days.  </li>
            <li>First time I tried this was a year ago from a health/workout online store and got hooked on these bars of soap from the get</li>
            <li>This is the first soap we have found that has averted another infection.</li>
            <li>I have ordered 5 more bars for the future.</li>
            <li>It last maybe a couple days more than a bar of dove for men.</li>
            <li>obviously any soap is better than no soap after training).</li>
            <li>It does not have a medicinal smell but really eliminates sweaty smells after the hardest workout - even on the feet!</li>
            <li>It serves the exact purpose for which it was purchased.</li>
            <li>My husband and son use this product, it works very well!</li>
            <li>gross. :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do any type of physical workouts as most people who use this do.</li>
            <li>good soap...leaves clean feeling...will dry out skin if you don&#x27;t moisturize daily...</li>
            <li>Did exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li>It really helps keep the mat funk away!</li>
            <li>If you know what this is, you know how I feel finding a product that made it go away during the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Exactly so advertised</li>
            <li>It is expensive and has a strong scent (you cant smell it once washed off) but it does a great job.</li>
            <li>and I feel very clean and refreshed after my daily shower.  </li>
            <li>Globulus leaf oil: Could not locate anything that showed scientific proof it does anything other than smell nice.</li>
            <li>I was worried that with lavender being an ingredient that it would be too feminine for gifts to the guys, but the smell is clean and pleasent and far from being flowery.</li>
            <li>and it is gentle enough for a baby&#x27;s skin or sensitive skin as well so if you want natural and gentle good smelling and fresh</li>
            <li>In the warm months i have a tendency to perspire aound my bra area, this soap keeps down any breakouts.</li>
            <li>i like that it feels soft and lathers quickly time</li>
            <li>I love this soap and recommend it to anyone who is active or looking for something more than your regular deodorant soap.</li>
            <li>and I have a strong personal hygiene.  </li>
            <li>seems to work for certain fungal rashed</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t bad either, actually kind of pleasant.</li>
            <li>If you are only using the soap, it will probably be fine.  </li>
            <li>I scrub my affected toes with the Fungi Soap and wash my whole foot with the Defense Bar.  </li>
            <li>They work hand in hand and they work together very well..</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>Would be 5 starts but one of the ingredients caused a rash on the soles of my feet making them very itchy.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really really is.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really curing all this and</li>
            <li>Like their barrier foam and wipes, I like the Defense products as a whole.  </li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this soap.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>but I needed relief fast.</li>
            <li>Oh, you know how you use the alovera (savila) on sun burns-----use the soap and alo combination for a fast heal.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent</li>
            <li>and it worked really well,</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Works very well, see vids on youtube.....</li>
            <li>I use this soap all the time now and really like how it foams.  </li>
            <li>is this for: People who have a real exposure to contact contagions like MRSA.</li>
            <li>much prefer square shape without any waste.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>There isnt much I can say about this that hasn&#x27;t already been said.</li>
            <li>Its very steep.</li>
            <li>Does it really matter?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully this soap will help someone else as it did so much for me.</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothiing to aid my condition.  </li>
            <li>therefore the whole family is making this change over.</li>
            <li>Even after an intense HIIT workout.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it really works.  </li>
            <li>but I practice good common sense hygiene care to begin with.</li>
            <li>and I like it better than any other dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Smells better than all other soaps in this category.</li>
            <li>Most other soaps mask body odor, this gets rid of it.</li>
            <li>I use this before and after class to make sure I do not get any staph or ringworm infections from the mats or other people.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many other things like dandruff shampoo and creams to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am very picky about smell and this product passed my high standard.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>I will never use another soap as long as this is available, and I will recommend it highly to anyone.</li>
            <li>I live in a climate that is very humid and my skin is always breaking out.</li>
            <li>I started using Defense soap in the shower and in the same time period I applied a drop of Oreganol Oil, Super Strength P73 1 oz.</li>
            <li>I have only used this soap a few times now, but it seems to be good.</li>
            <li>I had body odor issues, particularly in my underarms.</li>
            <li>One of my main problems since I was in high school was the problem with jotch itch</li>
            <li>questions remain regarding tea tree oil ingredient; if its really safe for youg boys to use.&lt;br /&gt;Research says use of the tea tree oil in boys before puberty could mess with the hormone and cause reversible gynecomastia (growth of breast tissue).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend adding this product to the travel bag of any athlete or weekend warriors.</li>
            <li>not for individuals with high blood pressure.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is the product that one needs---I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Gets you really clean as well as long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have three sons who all wrestle (elementary, middle and high school).  </li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff really works, and I work out a lot.</li>
            <li>Studies show that it can be somewhat useful against fungus and bacteria, actual effectiveness: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/</li>
            <li>Smells nice but it loses its scent after awhile.  </li>
            <li>but I definitely find it useful.</li>
            <li>I am sure it won&#x27;t last as long as garden variety bar soap, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that purpose.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry or itchy like most bar soap and actually leaves it softer than the Dove Sensitive Skin liquid I was using before!</li>
            <li>I was completely free of my white spots after the second bar of soap.</li>
            <li>The high school wrestling coach hands it out to all the wrestlers to use and no outbreaks so far.</li>
            <li>this stuff even helped clear up my face!</li>
            <li>I have only used one bar to date, and my rash is better, but I am also using other treatments</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a thing of the past :-)</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this soap, I bought 4 bars individually just to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>This soap has managed to keep me fresh all day long!</li>
            <li>/&gt;it doesn&#x27;t last as long as cheap soap, so maybe buy a case to store it in</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll dry out your skin a bit, but it&#x27;s definitely worth</li>
            <li>Really helps with acne and does not dry skin out</li>
            <li>so I use this only in certain places, e.g., under my arms, feet, etc.</li>
            <li>sign #1: On the packaging, instead of saying it actually helps with various skin related issues (fungal infections, dandruff, acne, dry skin), the packaging states you can &#x27;visit their website too see how it performs&#x27; against these things, along with a nice warning that they are prohibited from claiming the soap has anti-bacterial or anti-fungal properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some minor skin issues from time to time but clear up quickly and back to normal.</li>
            <li>I was concerned after reading the other reviews the soap would dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li>my pores are clear</li>
            <li>Since Defense, clear skin all around.</li>
            <li>It also helped clear up acne</li>
            <li>Using it to clear up ringworm.</li>
            <li>This soap is helpful as an anti-bacterial/anti-fungal to help clear up problem skin.</li>
            <li>My callous on my feet have disappeared and the feet are soft all the time now.  </li>
            <li>I have had tinea versicolor (sun spots) for years and tried this soap &amp; after about a month all the spots are completely gone.</li>
            <li>and if you want to go all natural</li>
            <li>I frequently would get ingrown hairs wherever rash guards and compression shorts came into contact with my skin.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I use this soap after BJJ class and so far no skin issues.</li>
            <li>and smells like old lady.</li>
            <li>The products stated purpose, and let me quote from the product description: \\&quot;These natural ingredients have been clinically proven to have antibacterial, antiviral and anti-fungal properties\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Who is this not for: People with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also use this if I have cuts or scrapes elsewhere to promote healing and provide antibacterial action.</li>
            <li>You can definitely smell the tea tree oil on this soap, but it didn&#x27;t really give me the results I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I gave a bar to friend whose young son was dealing with eczema.</li>
            <li>I use this to wash my hair as well and like that it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, unlike most common bar soap products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This defense soap has fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve completely switched to using Defense Soap all the time.</li>
            <li>There is nothing on the package that warns away people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Just as a warning though...if you are expecting your skin to feel &amp;#34;dove&amp;#34; soft...</li>
            <li>Nothing could quite get rid of it completely.</li>
            <li>so far, so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>....quite unexpectedly, the anti-fungal properties of this soap seem to have helped clear up an ongoing problem I&#x27;ve had with jock itch.  </li>
            <li>That may be because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>All natural stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know this is a sports soap, but I&#x27;ve been having problems with break-outs (adult onset acne).</li>
            <li>a person with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an MMA fighter and submission wrestler and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Good soap to clear troubled skin and keep it clear</li>
            <li>So sure enough, a few weeks after discontinuing the soap I contracted Staph on my hand.</li>
            <li>all the popular soaps like dial, irish spring, dove etc. would dry my skin out and not last very long.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel pretty dry</li>
            <li>Feels a little slimy but rinses completely clean</li>
            <li>My skin is less dry and feels and looks much better than before using Defense.  </li>
            <li>I have been using pure olive oil soaps from Mediterranean countries for long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the only thing stoping it from being 5 stars is the high price</li>
            <li>and of course the natural ingredients keep all the skin problems at bay from sports and in general.</li>
            <li>breakouts cause it seems to calm my skin down.</li>
            <li>Particularly the toilet seats-</li>
            <li>I would be fine during the entire day but would wake up in the middle of the night, sweating, sticking and itchy down in my jotch region.  </li>
            <li>This soap form was what I was looking for, I mean what is more convenient than to do something I already do an a regular basis.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth every penny</li>
            <li>If you use it early enough, it&#x27;ll knock-out staph and impetigo a majority of the time.</li>
            <li>and I barely ever remember I&#x27;m using it for jock itch.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s all natural is a big bonus.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like me, stay away from this bar soap or only use it once a week.</li>
            <li>Not recommended for people taking blood pressure meds as the oil extracts can apparently affect your meds.</li>
            <li>kind of expensive for soap</li>
            <li>Kind of weird but try it out.</li>
            <li>This leads to less itchiness in a hot climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The itching went away almost instantly and the next day the redness and swelling was almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>This soap cleans well and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>Seems to clear up minor skin rash/irritation quicker too.</li>
            <li>would recommend using this at least a month before seeing true results.</li>
            <li>In addition,it did not dry his skin out, which was a big concern, since he is a toddler.  </li>
            <li>I had a little rash from the heat or maybe from being around dogs all day, and it was very itchy and red.</li>

            <li> Good soap and smells good but didn&#x27;t clear the skin condition as promoted.</li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> I feel this claim is both truthful and misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : What bothers me the most, is that the packaging warns that it \\&quot;may antidote homeopathic medication\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> For more information: http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this soap</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> We all love it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to lotion up after each use.</li>
            <li> I love the way it lathers.  </li>
            <li> Great value and the bar lasts much longer than Dr. So&amp;so&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say for sure that the soap cleared it up.  </li>
            <li> sure if this soap had anything to do with my Hyperlinear Palm Eczema</li>
            <li> Outstanding antibacterial properties.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I was a skeptic, but I am now a believer.</li>
            <li> addition, the soap sits better that way on soap saver.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a bit OCD :)</li>
            <li> Best soap I have ever used, its clearing up a skin problem I had over 25 years , some thing the Doctors was totally clueless about ,</li>
            <li> This worked better than any soap or cream her doctor or aesthetician recommended.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a fannow, too, said it worked better than the Cetaphil that his doctor recommended.</li>
            <li> With age and diabetes, I&#x27;ve become more susceptible to fungal skin infections and this has been</li>
            <li> I continue to love this soap, so does my husband 😊</li>
            <li> My man and I totally love this soap.</li>
            <li> Net Rush gives the best price</li>
            <li> So glad to find a anti fungal soap</li>
            <li> The best soap to use to prevent a rash from spreading or any thing thats make look like a rash especially ring worms.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, I don&#x27;t love the price.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but I am okay with that.</li>
            <li> A lot of people complain about the smell, but I love the soap&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with jock itch for most of my life and tried every cream on the market and it never went away permenantly.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this soap.  </li>
            <li> The soap is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not a wrestler.&lt;br /&gt;Although I have no issues that are mentioned here, this is the most healing and procective soap that I have found.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I went to the doctor, and after my copay, I ended up spending way more money than I would have buying 4 more bars of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Good smelling soap, keeps me clean and itch free.</li>
            <li> This product helped my daughter so much!!!!  </li>
            <li> I remember when I first bought this soap it was amazing but there seems to be an inconsistency in the tea tree oil or ingredients because sometimes it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Nice smell and feels clean but could not tell it did anything for my athletes foot.</li>
            <li> Good soap, makes you feel SUPER clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working great so far, don&#x27;t know what the end result will be.</li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t be another medicated soap available with better results.</li>
            <li> I use your soap on my feet and they look great and feel soft.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is a great natural resource, but it can be harmful.</li>
            <li> I bought the soap after reading all the good reviews and I know that tea tree oil can be very healing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really working but smells good.</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re not a fighter or not in a gym everyday, this is a great product that leaves all of the GOOD bacteria on your skin without drying it out or adding chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Helps keep their skin clean and healthy</li>
            <li> Only thing good about it is that it smells nice.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so strong.</li>
            <li> The smell was strong with the tea tree</li>
            <li> This soap leaves you feeling very clean and has a clean scent.</li>
            <li> It makes you clean and feel clean!</li>
            <li> This soap lathers up nicely, has a pleasant smell and lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> It smells fine (light tea tree oil scent)</li>
            <li> my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> However, the soap is still fabulous because of it&#x27;s gentleness on skin with added anti-microbial activity.  </li>
            <li> The soap is great to shower up with after a workout, especially for wrestlers.</li>
            <li> Fantastic soap.  </li>
            <li> Great, kills jock itch when used daily.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this soap, it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> N can&#x27;t seem to keep you funky free.</li>
            <li> The soap rinses off easily and leaves a clean feeling without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> Effective yet gentle.  </li>
            <li> , I hope it will remain available.</li>
            <li> Great soap, especially when we travel</li>
            <li> So far so good at keeping the fungal away..</li>
            <li> that, but good so far.</li>
            <li> It takes away all bacteria and fungus as well as good smelling and making your skin soft.</li>
            <li> This soap is very useful in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell and if you find it to strong, the odor fades quickly.</li>
            <li> I mainly bought this because I grapple, and I wanted to avoid catching staph or ringworm....</li>
            <li> Very refreshing smell and makes myself, and most likely yourself feel invigorated, and clean after a morning shower.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good general family soap to keep in the shower.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;a significant help.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with this soap.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully because we keep clean mats but for the quality and price</li>
            <li> It lathers well and rinses completely clean.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, this soap doesn&#x27;t just claim to get you clean, and I feel the product artfully leads a consumers to believe the soap can do things that it can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> lathers up well and leaves me squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Smells clean.</li>
            <li> You skin is truley clean after using this soap.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin really clean.</li>
            <li> and I feel squeaky clean after showering.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, smells great, natural and moisturizing too.</li>
            <li> Each bas lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be very effective with jock itch.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> This is a great soap, the use of which is being advertised in a way too limited fashion.  </li>
            <li> Heard this was the best of the best for a multitude of skin issues, and within a few days of using this not only had it cleared up, it hasn&#x27;t come back since!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much and will continue to use it on my son, and myself, for maintenance.</li>
            <li> I play full contact sports and trade a lot of body sweat with others.</li>
            <li> disclaimer worries me a bit, but after searching the web it seems to be a CYA statement, more than a real worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> helped me out in my acne fight, also good for private parts</li>
            <li> I hope it keeps up the good work, I will definitely write an update after the summer-</li>
            <li> Dries your skin out a bit, funky mint petroleum smell, but not bad in any way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Irish with a very fair complexion and VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I get back acne a lot and this soap is the best thing i&#x27;ve found to manage my acne but not dry the hell out of my skin.</li>
            <li> fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> The combination of these things took care of it quickly - in a week it seemed and voila~</li>
            <li> used for ring worm cleared it up quickly</li>
            <li> It is also recommended by many high level grapplers to help fight off skin infections.</li>
            <li> I was extremely hesitant to purchase this soap but after researching figured it would be a good fit.</li>
            <li> I first bought this for $25.50, this time i got it for $20.50, which basically means I got one bar free.</li>
            <li> Clean refreshing natural scent,</li>
            <li> Also, leaves my skin feeling very soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> This soap smells okay and has effective doses of natural ingredients known to keep gross ass s</li>
            <li> and I do think my skin has been more clear, without increasing the dryness.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Guys, this is absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li> Its absolutely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> that I always get it with no packing slips and it&#x27;s always in some kind of different bag.</li>
            <li> Natural oils provide a safe alternative antibacterial solution.  </li>
            <li> But you get what you pay for and it is worth</li>
            <li> It would be worth you buying this and keeping it on hand --just in case.  </li>
            <li> Had to go to dermatologist and he prescribed a powerful ointment and wearing gloves at night with the ointment.  </li>
            <li> really worth the price</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of that pure castile clean feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very clean 53 year old person</li>
            <li> very strong initially when used but doesn&#x27;t linger after use.  </li>
            <li> The antimicrobial activity is great for the feet in preventing the usual days end smell, and also for the groin in stabilizing the microbial balance.  </li>
            <li> so I make sure I use ALL of it before going on to the next bar, but it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Also a very reasonable price for a pack of five.</li>
            <li> Recommend the product very much.</li>
            <li> particularly like it since it&#x27;s simple and without trying to put everything in it, an unfortunately popular and counterproductive effort in products these days.  </li>
            <li> First time I tried this was a year ago from a health/workout online store and got hooked on these bars of soap from the get</li>
            <li> This is the first soap we have found that has averted another infection.</li>
            <li> I have ordered 5 more bars for the future.</li>
            <li> It last maybe a couple days more than a bar of dove for men.</li>
            <li> obviously any soap is better than no soap after training).</li>
            <li> It does not have a medicinal smell but really eliminates sweaty smells after the hardest workout - even on the feet!</li>
            <li> It serves the exact purpose for which it was purchased.</li>
            <li> My husband and son use this product, it works very well!</li>
            <li> gross. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do any type of physical workouts as most people who use this do.</li>
            <li> good soap...leaves clean feeling...will dry out skin if you don&#x27;t moisturize daily...</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li> It really helps keep the mat funk away!</li>
            <li> If you know what this is, you know how I feel finding a product that made it go away during the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Exactly so advertised</li>
            <li> It is expensive and has a strong scent (you cant smell it once washed off) but it does a great job.</li>
            <li> and I feel very clean and refreshed after my daily shower.  </li>
            <li> Globulus leaf oil: Could not locate anything that showed scientific proof it does anything other than smell nice.</li>
            <li> I was worried that with lavender being an ingredient that it would be too feminine for gifts to the guys, but the smell is clean and pleasent and far from being flowery.</li>
            <li> and it is gentle enough for a baby&#x27;s skin or sensitive skin as well so if you want natural and gentle good smelling and fresh</li>
            <li> In the warm months i have a tendency to perspire aound my bra area, this soap keeps down any breakouts.</li>
            <li> i like that it feels soft and lathers quickly time</li>
            <li> I love this soap and recommend it to anyone who is active or looking for something more than your regular deodorant soap.</li>
            <li> and I have a strong personal hygiene.  </li>
            <li> seems to work for certain fungal rashed</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad either, actually kind of pleasant.</li>
            <li> If you are only using the soap, it will probably be fine.  </li>
            <li> I scrub my affected toes with the Fungi Soap and wash my whole foot with the Defense Bar.  </li>
            <li> They work hand in hand and they work together very well..</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> Would be 5 starts but one of the ingredients caused a rash on the soles of my feet making them very itchy.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really really is.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really curing all this and</li>
            <li> Like their barrier foam and wipes, I like the Defense products as a whole.  </li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this soap.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> but I needed relief fast.</li>
            <li> Oh, you know how you use the alovera (savila) on sun burns-----use the soap and alo combination for a fast heal.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent</li>
            <li> and it worked really well,</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Works very well, see vids on youtube.....</li>
            <li> I use this soap all the time now and really like how it foams.  </li>
            <li> is this for: People who have a real exposure to contact contagions like MRSA.</li>
            <li> much prefer square shape without any waste.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> There isnt much I can say about this that hasn&#x27;t already been said.</li>
            <li> Its very steep.</li>
            <li> Does it really matter?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully this soap will help someone else as it did so much for me.</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothiing to aid my condition.  </li>
            <li> therefore the whole family is making this change over.</li>
            <li> Even after an intense HIIT workout.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it really works.  </li>
            <li> but I practice good common sense hygiene care to begin with.</li>
            <li> and I like it better than any other dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Smells better than all other soaps in this category.</li>
            <li> Most other soaps mask body odor, this gets rid of it.</li>
            <li> I use this before and after class to make sure I do not get any staph or ringworm infections from the mats or other people.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many other things like dandruff shampoo and creams to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am very picky about smell and this product passed my high standard.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> I will never use another soap as long as this is available, and I will recommend it highly to anyone.</li>
            <li> I live in a climate that is very humid and my skin is always breaking out.</li>
            <li> I started using Defense soap in the shower and in the same time period I applied a drop of Oreganol Oil, Super Strength P73 1 oz.</li>
            <li> I have only used this soap a few times now, but it seems to be good.</li>
            <li> I had body odor issues, particularly in my underarms.</li>
            <li> One of my main problems since I was in high school was the problem with jotch itch</li>
            <li> questions remain regarding tea tree oil ingredient; if its really safe for youg boys to use.&lt;br /&gt;Research says use of the tea tree oil in boys before puberty could mess with the hormone and cause reversible gynecomastia (growth of breast tissue).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend adding this product to the travel bag of any athlete or weekend warriors.</li>
            <li> not for individuals with high blood pressure.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the product that one needs---I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Gets you really clean as well as long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have three sons who all wrestle (elementary, middle and high school).  </li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff really works, and I work out a lot.</li>
            <li> Studies show that it can be somewhat useful against fungus and bacteria, actual effectiveness: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/</li>
            <li> Smells nice but it loses its scent after awhile.  </li>
            <li> but I definitely find it useful.</li>
            <li> I am sure it won&#x27;t last as long as garden variety bar soap, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry or itchy like most bar soap and actually leaves it softer than the Dove Sensitive Skin liquid I was using before!</li>
            <li> I was completely free of my white spots after the second bar of soap.</li>
            <li> The high school wrestling coach hands it out to all the wrestlers to use and no outbreaks so far.</li>
            <li> this stuff even helped clear up my face!</li>
            <li> I have only used one bar to date, and my rash is better, but I am also using other treatments</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a thing of the past :-)</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this soap, I bought 4 bars individually just to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> This soap has managed to keep me fresh all day long!</li>
            <li> /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t last as long as cheap soap, so maybe buy a case to store it in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll dry out your skin a bit, but it&#x27;s definitely worth</li>
            <li> Really helps with acne and does not dry skin out</li>
            <li> so I use this only in certain places, e.g., under my arms, feet, etc.</li>
            <li> sign #1: On the packaging, instead of saying it actually helps with various skin related issues (fungal infections, dandruff, acne, dry skin), the packaging states you can &#x27;visit their website too see how it performs&#x27; against these things, along with a nice warning that they are prohibited from claiming the soap has anti-bacterial or anti-fungal properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some minor skin issues from time to time but clear up quickly and back to normal.</li>
            <li> I was concerned after reading the other reviews the soap would dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li> my pores are clear</li>
            <li> Since Defense, clear skin all around.</li>
            <li> It also helped clear up acne</li>
            <li> Using it to clear up ringworm.</li>
            <li> This soap is helpful as an anti-bacterial/anti-fungal to help clear up problem skin.</li>
            <li> My callous on my feet have disappeared and the feet are soft all the time now.  </li>
            <li> I have had tinea versicolor (sun spots) for years and tried this soap &amp; after about a month all the spots are completely gone.</li>
            <li> and if you want to go all natural</li>
            <li> I frequently would get ingrown hairs wherever rash guards and compression shorts came into contact with my skin.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I use this soap after BJJ class and so far no skin issues.</li>
            <li> and smells like old lady.</li>
            <li> The products stated purpose, and let me quote from the product description: \\&quot;These natural ingredients have been clinically proven to have antibacterial, antiviral and anti-fungal properties\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Who is this not for: People with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also use this if I have cuts or scrapes elsewhere to promote healing and provide antibacterial action.</li>
            <li> You can definitely smell the tea tree oil on this soap, but it didn&#x27;t really give me the results I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I gave a bar to friend whose young son was dealing with eczema.</li>
            <li> I use this to wash my hair as well and like that it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, unlike most common bar soap products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This defense soap has fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve completely switched to using Defense Soap all the time.</li>
            <li> There is nothing on the package that warns away people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Just as a warning though...if you are expecting your skin to feel &amp;#34;dove&amp;#34; soft...</li>
            <li> Nothing could quite get rid of it completely.</li>
            <li> so far, so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ....quite unexpectedly, the anti-fungal properties of this soap seem to have helped clear up an ongoing problem I&#x27;ve had with jock itch.  </li>
            <li> That may be because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> All natural stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know this is a sports soap, but I&#x27;ve been having problems with break-outs (adult onset acne).</li>
            <li> a person with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an MMA fighter and submission wrestler and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good soap to clear troubled skin and keep it clear</li>
            <li> So sure enough, a few weeks after discontinuing the soap I contracted Staph on my hand.</li>
            <li> all the popular soaps like dial, irish spring, dove etc. would dry my skin out and not last very long.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel pretty dry</li>
            <li> Feels a little slimy but rinses completely clean</li>
            <li> My skin is less dry and feels and looks much better than before using Defense.  </li>
            <li> I have been using pure olive oil soaps from Mediterranean countries for long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the only thing stoping it from being 5 stars is the high price</li>
            <li> and of course the natural ingredients keep all the skin problems at bay from sports and in general.</li>
            <li> breakouts cause it seems to calm my skin down.</li>
            <li> Particularly the toilet seats-</li>
            <li> I would be fine during the entire day but would wake up in the middle of the night, sweating, sticking and itchy down in my jotch region.  </li>
            <li> This soap form was what I was looking for, I mean what is more convenient than to do something I already do an a regular basis.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth every penny</li>
            <li> If you use it early enough, it&#x27;ll knock-out staph and impetigo a majority of the time.</li>
            <li> and I barely ever remember I&#x27;m using it for jock itch.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s all natural is a big bonus.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me, stay away from this bar soap or only use it once a week.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for people taking blood pressure meds as the oil extracts can apparently affect your meds.</li>
            <li> kind of expensive for soap</li>
            <li> Kind of weird but try it out.</li>
            <li> This leads to less itchiness in a hot climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The itching went away almost instantly and the next day the redness and swelling was almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> This soap cleans well and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to clear up minor skin rash/irritation quicker too.</li>
            <li> would recommend using this at least a month before seeing true results.</li>
            <li> In addition,it did not dry his skin out, which was a big concern, since he is a toddler.  </li>
            <li> I had a little rash from the heat or maybe from being around dogs all day, and it was very itchy and red.</li>
            <li> Works great, and brought my jock itch down from a ten level of uncomfortableness, sometimes being so bad it kept me up at night, to a 1, where using the soap is just a shower ritual now</li>
            <li> You will be addicted as soon as you use it, because it makes you feel so clean</li>
            <li> The bar soap suds up and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Has anyone ever gotten this 5 pack and gotten it in something like a big Ziplock baggie that looks a little old?</li>
            <li> My skin is dry on my legs and lower back and oily on face and chest.</li>
            <li> Initial oil scented oil odor disappears immediately after towel dry</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because it irritated my skin, made it dry and had a stingy feeling the next morning.</li>
            <li> I have since went with all natural soaps and lotions and added a few drops of tea tree oil to lotions for added antibacterial and antifungal protection.</li>
            <li> All three still had some minor &amp;#34;mat related&amp;#34; skin issues.  </li>
            <li> but when i was using that stuff my skin was really sensitive in the sun and always extremely dried out.</li>
            <li> So if you are having long standing skin issues give this soap a try IT WORKS,</li>
            <li> Works well to reduce minor skin irritations.</li>
            <li> I had been using anti-fungal powder to treat it, but it only seemed to help minimally.  </li>
            <li> this bar lasts a long time and the suds do as well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve heard about this a long time ago but never tried it.</li>
            <li> Long usage may cause dry skin so you&#x27;ll need lotion.</li>
            <li> Excessive combining of gentle ingredients can actually make you end up with a harsh product.</li>
            <li> Provides deep cleaning without the extreme dryness of soaps like Dial.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on the skin especially if you practice MMA (lots of sweat and possibility of picking up wing worn or some other type of fungus).</li>
            <li> That puts it at the same price as the other non-quality soaps we were buying before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since starting the DEFENSE soap again, I haven&#x27;t contracted any other skin infection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Defense soap for several years and always feel extremely refreshed after every shower.</li>
            <li> Initially I was a little hesitant to use on my face because some reviewers expressed that it left their skin too dry.  </li>
            <li> If you participate in any hard workouts, I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Got rid of my skin  tags on my face and helps control itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li> People with naturally dry skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like store bought and</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> stinks, and didn&#x27;t really change my skin much</li>
            <li> If your active at all into sports, martial arts, biking, ect, you should be using this.</li>
            <li> been practicing bjj and using defense soap for two years without a single infection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had a single infection since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this soap I have not have one problem with infections or rough patches of skin or any other gym-germ related issues.  </li>
            <li> but I came down with that shortly after trying this soap.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt tight after drying but actually did not make my skin dry.</li>
            <li> it cleared up a bad yest infection and  it worked better than the stuff I got from the Doctor</li>
            <li> Never buy again..plus late paid extra for next day.</li>
            <li> He did run out of it and after a few times back in the weight room the MRSA returned!</li>
            <li> They last me more than double the time than regular bar soap, plus this helps stop the nasty stuff that I may accrue during Jiu Jitsu training.</li>
            <li> But I like this soap because I do feel cleaner using it after training than regular everyday body soap(but</li>
            <li> I took the bar of soap, wet it a bit, and rubbed it on the problem area.</li>
            <li> consumers are paying extra for the round shaping labors and waste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Spent a lot of time in the bathroom and vomited for 2 days.  </li>
            <li> Helped clear up some serious folliculitus.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> You will never need any other soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried a couple of the usual topical creams to no avail, but a week of using this product cleared it up.</li>
            <li> My wife said to me the other day: -Honey, don&#x27;t buy any other soaps anymore.  </li>
            <li> helps eliminate orders that i was not able to get rid of using regular soap.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have pointed this out: it takes care of odors in *cough, cough*</li>
            <li> I dont wake up with extreme itchiness, sweating or stickiness.  </li>
            <li> Bought this soap because I read it helps with job itch and other bacterial issues.</li>
            <li> For one son, it seemed to leave his skin a little too dry.  </li>
            <li> Even after just a few days of using this consecutively, it leaves me with small blisters and majorly irritated/dry skin in some areas that I used it.</li>
            <li> After numerous doctors, remedies, antibiotics which made it worse and  several courses of fluconazole and rx ointments this soap started clearing it up within days.</li>
            <li> and I have an active job.</li>
            <li> the active ingredients list, included with the product:&lt;br /&gt;Melaleuca</li>
            <li> but I still spent $$ using a variety of natural things and it decreased in size from a dime sized ring to a pimple but the pimple wouldn&#x27;t go away</li>
            <li> (hardly scientifically solid data)</li>
            <li> People who don&#x27;t have a reason to use it (without the need for the antibacterial properties the drawback is not worth the boon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> calmed down some acne breakout on my face but ended up drying my skin, will continued to use tho even tho</li>
            <li> It keeps me clean and away from the bad stuff in the mat</li>
            <li> I was previously using an anti-fungal cream</li>
            <li> The reason I am writing a review is I have been fighting a fungal infection and taking different medications through a naturopath, and using this soap ON MY FEET ONLY, made me quite ill.  </li>
            <li> It really cleans well and has natural essential oils that help fight those nasty bacteria.</li>
            <li> Not that common in these days of big promise and small delivery.</li>
            <li> and if I didn&#x27;t keep applying stuff on it all the time the pimple would grow a little and get redder.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about chemicals I&#x27;m not familiar with, or parabens, etc.</li>
            <li> After washing with this soap, my skin does feel a little &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> it smells a little like menthol to me, but I like it.  </li>
            <li> I train Jiu-Jitsu etc. and got a lot of soap bars a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It is also irritating to a woman&#x27;s personal area.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few of their products for a while now</li>
            <li> I work out almost everyday at 24 hour fitness.  </li>
            <li> Who KNOWS what is left behind by people working out...</li>
            <li> I leave it on for a few minutes and don&#x27;t worry about jock itch anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing I don&#x27;t like about this soap is the round shape.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> My son has been using this soap for a few years.  </li>
            <li> May be harsh on some parts of the body so you may want to use this and another soap as well.</li>
            <li> Use to have jock Itch if i sweated heavily.  </li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews saying it dried their skin.</li>
            <li> Time will tell how it does on the fungus avoidance, but after a few days with it I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a small patch of ringworm.</li>
            <li> works well, no more spots</li>
            <li> Because defense soap is expensive I only use it after training.</li>
            <li> I have had issues in the past with contracting ring worm.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not sure what to do.  </li>
            <li> so for the past 15 years... 2-3 times a week, I had to apply it to my jotch region before sleeping to keep these problems in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this to help prevent some body acne and small rashes.</li>
            <li> No more</li>
            <li> He has been using it for the past two years and no skin infection or irritations.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my three small children( just don&#x27;t get it in their eyes-it will burn).  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in their appearance, but I&#x27;m not sure that they use it like they should.  </li>
            <li> No more.  </li>
            <li> I will have a hard time paying that</li>
            <li> but you know its going to be hard for fungus or bacteria to grow in those conditions.</li>
            <li> During those 3 months I didn&#x27;t get any of the common skin diseases that grow on the mats (Staph, MRSA, the worm, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what the price increase has forced me to do.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Does the tingling mean it&#x27;s working?</li>
            <li> I mean serious.</li>
            <li> This stuff works vs having to take an antibiotic for the rest of my life that will cause some serious side effects like tinnitus.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> The smell is not strong!!</li>
            <li> The only thing I can bad thing is the cost.</li>
            <li> but it was not good for my family.</li>
            <li> It comes in an amazon prime box and so far, I haven&#x27;t been disappointed, and I believe I&#x27;ve been getting legit product, but I find it weird</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is that it is quite expensive for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the smell, not that it smells terrible, but it has a medical quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It instead made skin worse, acne bumps, breakouts and so forth.</li>
            <li> but I think its unnecessary.</li>
            <li> It drys the area very well and clears up all of the nasty itchy stuff...</li>
            <li> DO NOT TRUST ANY PRODUCT THAT MAKES A SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HOMEOPATHY!</li>
            <li> Had a bad case of jock itch for a few weeks, tried everything and anything, including prescription creams and home remedies..</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with this soap.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage grandson who has been dealing with terrible acne.  </li>
            <li> I guess that it was not a perfect &amp;#34;defense&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> commercial soaps have nasty smell come from synthetic chemicals.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re wrong.</li>
            <li> my husband is crazy about that soap</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize how bad anti-bacterial soap is for you.</li>
            <li> I was shocked by the added benefit the soap was along with the salve.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that the price went up from $20 to $27.50 for 5 bars of soap...</li>
            <li> Solved a particularly nasty case of jock itch for me (TMI?)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Appears to work as advertised.  Not that common in these days of big promise and small delivery.</li>
            <li> this soap has changed my life.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap as an adjunct to Funga Soap.  I scrub my affected toes with the Fungi Soap and wash my whole foot with the Defense Bar.  Initially I was a little hesitant to use on my face because some reviewers expressed that it left their skin too dry.  The potential for clearer skin won out over drier skin.  I&#x27;ve been using on my face for a couple of weeks and I do think my skin has been more clear, without increasing the dryness.  I do use the Cetaphil facial lotion with spf 30.  My doctor insists I wear a sunscreen all the time, indoors and out.  BTW reviewer John MacDonald (2014), thank you for my chuckle.  I&#x27;m very happy it is working out for you:-]</li>
            <li> Nice smelling product. I use as both shampoo and soap. It lathers up very nicely for the hair. No issues for me of any skin issues, dryness, ringworm, etc.  Hopefully because we keep clean mats but for the quality and price it&#x27;s nice peace of mind.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a small patch of ringworm. The package arrived on time. My skin is dry on my legs and lower back and oily on face and chest. This soap smells great but leaves no fragrance once you rinse. It lathers well and rinses completely clean. My skin felt tight after drying but actually did not make my skin dry. I believe the astringent property of the soap just causes that temporary feeling. I like this soap a lot and will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Did well cleaning up some tinea versacolor on my chest and back, but hasn&#x27;t kept it back. Good for treating a symptom, not a cure.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with this soap. I buy the 5 pack each time.</li>
            <li> Great as always.  A definite need for kids who wrestle.</li>
            <li> i like this soap, and it makes my skin feel different.&lt;br /&gt;my skin feels a bit smoother when i use this and i&#x27;ve noticed some improvement on blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s kind of expensive for soap but if you have skin problems i&#x27;d say give it a shot. buy 1 bar.&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t last as long as cheap soap, so maybe buy a case to store it in so it&#x27;s not constantly hit with water in your shower.</li>
            <li> This took care of my skin problem. I has a fungal infection. It went away when I tried this.</li>
            <li> First time I tried this was a year ago from a health/workout online store and got hooked on these bars of soap from the get go. Very refreshing smell and makes myself, and most likely yourself feel invigorated, and clean after a morning shower. Also a very reasonable price for a pack of five.</li>
            <li> I was using Sal&#x27;s soap and that help my skin and then I tried Defense soap.  What ever problems you are having with your skin this one will take care of it.  I had problems with Acne and plug pores no matter what I tried nothing work until Defense.  The short time I have been using this soap my pores are clear my skin is smooth. I am very happy with this soap!  The bar soap suds up and last a long time.</li>
            <li> You must buy this and the salve.. They work hand in hand and they work together very well.. I was shocked by the added benefit the soap was along with the salve. Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> After a week using the soap, my ringworm is almost gone.</li>
            <li> Would be 5 starts but one of the ingredients caused a rash on the soles of my feet making them very itchy.  Other than that I loved this damn soap.  Had to switch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a pityrosporum folliculitis for over a year. After numerous doctors, remedies, antibiotics which made it worse and  several courses of fluconazole and rx ointments this soap started clearing it up within days. Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> This seems to be good soap.  I like the smell of it and it&#x27;s a good general family soap to keep in the shower.  The lavender balances out the tea tree scent.</li>
            <li> Great soap!  I love it.</li>
            <li> My son is a wrestler who has a propensity for skin infections. This is the first soap we have found that has averted another infection.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve tried both the liquid and bar Defense and I like the bar soap much better. It&#x27;s more soothing and leaves a softer finish on my skin. Seems to clear up minor skin rash/irritation quicker too.</li>
            <li> great to have for camping and hiking....keeps the funky butt away!!!</li>
            <li> I train Jiu-Jitsu etc. and got a lot of soap bars a few years ago. Shortly after running out of soap, I started developing the occasional funk on my skin. It&#x27;ll dry out your skin a bit, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, ask your doctor for some Rx Mupirocin (Bactroban) ointment to use on soars that are already present. If you use it early enough, it&#x27;ll knock-out staph and impetigo a majority of the time. It saves me from having to go on antibiotics.</li>
            <li> it cleared up a bad yest infection and  it worked better than the stuff I got from the Doctor</li>
            <li> This is a great soap, the use of which is being advertised in a way too limited fashion.  I&#x27;m just a regular guy who isn&#x27;t into contact sports or using public showers etc.  However, the soap is still fabulous because of it&#x27;s gentleness on skin with added anti-microbial activity.  The antimicrobial activity is great for the feet in preventing the usual days end smell, and also for the groin in stabilizing the microbial balance.  This leads to less itchiness in a hot climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like it since it&#x27;s simple and without trying to put everything in it, an unfortunately popular and counterproductive effort in products these days.  Excessive combining of gentle ingredients can actually make you end up with a harsh product.</li>
            <li> I was extremely hesitant to purchase this soap but after researching figured it would be a good fit. It did not work for our family. It instead made skin worse, acne bumps, breakouts and so forth. It is also irritating to a woman&#x27;s personal area. I would not recommend. I have since went with all natural soaps and lotions and added a few drops of tea tree oil to lotions for added antibacterial and antifungal protection. It might work for some but it was not good for my family.</li>
            <li> So far so good at keeping the fungal away..</li>
            <li> My McNuggets have never been cleaner</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband for Ju Jitsu after Joe Rogan recommended it. Now we both use it, I love it! It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry or itchy like most bar soap and actually leaves it softer than the Dove Sensitive Skin liquid I was using before!</li>
            <li> Love this soap, makes my skin feel real clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful. Cleans skin thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and lasts and lasts! Has helped improve skin conditions. Highly recommend adding this product to the travel bag of any athlete or weekend warriors.Really GOOD stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product does exactly what it says helps out with ringworm!!</li>
            <li> A MUST have for any athlete!! My son is a football player and contacted MRSA from the indoor turf, and was hospitalized for 6 days. A friend recommended who&#x27;s son is a wrestler recommended this to us and since my son began using it, has not had a recurrance of it. He did run out of it and after a few times back in the weight room the MRSA returned! He will never be without DEFENSE!</li>
            <li> This soap really is great for winter skin.Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this daily and it has eliminated heat rash. I also use it to shampoo with and I like it better than any other dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Love it will order again</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth every penny</li>
            <li> Works great Smells even better</li>
            <li> World&#x27;s best bar of soap.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap. They last me more than double the time than regular bar soap, plus this helps stop the nasty stuff that I may accrue during Jiu Jitsu training.</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic! My husband has tinea versicolor on his back and arms. This product has greatly reduced the bumps. Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap, the smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and I feel very clean and refreshed after my daily shower.  My skin is less dry and feels and looks much better than before using Defense.  Seems to be doing what it says it&#x27;s suppose to.  Recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells like pine-sol &amp; raises your blood pressure, literally. Otherwise it lathers &amp; rinses well.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and seems to work well!</li>
            <li> this soap is great, awesome product, a must if you roll!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This soap cleans well and does not dry out my skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> Works great. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working great so far, don&#x27;t know what the end result will be.</li>
            <li> It worked great for ringworm</li>
            <li> Good product and Prompt service.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I use this after every Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai class. It keeps me clean and away from the bad stuff in the mat</li>
            <li> Amazing! Feels a little slimy but rinses completely clean and then there&#x27;s the plus of no returning dandruff, athletes foot, jock itch, etc. this stuff even helped clear up my face! I&#x27;m Irish with a very fair complexion and VERY sensitive skin. Perfect results! They can&#x27;t be another medicated soap available with better results. &amp;#34;Powerful&amp;#34; Defense soap #JRE !</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Use it alternatively with Tea Tree oil soap.</li>
            <li> I seem to have inherited a weakness for defending against athlete&#x27;s foot from my father (if that is possible)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have it on my left foot, and the nails in that foot, and have tried everything to get rid of it.  It always comes back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I use this stuff every day, and scrub the foot and toenails with a scrub brush, it has all but cleared up.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I like to use this sofa because of it&#x27;s  antibacterial and antiviral properties. It also helps my skin to retain  moisture.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome. My daughter told us about it. She uses it daily in the shower after working out. My husband started using it as soon as we received it and his rashes have dryed up . My callous on my feet have disappeared and the feet are soft all the time now.  Wooooo hoo this soap works great. I have ordered 5 more bars for the future.</li>
            <li> Started using this year.  Don&#x27;t like the smell, but it seems effective for it&#x27;s prevention purpose</li>
            <li> Helped clear up some serious folliculitus. I mean serious. Went and saw an USAF dermatologist and he didn&#x27;t know what it was, saw a civilian dermatologist and didn&#x27;t know what was causing it. This stuff works vs having to take an antibiotic for the rest of my life that will cause some serious side effects like tinnitus.&lt;br /&gt;And if you&#x27;ve got folliculitus then try this folliculitus lotion from Amazon too, &amp;#34;Treatment of Severe and Chronic Folliculitis - Leave in Hair and Scalp Lotion 8.0 Oz&amp;#34;. God bless!</li>
            <li> Gets the dirt out from when you come home from BJJ or Muay Thai class.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;say no to staph and ringworm.&lt;br /&gt;Ive been practicing bjj and using defense soap for two years without a single infection.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage grandson who has been dealing with terrible acne.  He&#x27;s been using this soap for 10 days now and I can see a remarkable difference.  Great deal.  Does need to be mentioned though that there is a warning on the box... not for individuals with high blood pressure.  Apart from that, does the job.</li>
            <li> my husband is crazy about that soap it does what it says it&#x27;s going</li>
            <li> I use your soap on my feet and they look great and feel soft. Great product.</li>
            <li> Guys, this is absolutely worth it.  I got rid of my acne within using it every two days, for two weeks.  I had severe athletes foot a while back and the fungus keeps coming back every now and then.  SInce I started using it, its gone for good.  I cant belive how good this works!  Its absolutely worth the money.  It really really is.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised and provided relief to my husband and my daughter&#x27;s skin conditions. Recommend the product very much.</li>
            <li> I remember when I first bought this soap it was amazing but there seems to be an inconsistency in the tea tree oil or ingredients because sometimes it&#x27;s amazing and then the next bar seems to do nothing at all.</li>
            <li> works well, no more spots</li>
            <li> fresh and clean. the best soap I have found.</li>
            <li> Lathers well, smells good...don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really curing all this and that, but good so far. Does the tingling mean it&#x27;s working?</li>
            <li> Use it every day.  I&#x27;m in martial arts and law enforcement.  No staff yet.  Crossed fingers</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have three sons who all wrestle (elementary, middle and high school).  They all used it and it worked okay.  For one son, it seemed to leave his skin a little too dry.  All three still had some minor &amp;#34;mat related&amp;#34; skin issues.  I guess that it was not a perfect &amp;#34;defense&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Like their barrier foam and wipes, I like the Defense products as a whole.  The soap is great to shower up with after a workout, especially for wrestlers.</li>
            <li> I have had tinea versicolor (sun spots) for years and tried this soap &amp; after about a month all the spots are completely gone. I am very impressed, this soap smells great and took care of an issue I have every summer and medication both topical and by mouth have not cleared up.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap. If you buy this soap it will be the only soap you will ever need. It takes away all bacteria and fungus as well as good smelling and making your skin soft. You will never need any other soap. I truly like this and if you want to go all natural it is all you need. You will be addicted as soon as you use it, because it makes you feel so clean and it is gentle enough for a baby&#x27;s skin or sensitive skin as well so if you want natural and gentle good smelling and fresh this is a for you.</li>
            <li> Solved a particularly nasty case of jock itch for me (TMI?) This soap lathers up nicely, has a pleasant smell and lasts longer than I expected. I&#x27;d tried a couple of the usual topical creams to no avail, but a week of using this product cleared it up. Recommended!</li>
            <li> The best soap for athletes or anyone who partakes in physical activity. It really cleans well and has natural essential oils that help fight those nasty bacteria. Only bad thing is that it is quite expensive for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff to keep jock itch in check, even before training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Works great, and brought my jock itch down from a ten level of uncomfortableness, sometimes being so bad it kept me up at night, to a 1, where using the soap is just a shower ritual now and I barely ever remember I&#x27;m using it for jock itch. I have a question though. Has anyone ever gotten this 5 pack and gotten it in something like a big Ziplock baggie that looks a little old? It comes in an amazon prime box and so far, I haven&#x27;t been disappointed, and I believe I&#x27;ve been getting legit product, but I find it weird that I always get it with no packing slips and it&#x27;s always in some kind of different bag.</li>
            <li> i like that it feels soft and lathers quickly time will tell how effective it is as an antibacterial but for now it seems to be working well and has a pleasant fragrance</li>
            <li> I roll bjj 1-2x/week and box 1-2x/week, and I have an active job. I frequently would get ingrown hairs wherever rash guards and compression shorts came into contact with my skin. Since Defense, clear skin all around.</li>
            <li> Good soap and smells good but didn&#x27;t clear the skin condition as promoted.</li>
            <li> Fantastic soap.  I would never do jiujitsu without it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what they say it is. Lasts along time too, with good lather and smell. Been using either the bar or liquid for a year now. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wow. A friend turned me on to this stuff and now thats all I use. I love it....</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this soap. He kept getting funky skin rashes from the gym and this has truly cleared it up</li>
            <li> It has a very strong odor but doesn&#x27;t leave that odor on your body. It cleans well. It latherd well. It last maybe a couple days more than a bar of dove for men. After a week of use I can&#x27;t say it helped anymore than a regular bar of soap.... Guess it can&#x27;t hurt. Except the price.</li>
            <li> I use this soap after BJJ class and so far no skin issues. I haven&#x27;t had a skin issue even before using defense soap but I practice good common sense hygiene care to begin with. But I like this soap because I do feel cleaner using it after training than regular everyday body soap(but obviously any soap is better than no soap after training). Because defense soap is expensive I only use it after training. I use regular soap on non-training days.</li>
            <li> Some claim Triclosan contributes the bacterial resistance to antibiotics.  Natural oils provide a safe alternative antibacterial solution.  Causes dryness of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT.  I REPEAT DO NOT LET THIS SOAP GET IN YOUR EYES.</li>
            <li> This soap has a great smell and feel. Probably some of the best I have ever tried. Gets you really clean as well as long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product. The only thing I can bad thing is the cost. But you get what you pay for and it is worth&lt;br /&gt;the cost</li>
            <li> This I going to be short.&lt;br /&gt;Basically the best soap I have tried so fare.  My wife said to me the other day: -Honey, don&#x27;t buy any other soaps anymore.  This soap is the only one I want to use from now one.&lt;br /&gt;I agreed.  This soap stands in a class of it own.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product!! I have bought a few of their products for a while now and I have no complaints!! The smell is not strong!! It makes you clean and feel clean! I&#x27;m so glad I found this product!!!</li>
            <li> Just pricey. and smells like old lady. But good anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties.</li>
            <li> This soap is helping some skin issues.</li>
            <li> Works very well. I like the smell and if you find it to strong, the odor fades quickly.</li>
            <li> i think this soap made an impact.</li>
            <li> Ever since I heard about this soap on Joe Rogan&#x27;s podcast I wanted to try it.  I have been using organic soap my sister makes from home, but she recently had a baby and doesn&#x27;t have time to make it anymore...so I had to go back to regular brand soap and my skin HATES it!  Defense soap DEFINITELY makes a difference.  Even if you&#x27;re not a fighter or not in a gym everyday, this is a great product that leaves all of the GOOD bacteria on your skin without drying it out or adding chemicals.  It clears up my acne and keeps folliculitis away...would recommend using this at least a month before seeing true results.</li>
            <li> Does the job this is my second order. Doesn&#x27;t leave a medicinal ordor, you can apply your body lotion and go out for the evening. In the warm months i have a tendency to perspire aound my bra area, this soap keeps down any breakouts. Happy with defense.</li>
            <li> works great. helps eliminate orders that i was not able to get rid of using regular soap. the only thing stoping it from being 5 stars is the high price</li>
            <li> It works great. I had a little rash from the heat or maybe from being around dogs all day, and it was very itchy and red. I took the bar of soap, wet it a bit, and rubbed it on the problem area. I know this isn&#x27;t how it is supposed to be used but I needed relief fast. The itching went away almost instantly and the next day the redness and swelling was almost completely gone. It does have an odor and will make your bathroom smell, but it does work great.</li>
            <li> Great, kills jock itch when used daily.</li>
            <li> Really helps with acne and does not dry skin out</li>
            <li> It is summer time and rashes, insect bites and its.  This is the product that one needs---I highly recommend it.  It would be worth you buying this and keeping it on hand --just in case.  Oh, you know how you use the alovera (savila) on sun burns-----use the soap and alo combination for a fast heal.</li>
            <li> I work out almost everyday at 24 hour fitness.  Who KNOWS what is left behind by people working out...me included.  I use the equipment, I use the mats, I use the elipticals and hand held weights....there are germs everywhere.  And, the facilities are maintained, it is just the nature of the beast.  Gyms have germs.  Since I started using this soap I have not have one problem with infections or rough patches of skin or any other gym-germ related issues.  I really like the scent and it does leave my skin feeling hydrated.  It is expensive so I make sure I use ALL of it before going on to the next bar, but it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Works great. I get back acne a lot and this soap is the best thing i&#x27;ve found to manage my acne but not dry the hell out of my skin. I&#x27;ve used PanOxl and it worked really well, but when i was using that stuff my skin was really sensitive in the sun and always extremely dried out. Not to mention it bleaches your sheets and towels.</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that I like this soap, it smells nice, and it cleans well. On those grounds alone, I would give it 5 stars. HOWEVER, this soap doesn&#x27;t just claim to get you clean, and I feel the product artfully leads a consumers to believe the soap can do things that it can&#x27;t. The products stated purpose, and let me quote from the product description: \\&quot;These natural ingredients have been clinically proven to have antibacterial, antiviral and anti-fungal properties\\&quot;. Notice it doesn&#x27;t state how effective it is. I feel this claim is both truthful and misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the active ingredients list, included with the product:&lt;br /&gt;Melaleuca Alternifolia (tee tree) oil:  This is the ingredient that lends truth to the clinically proven anti-bacterial and anti-fungal claim. The packaging prefaces the claims with \\&quot;has been thought to\\&quot;. Studies show that it can be somewhat useful against fungus and bacteria, actual effectiveness: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/113.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus Globulus leaf oil: Could not locate anything that showed scientific proof it does anything other than smell nice. The only source i could find outside of psudo-science land was webMD: http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-700-EUCALYPTUS.aspx?activeIngredientId&#x3D;700&amp;activeIngredientName&#x3D;EUCALYPTUS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning sign #1: On the packaging, instead of saying it actually helps with various skin related issues (fungal infections, dandruff, acne, dry skin), the packaging states you can &#x27;visit their website too see how it performs&#x27; against these things, along with a nice warning that they are prohibited from claiming the soap has anti-bacterial or anti-fungal properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning sign #2: What bothers me the most, is that the packaging warns that it \\&quot;may antidote homeopathic medication\\&quot;. DO NOT TRUST ANY PRODUCT THAT MAKES A SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HOMEOPATHY! For more information: http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I felt cheated after reading the packaging. Had I known this information prior to purchasing, I would not have purchased this product.</li>
            <li> good soap does the job</li>
            <li> Great soap! Fast shipping I will use it again...</li>
            <li> Got rid of my skin  tags on my face and helps control itchy dry skin. I love this soap</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic!  I ordered it for myself and now my entire family is using it.  We all love it.</li>
            <li> worked great for me will order again</li>
            <li> As described . Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Works very well, see vids on youtube.....</li>
            <li> best soap every if you are prone to yeast infections</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome! Provides deep cleaning without the extreme dryness of soaps like Dial. It is even non-drying on my face. It does not have a medicinal smell but really eliminates sweaty smells after the hardest workout - even on the feet! Absolutely love this soap, it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great price for an excellent product. It serves the exact purpose for which it was purchased. I would buy it again from this seller and have already recommended it to others. Be sure to lotion up after each use.</li>
            <li> Our son is a wrestler, and had to watch out for the occasional ringworm infection.&lt;br /&gt;Since using this soap, we have not seen any skin infections!&lt;br /&gt;If they would lower the price a bit, I would give it 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Great product and buy from Amazon...will buy again. Use after each visit to the gym now.</li>
            <li> Great value and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> best soap for keeping skin protected when doing MMA training.</li>
            <li> This product should have all the warnings listed so that people can see them prior to purchasing. Instead of this soap just use a 50/50 mixture of vinegar and water to achieve the same thing.</li>
            <li> Seems to work to control diabetes related rashes like jock itch, etc.</li>
            <li> Good soap using a bar now. lathers up well and leaves me squeaky clean. The defense properties i can&#x27;t comment on as I&#x27;m not work out in a gym BUT it seems to have a great medicinal herbal scent and feels like it would do the job it claims it can do</li>
            <li> Smells better than all other soaps in this category. Defense soap also works great for your hair. Kind of weird but try it out.</li>
            <li> Great product for acne.fast shipping</li>
            <li> I think it works. I have a chronic skin condition from a drug reaction, and I&#x27;m borderline diabetic, which may cause sugar to get to skin and attract fungus grazing. I think the soap discourages this. Observation not scientific.</li>
            <li> Superior product!!  Defense Soap worked on my son&#x27;s rash when nothing else would.  I love the way it lathers.  In addition,it did not dry his skin out, which was a big concern, since he is a toddler.  I love this product so much and will continue to use it on my son, and myself, for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Remove the dirt and grease surprisingly good</li>
            <li> This product is making my athletes foot a memory.</li>
            <li> This soap smells okay and has effective doses of natural ingredients known to keep gross ass s*** that lives on BJJ mats off of your skin. People I train with swear by this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great value and the bar lasts much longer than Dr. So&amp;so&#x27;s. I would definitely buy this package the next time.</li>
            <li> I have only used one bar to date, and my rash is better, but I am also using other treatments so I can&#x27;t say for sure that the soap cleared it up.  But it is still a good body soap and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> after one issue of ring worm bought products to prevent</li>
            <li> Helps keep ringworm away.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves you feeling very clean and has a clean scent. I play full contact sports and trade a lot of body sweat with others. I have had issues in the past with contracting ring worm. After switching to this soap, I have not had any such issues. I love this soap and recommend it to anyone who is active or looking for something more than your regular deodorant soap.</li>
            <li> UPDATE 12/2/16&lt;br /&gt;Soap had nothing to do with the palm problems.  I use this soap all the time now and really like how it foams.  I leave it on for a few minutes and don&#x27;t worry about jock itch anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this soap had anything to do with my Hyperlinear Palm Eczema but I came down with that shortly after trying this soap.  I bought the soap after reading all the good reviews and I know that tea tree oil can be very healing.  I had a case of jock itch and thought this soap would be the answer to preventing it again.  Now I&#x27;m not sure what to do.  Had to go to dermatologist and he prescribed a powerful ointment and wearing gloves at night with the ointment.  It could have been a coincidence but for the time being I&#x27;m not going to use the soap.</li>
            <li> My husband and son use this product, it works very well!</li>
            <li> Pros: Outstanding antibacterial properties.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Removes a lot of skin moisture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is this for: People who have a real exposure to contact contagions like MRSA. (contact sports, medical personnel, cab drivers, money handlers)&lt;br /&gt;Who is this not for: People with sensitive skin. People with naturally dry skin. People who don&#x27;t have a reason to use it (without the need for the antibacterial properties the drawback is not worth the boon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I find substantial relief from my Hidradenitis suppurativa symptoms; tracked results for 1 year without and then one year with showed an 80% reduction in symptoms. (hardly scientifically solid data) The results (for me) though, are undeniable.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff really works, and I work out a lot. Other reviewers have pointed this out: it takes care of odors in *cough, cough* your &amp;#34;nether regions.&amp;#34; This product works unlike any antibacterial soap I&#x27;ve used. I have found it beneficial to wash the desired area a couple of times while showering. I also use this if I have cuts or scrapes elsewhere to promote healing and provide antibacterial action. Truthfully, I was a skeptic, but I am now a believer. A really great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/25/16: Still works, still doing what it advertises. Proving to be a good, mild face soap as well.</li>
            <li> You can definitely smell the tea tree oil on this soap, but it didn&#x27;t really give me the results I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Not really worth the price - I&#x27;d rather just buy tea tree oil</li>
            <li> Good soap to clear troubled skin and keep it clear</li>
            <li> As a veterinary technician I am always exposed to ringworm. The anti-fungal property of this soap gives me piece of mind after a day of handling ringworm infected kittens. The fact that it&#x27;s all natural is a big bonus.</li>
            <li> Big surprise in my life. I am very picky about smell and this product passed my high standard.&lt;br /&gt;Most commercial soaps have nasty smell come from synthetic chemicals. And they make me ill.&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using pure olive oil soaps from Mediterranean countries for long time.&lt;br /&gt;Defense Soap has become a big part of my life because of antibacterial, antiviral and anti-fungal properties.&lt;br /&gt;According to the web page, the smell is based on Tea Tree oils and oil of Eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like about this soap is the round shape.&lt;br /&gt;We consumers are paying extra for the round shaping labors and waste.&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer square shape without any waste.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the soap sits better that way on soap saver.</li>
            <li> This soap is great. No nonsense. It works.</li>
            <li> The mother of all soap bars.</li>
            <li> This stuff lives up to its name! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to have for the kids to use on hands &amp; in the tub, after being at school all day &amp; using school restrooms ETC. GROSS! :)&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I&#x27;m a bit OCD :) but it is flu season &amp; I believe all schools (regardless of cleaning habits) are a breeding ground for sickness. Particularly the toilet seats- gross. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really working but smells good.</li>
            <li> calmed down some acne breakout on my face but ended up drying my skin, will continued to use tho even tho i still get breakouts cause it seems to calm my skin down.</li>
            <li> Best soap I have ever used, its clearing up a skin problem I had over 25 years , some thing the Doctors was totally clueless about , So if you are having long standing skin issues give this soap a try IT WORKS,</li>
            <li> There isnt much I can say about this that hasn&#x27;t already been said. If your active at all into sports, martial arts, biking, ect, you should be using this.</li>
            <li> As a person who CONSTANTLY deals with fungal infections this soap has been a lifesaver. I&#x27;ve not had a single infection since I started using it. There were days where a felt the beginnings of an infection and after showering and sleeping in breathable clothes I had no worries.</li>
            <li> Great clean feel after getting out. Smells clean.</li>
            <li> OMG!!!  This product helped my daughter so much!!!!  I am so glad I ordered 5 Bars!  EXCELLENT!!  This worked when NOTHING ELSE would!!!</li>
            <li> Works well to reduce minor skin irritations.</li>
            <li> my son have been liking, using defense soap / have gone accustomed to shower with this soap ever since.</li>
            <li> For body odor, this is it. However it is drying so I use this only in certain places, e.g., under my arms, feet, etc. and then I use a ph balanced cleanser on the rest of my body. Most other soaps mask body odor, this gets rid of it.</li>
            <li> This soap worked great on poison ivy. It doesn&#x27;t lather well but it lathers well enough, I think. It also helped clear up acne my daughter was having a problem with. This worked better than any soap or cream her doctor or aesthetician recommended. I gave a bar to friend whose young son was dealing with eczema. She&#x27;s a fannow, too, said it worked better than the Cetaphil that his doctor recommended.</li>
            <li> Very effective product.  With age and diabetes, I&#x27;ve become more susceptible to fungal skin infections and this has been&lt;br /&gt;a significant help. I strongly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;i also use it in the shower gel form and find that equally effective.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful. Pleasant scent. Works wonders on the skin especially if you practice MMA (lots of sweat and possibility of picking up wing worn or some other type of fungus). The only downside is the price. Its very steep.</li>
            <li> I had ring worm on the back of my hand for 3 months. No idea how I got it. Does it really matter? Oh well. I read that 20% of the population may have this. I take a shower every day. I&#x27;m a very clean 53 year old person so I was mortified. It was stubborn to get rid of. I never went to the M.D. but I still spent $$ using a variety of natural things and it decreased in size from a dime sized ring to a pimple but the pimple wouldn&#x27;t go away and if I didn&#x27;t keep applying stuff on it all the time the pimple would grow a little and get redder. I started using Defense soap in the shower and in the same time period I applied a drop of Oreganol Oil, Super Strength P73 1 oz. as often as I remembered throughout the day - bought on Amazon. The combination of these things took care of it quickly - in a week it seemed and voila~ it&#x27;s a thing of the past :-)</li>
            <li> used for ring worm cleared it up quickly</li>
            <li> I continue to love this soap, so does my husband 😊</li>
            <li> Clean refreshing natural scent, very strong initially when used but doesn&#x27;t linger after use.  I use this to wash my hair as well and like that it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, unlike most common bar soap products.  Also, leaves my skin feeling very soft and healthy.  Really good product, glad to have found it, will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This soap does what it claims.  Initial oil scented oil odor disappears immediately after towel dry</li>
            <li> My man and I totally love this soap. You skin is truley clean after using this soap. It took us 7 weeks to get through the 5 pk, and that included us using a bar to wash our hands regularly as well. That puts it at the same price as the other non-quality soaps we were buying before. I first bought this for $25.50, this time i got it for $20.50, which basically means I got one bar free. Net Rush gives the best price and I got it in a day with Prime Shipping. Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I give off a lot of heat and I have a strong personal hygiene.  One of my main problems since I was in high school was the problem with jotch itch/sweat during the nights. I would be fine during the entire day but would wake up in the middle of the night, sweating, sticking and itchy down in my jotch region.  MD told me to use clotomizole  any night i need it (after going through a course of treatment)...so for the past 15 years... 2-3 times a week, I had to apply it to my jotch region before sleeping to keep these problems in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This defense soap has fixed the problem. I used it every time I shower.  Its a great soap.  I dont wake up with extreme itchiness, sweating or stickiness.  It took about 2 weeks for it to fully work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this soap will help someone else as it did so much for me.</li>
            <li> So glad to find a anti fungal soap</li>
            <li> great price, great soap.  lasts a while.  good lather, excellent smell</li>
            <li> It smells good get you clean N can&#x27;t seem to keep you funky free.</li>
            <li> I use this to help prevent some body acne and small rashes. It works well and I use it daily. I don&#x27;t do any type of physical workouts as most people who use this do.</li>
            <li> My son has been using this soap for a few years.  No complaints!  Wrestlers, MMA fighters, buy this.</li>
            <li> What else can I say....its soap</li>
            <li> I was shopping for an antibacterial soap last December after a bout with MRSA when I came across Defense products.  Since then I&#x27;ve completely switched to using Defense Soap all the time. My skin has never felt so good and really clean. T</li>
            <li> The bars tend to go quicker than one would think but the product does what it is supposed to do. Some minor skin issues from time to time but clear up quickly and back to normal.</li>
            <li> The best soap to use to prevent a rash from spreading or any thing thats make look like a rash especially ring worms.</li>
            <li> I have only used this soap a few times now, but it seems to be good. I am not a huge fan of the smell, not that it smells terrible, but it has a medical quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The disclaimer worries me a bit, but after searching the web it seems to be a CYA statement, more than a real worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is used by the Iowa Wrestling Team, so it must be effective. It is also recommended by many high level grapplers to help fight off skin infections.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Will not be without it. *****</li>
            <li> Never buy again..plus late paid extra for next day. No more</li>
            <li> good soap...leaves clean feeling...will dry out skin if you don&#x27;t moisturize daily...wish price was cheaper</li>
            <li> Excellent soap.  Smells nice and lathers well.  The soap rinses off easily and leaves a clean feeling without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. It&#x27;s amazing! It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like store bought and my acne on my back is practically gone.</li>
            <li> seems to work for certain fungal rashed</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothiing to aid my condition.  Only thing good about it is that it smells nice.</li>
            <li> It has helped with my jock itch symptoms.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> There is nothing on the package that warns away people with sensitive skin. I recently had ringworm all over my body, and tried to give this a shot. Even after just a few days of using this consecutively, it leaves me with small blisters and majorly irritated/dry skin in some areas that I used it. If you have sensitive skin like me, stay away from this bar soap or only use it once a week.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my son who is a wrestler.  He has been using it for the past two years and no skin infection or irritations.  The high school wrestling coach hands it out to all the wrestlers to use and no outbreaks so far.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but it loses its scent after awhile.  I do love their wipes!</li>
            <li> Nice smell and feels clean but could not tell it did anything for my athletes foot. I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 months on my feet at the end of my shower every night and morning almost 100% of the time.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, I don&#x27;t love the price. This stuff works great for keeping fungal and bacterial skin conditions at bay. 5 stars for a price drop.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, nice clean.</li>
            <li> Good soap, makes you feel SUPER clean.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t notice anything spectacular, but I think that is a good sign. Long usage may cause dry skin so you&#x27;ll need lotion. I do BJJ and anything that keeps germs at bay is always a plus. I use it before and after classes.</li>
            <li> Effective yet gentle.  lathers up great</li>
            <li> My son is a wrestler and NEVER had ringworm while using this product after practice each day.  One time we ran out and he immediately contracted ringworm, so in my opinion, the stuff works!</li>
            <li> hygienic!! helped me out in my acne fight, also good for private parts</li>
            <li> I was worried that with lavender being an ingredient that it would be too feminine for gifts to the guys, but the smell is clean and pleasent and far from being flowery. I didn&#x27;t use it but gave it away as gifts it seemed to be well received.</li>
            <li> Defense always works great.  Paired this with a tea tree shampoo and I feel great and my skin does too.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so strong. I could smell it before I opened the box it came in. After showering with it there is no aftersmell.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize how bad anti-bacterial soap is for you. therefore the whole family is making this change over.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my tinea versicolor. I was previously using an anti-fungal cream but I just didn&#x27;t have the patience for it. So, I went on a google hunt to search for an easier alternative. This soap form was what I was looking for, I mean what is more convenient than to do something I already do an a regular basis. I was completely free of my white spots after the second bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I love it. I don&#x27;t have to worry about chemicals I&#x27;m not familiar with, or parabens, etc. Just as a warning though...if you are expecting your skin to feel &amp;#34;dove&amp;#34; soft...you&#x27;re wrong. After washing with this soap, my skin does feel a little &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;...but I am okay with that. A lot of people complain about the smell, but I love the soap&#x27;s smell. If you participate in any hard workouts, I highly recommend this soap. It is a little pricey but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing!!!! I absolutely love this soap. I had body odor issues, particularly in my underarms. This soap has managed to keep me fresh all day long! Even after an intense HIIT workout. I hope it keeps up the good work, I will definitely write an update after the summer- since that will be the ultimate test!</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li> Had a bad case of jock itch for a few weeks, tried everything and anything, including prescription creams and home remedies.. Nothing could quite get rid of it completely. Heard this was the best of the best for a multitude of skin issues, and within a few days of using this not only had it cleared up, it hasn&#x27;t come back since!</li>
            <li> Definitely worked!!!! It makes my skin really clean.</li>
            <li> I received it in four days.  It clears your pimples.</li>
            <li> worked immediately / after 1 (one) use...</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with this soap.  It smells fine (light tea tree oil scent), it lathers up well, and the bars seem to last quite a while.  I mainly bought this because I grapple, and I wanted to avoid catching staph or ringworm....so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO....quite unexpectedly, the anti-fungal properties of this soap seem to have helped clear up an ongoing problem I&#x27;ve had with jock itch.  I had been using anti-fungal powder to treat it, but it only seemed to help minimally.  I started using this soap about two weeks ago, and things seem to have cleared up quite nicely!  Thank you, Defense soap!</li>
            <li> My teenage boys use this during wrestling season.  It really helps keep the mat funk away!</li>
            <li> Its a great idea but I think its unnecessary. I stopped using it because it irritated my skin, made it dry and had a stingy feeling the next morning. That may be because I have sensitive skin so I still gave this thing 4/5. If you want extra protection, use this if your skin can handle it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product.  Using it to clear up ringworm.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about this soap when my husband bought it. The smell was strong with the tea tree oil(but there were 5 bars in the package).Now, I ABSOLUTELY love this soap!! It cleans without drying out my skin. I also use it on my three small children( just don&#x27;t get it in their eyes-it will burn).  I passed it a bar on to a friend of mine who is allergic to everything and she has had no reaction. We just ordered more!!</li>
            <li> The soap to have and use if you&#x27;re a wrestler or into sports like Judo, BJJ or MMA, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This soap will prevent ringworm, etc.  All natural stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Effects and Cautions for male youth athelete;&lt;br /&gt;Some questions remain regarding tea tree oil ingredient; if its really safe for youg boys to use.&lt;br /&gt;Research says use of the tea tree oil in boys before puberty could mess with the hormone and cause reversible gynecomastia (growth of breast tissue).</li>
            <li> Very good product. Each bas lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be very effective with jock itch.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great soap !! I&#x27;ve struggled with jock itch for most of my life and tried every cream on the market and it never went away permenantly. This soap was wonderful. It drys the area very well and clears up all of the nasty itchy stuff... I&#x27;m a customer for life!!</li>
            <li> amazing soap!!! all the popular soaps like dial, irish spring, dove etc. would dry my skin out and not last very long. this bar lasts a long time and the suds do as well. and of course the natural ingredients keep all the skin problems at bay from sports and in general.</li>
            <li> The best to avoid skin fungus</li>
            <li> This soap is very useful in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.  I use this before and after class to make sure I do not get any staph or ringworm infections from the mats or other people.  It works very well. A definite must to have.</li>
            <li> does what it says!!  Great product!!  will keep this in my bathroom from now on!!  Amazing!!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT SMELLS GREAT.WORKS GREAT!</li>
            <li> Awesome soap.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and I feel squeaky clean after showering.</li>
            <li> This soap was bought to help with acne for my daughter and son.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in their appearance, but I&#x27;m not sure that they use it like they should.  Some will probably not like the smell.....it smells a little like menthol to me, but I like it.  May be harsh on some parts of the body so you may want to use this and another soap as well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this soap.  The reason I am writing a review is I have been fighting a fungal infection and taking different medications through a naturopath, and using this soap ON MY FEET ONLY, made me quite ill.  Spent a lot of time in the bathroom and vomited for 2 days.  If you are only using the soap, it will probably be fine.  I bought 5 bars and have to throw it all away.</li>
            <li> What ever will help keep the germs away during wrestling season.</li>
            <li> My skin felt/looked NO DIFFERENT.  Totally unimpressed.  I would NOT purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I know this is a sports soap, but I&#x27;ve been having problems with break-outs (adult onset acne). This soap is helpful as an anti-bacterial/anti-fungal to help clear up problem skin.</li>
            <li> Great product to use for your boys after they get off the wrestling mat.  Helps keep their skin clean and healthy</li>
            <li> Love it! The bar lasts longer than national brands. The scent of Tee Tree Oil is prevalent so you know it&#x27;s in there. Great on the skin and leaves a feeling of FRESH! It definitely is working on my condition. As an athlete, heat, sweat and sharing equipment is a way of life. So a fungus started growing in my back. The soap is fantastic! My toes are no longer itching, my jock itch is gone and my back is clearing up. I started using a fungus cream to speed up the process. I just ordered 2-5pks.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not a wrestler.&lt;br /&gt;Although I have no issues that are mentioned here, this is the most healing and procective soap that I have found.&lt;br /&gt;For a person with sensitive skin it great, I hope it will remain available.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap exclusively for a year now. It has cleared up several skin issues and it keeps me from having to use deodorant, which irritates my skin. I know it seems expensive, but one bar lasts me a month or more with daily use. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> No skin conditions since ive begun to use this.  Use to have jock Itch if i sweated heavily.  No more.  Also greatly reduces body odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research before putting this on your children.  Tea tree oil is a great natural resource, but it can be harmful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an MMA fighter and submission wrestler and I have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve trained all over the world, and have competed all over the states. So I&#x27;ve seen my fair share of skin infections. I train on the mats 5-6 days a week. I use the soap in my shower that immediately follows my training sessions and competitions. The first time I bought this soap, I bought 4 bars individually just to give it a shot. Those 4 bars lasted me 3 months (again, I use this soap only in the shower after my training session, I don&#x27;t use this soap in all of my showers). During those 3 months I didn&#x27;t get any of the common skin diseases that grow on the mats (Staph, MRSA, the worm, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After those 3 months I didn&#x27;t purchase any more DEFENSE soap for 2 reasons; 1) it was expensive and 2) laziness. So sure enough, a few weeks after discontinuing the soap I contracted Staph on my hand. I went to the doctor, and after my copay, I ended up spending way more money than I would have buying 4 more bars of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I reupped on my DEFENSE soap, I bought 2 - 5 packs, so 10 bars total. This was way cheaper than buying the bars individually, and way WAY cheaper than my copay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since starting the DEFENSE soap again, I haven&#x27;t contracted any other skin infection. My experience tells me it works, and I&#x27;ll continue to use DEFENSE soap for this reason.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son who does MMA.  I had gotten it before and he loved it.</li>
            <li> Good soap. Dries your skin out a bit, funky mint petroleum smell, but not bad in any way. Not recommended for people taking blood pressure meds as the oil extracts can apparently affect your meds.</li>
            <li> stinks, and didn&#x27;t really change my skin much</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My husband has had perpetual athlete&#x27;s foot since being in the Marines. For years, we&#x27;ve tried everything. Finally, I got it too, and the fungus began to spread on my body. This soap was a last-ditch effort, and it WORKED. Both of us are itch- and rash-free after only a couple weeks. I will never use another soap as long as this is available, and I will recommend it highly to anyone. It even prevents razor burn. I love it.</li>
            <li> Works great for both my hubby and me! I read a lot of reviews saying it dried their skin. We only use it on our under arms, privates, and feet -- and use a separate body bar for the rest, so we don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> Good smelling soap, keeps me clean and itch free.</li>
            <li> Edit: I&#x27;m disappointed that the price went up from $20 to $27.50 for 5 bars of soap...That&#x27;s $5.50 for a bar of soap... Really? I like a good product but I don&#x27;t like getting gouged. What&#x27;s to stop people from just buying essential oils and mixing it with their soap? Nothing. That&#x27;s what the price increase has forced me to do. Go buy Tea tree and Eucalyptus oil and mix some with your soap. I will have a hard time paying that price.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Dove-Beauty-Sensitive-Skin-ounce/dp/B005HO0AR2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1435091190&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;bar+soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/100%25-Pure-Tree-Good-Natural/dp/B001063NY8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1435091228&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;teatree+oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: I train jiu jitsu and I&#x27;ve heard about this a long time ago but never tried it. I was listening to Joe Rogan podcast and he reminded me how awesome this soap is. So... I bought a 5 pack. Its basically a tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil soap. Helps getting rid of and defending against skin irritations. It reminds me of that pure castile clean feel afterwards. It makes your skin feel pretty dry but you know its going to be hard for fungus or bacteria to grow in those conditions. If skin irritations aren&#x27;t an issue, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it but I definitely find it useful.</li>
            <li> I have had tinea versicolor for 30 years now. If you know what this is, you know how I feel finding a product that made it go away during the first 2 weeks. I  haven&#x27;t even used up the bar yet and it is GONE!!!!! I have tried so many other things like dandruff shampoo and creams to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this product. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great soap, especially when we travel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Defense soap for several years and always feel extremely refreshed after every shower.I live in a climate that is very humid and my skin is always breaking out.But this soap combats these outbreaks and always defeats it.This is my only soap now.&lt;br /&gt;  Try the shower-gel,SUPER LATHER!</li>
            <li> Bought this soap because I read it helps with job itch and other bacterial issues. I have to say I have been using this a week and its working as advertised. It is expensive and has a strong scent (you cant smell it once washed off) but it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Exactly so advertised</li>
            <li> I will never stop buying these! We non longer use store brand soap!</li>
            <li> excellent soap and I like how it kills much bacteria.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it really works.  I&#x27;ll stick to my Dove soap and it&#x27;s alot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Did not agree with my blood pressures. Raised them after 3 uses. THERE IS A WARNING ON THE BOX THAT STATES NOT FOR USE IF TAKING BLOOD PRESSURE MEDS. WILL WORK AS ANTIDOTE, NO WARNING ON BUT THE AMAZON SITE. BUT I ADMIT IT FEELS GOOD WHEN USED. I even call them Defense Site before I used they stated that they have to put the warning, but it does not affect blood pressures.........</li>
            <li> I was concerned after reading the other reviews the soap would dissolve quickly. Not a problem from what I&#x27;ve experienced. I am sure it won&#x27;t last as long as garden variety bar soap, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that purpose. The smell isn&#x27;t bad either, actually kind of pleasant. Time will tell how it does on the fungus avoidance, but after a few days with it I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, smells great, natural and moisturizing too.</li>
