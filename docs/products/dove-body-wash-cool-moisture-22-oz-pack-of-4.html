            <li>I love the scent and</li>
            <li>How many body washes can say that?</li>
            <li>Dove is my favorite bodywash and soap product...</li>
            <li>yet so really pleased to get this product shipped from u.s.a</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works ok as a body wash, it does the job as any body soap.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I love this Dove body wash.</li>
            <li>This body wash is very moisturizing, and a great bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>it is gentle on the skin plus it has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>MAKES YOU FEEL CLEAN TOO !</li>
            <li>This particular smell is good, although not my favorite, but that&#x27;s a matter of opinion.</li>
            <li>I love that clean refreshing feeling after using this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells fantastic and is a great value, but I found that my skin was better moisturized after using any old oatmeal based body wash.</li>
            <li>The product leaves your skin baby soft after a shower and smells great, not too overpowering .</li>
            <li>The smell is yummy and lush without being overpowering and it is so very nice to your skin as well.</li>
            <li>Dove body wash never makes my skin feel dry, had a wonderful clean smell.  </li>
            <li>so the search was on saw alot of good reviews for this particular scent</li>
            <li>I took one star off because I find the smell a bit too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>It is such a beautiful, feminine scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She prefers to use this body wash with man-made loofahs like those from Aquasentials([[ASIN:B001CTQMIC Aquasentials Mesh Pouf Sponge (4 Pack)]]), and finds that the Dove wash does a great job of cleaning, does not dry out her skin, and smells fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Advanced Ribbons Soothing Cr&amp;egrave;me +</li>
            <li>Advanced Moisture Body Wash 18 Oz</li>
            <li>They work fabulously together.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this body wash...</li>
            <li>and I completely enjoy it</li>
            <li>TOO , HELPED FILL IN FOR MY FREE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and gentle on the skins.</li>
            <li>This produces good amount of lather, has good scent and is moisturizing, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last for much time.</li>
            <li>it is more of a softer fruity smell that I cannot even describe other than to say it is great.</li>
            <li>I feel clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>Very nice smelling and very soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the value - it doesn&#x27;t dry you out - and depending on the scent you get - it&#x27;s unisex.  </li>
            <li>After drying, my skin is velvety soft and smooth and there is still a very soft and lingering fragrance----again not over powering---this is a great body wash</li>
            <li>you are looking for a wash that smells great, cleans well and and leaves your skin feeling well hydrated -- our 21 year old highly recommends these to you.</li>
            <li>Overall good value for money.</li>
            <li>The skin feels soft after the shower and it lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>I love Dove products and found this plum scent very natural-smelling.  </li>
            <li>This scent moisturizes well and makes taking a shower a true spa experience.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and leaves my skin soft, which is nice because my skin is naturally rather dry.  </li>
            <li>This wash smells so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;m sold, ring it up and get it to me quickly.  </li>
            <li>Luckily it didn&#x27;t spill all over the toy.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>decided to use both the Dove Body Wash, go fresh, Rebalance, Plum and Sakura Blossom, 24 Ounce with the \\&quot;Olay 2-In-1</li>
            <li>ANOTHER ONE OF DOVE&#x27;S GO FRESH, REBALANCE PRODUCT KEEPS</li>
            <li>FRESH THOROUGH OUT</li>
            <li>Dove Go Fresh Body Wash, Revive, Pomegranate &amp; Lemon Verbena Scent,</li>
            <li>fresh&#x27; body wash products have become her</li>
            <li>All dove products are amazing but the smell, I could not bare.</li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>does not dry out my skin, and the smell is really refreshing.</li>
            <li>I do not like the combination of the scents, but I know that the product itself is good, as I have previously used Dove body wash.</li>
            <li>you feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The smell is lovely and my boyfriend is constantly complimenting me on how yummy I smell.</li>
            <li>About the same as most body washes though.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s a better body wash than Nivea, though I&#x27;d still use Nivea.</li>
            <li>Dove totally came up with a winning scent on this one.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, this product works great, cleans well, smells good, and has totally cured my flake ridden body</li>
            <li>This body wash leaves my skin clean, soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Though the body wash is good, i did not enjoy it as much as i did ...</li>
            <li>The Boby Wash is thick and smooth and also has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice any difference to my skin after trying this product two times a day for over a week.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got it in one piece and fast too.</li>
            <li>It really lathers a lot.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Really like this product</li>
            <li>this product does not lather as much as some others I&#x27;ve used by the same maker, but it is far more moisturizing</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the scent..</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I liked the convenience of liquid soap; however, the scent was far less strong and didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>but it is more thicker than the other one</li>
            <li>It not only leaves you feeling clean but your skin is nurtured .  </li>
            <li>It helps keep my skin soft and lasts a long time before I need more.</li>
            <li>It does not dry your skin either - instead my skin feels so soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>It makes a good lather and doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin like other soaps.</li>
            <li>This is my new fav body wash, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It lathers much better than the previous body wash I tried</li>
            <li>, will definitely be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li>This dove makes my skin SOOO soft!!</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the camp of people who prefer grassy natural scents like from Aveda, so the ultra-sweet saccharine scent was a bit much for me.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this Dove, makes my skin soft, but I&#x27;m looking for something that has a stronger scent, something I can smell way after I&#x27;ve showered.</li>
            <li>other than that Dove shower gel is a good product, but next time I will pick a different scent.</li>
            <li>This body wash has a mild soothing fragrance and doesn&#x27;t dry skin.</li>
            <li>I was plesantly suprised when it didn&#x27;t break me out, and my skin is actually more clear after using it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>I usually do not buy fruit or food scented body products.</li>
            <li>I had expected it to be less of a fruit-roll-up scent and more of a floral, so I was surprised when I used this for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was fun to go shopping on here and add allot of the things you can&#x27;t afford as a single parent to it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t skimp and buy the generic, it doesn&#x27;t even compare to the real thing.</li>
            <li>Product works well for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>SKIN STAYS SOFT AND MOISTURRIZED.</li>
            <li>daughter with sensitive skin used it one day as well</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft.  </li>
            <li>MAKES MY SKIN FEELS SO SOFT</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, and showering aggravates it, no matter what I use in the shower, but Dove is much better than any other option.</li>
            <li>It is on the pricey side compared to other body washes, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Although it was a bit on the pricy side compared to what I normally use, I will continue to use this in the future.</li>
            <li>It would probably be fine for some others but didn&#x27;t have as &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; a texture I prefer and didn&#x27;t seem to have as much after-bath skin softening/moisturizing effect as some other Dove Body Wash products or those under a couple of other brand names within similar price range.</li>
            <li>even the little kids were excited to open the goody box...</li>
            <li>Enjoy the fragrance and it suds up with only a small amount .</li>
            <li>It moisturizes skin to a decent extent (doesn&#x27;t leave skin too dry or too sticky).</li>
            <li>Does not have same scent as body mist but leaves skin soft</li>
            <li>so just be careful how much you put on your loofah.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because thought I remembered liking some other variations of Dove Body Wash I have tried in the past and because this was on sale &amp; very cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She has always been particular when it comes to facial and body cleansing products and routines, and likes the moisturizing aspects of Dove products very much, but she has never liked bar-style soaps.</li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance (not overwhelming and does not last all day long like some other heavily perfumed body washes)</li>
            <li>There were many different Dove items on sale, but me being obsessed with purple and plum in general, well I just had to pick this one</li>
            <li>This body wash feel a little like that but not as much.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t too much of either one, yet you can smell a little of both</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love the scent, if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> I love to shower with this body wash.  </li>
            <li> I like the interesting aroma ingredients it uses.</li>
            <li> probably had lot more expectations on fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, so glad I made this choice.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash, it makes my skin sooo soft and smooth, and the smell is delicious  </li>
            <li> you can do better.  </li>
            <li> Suave has a better container...</li>
            <li> I love this product .  </li>
            <li> I put in many items on here for her and the kids.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I was unsure of the smell because I&#x27;ve never had this one before, but I love the dove products.</li>

            <li> and I think many people would and</li>
            <li> I love how this smells.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate Dove&#x27;s Campaign for Real Beauty; I&#x27;m happy to support a company that helps to improve the quality of my skin, but also build&#x27;s women&#x27;s self esteem.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent...</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I will buy more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and</li>
            <li> How many body washes can say that?</li>
            <li> Dove is my favorite bodywash and soap product...</li>
            <li> yet so really pleased to get this product shipped from u.s.a</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works ok as a body wash, it does the job as any body soap.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I love this Dove body wash.</li>
            <li> This body wash is very moisturizing, and a great bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> it is gentle on the skin plus it has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> MAKES YOU FEEL CLEAN TOO !</li>
            <li> This particular smell is good, although not my favorite, but that&#x27;s a matter of opinion.</li>
            <li> I love that clean refreshing feeling after using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells fantastic and is a great value, but I found that my skin was better moisturized after using any old oatmeal based body wash.</li>
            <li> The product leaves your skin baby soft after a shower and smells great, not too overpowering .</li>
            <li> The smell is yummy and lush without being overpowering and it is so very nice to your skin as well.</li>
            <li> Dove body wash never makes my skin feel dry, had a wonderful clean smell.  </li>
            <li> so the search was on saw alot of good reviews for this particular scent</li>
            <li> I took one star off because I find the smell a bit too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> It is such a beautiful, feminine scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She prefers to use this body wash with man-made loofahs like those from Aquasentials([[ASIN:B001CTQMIC Aquasentials Mesh Pouf Sponge (4 Pack)]]), and finds that the Dove wash does a great job of cleaning, does not dry out her skin, and smells fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Advanced Ribbons Soothing Cr&amp;egrave;me +</li>
            <li> Advanced Moisture Body Wash 18 Oz</li>
            <li> They work fabulously together.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this body wash...</li>
            <li> and I completely enjoy it</li>
            <li> TOO , HELPED FILL IN FOR MY FREE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and gentle on the skins.</li>
            <li> This produces good amount of lather, has good scent and is moisturizing, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last for much time.</li>
            <li> it is more of a softer fruity smell that I cannot even describe other than to say it is great.</li>
            <li> I feel clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling and very soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the value - it doesn&#x27;t dry you out - and depending on the scent you get - it&#x27;s unisex.  </li>
            <li> After drying, my skin is velvety soft and smooth and there is still a very soft and lingering fragrance----again not over powering---this is a great body wash</li>
            <li> you are looking for a wash that smells great, cleans well and and leaves your skin feeling well hydrated -- our 21 year old highly recommends these to you.</li>
            <li> Overall good value for money.</li>
            <li> The skin feels soft after the shower and it lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> I love Dove products and found this plum scent very natural-smelling.  </li>
            <li> This scent moisturizes well and makes taking a shower a true spa experience.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and leaves my skin soft, which is nice because my skin is naturally rather dry.  </li>
            <li> This wash smells so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;m sold, ring it up and get it to me quickly.  </li>
            <li> Luckily it didn&#x27;t spill all over the toy.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> decided to use both the Dove Body Wash, go fresh, Rebalance, Plum and Sakura Blossom, 24 Ounce with the \\&quot;Olay 2-In-1</li>
            <li> ANOTHER ONE OF DOVE&#x27;S GO FRESH, REBALANCE PRODUCT KEEPS</li>
            <li> FRESH THOROUGH OUT</li>
            <li> Dove Go Fresh Body Wash, Revive, Pomegranate &amp; Lemon Verbena Scent,</li>
            <li> fresh&#x27; body wash products have become her</li>
            <li> All dove products are amazing but the smell, I could not bare.</li>
            <li> the price is right.</li>
            <li> does not dry out my skin, and the smell is really refreshing.</li>
            <li> I do not like the combination of the scents, but I know that the product itself is good, as I have previously used Dove body wash.</li>
            <li> you feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The smell is lovely and my boyfriend is constantly complimenting me on how yummy I smell.</li>
            <li> About the same as most body washes though.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it&#x27;s a better body wash than Nivea, though I&#x27;d still use Nivea.</li>
            <li> Dove totally came up with a winning scent on this one.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this product works great, cleans well, smells good, and has totally cured my flake ridden body</li>
            <li> This body wash leaves my skin clean, soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Though the body wash is good, i did not enjoy it as much as i did ...</li>
            <li> The Boby Wash is thick and smooth and also has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice any difference to my skin after trying this product two times a day for over a week.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got it in one piece and fast too.</li>
            <li> It really lathers a lot.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Really like this product</li>
            <li> this product does not lather as much as some others I&#x27;ve used by the same maker, but it is far more moisturizing</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scent..</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I liked the convenience of liquid soap; however, the scent was far less strong and didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> but it is more thicker than the other one</li>
            <li> It not only leaves you feeling clean but your skin is nurtured .  </li>
            <li> It helps keep my skin soft and lasts a long time before I need more.</li>
            <li> It does not dry your skin either - instead my skin feels so soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> It makes a good lather and doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin like other soaps.</li>
            <li> This is my new fav body wash, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It lathers much better than the previous body wash I tried</li>
            <li> , will definitely be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> This dove makes my skin SOOO soft!!</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the camp of people who prefer grassy natural scents like from Aveda, so the ultra-sweet saccharine scent was a bit much for me.  </li>
            <li> I really do like this Dove, makes my skin soft, but I&#x27;m looking for something that has a stronger scent, something I can smell way after I&#x27;ve showered.</li>
            <li> other than that Dove shower gel is a good product, but next time I will pick a different scent.</li>
            <li> This body wash has a mild soothing fragrance and doesn&#x27;t dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was plesantly suprised when it didn&#x27;t break me out, and my skin is actually more clear after using it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I usually do not buy fruit or food scented body products.</li>
            <li> I had expected it to be less of a fruit-roll-up scent and more of a floral, so I was surprised when I used this for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was fun to go shopping on here and add allot of the things you can&#x27;t afford as a single parent to it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t skimp and buy the generic, it doesn&#x27;t even compare to the real thing.</li>
            <li> Product works well for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> SKIN STAYS SOFT AND MOISTURRIZED.</li>
            <li> daughter with sensitive skin used it one day as well</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft.  </li>
            <li> MAKES MY SKIN FEELS SO SOFT</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and showering aggravates it, no matter what I use in the shower, but Dove is much better than any other option.</li>
            <li> It is on the pricey side compared to other body washes, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Although it was a bit on the pricy side compared to what I normally use, I will continue to use this in the future.</li>
            <li> It would probably be fine for some others but didn&#x27;t have as &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; a texture I prefer and didn&#x27;t seem to have as much after-bath skin softening/moisturizing effect as some other Dove Body Wash products or those under a couple of other brand names within similar price range.</li>
            <li> even the little kids were excited to open the goody box...</li>
            <li> Enjoy the fragrance and it suds up with only a small amount .</li>
            <li> It moisturizes skin to a decent extent (doesn&#x27;t leave skin too dry or too sticky).</li>
            <li> Does not have same scent as body mist but leaves skin soft</li>
            <li> so just be careful how much you put on your loofah.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because thought I remembered liking some other variations of Dove Body Wash I have tried in the past and because this was on sale &amp; very cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She has always been particular when it comes to facial and body cleansing products and routines, and likes the moisturizing aspects of Dove products very much, but she has never liked bar-style soaps.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance (not overwhelming and does not last all day long like some other heavily perfumed body washes)</li>
            <li> There were many different Dove items on sale, but me being obsessed with purple and plum in general, well I just had to pick this one</li>
            <li> This body wash feel a little like that but not as much.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t too much of either one, yet you can smell a little of both</li>
            <li> Cleans very well using a small amount at a time.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago when I was looking for a new body wash.  </li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s skin turns dry with regular soap.</li>
            <li> Dove&#x27;s bar soaps always get soft and make a mess.</li>
            <li> We have soft water, so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will be using this for a long time before I look for any thing else.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> The fresh smell of plum and sakura just refresh my tired body.</li>
            <li> I brought this because I was in search of a new body wash since the one I was using for a few years seem to be harder &amp; harder to find I even tried to see if I could find it here on Amazon with no luck</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use bar soap because i do not like how it feels on my skin, it makes my skin feel dry and waxy (if that is the correct word to use).</li>
            <li> I like all the Dove Body Washes winter dry skin  </li>
            <li> I bought a goody box of stuff for my daughter who is a single mom and this is one of the things in it.</li>
            <li> get me wrong, it is not an overly sweet fruity smell like candy etc...</li>
            <li> It was what I expected</li>
            <li> (Ive tried the pomegranate pink one</li>
            <li> When hand are wet, bottle tend to slip out of my hands and land somewhere in the tub.  </li>
            <li> That says alot because she can only use a select few products without her skin breaking out in rashes or bumps of some</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong right?).</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way on my loofah</li>
            <li> A little goes a verrry long way</li>
            <li> I use very little moisturizer since adding this body wash to my daily routine..</li>
            <li> I happen to adore the scent of Dove&#x27;s bar soap with this same fragrance, so I bought this thinking it would be less messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old geezer with dry skin and drop dander worse than Pig Pen.</li>
            <li> Not sure about other places, but I could not find this anywhere else locally.</li>
            <li> I had to get used to using less because I felt like I was wasting at the beginning.</li>
            <li> The body wash spilled into the bag, seeped out of the bag, and made a mess inside of the cardboard box which by the way had my grandson&#x27;s toy in it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is soft and subtle, not in the least bit over powering.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It is a little on the pricer side from what I use to buy</li>
            <li> This plum and sakura blossom scented wash is one of our college senior daughter&#x27;s favorites, and the the other one she usually buys is the &#x27;Pomegranate and Lemon Verbena&#x27; scented one ([[ASIN:B0037LGP9E</li>
            <li> It does smell a little bit like perfume</li>
            <li> I was a little put off because it came in a Target shipping box, if I had known I ordered it from Target</li>
            <li> It has a creamy smooth lather, even in my disgusting Southern California water&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Not available in the u.k</li>
            <li> I cannot stand heavily perfumed body washes and this one is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several and unfortunately this is one of the few you can&#x27;t subscribe to.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it :/</li>
            <li> Love the body wash, but hate the awkward shape of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> do like Dove Products and can&#x27;t think of any varieties or flavors I have not liked since I started purchasing them years</li>
            <li> Had major breakout on my body after using.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend :(</li>
            <li> The packaging was poor.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with Dove.  </li>
            <li> One thing that I find weird is how it leaves my skin with a soap feeling.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Dove.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about trying it because I tend to have oily skin and was afraid this would make me break out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, when \\&quot;I bathe, I find that I do Not leave a dirty, bathtub ring!\\</li>
            <li> Was just waiting for this wash to get over:(</li>
            <li> and i hated the smell)  </li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>

            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice any difference to my skin after trying this product two times a day for over a week. It&#x27;s smells fantastic and is a great value, but I found that my skin was better moisturized after using any old oatmeal based body wash. Buy it and try it - if you don&#x27;t like it all you lost was $5.</li>
            <li> This is far and away the best smelling soap I have ever showered with!</li>
            <li> I love Dove body wash, nothing else compares. It makes a good lather and doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin like other soaps. It is on the pricey side compared to other body washes, but it&#x27;s worth it to me. Don&#x27;t skimp and buy the generic, it doesn&#x27;t even compare to the real thing.</li>
            <li> Brought this at walmart &amp; I&#x27;m in love with this stuff. I&#x27;ve used Dove soap before of course but never the body wash I brought this because I was in search of a new body wash since the one I was using for a few years seem to be harder &amp; harder to find I even tried to see if I could find it here on Amazon with no luck so the search was on saw alot of good reviews for this particular scent so thought I would give it a try so glad I did (plus its Dove you cant go wrong right?). It is a little on the pricer side from what I use to buy but it is more thicker than the other one so it will last longer. I will definitely buy this again &amp; again &amp; again.</li>
            <li> I like this product,  it is gentle on the skin plus it has a pleasant smell.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have 3 favorite brands and though I like this brand, this was not my favorite scent.  It freshens you but does not leave any scent on you.</li>
            <li> great cheap body wash. does not dry out my skin, and the smell is really refreshing. does what it promises.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and leaves my skin soft, which is nice because my skin is naturally rather dry.  I love this!</li>
            <li> This body wash has a mild soothing fragrance and doesn&#x27;t dry skin. It moisturizes skin to a decent extent (doesn&#x27;t leave skin too dry or too sticky). Overall good value for money.</li>
            <li> I will be using this for a long time before I look for any thing else.&lt;br /&gt;1. The fragrance is soft and subtle, not in the least bit over powering.&lt;br /&gt;2. It has a creamy smooth lather, even in my disgusting Southern California water&lt;br /&gt;3. After drying, my skin is velvety soft and smooth and there is still a very soft and lingering fragrance----again not over powering---this is a great body wash</li>
            <li> Product works well for sensitive skin.  Love the scent, if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago when I was looking for a new body wash.  I was hesitant about trying it because I tend to have oily skin and was afraid this would make me break out.  I was plesantly suprised when it didn&#x27;t break me out, and my skin is actually more clear after using it for a few weeks.  I cannot stand heavily perfumed body washes and this one is not overwhelming.  Although it was a bit on the pricy side compared to what I normally use, I will continue to use this in the future.</li>
            <li> I love to shower with this body wash.  It makes my skin feels so soft.  I feel clean and fresh! I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess, what, I updated my comments on 10/9/2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use both the Dove Body Wash, go fresh, Rebalance, Plum and Sakura Blossom, 24 Ounce with the \\&quot;Olay 2-In-1 Advanced Ribbons Soothing Cr&amp;egrave;me + Advanced Moisture Body Wash 18 Oz (Pack of 3.)\\&quot; The experience was both revitalizing, invigorating and rejuvenating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when \\&quot;I bathe, I find that I do Not leave a dirty, bathtub ring!\\&quot; I&#x27;m sold, ring it up and get it to me quickly.  They work fabulously together.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this soap quite a bit. It&#x27;s reach and creamy as Dove soap always is. Creates very nice foam. I like the interesting aroma ingredients it uses. I took one star off because I find the smell a bit too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever.... Got it in one piece and fast too.</li>
            <li> Though the body wash is good, i did not enjoy it as much as i did ...probably had lot more expectations on fragrance. I loved Jasmine &amp;Coconut milk combo better . Was just waiting for this wash to get over:(</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with Dove.  It is great for the skin and leave you soft and smelling nice which give you a nice feeling.  But does not interfer with perfumes or deodrants.  This is alway an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the fragrance and it suds up with only a small amount . The price is also good too. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected&lt;br /&gt;To be</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this body wash...my skin feels so good...there is a noticeable softness to my skin I use very little moisturizer since adding this body wash to my daily routine..i would recommend to family and friends</li>
            <li> This body wash leaves you feeling soft and smooth.  Cleans very well using a small amount at a time.  Love the smell, so glad I made this choice.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, feels great on skin, and unique. Not sure about other places, but I could not find this anywhere else locally.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash, it makes my skin sooo soft and smooth, and the smell is delicious  (Ive tried the pomegranate pink one and i hated the smell)  This is my new fav body wash, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This produces good amount of lather, has good scent and is moisturizing, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last for much time.</li>
            <li> The Boby Wash is thick and smooth and also has a nice smell. I would definately reccoment to a friend.</li>
            <li> I gave this body wash four out of five stars because it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the deoderant does.</li>
            <li> Love the body wash, but hate the awkward shape of the bottle.  When hand are wet, bottle tend to slip out of my hands and land somewhere in the tub.  Very annoying. DOVE you can do better.  Just call me. Suave has a better container...</li>
            <li> ANOTHER ONE OF DOVE&#x27;S GO FRESH, REBALANCE PRODUCT KEEPS YOU FEELING AND SMELLING FRESH THOROUGH OUT THE DAY. I LIKE TAKING MY BATH WITH THIS.</li>
            <li> I love this product .  It not only leaves you feeling clean but your skin is nurtured .  I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way. I had to get used to using less because I felt like I was wasting at the beginning. It really lathers a lot. This particular smell is good, although not my favorite, but that&#x27;s a matter of opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought a goody box of stuff for my daughter who is a single mom and this is one of the things in it. You can&#x27;t complain about this product and the price was as good as Walmart too. It was fun to go shopping on here and add allot of the things you can&#x27;t afford as a single parent to it. She called me up and said MOM what surprise and thank you! I put in many items on here for her and the kids. She runs a child care and even the little kids were excited to open the goody box...lol Thanks for the  great prices too AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I happen to adore the scent of Dove&#x27;s bar soap with this same fragrance, so I bought this thinking it would be less messy. Dove&#x27;s bar soaps always get soft and make a mess. I liked the convenience of liquid soap; however, the scent was far less strong and didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> The size has lasted me over a month, and that is with heaving portions every shower! The smell is lovely and my boyfriend is constantly complimenting me on how yummy I smell.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, and bonus that it&#x27;s my favorite color - purple! Just a little goes a long way on my loofah, will definitely be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scent. I wish I tried it before in shops markets. I had no idea. I couldn&#x27;t use it :/ other than that Dove shower gel is a good product, but next time I will pick a different scent. But you might like it who knows...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Dove Body Wash. And this flavor smells nice. I must have found this to be cheaper than walmart when purchased.</li>
            <li> NOT TO BE USED AS LUBRICANT. It sloughed off some skin and left a burning sensation that lasted for days. I am switching to Dial next time. Otherwise, pleasant smell. Two stars.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance (not overwhelming and does not last all day long like some other heavily perfumed body washes) Even when you can smell a bit of it after a shower, it is pleasant in the room. Not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well. The skin feels soft after the shower and it lathers nicely. We have soft water, so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I do like Dove Products and can&#x27;t think of any varieties or flavors I have not liked since I started purchasing them years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Dove is my go to body wash.  It moisturized great.  I love the scent.  It lasts a while.  Consider trying this product.  I was happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was unsure of the smell because I&#x27;ve never had this one before, but I love the dove products. The smell is great and it stays on me for awhile. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved dove soap, and this is a great smell and moisturizer. About the same as most body washes though.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite bath wash. Shipped quickly and happy. Smells so goood</li>
            <li> Thinking aBout switching to all Dove products. I love this body wash had a great scent and does the job. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> This plum and sakura blossom scented wash is one of our college senior daughter&#x27;s favorites, and the the other one she usually buys is the &#x27;Pomegranate and Lemon Verbena&#x27; scented one ([[ASIN:B0037LGP9E Dove Go Fresh Body Wash, Revive, Pomegranate &amp; Lemon Verbena Scent, 24 oz.]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has always been particular when it comes to facial and body cleansing products and routines, and likes the moisturizing aspects of Dove products very much, but she has never liked bar-style soaps. Given all that, these &#x27;Dove go fresh&#x27; body wash products have become her favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She prefers to use this body wash with man-made loofahs like those from Aquasentials([[ASIN:B001CTQMIC Aquasentials Mesh Pouf Sponge (4 Pack)]]), and finds that the Dove wash does a great job of cleaning, does not dry out her skin, and smells fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a wash that smells great, cleans well and and leaves your skin feeling well hydrated -- our 21 year old highly recommends these to you. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> DOVE IS A BRAND THAT IS SO POPULAR, AND IT LIVES UP TO  IT&#x27;S NAME AND OF COURSE THE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADVERTISMENT. SKIN STAYS SOFT AND MOISTURRIZED. THANKS</li>
            <li> Really like this product and it is a wonderful moisturizer, some will lather more this product does not lather as much as some others I&#x27;ve used by the same maker, but it is far more moisturizing and I completely enjoy it and I think many people would and the scent is just as wonderful.</li>
            <li> just as you would expect at a great price</li>
            <li> I love Dove products and found this plum scent very natural-smelling.  Not overpowering.  It helps keep my skin soft and lasts a long time before I need more.</li>
            <li> Dove body wash, in its various scents, is the only body wash I use anymore.  I have very dry skin, and showering aggravates it, no matter what I use in the shower, but Dove is much better than any other option.</li>
            <li> My best body wash made from dove. The smell was also very good.</li>
            <li> I love how this smells. One thing that I find weird is how it leaves my skin with a soap feeling. I don&#x27;t use bar soap because i do not like how it feels on my skin, it makes my skin feel dry and waxy (if that is the correct word to use). This body wash feel a little like that but not as much. It does smell wonderful in pair with the deodorant its amazing. So i will continue to use since i did purchase 5 bottles.</li>
            <li> Dove body wash never makes my skin feel dry, had a wonderful clean smell.  I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> It smells of fruit and flowers, just amazing. It lathers much better than the previous body wash I tried ([[ASIN:B001MIZMN4 Nivea Touch Of Happiness Moisturizing Body Wash, Orange Blossom, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]], which I also loved). It leaves my skin smelling great. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a better body wash than Nivea, though I&#x27;d still use Nivea. I also appreciate Dove&#x27;s Campaign for Real Beauty; I&#x27;m happy to support a company that helps to improve the quality of my skin, but also build&#x27;s women&#x27;s self esteem.</li>
            <li> smells so good and is easy on the skin and great buy will be buying again thanks again great buy</li>
            <li> Does not have same scent as body mist but leaves skin soft</li>
            <li> The product moisturizes and smells good.The packaging was poor. The bottle of dove was not sealed, only wrapped in a plastic resealable bag. The body wash spilled into the bag, seeped out of the bag, and made a mess inside of the cardboard box which by the way had my grandson&#x27;s toy in it. Luckily it didn&#x27;t spill all over the toy.</li>
            <li> I am use to using olay , but ordered this because it was on sale at the time. I love that clean refreshing feeling after using this.</li>
            <li> I needed something for the rash/itching on my back and after reading reviews decided to give this a try.  So far it&#x27;s working very well and I intend to make it my go-to body wash.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent...I&#x27;ve tried several and unfortunately this is one of the few you can&#x27;t subscribe to.  Please add the option to subscribe this scent!!</li>
            <li> Dove Body wash in Plum smells ravishing. This scent moisturizes well and makes taking a shower a true spa experience.</li>
            <li> Well, my review title about says it all. This is a wonderful body wash. It smells absolutely wonderful. It is the most absolutely perfect Plum and floral scent I have ever come across. I usually do not buy fruit or food scented body products. No strawberry scented lotions and I do not want to smell like a cupcake either. This body wash is so very different though. It is such a beautiful, feminine scent. It actually smells \\&quot;juicy\\&quot; - If that&#x27;s even possible?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is not an overly sweet fruity smell like candy etc... it is more of a softer fruity smell that I cannot even describe other than to say it is great. Dove totally came up with a winning scent on this one. It is the perfect mix of fruit and floral. There isn&#x27;t too much of either one, yet you can smell a little of both and they blend so perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash lathers up so nicely. It is a nice creamy lather that rinses easily and does not leave a residue. It does not dry your skin either - instead my skin feels so soft and smooth after using it. I bought this on a whim after seeing it here during a great sale. There were many different Dove items on sale, but me being obsessed with purple and plum in general, well I just had to pick this one and I am so glad I did. I will buy more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter with sensitive skin used it one day as well and she had no irritations from it. That says alot because she can only use a select few products without her skin breaking out in rashes or bumps of some sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended! The smell is yummy and lush without being overpowering and it is so very nice to your skin as well.</li>
            <li> Works great but I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> This body wash leaves my skin clean, soft and supple. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it. I love the scent and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the thing about Dove.  It&#x27;s great for the value - it doesn&#x27;t dry you out - and depending on the scent you get - it&#x27;s unisex.  How many body washes can say that?</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling body wash. Dove is my favorite bodywash and soap product...</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing. Not available in the u.k yet so really pleased to get this product shipped from u.s.a</li>
            <li> Very rich lather, nice smell.  Would buy again and like all the Dove products.  The price was a good selling point too and got quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the camp of people who prefer grassy natural scents like from Aveda, so the ultra-sweet saccharine scent was a bit much for me.  I had expected it to be less of a fruit-roll-up scent and more of a floral, so I was surprised when I used this for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works ok as a body wash, it does the job as any body soap.</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT !! I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE MAKES YOU FEEL CLEAN TOO ! I GOT THIS AT A GREAT PRICE TOO , HELPED FILL IN FOR MY FREE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> I like all the Dove Body Washes winter dry skin  works great and summer just makes you&lt;br /&gt;feel good.</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling and very soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> I always look at Amazons inventory and price prior to heading out to make a purchase, and this one is a winner on a&lt;br /&gt;Amzn. Great price and the convenience of home delivery. The product leaves your skin baby soft after a shower and smells great, not too overpowering .</li>
            <li> Nice smell and gentle on the skins. Skin feels soft.  Best body wash!&lt;br /&gt;Dermatologies recommended this product for my son with sensitive skin &amp; allergies.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s price is great as well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scent.. Also leaves soap residue on my skin.  Had major breakout on my body after using.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend :(</li>
            <li> Smells awesome like its body spray and it keeps my skin healthy and soft. I use a body puff also with this and I love it</li>
            <li> The plum and sakura blossom is a nice scent. It does smell a little bit like perfume but it&#x27;s not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash! It smells very pleasant. The fresh smell of plum and sakura just refresh my tired body.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell of this. All dove products are amazing but the smell, I could not bare.</li>
            <li> The two scents sounded like they would smell good, and I ordered this to make an order $35 for the free shipping. I do not like the combination of the scents, but I know that the product itself is good, as I have previously used Dove body wash. I ended up giving it to my daughter, who does not have a problem with the scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because thought I remembered liking some other variations of Dove Body Wash I have tried in the past and because this was on sale &amp; very cheap. It would probably be fine for some others but didn&#x27;t have as &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; a texture I prefer and didn&#x27;t seem to have as much after-bath skin softening/moisturizing effect as some other Dove Body Wash products or those under a couple of other brand names within similar price range. I would buy again, on sale, (&amp; with no shipping fees) unless I could get what I prefer for close to same price. I did like the scent.</li>
            <li> This wash smells so fresh and clean. It also moisturizes and clean great. I love this Dove body wash.</li>
            <li> Ah I need more of this! smells sooooo amazing</li>
            <li> I love this body wash! It smells amazing and makes my skin feel wonderful! I was a little put off because it came in a Target shipping box, if I had known I ordered it from Target I would have bought it in the store and saved three dollars. Either way, very happy with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> Always loved it and it is nice to be able to order it and have it shipped to my house because it feels like I never have time to go shopping for myself.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product! I would definitely purchase again. This body wash awakens the senses. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Dove.</li>
            <li> MAKES MY SKIN FEELS SO SOFT</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s skin turns dry with regular soap. This is her answer. On Amazon, you can get several fragrances and mix them up a bit. She loves the product.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell!! I&#x27;ve never used body wash, and wanted to try it, so I bought this a 2 hand loofa. This dove makes my skin SOOO soft!! I bought another one, it&#x27;s coconut one, it smells amazing, none of doves smells are over whelming, just a hint of smell, I can&#x27;t smell it after I&#x27;ve finished showered and gotten dressed, so don&#x27;t worry if your concerned about the scent. I really do like this Dove, makes my skin soft, but I&#x27;m looking for something that has a stronger scent, something I can smell way after I&#x27;ve showered. Anyone know of a body wash with a nice floral scent that stays? Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells and the sudsy lusciousness of the product and seems to be good for my skin too. I will use this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old geezer with dry skin and drop dander worse than Pig Pen. I tried just about every body wash known to man or beast and ran across this product when visiting my niece. Needless to say, this product works great, cleans well, smells good, and has totally cured my flake ridden body and I no longer leave a dander trail around the house. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This body wash is very moisturizing, and a great bang for your buck. A little goes a verrry long way so just be careful how much you put on your loofah.</li>
