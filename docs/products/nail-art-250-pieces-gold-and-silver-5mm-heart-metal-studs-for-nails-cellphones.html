            <li> It only works if you apply directly to the middle of the nail, in my case.</li>
            <li> These are small enough to fit on small nails.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> I mean, it looks pretty its just not really functional for long wear unless you apply on fake nails or have wider nails.</li>
            <li> I would say evenly half and half of each color.</li>
            <li> (2 little bags)</li>
            <li> Hearts come in gold and silver and in small ziplock bags?</li>
            <li> They didnt stay on my nails that well, but its hard to get something that does.</li>
            <li> pachaging was very small</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>

            <li> Good really good my girl loves it she will buy more she recommend it everything is like they show in the pic</li>
            <li> There was the exact amount. The hearts looked just like the picture. Other than the quality I loved the reasonable price.</li>

            <li> Super product, better price, great service!  Change my nails weekly, these make every color fun! Don&#x27;t wait to try them they came in as told me they would</li>
            <li> Needs things like this for school projects and to practice on things that she learns in order to get proficient at what she does</li>
            <li> So cute! Can&#x27;t wait to try them</li>
            <li> They are the perfect size for my nail art. Silver and gold will always be the best choices to go with whatever I may do on my nails. The price was really good too, would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> These are really cute, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. They always fall off my nails (I only use polish to put them on), but there are plenty to fix them with.</li>
            <li> I never got my product.It would be nice to still get it or my money back as soon as possible,due to the fact this is going on 2 months of waiting.</li>
            <li> these are so cute. they look great in encapsulated acrylic! they come mixed together you have to separate them yourself</li>
            <li> I love these studs, and so do my little girls! Apply a layer of top coat every few days, and they stay really well.</li>
            <li> the only problem i had was tha the package was not sealed all the way and they were hard to find and to pick lol</li>
            <li> I really like this studs they r really pretty. Which can be used in many things not only with nails</li>
            <li> These are such a great value, and are the perfect size. They also stay on for a very long time and look very nice!</li>
            <li> Its okay, I guess. Its too big for us people with smaller hands and nails. It won&#x27;t fit 100% of the way so it gets caught up by the corners and comes off. I mean, it looks pretty its just not really functional for long wear unless you apply on fake nails or have wider nails. It only works if you apply directly to the middle of the nail, in my case. I might repurchase this products for clients, but defintely not for me.</li>
            <li> absolutely love the product can&#x27;t wait to use it can&#x27;t wait to do my friends nails so I can make them look even more better than now</li>
            <li> These are really cute. They didnt stay on my nails that well, but its hard to get something that does.</li>
            <li> nothing says love like hearts. easy to used</li>
            <li> I ordered these to use for my nails. Just starting out with trying a little nail art and thought that these hearts would be something cute to put on my nails. Will order more in the future. One thing I didn&#x27;t do was count the number of hearts in the bag. The bag is small, so I don&#x27;t know if there are exactly 250 pieces in it. Come to think of it, I&#x27;m going to count them and see.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t quite come with 250 (a few less), but for ~$0.75, totally worth it! :)</li>
            <li> theseGold &amp; Silver studs are super!! I wish I had gotten 2 packages....SUPER DUPER Price for a great product. HIGHLY recommend these.</li>
            <li> Great large size. Exactly as described. I use these for nail art and everyone just loves them. Price was great too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited about this new product! I will order more!  I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they are so pretty.</li>
            <li> Very cute and easy to use nail art. I bought these in the star shape as well and I love them. They stay on really well with gel topcoat</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get these in the mail.  I wish they were separated by color (silver/gold) but they are a good size and quality.</li>
            <li> Great service. Arrived early. Looks great. Hearts come in gold and silver and in small ziplock bags? Overall great,for the price.</li>
            <li> Pretty much what you see is what you get what can I say their flimsy pieces of tin that are really overpriced</li>
            <li> very nice and the perfect size. They take some getting use to. At first they bugged me but now I forget I&#x27;m wearing them. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> these studs are so tiny and you get so many of them in silver and gold. good quality for a great price!</li>
            <li> I love the way they look, but I haven&#x27;t used them yet. I think they will make for nice nail art.</li>
            <li> These are small enough to fit on small nails.  I love these, they add to the nails.  I&#x27;ve used the gold and the silver on black polish and they looked great!  they stayed on really well I dropped them on where I wanted them on tacky polish (polish was not very wet just sticky) then just 2 top coats.  I got so many compliments on them.</li>
            <li> good size for your nail i really like that i got both silver and gold hearts!!! i could not belive the price awesome price</li>
            <li> I love them! They are so cute! I can&#x27;t wait to use them! When I paint my nails next I&#x27;m going to use them for that!</li>
            <li> For pennies you get a ton of hearts. They are mixed gold/silver. I would say evenly half and half of each color. They are cute and I&#x27;ll probably never use all of them, there are so many.</li>
            <li> They fall off to easily, but other then that they are super cute and a great little something extra for your nails!!</li>
            <li> love it! exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> It is big size for nail</li>
            <li> They stay on for about a week, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> looks great on my nails,only thing its not flexible on top of the nail.</li>
