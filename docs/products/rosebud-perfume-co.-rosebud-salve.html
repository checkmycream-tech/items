    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent salve for your lips!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the best!  </li>
            <li>One of the best things is its scent-rose, but</li>
            <li>It comes in a delightfully retro tin containing .8 oz of the product.</li>
            <li>Well, I tried and I did see just what&#x27;s so wonderful about this multitasking salve.     </li>
            <li>This is a VERY good value.</li>
            <li>and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>What a great deal at under 10.00 &lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li>Your grandmother would be proud.</li>
            <li>reminds me of buckley&#x27;s cough syrup in the sense that their unforgettable slogan is unfortunately fairly applicable.</li>
            <li>It does not make a good lip gloss because it is the type that will slide off lips onto your chin.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied however</li>
            <li>The tin is very cute too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to etch my name into one, so I can make sure my husband doesn&#x27;t take off with it!</li>
            <li>moisturizes and thikens them up while imparting a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>not perfumey rose.</li>
            <li>Kind of a powdery scent.</li>
            <li>I saw it advertised in a Shopping magazine and saw that it got nice reviews.  </li>
            <li>I love the packaging of this, and I will be honest, that is the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>I only own one, but it is truly wonderful.</li>
            <li>Boy does she know best or what, years later this stuff is still popular and like always still work miracles.</li>
            <li>It has a very light rose-like taste and smell, isn&#x27;t to gooey or gloppy.</li>
            <li>Which is awesome because it last forever.</li>
            <li>I still love what it does for my skin and lips and now my husband is a huge fan too!</li>
            <li>The smell is not my favorite</li>
            <li>Sometimes the simple things are still the best.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>My lips love it.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of the product and the smell.</li>
            <li>what was even better, was it&#x27;s versatility.  </li>
            <li>I have never found anything more moisturizing for my lips and believe me, I am a lip balm queen.</li>
            <li>if you like this smell of rosewater, i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it.  </li>
            <li>and it had melted, the top had somehow come off and was all over my purse.  </li>
            <li>I love rosebud salve...  </li>
            <li>and my lips look naturally more colored and glossy.  </li>
            <li>Just the right consistency, good scent, not sticky at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price and lasts forever, I don&#x27;t think I can live without this product anymore.  </li>
            <li>and I found it to be nothing very special.</li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s fine for heels, elbows,</li>
            <li>I love it as a light chapstick</li>
            <li>First of all, the smell is quite nice, rose-y and baby powder-y.</li>
            <li>I love love love the taste/smell (it smells like a mix between a new baby doll and a bouquet of roses).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a wonderful product, whose only downfall, may be that it&#x27;s heat sensitive.  </li>
            <li>a lip balm, this works great and has a it also works well on dry feet (paired with cotton socks before you go to sleep) and chapped hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful for dry, chapped lips, the tin is, indeed, cute, and above all things, it reminds me of my childhood</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too special.  </li>
            <li>It has a different consistancy and stays put fairly well.</li>
            <li>This delightful salve works beautifully as a delicately scented lip gloss/balm.</li>
            <li>And I have to say it&#x27;s really proved priceless as a cuticle and around-the-nail moisturizer (put some on, leave it for a little while, then massage in).</li>
            <li>Apparently, now Rosebud Salve is a trendy, hip thing to use.  </li>
            <li>I feel like there are better moisturizers/salves out there (like burts bees cuticle lemon butter), but the cute packaging is worth having lying around and it is fun to use occasionally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer too, though I like it more in small areas like your elbows or parts of your hands.</li>
            <li>You really can use it for just about anything - works great on elbows, dry heels, lips -</li>
            <li>It really makes my lips super smooth before I put lipstick, or I wear it alone</li>
            <li>It does its job very well as a lip balm since it&#x27;s light and not sticky.</li>
            <li>Rosebud Salve is definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li>That is rare.</li>
            <li>I love that the packaging has stayed the same after all these years.  </li>
            <li>It does melt if you leave it in a hot place, like your car.</li>
            <li>This is not my first preference for a moisturizer/salve.</li>
            <li>It was first invented in 1892.</li>
            <li>I first tried this salve a few months ago, and loved</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>i purchased a tin of rosebud salve and had it in my pocketbook on a hot day, went to reach into my purse to get it</li>
            <li>I confess that I first tried this product because I wanted to see what all the hype was about surrounding this \\&quot;cult favorite\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it to prep skin like most people, but I do use it just as a regular lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Besides all of the other uses mentioned, it is also the quick fix for an &#x27;irritated by too many tissues&#x27; nose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s not a bad product, I don&#x27;t see myself buying it again, as it just doesn&#x27;t make my skin as soft as a plant-based product does.</li>
            <li>It tends to dry them out more, instead of hydrating them.</li>
            <li>It does work well as an overnight moisturizer for dry hands, but doesn&#x27;t absorb well into skin, so make sure you have gloves to sleep in if you plan to use it for that purpose.</li>
            <li>a tin handy to keep lips smooth, hydrate dry cuticles and to moisten and protect dry or chapped skin.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be losing much.</li>
            <li>Another tip, apply a light coating on you lashes (especially if u use mascara&#x3D;</li>
            <li>Much lighter in texture than carmex-</li>
            <li>Also, it does the whole drying out thing to my lips.</li>
            <li>tastes similar to rose petals mixed with baby powder and vasoline.</li>
            <li>This mild formula contains essential oils and is always soothing and healing.</li>
            <li>i lick my lips alot and this is not something you particularly want on them while you&#x27;re doing it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m now a satisfied owner of TWO pots of this little wonder salve.</li>
            <li>alas, being beautiful does require some sacrifices however and lip licking is one i&#x27;m will to curb as this product does wonders at softening lips - especially in the winter time.</li>
            <li>It isnt to greasy but its nice and thick so use sparingly.</li>
            <li>But when I did have extremely dry lips as a side-effect of medication, this was the only thing that was able to moisturize my lips.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for something a little different and effective, than this is for you.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised with how well this product worked for me.</li>
            <li>It has a very soft scent.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive lips.</li>
            <li>I saw a woman using Rosebud on the subway one day, then later saw it recommended in a fashion magazine, all of which I thought was funny since I remember putting it on my \\&quot;boo</li>
            <li>Despite that, it has a clean, light scent and is less \\&quot;slimey\\&quot; than other petrol products (i.e. vaseline)</li>
            <li>It is also useful for sealing in moisture on stubbornly dry skin (soles, knees, elbows) &lt;</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Giving only 4 stars because I&#x27;m not sure how this formula will perform in warm weather - for instance</li>
            <li>Be sure to keep it away from heat as it does tend to soften and could potentially cause a mess.</li>
            <li>As an adult, on any problem areas.  </li>
            <li>I was quite underwhelmed with it, and that surprised me.</li>
            <li>It gets soft if you carry it in your pocket.</li>
            <li>In fact, I use it so much that I found that carrying it around in my purse and taking it out when I needed it only meant I either forgot it home when I wanted to use it at the office or viceversa</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The little tin is cute and for the price it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>I also have very chapped hands due to the cold climate and I use this salve on the top of my hands which soothes and helps the chapped areas tremendously!</li>
            <li>and I give it extra points since, unlike other tins, it&#x27;s always easy to open.</li>
            <li>Not only is Rosebud great for the obvious reasons, but I am obsessed with it as an eyebrow gel.</li>
            <li>but it also works well at shriking zits, getting rid dry skin and calming reddened areas that accompany very fickle skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the original Rosebud Salve consistantly over the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li>My great-grandmother used to sell Rosebud for extra money back in the early to mid 1900&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Predictably, though, it melts when left in the hot car, but it is still usable.</li>

            <li> Excellent salve for your lips!  Don&#x27;t bother with any other product, this does the job too well.  I don&#x27;t use it that often during the day because I just put it on before going to sleep so my lips don&#x27;t get dry throughout the day.  But when I did have extremely dry lips as a side-effect of medication, this was the only thing that was able to moisturize my lips.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!  Just the right consistency, good scent, not sticky at all.  You really can use it for just about anything - works great on elbows, dry heels, lips - basically anyplace that&#x27;s dry.  I have one at work, at home, in my purse, in my car...it&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m a little obsessed with the Rosebud...&lt;br /&gt;Giving only 4 stars because I&#x27;m not sure how this formula will perform in warm weather - for instance, if I keep one in my car will it melt all over everything?</li>
            <li> As well as others, I bought this salve because I heard of its  cult status. At five bucks I figured even if I didnt like it I wouldn&#x27;t be losing much. I was very satisfied however, I have very dry cheeks, and putting this salve on at night left my cheeks silky and glowing in the morning. It isnt to greasy but its nice and thick so use sparingly. Which is awesome because it last forever. Have you seen how big the tin is, unlike the decieving Cargo lipgloss tin. Tssk Tssk. Another tip, apply a light coating on you lashes (especially if u use mascara&#x3D;drying),it moisturizes and thikens them up while imparting a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> My great-grandmother used to sell Rosebud for extra money back in the early to mid 1900&#x27;s. I grew up using it. As a baby, for diaper rash. As a child on scuffed knees and elbows. As a teen on the lips. As an adult, on any problem areas.  There are always several tins around the house. I&#x27;ve had to etch my name into one, so I can make sure my husband doesn&#x27;t take off with it! There&#x27;s a reason why my family has been using it for decades!</li>
            <li> I only own one, but it is truly wonderful. Besides all of the other uses mentioned, it is also the quick fix for an &#x27;irritated by too many tissues&#x27; nose. Much lighter in texture than carmex-another one of my standbys. One of the best things is its scent-rose, but not perfumey rose.</li>
            <li> I like this product for dry cudicles, feet, knees, and elbows, but not neccessary on my lips. It tends to dry them out more, instead of hydrating them.</li>
            <li> For use on dry hands, I didn&#x27;t like the sheen and slight stickiness it left that looked like I&#x27;d used a product containing vaseline/petrolatum in it. Aveno&#x27;s products moisturize a *lot* longer while keeping your skin looking and feeling soft and supple, not sticky, and Burt&#x27;s Bees makes small pots of yummy hand creme if you need tiny portable containers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for lip salve, well, save your money and use Bonne Bell, Carmex, or even a tinted Blistex. I didn&#x27;t like the results of using it as lip balm either, sad to say, this didn&#x27;t moisturize or stay on as long as the above brands and had zero tint.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine for heels, elbows, Kleenex-aggravated nostrils but for a hand cream and lip help, it&#x27;s my opinion there are much better and a lot less expensive little pots and tubes than this stuff. I was quite underwhelmed with it, and that surprised me. Definitely not the \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; I&#x27;m going to carry around with me.</li>
            <li> I used this salve as a child and thought it was no longer made.  I found it by chance this site and immediately ordered.  I still love what it does for my skin and lips and now my husband is a huge fan too! I love that the packaging has stayed the same after all these years.  It&#x27;s healing properties are unequaled.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 tins about 3 years ago and lost one at the airport this winter going through security.  Now my other is getting low so these do last a long time.  I had a really bad headcold last week and used this on my nose to prevent it getting raw and it worked great.  My cold is gone and I don&#x27;t have a peeling, flakey nose to show for it now.  It does melt if you leave it in a hot place, like your car.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging of this, and I will be honest, that is the reason I bought it. The smell is not my favorite but it is tolerable. Kind of a powdery scent. It does not make a good lip gloss because it is the type that will slide off lips onto your chin. Also, it does the whole drying out thing to my lips. I guess the reason it dries them is because it&#x27;s petrolatum based. It does work well as an overnight moisturizer for dry hands, but doesn&#x27;t absorb well into skin, so make sure you have gloves to sleep in if you plan to use it for that purpose. I feel like there are better moisturizers/salves out there (like burts bees cuticle lemon butter), but the cute packaging is worth having lying around and it is fun to use occasionally. This is not my first preference for a moisturizer/salve.</li>
            <li> I see why Rosebud is a \\&quot;cult favorite\\&quot;. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it. It has a very light rose-like taste and smell, isn&#x27;t to gooey or gloppy. I put it on my lips every night like a ritual. And no, it&#x27;s not the same as Vasaline. It has a different consistancy and stays put fairly well. The little tin is cute and for the price it lasts a very long time. Sometimes the simple things are still the best. I do find it too sticky for my cutlicles though. But that&#x27;s okay. My lips love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because we live in NH and the winter can be harsh on the lips and skin. I was very surprised with how well this product worked for me. I love the consistency of the product and the smell. It has a very soft scent. I use it on my lips daily and I use it on my childrens lips as well (ranging from ages 17 to 3.) I also have very chapped hands due to the cold climate and I use this salve on the top of my hands which soothes and helps the chapped areas tremendously! &lt;br /&gt;I definitely will buy this product again when I run out, which doesn&#x27;t seem to be anytime soon. I use this sparingly as it has a thicker consistency.</li>
            <li> Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve is an all-purpose skin preparation. It was first invented in 1892. This delightful salve works beautifully as a delicately scented lip gloss/balm. It comes in a delightfully retro tin containing .8 oz of the product. One container lasts me for about 10 months with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep a tin handy to keep lips smooth, hydrate dry cuticles and to moisten and protect dry or chapped skin. This mild formula contains essential oils and is always soothing and healing. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Not only is Rosebud great for the obvious reasons, but I am obsessed with it as an eyebrow gel. It keeps every brow in place without stickiness or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Rosebud Salve is definitely worth trying.  I first tried this salve a few months ago, and loved it&#x27;s floral fragrance, but what was even better, was it&#x27;s versatility.  I began using it, on my dry cracked hands, but later used it on my lips, elbows and feet.  I even used it to treat my son&#x27;s diaper rash.  It&#x27;s really a wonderful product, whose only downfall, may be that it&#x27;s heat sensitive.  It gets soft if you carry it in your pocket.</li>
            <li> reminds me of buckley&#x27;s cough syrup in the sense that their unforgettable slogan is unfortunately fairly applicable. i lick my lips alot and this is not something you particularly want on them while you&#x27;re doing it. tastes similar to rose petals mixed with baby powder and vasoline. alas, being beautiful does require some sacrifices however and lip licking is one i&#x27;m will to curb as this product does wonders at softening lips - especially in the winter time. not only that but it also works well at shriking zits, getting rid dry skin and calming reddened areas that accompany very fickle skin. i swear by it and reccomend it for almost any skin problem. not just an emoliant and very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I LOOOOOOOOOOOVE this product! I have never found anything more moisturizing for my lips and believe me, I am a lip balm queen. Plus, I have owned this one tin for 6 months and have yet to lose it! That is rare.</li>
            <li> When I was little gram always used the rosebud salve on my lips and boo boos anywhere she felt there was a need or dry spot. Boy does she know best or what, years later this stuff is still popular and like always still work miracles. I will never go without it, this little wonder does the trick from burns to chapped lips all the way to cuts, and of course everything in between. What a great deal at under 10.00 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> As everyone else has said, I use this stuff everywhere. I love it as a light chapstick and I have very sensitive lips. This doesnt irritate them at all. I also use it on my cuticles, as hand lotion when i can&#x27;t find any anywhere, and also on my eye lids for a little sheen instead of eye shadow. Just kinda brightens up the face. A little goes a long way, and I love this stuff. I have two of them, so just in case I misplace one, I can find the other. A definite must-have in my opinion</li>
            <li> I bought this to see what all the hype was about and I found it to be nothing very special. it just seems like scented vaseline to me.</li>
            <li> This Rosebud Salve instantly softened my dried lips, while adding a pretty, subtle shine! I love love love the taste/smell (it smells like a mix between a new baby doll and a bouquet of roses). Predictably, though, it melts when left in the hot car, but it is still usable. Like it says on the tin, it isn&#x27;t only for lips, and I&#x27;ve used it on everything from my cuticles to dried elbows to dry patches on my face. This is a VERY good value.</li>
            <li> I bought this salve not noticing that it was petrol-based, which I typicaly try to avoid. Despite that, it has a clean, light scent and is less \\&quot;slimey\\&quot; than other petrol products (i.e. vaseline) &lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t like using it for a lip balm (taste), I have found that it is very soothing on the raw, bruised knuckles that I get from the punching bag. It is also useful for sealing in moisture on stubbornly dry skin (soles, knees, elbows) &lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s not a bad product, I don&#x27;t see myself buying it again, as it just doesn&#x27;t make my skin as soft as a plant-based product does.</li>
            <li> i think i bought this one for the nostalgic packaging, and the lofty claims.  it&#x27;s not too special.  if you like this smell of rosewater, i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it.  it&#x27;s pretty much useless for any other purpose. ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original Rosebud Salve consistantly over the past 5 years.  I saw it advertised in a Shopping magazine and saw that it got nice reviews.  Obviously it snagged me from the get go.  I buy 2 now everytime I replenish my stock.  Aside from my wallet and keys, this is the only other mainstay in my purse.     I&#x27;ll never wander.</li>
            <li> My mother used to give this to me to use on...well...just about anything.  I&#x27;m addicted to lip balm/Chapstick, and I always carry some with me.  I saw a woman using Rosebud on the subway one day, then later saw it recommended in a fashion magazine, all of which I thought was funny since I remember putting it on my \\&quot;boo boos\\&quot; as a kid.  Apparently, now Rosebud Salve is a trendy, hip thing to use.  Honestly, it&#x27;s a great product.  It&#x27;s wonderful for dry, chapped lips, the tin is, indeed, cute, and above all things, it reminds me of my childhood everytime I go to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something a little different and effective, than this is for you.  Go for it.  Your grandmother would be proud.</li>
            <li> i purchased a tin of rosebud salve and had it in my pocketbook on a hot day, went to reach into my purse to get it and it had melted, the top had somehow come off and was all over my purse.  be warned - it comes in a metal tin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;as a lip balm, this works great and has a it also works well on dry feet (paired with cotton socks before you go to sleep) and chapped hands.</li>
            <li> I confess that I first tried this product because I wanted to see what all the hype was about surrounding this \\&quot;cult favorite\\&quot;. Well, I tried and I did see just what&#x27;s so wonderful about this multitasking salve.     First of all, the smell is quite nice, rose-y and baby powder-y. The tin is very cute too and I give it extra points since, unlike other tins, it&#x27;s always easy to open. Be sure to keep it away from heat as it does tend to soften and could potentially cause a mess. It does its job very well as a lip balm since it&#x27;s light and not sticky. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer too, though I like it more in small areas like your elbows or parts of your hands. And I have to say it&#x27;s really proved priceless as a cuticle and around-the-nail moisturizer (put some on, leave it for a little while, then massage in). Some other reviewers have recommended trying it on dry feet, I may try that some time. I guess the sky&#x27;s the limit!    In fact, I use it so much that I found that carrying it around in my purse and taking it out when I needed it only meant I either forgot it home when I wanted to use it at the office or viceversa so I did what I had to do and I&#x27;m now a satisfied owner of TWO pots of this little wonder salve.</li>
            <li> I love rosebud salve...  I don&#x27;t use it to prep skin like most people, but I do use it just as a regular lip balm.  It really makes my lips super smooth before I put lipstick, or I wear it alone and my lips look naturally more colored and glossy.  It&#x27;s a great price and lasts forever, I don&#x27;t think I can live without this product anymore.  I swipe it one several times during the day, whenever the thought pops in my head.</li>
