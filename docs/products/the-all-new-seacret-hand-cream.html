            <li>I have used several of the Seacret products and they are all great.  </li>
            <li>It is non oily and leaves my hands so smooth.</li>
            <li>My new hand cream by Seacret is infused with apricot and chamomile and aloe or something and makes my hands smell warm and fresh to continue making my experience at work better.</li>
            <li>I purchased the original hand cream at a kiosk at the mall</li>
            <li>I use many Seacret products from their amazing Facial and Body Skin Care Line.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly so that you do not leave oil on things.  </li>

            <li>I introduced her to it when I brought some home as a present from the mall and when she had used it all up and needed more</li>
            <li>Amazing and half the price of their mall kiosk.</li>
            <li>For me it works much better to help solve my dry chapped hands.</li>
            <li>&#x27;ve been using this product for over 7 years now and really like it as it does not leave a greasy or &amp;</li>
            <li>This product works for smooth, younger looking skin immediately.  </li>
            <li>The cream absorbs fast and hands are not greasy.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I purchased it at the mall when I was accosted by a kiosk salesman and I ended up spending far too much money on other products, most of which I never ended up using.</li>
            <li>Subtle fragrance and good moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to soften hands as well as the older version.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>The old version worked very well.</li>
            <li>My wife is a busy hairdresser and somewhat of a Guru where beauty products are concerned.</li>
            <li>This new version is extremely perfumed, overpowering really, so if you are sensitive to perfumes you probably won&#x27;t care for this cream.</li>
            <li>at the same time it keeps your hands soft for a very long time.  </li>

            <li> I have used this product for a while, switching from Aveda&#x27;s Hand Relief. For me it works much better to help solve my dry chapped hands. Worth the price and competitive with Aveda.</li>
            <li> Love This Hand Cream Makes My Hands Soft Don&#x27;t Need to Use Much My Hands Were So Dry And Flakey. I would Recommend This To My Friends</li>
            <li> I have used several of the Seacret products and they are all great.  This one is no exception.  Subtle fragrance and good moisturizing. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> &#x27;ve been using this product for over 7 years now and really like it as it does not leave a greasy or &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; feeling. I used to buy it from the company itself and originally from a kiosk in the Galleria Mall, But this company is less expensive and faster. The best body/hand lotion PERIOD.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is the best!  It goes into your skin quickly and leaves it feeling so smooth!</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Prompt delivery. A great saving was made.  I hadn&#x27;t tried this product before but it smells nice and absorbs into the skin quickly.  Will buy this product again.  Another great product by Seacret skincare.</li>
            <li> I chose this product out because it seemed to cover all the necessary aspects of hand lotion that I needed. I used to use my regular hand lotion that went with the dishwash soap. My new hand cream by Seacret is infused with apricot and chamomile and aloe or something and makes my hands smell warm and fresh to continue making my experience at work better.</li>
            <li> my hands get very dry from constantly washing dishes  I am almost out so guarding it closely &amp; will order more asap</li>
            <li> Best hand cream I have ever used</li>
            <li> This hand cream feels great and the fragrance is nice too!  I even use it on my legs and feet too!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brand mainly because it dries so quickly and at the same time it keeps your hands soft for a very long time.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the hand lotion but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a Mall Kiosk some time ago.  I misplaced it and had been using it very sparingly.  I was devistated I didn&#x27;t have it available and was grateful to see good pricing at Amazon.com.  This product works for smooth, younger looking skin immediately.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the body lotion and foot cream.  I previously used the hand cream on my feet.  I will use this exclusively for my hands now.</li>
            <li> Just love this product, they work great and smell wonderful, and make ur skin feel awesome! Will definitely purchase this line again!</li>
            <li> Why, oh why, do companies insist on changing products that are perfect to begin with? I purchased the original hand cream at a kiosk at the mall and it was so wonderful. This new version is extremely perfumed, overpowering really, so if you are sensitive to perfumes you probably won&#x27;t care for this cream. Very strong aroma. It doesn&#x27;t seem to soften hands as well as the older version. The old version worked very well. Sure do with they hadn&#x27;t changed. I will not purchase this product again. Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I use the cream often. It has nice smell and makes hands feel smooth and fresh.The cream absorbs fast and hands are not greasy. recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> My wife is a busy hairdresser and somewhat of a Guru where beauty products are concerned. She simply reckons that this is the best hand cream she has ever used. The main plus being that it moisturizes without leaving your skin greasy. I introduced her to it when I brought some home as a present from the mall and when she had used it all up and needed more I turned to Amazon to see if I could get a better deal than the cost from the supplier&#x27;s website. I did. Lesson learned. Amazon sells a lot more than just books these days.</li>
            <li> Amazing and half the price of their mall kiosk. Works wonders on eczema.  Oh and it smells great, highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream.
