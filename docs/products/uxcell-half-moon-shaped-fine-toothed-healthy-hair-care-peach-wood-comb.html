            <li>I don&#x27;t get static either when I comb my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This comb has nice light fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>I recommended it to my friends. :)</li>
            <li>this comb is not what i thought it would be, but i do love it.</li>
            <li>and it smells so lovely.  </li>
            <li>I am now doing a low-poo more often than soap nuts no-poo....</li>
            <li>Love the scent of the wood, some may not.</li>
            <li>I love this comb.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Cute</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite comb.</li>
            <li>the better the oils become distributed through my hair.</li>
            <li>Packaging was appropriate.  </li>
            <li>And my hair feel so much better to use it rather than plastic</li>
            <li>This product was smaller than I imagined, but turned out to be perfect!</li>
            <li>Need to use it more in order to see more changes..</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad with my purchase</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s supposed health care magic except</li>
            <li>Love this comb.</li>
            <li>Oh and yes it does smell lovely.</li>
            <li>Hairs get charged more in winter and plastic combs break them more easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a worthy investment if you want nice hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter and even my husband loved it so much that i had to order two more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve carried this around for a while now, loose in my purse or pocket, and it&#x27;s doing great!</li>
            <li>And my hair becomes more smooth.</li>
            <li>It is so much more environmentally sound to use wood over plastics.</li>
            <li>Good quality, and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The handling of the comb does require a learning curve but it&#x27;s not steep and I was able to use it competently (I think) fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>When you can&#x27;t use a lot of products in your hair, it&#x27;s very nice to have a natural comb that works so well at taming frizz.  </li>
            <li>It still is about hand-sized, so it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It gets through my longer-than-shoulder-length hair easily.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend people to use wood/bamboo/horn comb.</li>
            <li>My hair was full of static when I was using plastic one.</li>
            <li>The comb works just fine.</li>
            <li>but I have fine hair and it works well for me.</li>
            <li>This is a fine comb except that it was not made of sandal wood.  </li>
            <li>I manage just fine.</li>
            <li>And hey huge point for my life&#x27;s work...</li>
            <li>Amazingly smooth and fragrant.  </li>
            <li>Shape is comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for missing the snags and snarls a brush will glide over.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Although the sandalwood is not strongly scented, this is a very attractive comb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have a small, sturdy pocket comb that doesn&#x27;t produce any static!</li>
            <li>The smooth curving back is pleasantly shaped.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect size for her small hands, but sturdy and grown-up, too.</li>
            <li>The fine teeth are strong (unlike my previous wood comb which ended up with many broken teeth) and this is great and beautiful product!</li>
            <li>Not only do they feel good to use but they are compact and very pretty!  </li>
            <li>wood feels super smooth going through the hair.</li>
            <li>Cute design, although the scent fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I ordered this as something special for myself.  </li>
            <li>but it does such a good job of detangling longer hair.</li>
            <li>SOOO cute and very convenient with size and use.</li>
            <li>I love it, and I highly recommend my family and friends to have one.</li>
            <li>looks very pretty and well made.</li>
            <li>Smooth &amp; with pretty design.</li>
            <li>The design is very pretty as well.</li>
            <li>This is very sturdy comb that can tackle my easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty nice comb, but the design was off and it kind of ruined it a little for me.</li>
            <li>; and this has been a great little comb for that.</li>
            <li>I would prefer a handled comb for everyday use but this one does the job when I&#x27;m on the go.&lt;br /&gt;I also used it for teasing my hair and it did a great job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like plastic combs because I always feel that they pull too much when I use them, and this was cheap.</li>
            <li>My sister ordered this same comb months ago and it had an amazing smell.</li>
            <li>I found it beautiful on the picture, and I needed a small comb to carry around with me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>not as good as Chinese local ones, but OK for this price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as big as I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s still quite nice.  </li>
            <li>I prefer wooden or horn combs but haven&#x27;t been able, until now, to find one that I could fit in my purse or pocket that wouldn&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li>This one has teeth that are really close to one another, which is nice if you have fine long hair.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a comb made of wood, you&#x27;ve come to the right item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fits right into the hand.</li>
            <li>I bought this little guy because it&#x27;s so charming and the price was right.</li>
            <li>I love these little combs so much I&#x27;ve purchased two more since my first, one as a gift and one as a backup for myself!</li>
            <li>It is a relatively wide-tooth comb, more so than the picture suggests.</li>
            <li>This is real sandal wood comb!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my preferred comb for keeping my hair soft and smooth, while de-tangling without causing breakage.  </li>
            <li>She is pretty taken with it.</li>
            <li>also this comb looks awesomely pretty laying around.</li>
            <li>I wanted a wooden comb so eliminate the static I was getting with a plastic one.</li>
            <li>It is almost to pretty to use though.</li>
            <li>Pretty and does the job.</li>
            <li>I have a wooden hairbrush that I love, but I like to tuck a comb in my purse/pocket when I go anywhere.</li>
            <li>This is my second wood comb and I love them both.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty durable.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased that I ordered a second one!  </li>
            <li>I love the wood, never going back to plastic combs and brushes.</li>
            <li>The comb is exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already dropped mine many times and knocked them around, repeatedly soaked and dried them, and they seem to be doing just fine.</li>
            <li>They clean, spread the natural oils as well as detangling.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely over the moon with this comb, it came exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>I wanted to use it as a hair ornament but the handle was too large but as a comb this won&#x27;t break on you or hurt your scalp.</li>
            <li>Small enough to fit in my pocket, this comb is gorgeous and well made.</li>
            <li>The teeth are extremely fine and amazingly doesn&#x27;t snag as harshly on tangles as regular plastics when I comb from bottom-up.</li>
            <li>I havent lost much hair since I started using this.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and seems to be about what it portends to be.</li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>i have a straight hair and as i comb my hair the comb started to break apart...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells like real sandalwood</li>
            <li>I really like these wood combs.  </li>
            <li>will be buying more for the other ladies in the family.</li>
            <li>this would work for someone with fine, not too long, hair.</li>
            <li>Combs through long hair nicely without catching like other more expensive combs.  </li>
            <li>and it does a wonderful job even though I was skeptical that such a small comb may not work on my kind of hair.</li>
            <li>There is less static electricity when I comb my hair.</li>
            <li>It helps my hair less shony and static.</li>
            <li>I like the small size because it isn&#x27;t too small, just perfect.</li>
            <li>It is small, perfect if you have small hands.</li>
            <li>Initially for the first few months, it also carried a nice sandalwood-like scent, but it did fade.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great comb for personal everyday use, but I wouldn&#x27;t give it as a gift.</li>
            <li>It smells like sandalwood, it&#x27;s pretty and functional, but I don&#x27;t think it is actually carved wood.</li>
            <li>While some people complain about the size of this comb, I love it as it fits perfectly in a small pocket in my purse.  </li>
            <li>i noticed a few little holes in it due to the wood structure, but so far it is intact and does its work perfect.</li>
            <li>Slightly wedge shaped so it fits comfortably in your hand</li>
            <li>The wood is smooth and has a slight sent of sandalwood.</li>
            <li>It was also a little more faded than hers and had a different inscription on it.</li>
            <li>When I got mine, it had no aroma when the description clearly states there is.</li>
            <li>The quality, shape, natural scent etc.  </li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m using this finer-toothed comb for just arranging the hair near my face and</li>
            <li>I like that this comb is made of natural wood.  </li>
            <li>I gave only 4 stars because of the location of the model #, it&#x27;s right next the decoration on the face.</li>
            <li>To my delight it is extremely sturdy and while the teeth may seem pretty closely spaced</li>
            <li>( I also bought other combs from Rosallini, they are all pretty.)</li>
            <li>Strong, well made, convenient, and small enough to carry with me everywhere.</li>
            <li>The only concern was: the description says &amp;#34; Natural sandalwood wood material&amp;#34;, and it smells like sandalwood.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and does not catch while using, even with my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than any less natural comb I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The more I use it, the less this happens, so I suppose I just have to get used to it as it is quite different than my previous plastic comb.  </li>
            <li>Not as wide-toothed as i was led to believe but a cute Little (little) comb non-the-less.</li>
            <li>I could feel it become a little less dry and shines more naturally.</li>
            <li>It is such a pretty little design.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t get static either when I comb my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This comb has nice light fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> I recommended it to my friends. :)</li>
            <li> this comb is not what i thought it would be, but i do love it.</li>
            <li> and it smells so lovely.  </li>
            <li> I am now doing a low-poo more often than soap nuts no-poo....</li>
            <li> Love the scent of the wood, some may not.</li>
            <li> I love this comb.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Cute</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite comb.</li>
            <li> the better the oils become distributed through my hair.</li>
            <li> Packaging was appropriate.  </li>
            <li> And my hair feel so much better to use it rather than plastic</li>
            <li> This product was smaller than I imagined, but turned out to be perfect!</li>
            <li> Need to use it more in order to see more changes..</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad with my purchase</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s supposed health care magic except</li>
            <li> Love this comb.</li>
            <li> Oh and yes it does smell lovely.</li>
            <li> Hairs get charged more in winter and plastic combs break them more easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a worthy investment if you want nice hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter and even my husband loved it so much that i had to order two more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve carried this around for a while now, loose in my purse or pocket, and it&#x27;s doing great!</li>
            <li> And my hair becomes more smooth.</li>
            <li> It is so much more environmentally sound to use wood over plastics.</li>
            <li> Good quality, and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The handling of the comb does require a learning curve but it&#x27;s not steep and I was able to use it competently (I think) fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> When you can&#x27;t use a lot of products in your hair, it&#x27;s very nice to have a natural comb that works so well at taming frizz.  </li>
            <li> It still is about hand-sized, so it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It gets through my longer-than-shoulder-length hair easily.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend people to use wood/bamboo/horn comb.</li>
            <li> My hair was full of static when I was using plastic one.</li>
            <li> The comb works just fine.</li>
            <li> but I have fine hair and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> This is a fine comb except that it was not made of sandal wood.  </li>
            <li> I manage just fine.</li>
            <li> And hey huge point for my life&#x27;s work...</li>
            <li> Amazingly smooth and fragrant.  </li>
            <li> Shape is comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for missing the snags and snarls a brush will glide over.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Although the sandalwood is not strongly scented, this is a very attractive comb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have a small, sturdy pocket comb that doesn&#x27;t produce any static!</li>
            <li> The smooth curving back is pleasantly shaped.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size for her small hands, but sturdy and grown-up, too.</li>
            <li> The fine teeth are strong (unlike my previous wood comb which ended up with many broken teeth) and this is great and beautiful product!</li>
            <li> Not only do they feel good to use but they are compact and very pretty!  </li>
            <li> wood feels super smooth going through the hair.</li>
            <li> Cute design, although the scent fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as something special for myself.  </li>
            <li> but it does such a good job of detangling longer hair.</li>
            <li> SOOO cute and very convenient with size and use.</li>
            <li> I love it, and I highly recommend my family and friends to have one.</li>
            <li> looks very pretty and well made.</li>
            <li> Smooth &amp; with pretty design.</li>
            <li> The design is very pretty as well.</li>
            <li> This is very sturdy comb that can tackle my easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Overall pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty nice comb, but the design was off and it kind of ruined it a little for me.</li>
            <li> ; and this has been a great little comb for that.</li>
            <li> I would prefer a handled comb for everyday use but this one does the job when I&#x27;m on the go.&lt;br /&gt;I also used it for teasing my hair and it did a great job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like plastic combs because I always feel that they pull too much when I use them, and this was cheap.</li>
            <li> My sister ordered this same comb months ago and it had an amazing smell.</li>
            <li> I found it beautiful on the picture, and I needed a small comb to carry around with me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> not as good as Chinese local ones, but OK for this price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as big as I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s still quite nice.  </li>
            <li> I prefer wooden or horn combs but haven&#x27;t been able, until now, to find one that I could fit in my purse or pocket that wouldn&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li> This one has teeth that are really close to one another, which is nice if you have fine long hair.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a comb made of wood, you&#x27;ve come to the right item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fits right into the hand.</li>
            <li> I bought this little guy because it&#x27;s so charming and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I love these little combs so much I&#x27;ve purchased two more since my first, one as a gift and one as a backup for myself!</li>
            <li> It is a relatively wide-tooth comb, more so than the picture suggests.</li>
            <li> This is real sandal wood comb!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my preferred comb for keeping my hair soft and smooth, while de-tangling without causing breakage.  </li>
            <li> She is pretty taken with it.</li>
            <li> also this comb looks awesomely pretty laying around.</li>
            <li> I wanted a wooden comb so eliminate the static I was getting with a plastic one.</li>
            <li> It is almost to pretty to use though.</li>
            <li> Pretty and does the job.</li>
            <li> I have a wooden hairbrush that I love, but I like to tuck a comb in my purse/pocket when I go anywhere.</li>
            <li> This is my second wood comb and I love them both.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty durable.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased that I ordered a second one!  </li>
            <li> I love the wood, never going back to plastic combs and brushes.</li>
            <li> The comb is exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already dropped mine many times and knocked them around, repeatedly soaked and dried them, and they seem to be doing just fine.</li>
            <li> They clean, spread the natural oils as well as detangling.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely over the moon with this comb, it came exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it as a hair ornament but the handle was too large but as a comb this won&#x27;t break on you or hurt your scalp.</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in my pocket, this comb is gorgeous and well made.</li>
            <li> The teeth are extremely fine and amazingly doesn&#x27;t snag as harshly on tangles as regular plastics when I comb from bottom-up.</li>
            <li> I havent lost much hair since I started using this.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and seems to be about what it portends to be.</li>
            <li> She really likes it.</li>
            <li> i have a straight hair and as i comb my hair the comb started to break apart...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells like real sandalwood</li>
            <li> I really like these wood combs.  </li>
            <li> will be buying more for the other ladies in the family.</li>
            <li> this would work for someone with fine, not too long, hair.</li>
            <li> Combs through long hair nicely without catching like other more expensive combs.  </li>
            <li> and it does a wonderful job even though I was skeptical that such a small comb may not work on my kind of hair.</li>
            <li> There is less static electricity when I comb my hair.</li>
            <li> It helps my hair less shony and static.</li>
            <li> I like the small size because it isn&#x27;t too small, just perfect.</li>
            <li> It is small, perfect if you have small hands.</li>
            <li> Initially for the first few months, it also carried a nice sandalwood-like scent, but it did fade.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great comb for personal everyday use, but I wouldn&#x27;t give it as a gift.</li>
            <li> It smells like sandalwood, it&#x27;s pretty and functional, but I don&#x27;t think it is actually carved wood.</li>
            <li> While some people complain about the size of this comb, I love it as it fits perfectly in a small pocket in my purse.  </li>
            <li> i noticed a few little holes in it due to the wood structure, but so far it is intact and does its work perfect.</li>
            <li> Slightly wedge shaped so it fits comfortably in your hand</li>
            <li> The wood is smooth and has a slight sent of sandalwood.</li>
            <li> It was also a little more faded than hers and had a different inscription on it.</li>
            <li> When I got mine, it had no aroma when the description clearly states there is.</li>
            <li> The quality, shape, natural scent etc.  </li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m using this finer-toothed comb for just arranging the hair near my face and</li>
            <li> I like that this comb is made of natural wood.  </li>
            <li> I gave only 4 stars because of the location of the model #, it&#x27;s right next the decoration on the face.</li>
            <li> To my delight it is extremely sturdy and while the teeth may seem pretty closely spaced</li>
            <li> ( I also bought other combs from Rosallini, they are all pretty.)</li>
            <li> Strong, well made, convenient, and small enough to carry with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> The only concern was: the description says &amp;#34; Natural sandalwood wood material&amp;#34;, and it smells like sandalwood.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and does not catch while using, even with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than any less natural comb I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The more I use it, the less this happens, so I suppose I just have to get used to it as it is quite different than my previous plastic comb.  </li>
            <li> Not as wide-toothed as i was led to believe but a cute Little (little) comb non-the-less.</li>
            <li> I could feel it become a little less dry and shines more naturally.</li>
            <li> It is such a pretty little design.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, so I need to use a brush first.</li>
            <li> Looks a little worn for being brand new.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the wood comb can keep fragrance such a long time!</li>
            <li> i have a wider-tooth comb for combing out all my long hair</li>
            <li> I wish the seller had a longer comb for long hair.</li>
            <li> It has reduced breakage of my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have been use it for a least a week, a least is less static and freeze on my hair..</li>
            <li> (teeth have a slight springy give to them, but not enough to cause worry of breakage)&lt;br</li>
            <li> like my stuff to be different and this little guy is just that.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little girl as a Christmas present &amp;#34;from&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> However, a little smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> It was a little bit smaller than I expected, but it is so convenient to carry around!</li>
            <li> shipping took forever as expected from something that is coming from the other side of the world....</li>
            <li> Well made with no burrs or sharp ends.</li>
            <li> Other than that i didnt have a problem</li>
            <li> I have long, thick curly hair which I flat iron</li>
            <li> Not only is the design just printed on (and not too neatly), the comb is hard to use.</li>
            <li> Not as fragrant as I thought it might be but never had one before to compare to and since its about 20 times less than others I&#x27;ve seen online</li>
            <li> The comb is small (as expected).  </li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair</li>
            <li> ordered this little one cause</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used this little comb to distribute conditioner in my hair in the shower and after the shower with leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve usually broken plastic combs within a handful of uses thanks to my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> if you wanna waste your money i dont suggest you waste it on this item. (-_-)</li>
            <li> The teeth are closer together than I realized from the picture -- not suitable for people with thick or long hair.</li>
            <li> The engraving is a little clumsy.</li>
            <li> However, I feel it should be noted that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;child size&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; as it seems small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering a few for dear girlfriends!</li>
            <li> Since my hands are small</li>
            <li> It seems to actually tame hair!  </li>
            <li> However, I find the shape a bit hard to hold onto.  </li>
            <li> Arrived late.</li>
            <li> The teeth are thick and sturdy.</li>
            <li> My hair was horrible, with brush or comb.</li>

            <li> It smells like sandalwood, it&#x27;s pretty and functional, but I don&#x27;t think it is actually carved wood.</li>
            <li> What a great hair comb! Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Smells great out of the package - of course the sandalwood scent goes away but this is a great comb.  The fine teeth are strong (unlike my previous wood comb which ended up with many broken teeth) and this is great and beautiful product!</li>
            <li> This is very sturdy comb that can tackle my easily tangled hair. Initially for the first few months, it also carried a nice sandalwood-like scent, but it did fade.

            <li> This would make a great gift if you could stand to give it away. It works well; smells wonderful and controls static.</li>
            <li> Nice comb, it&#x27;s cute, works well and the perfect size for keeping in my purse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product, and I love the fragrance of the wood! It was delivered before last week, the fragrance still. I can&#x27;t believe the wood comb can keep fragrance such a long time!</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in my pocket, this comb is gorgeous and well made. The teeth are thick and sturdy. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This is real sandal wood comb! Smells beautiful and combs smooth. One of the best combs I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I carry this in my purse. It&#x27;s so compact but it does such a good job of detangling longer hair. I have thick, long hair and it does a wonderful job even though I was skeptical that such a small comb may not work on my kind of hair.

            <li> Although the sandalwood is not strongly scented, this is a very attractive comb. The teeth are closer together than I realized from the picture -- not suitable for people with thick or long hair. The smooth curving back is pleasantly shaped.</li>
            <li> While some people complain about the size of this comb, I love it as it fits perfectly in a small pocket in my purse.  It still is about hand-sized, so it&#x27;s easy to use.

            <li> gave as a gift. looks very pretty and well made. would buy again. and would also like to receive. nice</li>
            <li> Good quality, and reasonable price. My hair was full of static when I was using plastic one. I strongly recommend people to use wood/bamboo/horn comb. They are good for your hair and keep them smooth and nice. The only concern was: the description says &amp;#34; Natural sandalwood wood material&amp;#34;, and it smells like sandalwood. However, on the comb, it says &amp;#34;Mahogany comb&amp;#34; in Chinese.</li>
            <li> This comb reminds me of why we created combs to begin with. They clean, spread the natural oils as well as detangling. I love this comb. I am thinking only wood from this point on. And hey huge point for my life&#x27;s work... It is so much more environmentally sound to use wood over plastics. Thank You for such a great product!</li>
            <li> The comb works just fine. I like the wood - no problems getting it through my hair. However, I feel it should be noted that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;child size&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; as it seems small.</li>
            <li> It is so adorable!!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this little one cause I found it beautiful on the picture, and I needed a small comb to carry around with me.&lt;br /&gt;I like my stuff to be different and this little guy is just that. Love the design and pocket size.</li>
            <li> Very nice comb! Hairs get charged more in winter and plastic combs break them more easily.I havent lost much hair since I started using this.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!  The quality, shape, natural scent etc.  I am very happy with this comb.  It is the perfect fine tooth comb--good for helping disperse the natural hair oils without static.</li>
            <li> Comb is NOT sandalwood and it is warped.  would not purchase again.  should have returned it, but didn&#x27;t.  buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I love these little combs so much I&#x27;ve purchased two more since my first, one as a gift and one as a backup for myself! I&#x27;m so happy to have a small, sturdy pocket comb that doesn&#x27;t produce any static!

            <li> I am absolutely over the moon with this comb, it came exactly like the picture and I couldn&#x27;t  be any happier with my purchase. SOOO cute and very convenient with size and use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little girl as a Christmas present &amp;#34;from&amp;#34; her baby brother. She is pretty taken with it. It is the perfect size for her small hands, but sturdy and grown-up, too. I&#x27;ve been working on fostering her independence and giving her opportunities to practice &amp;#34;self-care&amp;#34; and this has been a great little comb for that. She is proud to use it and takes good care of it.</li>
            <li> wood feels super smooth going through the hair. i have a wider-tooth comb for combing out all my long hair but i&#x27;m using this finer-toothed comb for just arranging the hair near my face and it&#x27;s working great. also this comb looks awesomely pretty laying around.</li>
            <li> This is the best comb, smells so good</li>
            <li> I wanted a wooden comb so eliminate the static I was getting with a plastic one. This works. I have long, thick curly hair which I flat iron and it doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out or make it static-y.  It hasn&#x27;t lost any teeth either.  Great comb!</li>
            <li> not as good as Chinese local ones, but OK for this price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as something special for myself.  It is a beautiful comb and just perfect.  I don&#x27;t get static either when I comb my hair.  It is almost to pretty to use though.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these one for my son who has dandruff and one for myself.  It is a small size but it fits perfect in our hands and is beautifully crafted.  I love it</li>
            <li> I love it!! This comb has nice light fragrance to it. It effectively removes static from the hair. It has reduced breakage of my dry hair. I recommended it to my friends. :)</li>
            <li> Pretty and does the job. It combs hair. Since that is the purpose of the product, to comb hair, then it works</li>
            <li> I like this comb.  It is smaller but I have fine hair and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> i love this comb nice wood and healthy and the view the same pic&lt;br /&gt;trus me buy it its work</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in my hand, glides through my curly hair without any static. Well made with no burrs or sharp ends.</li>
            <li> wife loved it. will be buying more for the other ladies in the family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase. I have a wooden hairbrush that I love, but I like to tuck a comb in my purse/pocket when I go anywhere. I don&#x27;t like plastic combs because I always feel that they pull too much when I use them, and this was cheap. Really nice sturdy construction, attractive design, and even smells nice!</li>
            <li> this comb is not what i thought it would be, but i do love it. it holds my hair up nice and neatly seeing as how i do not use rubber bands.</li>
            <li> Amazingly smooth and fragrant.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and seems to be about what it portends to be. Not as fragrant as I thought it might be but never had one before to compare to and since its about 20 times less than others I&#x27;ve seen online it s probably what you pay for you get sorta thing.</li>
            <li> This is my second wood comb and I love them both. This one has teeth that are really close to one another, which is nice if you have fine long hair.</li>
            <li> very happy with this comb.  What a bargain and it smells so lovely.  Going no-poo and this has been a great added tool to my stuff. UPDATE May 2016: If u could love a comb -- this is the one i love! Still carry it with me every day.  I am now doing a low-poo more often than soap nuts no-poo.... and this comb is the best for dispersing the natural hair oils and keeping it balance to the ends.</li>
            <li> It was purchased for my wife. She really likes it.</li>
            <li> Very nice finish and carving.  Shape is comfortable to hold and use. Combs through long hair nicely without catching like other more expensive combs.  Love the scent of the wood, some may not.</li>
            <li> This is a fine comb except that it was not made of sandal wood.  It was made of peach wood with sandal wood scent.</li>
            <li> Arrived late. Looks a little worn for being brand new. Not as wide-toothed as i was led to believe but a cute Little (little) comb non-the-less.</li>
            <li> I love this comb! I like how sturdy the comb is and how it scratches against my scalp and removed dandruff like mágic! I wanted to use it as a hair ornament but the handle was too large but as a comb this won&#x27;t break on you or hurt your scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this comb. In the past I&#x27;ve usually broken plastic combs within a handful of uses thanks to my thick curly hair. I bought this because it was inexpensive and had solid reviews fully expecting that it too would break. To my delight it is extremely sturdy and while the teeth may seem pretty closely spaced I manage just fine. it&#x27;s perfect for missing the snags and snarls a brush will glide over. I use this then a wooden toothed brush and finish off with a boar bristle brush. My hair has never been neater, healthier, or shinier. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a nice comb for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Slightly wedge shaped so it fits comfortably in your hand&lt;br /&gt;- Perfect size to keep in a purse instead of a bulky brush&lt;br /&gt;- Sturdy feel (teeth have a slight springy give to them, but not enough to cause worry of breakage)&lt;br /&gt;- Cute</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite comb. I like the small size because it isn&#x27;t too small, just perfect. It changed my hair for the better, but also it feels good while you are grooming. My hair was horrible, with brush or comb. I can&#x27;t believe the difference a wooden comb can make. Very beautiful too. It seems to take the dryness away.</li>
            <li> My sister ordered this same comb months ago and it had an amazing smell. When I got mine, it had no aroma when the description clearly states there is. It was also a little more faded than hers and had a different inscription on it. A cutback and change on production perhaps?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still works as good though, the pocket size is lovely for quick touch-ups. The teeth are extremely fine and amazingly doesn&#x27;t snag as harshly on tangles as regular plastics when I comb from bottom-up. Frizz is nicely reduced and the more I use it the better the oils become distributed through my hair. I could feel it become a little less dry and shines more naturally.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty nice comb, but the design was off and it kind of ruined it a little for me. It is such a pretty little design.</li>
            <li> This is a comb made out of wood. If you are looking for a comb made of wood, you&#x27;ve come to the right item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Wooden comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Did not assist in doing my taxes.</li>
            <li> Good quality. However, a little smaller than I thought. Therefore I put it in my purse as a travel comb. Overall pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> shipping took forever as expected from something that is coming from the other side of the world.... i have a straight hair and as i comb my hair the comb started to break apart... thank god it was only $2.50.. if you wanna waste your money i dont suggest you waste it on this item. (-_-)</li>
            <li> The comb is small (as expected).  One end had a crack perhaps during shipping which later broke off.  Packaging was appropriate.  I like it because it is a sturdy product.  I wish the seller had a longer comb for long hair.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable size for the purse. Smooth &amp; with pretty design. Fits right into the hand. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very nice comb. It is smooth and does not catch while using, even with my thick hair. It is small, perfect if you have small hands. It looks pretty durable.</li>
            <li> Its a good comb. I like quite a bit. However it did take awhile to get to me. Other than that i didnt have a problem</li>
            <li> This is a very nice comb for keeping your hair from getting too frizzy.  Much nicer than any less natural comb I&#x27;ve used.  It seems to actually tame hair!  When you can&#x27;t use a lot of products in your hair, it&#x27;s very nice to have a natural comb that works so well at taming frizz.  I was so pleased that I ordered a second one!  It&#x27;s not as big as I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s still quite nice.  I have thick hair, so I need to use a brush first.</li>
            <li> I prefer wooden or horn combs but haven&#x27;t been able, until now, to find one that I could fit in my purse or pocket that wouldn&#x27;t break.  I&#x27;ve carried this around for a while now, loose in my purse or pocket, and it&#x27;s doing great! Strong, well made, convenient, and small enough to carry with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> I take this comb everywhere, it fits perfectly in my wallet. I love the wood, never going back to plastic combs and brushes.</li>
            <li> It was a little bit smaller than I expected, but it is so convenient to carry around! And my hair feel so much better to use it rather than plastic comb.&lt;br /&gt;The more amazing thing is that even though it shipped from China, they did not charge me any shipping fee!&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This product was smaller than I imagined, but turned out to be perfect! It fits perfectly in my purse, combs my hair perfectly, and still smells like sandalwood. I&#x27;ll be ordering a few for dear girlfriends! Arrived ahead of schedule, too!</li>
            <li> Beautiful combs, and they help reduce static electricity in your hair.  I ordered 2, one each for my granddaughters.  Excellent product and excellent transaction!</li>
            <li> Not only is the design just printed on (and not too neatly), the comb is hard to use. this would work for someone with fine, not too long, hair.</li>
            <li> Since my hands are small it&#x27;s easy and fits perfectly. I have been use it for a least a week, a least is less static and freeze on my hair.. Need to use it more in order to see more changes.. It&#x27;s smells like real sandalwood the comb so I&#x27;m glad with my purchase</li>
            <li> It is a sandal wood, which very healthy for your hair. When i got this comb i noticed a few little holes in it due to the wood structure, but so far it is intact and does its work perfect. My daughter and even my husband loved it so much that i had to order two more.</li>
            <li> yes, my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> I really like these wood combs.  Not only do they feel good to use but they are compact and very pretty!  Seem to be well made also.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!!!! It looks very nice, and it is also stout. I highly recommend it. ( I also bought other combs from Rosallini, they are all pretty.)</li>
            <li> I like that this comb is made of natural wood.  It gets through my longer-than-shoulder-length hair easily.  However, I find the shape a bit hard to hold onto.  It often slips out of my hands and falls on the floor.  The more I use it, the less this happens, so I suppose I just have to get used to it as it is quite different than my previous plastic comb.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about it&#x27;s supposed health care magic except it&#x27;s good to groom, but I ordered this as a re-enactment accessories. It&#x27;s great for that.</li>
            <li> Love this comb. It helps my hair less shony and static.</li>
            <li> The comb is exactly like the picture. The wood is smooth and has a slight sent of sandalwood. It is sturdy and doesn&#x27;t snag while combing my hair. The design is very pretty as well. It&#x27;s a great comb.</li>
            <li> I bought this little guy because it&#x27;s so charming and the price was right. Everytime I pop this guy out of my purse to use I always get a  a compliment or two. I gave only 4 stars because of the location of the model #, it&#x27;s right next the decoration on the face. Oh and yes it does smell lovely.</li>
