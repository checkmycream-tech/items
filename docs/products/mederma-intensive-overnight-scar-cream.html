            <li>Great price with great results.</li>
            <li>he loves it, says it works great</li>
            <li>This is great news since I was looking into plastic surgery to remove the scaring that this cream is fixing.</li>
            <li>I am going to keep using them until they are almost gone :P</li>
            <li>May not work as well for everyone, but it sure worked great for me and I am grateful!</li>
            <li>Made with a pleasant aroma from onions and garlic.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it had good reviews</li>
            <li>product and delivery was good</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>So I ended up with some nice ridges on the scar.</li>
            <li>This cream is honestly a miracle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for a good 3 months and love the results.</li>
            <li>and it is making the scars very smooth and faded.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the non greasy feel and look too.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>the results are getting better each day.</li>
            <li>Doctor of Plastic Surgery told me that the company doesn&#x27;t want the danger of this - but the product works better when used for a year.</li>
            <li>Love it, takes a while but works for me</li>
            <li>and I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw fabulous results after just two applications!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d never leave my house in a tank top.</li>
            <li>My feet look rejuvenated and healthy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Be sure you wash your hands after you apply, you don&#x27;t want this in your eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, as directed, and while I still have a scar, it&#x27;s improved much more than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>This is applied once a day, instead of twice, which makes it easier to remember and to abide by.&lt;br /&gt;Thoroughly pleased with this purchase, though it is a bit pricy.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>however I am very excited to get started.</li>
            <li>forget to buy first a good face wash and then on the clean skin</li>
            <li>Now, I can&#x27;t say for sure if I can attribute the softness to either the vitamin A&amp;E oil or Mederma but the combination of both are truly worth it!</li>
            <li>I love the texture of this cream and the mild smell.  </li>
            <li>It also makes your skin smooth (:</li>
            <li>Also I am happy with this product I&#x27;m only going on week two of using this on my face</li>
            <li>As with most medical products, I presume that each individual has to find out what works best for them.</li>
            <li>Even though I can&#x27;t help myself when I am stressed, I have comfort in knowing that no matter how many times I will damage my skin, this will help my skin come back together, good as new :)</li>
            <li>the big Vitamin B bottle from Amazon first - a lot cheaper, and much more effective...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super exited to see what happens when I continue using this product.</li>
            <li>While it is certainly possible some or perhaps even all of the results would have occurred anyway through the healing process, I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used nearly every Mederma scar-away product at some point, and almost every other scar-fading cream on the market, but this one works the best for me.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply to the whole leg.</li>
            <li>However I used this on a ten year old finger tip scar and the scar fell off with new skin underneath - perfect.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I would recommend it to anyone going through a similar situation.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>I was in a motorcycle accident and have been using this product for a wee and the minor scars are already fading and the deeper scars are looking better!</li>
            <li>I started using this right after I had surgery once all the stitches were out</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t get very much.</li>
            <li>I believe much better formulation then the standard &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; formula</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the product consistently but it did nothing.</li>
            <li>The balls of my feet that were developing calluses are now smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This however has delivered exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>What I do know is I wasn&#x27;t willing to wait and see and</li>
            <li>Buuuttt Mederma has been clearing it up really well!</li>
            <li>This is a thicker, creamier lotion and lasts a bit longer than the Advanced, which is a clear, runny liquid.</li>
            <li>The surgeon did not recommend a scar product, but I had used a different mederma with good results on an earlier surgery.</li>
            <li>and like I said would absolutely spend the money again regardless of knowing for sure what the impact of the cream actually is.  </li>
            <li>I think after six months of application the ACL scar will look better as well although I&#x27;m not really bothered by the look of that scar so much as how it feels!</li>
            <li>There was one incision that kind of split a part a little bit while it was healing.</li>
            <li>apply it after showering and rub in in really well.</li>
            <li>Mederma is the only product that keeps my face acne free.  </li>
            <li>Works really fast.  </li>
            <li>I expected more.</li>
            <li>this stuff really works but you gotta give it time</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t give much of a review.  </li>
            <li>Using it for zits, this jar is quite a bit too much product.</li>
            <li>works very well, almost got rid of my marks</li>
            <li>I am finally feeling comfortable</li>
            <li>Nothing reallY happened.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend Mederma PM</li>
            <li>&amp; I haven&#x27;t really seen results with it</li>
            <li>This cream is working what better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I purchased this the second time, it effectively remove my acne scars, only one disadvantage is it sometimes irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products</li>
            <li>Like it because it feels smoother than regular Mederma and more like a night cream, but I don&#x27;t think it works quite as fast as the regular Mederma.  </li>
            <li>The more you apply at night the less are noticed  your acne scars...</li>
            <li>A lot more bang for your buck with this product, compared to a tiny tube of regular mederma for $20.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I wear high heels a lot and they are murder on a girl&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>It is better than gel, because it last long in the skin.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my ACL scar originally, and have yet to see much difference in the physical appearance of the scar but the skin of the scar definitely feels much more pliant and not as tight as it was before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to apply, and has a slight fragrance, which Mederma says is to cover up an onion smell in the &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it consistently because I bought it to get rid of zit scars and when I put it on, it brings back a zit.  </li>
            <li>My scar is nearly gone!</li>
            <li>In fact, the scar now looks almost like a pencil mark on my neck whereas prior to using the cream it looked more like an un-smoothed slightly squiggly line of caulk.  </li>
            <li>So, Mederma Scar Cream is a total rip-off, both price wise, as well as the portrayal of how well it supposedly fades new</li>
            <li>WOW WOW WOW IS ALL THT</li>
            <li>I used the whole container, and it still didn&#x27;t work as well as the smaller mederma scar cream.</li>
            <li>It helps but does not remove completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this product on an old scar.  </li>
            <li>SO FAR.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seem any improvements in my surgical scars, I&#x27;ve been using it every night for a month or so.  </li>
            <li>The scars are fading, slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>He said the first six months not much improvement is made and you might give up.</li>
            <li>After 1 night my scars were much lighter and my stretch marks went from a bright red to an almost pale, dull red.</li>
            <li>It help to clear my big scar.</li>
            <li>My scars are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>The skin on my heels and toes is also baby soft after only 1 week of use twice a day.</li>
            <li>Based on the first couple of weeks, if I used it everyday for a week or two my scars would be gone.</li>
            <li>Your confidence shouldn&#x27;t be determined by how you look, but this really helped me feel like there was less of me to hide.</li>

            <li> As a general statement, I&#x27;m pretty skeptical of magic creams or similar treatments and in particular expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2-3 weeks and can definitely see a result on all my minor scars, especially the Acne scars I have on my chin.</li>
            <li> The dark scar color has diminished and some spots are completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much it helped the scars fade.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if the product really works</li>
            <li> To Mederma&#x27;s credit, they will stand behind the product and offer a full refund if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> TWO NIGHTS AGO  MARKED DOWN TO $17 AT WALMART AND DECIDED THT</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve notice a little bit of lightness so far when I get further with using this</li>
            <li> I had a rough time remembering to use daily.</li>
            <li> I noticed my scars had faded almost immediately, diminishing in color as expected and even surpassing initial expectations.</li>
            <li> My scars are on my lower and upper abdominal due to a hysterectomy.</li>
            <li> SO I WENT BACK AND BOUGHT THE OTHER ONE THAT WAS ON CLEARANCE</li>
            <li> From old, raised, red scars to flat white thin scar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently had a laparotomy and have a 8 inch scar down my abdomen.  </li>
            <li> one down size is obviously the price and the smell.</li>
            <li> I used this cream consistently for 6months and noticed a dramatic improvement in the color of scarring on my forearms.  </li>
            <li> Spent a fortune for it and can&#x27;t use is because I am allergic</li>
            <li> The color of my skin in that area has also blended together so discoloration is minimal as well.  </li>
            <li> Work as expected must use every night</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount</li>
            <li> The other scar products were too tedius to apply to each incision site.</li>
            <li> I am dark skinned.  </li>
            <li> I have some darker scars that are still fairly dark</li>
            <li> My skin is medium toned and for some odd reason my scar tissue just ends up extremely dark.</li>
            <li> In less than a month, I have seen a 50-60% decrease in the two scars.</li>
            <li> So even though my scar is slightly darker it feels like the rest of my skin.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be a waste of money since, in my case, my scars were so drastically dark.</li>
            <li> The Mederma seemed to soften those ridges up and make it seem a little flatter.</li>
            <li> and the scars are fading a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday for awhile now</li>
            <li> was in an accident a few scars that I find embarrassing.</li>
            <li> ugh, don&#x27;t waste time/money with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Seeing small progress in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I think this cream is working its a very heavy cream.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very heavy with plastic, deceiving packaging.</li>
            <li> Slowly</li>
            <li> I notice my &amp;#34;keloid&amp;#34; scar slowly going away, and i also can feel movement in my scar when Mederma is working.</li>
            <li> This product is a little expensive and it appears it will take about a year to work as promised.</li>
            <li> I had really bad back acne and all the scabs were driving me nuts!</li>
            <li> and I had back acne really bad</li>
            <li> Very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> I had terrible scarring from vascular surgery (27 incisions on each leg — over 50 incisions total).</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worthit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it broke my face out really badly</li>
            <li> and I was very insecure about it</li>
            <li> for some reason i hate the smell of this cream its a weird smell but that could be just me idk</li>
            <li> Very expensive</li>
            <li> It works so well that I can&#x27;t even think of what else to say about it except that you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as it said it would. :(</li>
            <li> Very bad doesn&#x27;t remove the scars  at all.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, there were no improvement results.</li>
            <li> As soon as I stop using mederma, my face breaks out with nasty looking acne.  </li>
            <li> It was terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Miracle cream. Helped with my scar recovery. I believe much better formulation then the standard &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; formula</li>
            <li> Great buy, Great Seller!!</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this cream and the mild smell.  Unfortunately it broke my face out really badly so I can&#x27;t use it as planned for acne scars.  I am using it on a scar on my hand and the results are really great,</li>
            <li> Used for over a month, and the two scars showed no fading whatsoever. Very disappointed. I then purchased Vitamin E gel caps, broke them open and applied the gel to the scars. In less than a month, I have seen a 50-60% decrease in the two scars. So, Mederma Scar Cream is a total rip-off, both price wise, as well as the portrayal of how well it supposedly fades new scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the big Vitamin B bottle from Amazon first - a lot cheaper, and much more effective...apply it after showering and rub in in really well. It has worked great for me...</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It definitely helps improve scars. My scars are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> takes a while to start seeing results, but they do happen</li>
            <li> Product has been great!</li>
            <li> I am dark skinned.  Mederma is the only product that keeps my face acne free.  I have tried many other products but this is the only product that prevents break outs on my face.  Love the non greasy feel and look too. Works really fast.  As soon as I stop using mederma, my face breaks out with nasty looking acne.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not great. I used the whole container, and it still didn&#x27;t work as well as the smaller mederma scar cream. I expected more. I would say it&#x27;s okay,so so.</li>
            <li> The scar is still a scar</li>
            <li> Spent a fortune for it and can&#x27;t use is because I am allergic</li>
            <li> I used this cream consistently for 6months and noticed a dramatic improvement in the color of scarring on my forearms.  The dark scar color has diminished and some spots are completely gone.  Majority of the scarring has been lightened and I continue to use this product.  It helps but does not remove completely.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works but you gotta give it time it help me with my back and chest acne</li>
            <li> Been using for over 6 months on acne scars ..no improvement. Waisted money and time in product.</li>
            <li> This product is a little expensive and it appears it will take about a year to work as promised.</li>
            <li> I have tons of acne scars. I don&#x27;t apply as regularly as I should, but it seems to be working!</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday for awhile now and i do not see any results... i have been using this for about three months</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t give much of a review.  I haven&#x27;t used it consistently because I bought it to get rid of zit scars and when I put it on, it brings back a zit.  I just can&#x27;t have any cream on my face, I guess.  I wasn&#x27;t too happy that I bought it in Feb. and it expires in Nov.  Using it for zits, this jar is quite a bit too much product.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use Mederma even when my surgeon had recommended it several times prior to my purchase (( call me hard-headed )).  I&#x27;ve recently had a laparotomy and have a 8 inch scar down my abdomen.  See, I&#x27;ve had scarring issues all of my life- from acne or just being a Tomboy. My skin is medium toned and for some odd reason my scar tissue just ends up extremely dark. It even baffled my surgeon. So after the 3rd time he politely encouraged me to get Mederma I finally caved.  I was expecting it to be a waste of money since, in my case, my scars were so drastically dark. To my surprise, Mederma lightened my scar to about 2 shades darker than my overall medium skin tone- which was a miracle in my case. I combined it with the usage of vitamin A &amp; E oil and the results are getting better each day. It&#x27;s even softened my scar... So even though my scar is slightly darker it feels like the rest of my skin. Now, I can&#x27;t say for sure if I can attribute the softness to either the vitamin A&amp;E oil or Mederma but the combination of both are truly worth it!</li>
            <li> I had surgery and after the staples were out I started using MedermaPM every night for a year. It works.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the product consistently but it did nothing.</li>
            <li> Doctor of Plastic Surgery told me that the company doesn&#x27;t want the danger of this - but the product works better when used for a year. He said the first six months not much improvement is made and you might give up. My Son used this on stitches - the products of Mederma do have some different ingredients and require some research. But he did give up on his forehead scar from stitches after 6 months of 3 times a day. So at night for the last six months, I dabbed some there in his sleep. Now he has zero, gone, totally gone - not there - no scar.  He was in sixth grade. However I used this on a ten year old finger tip scar and the scar fell off with new skin underneath - perfect. Made with a pleasant aroma from onions and garlic.</li>
            <li> i didnt use it. but its Exp. date is 11 2015。  i dont know why.</li>
            <li> i use mederma PM for about 2 month.&lt;br /&gt;until these time i did&#x27;nt see the result yet</li>
            <li> Love it, takes a while but works for me</li>
            <li> I got the product on time, but it&#x27;s going to be expired too soon.  (Sept 2015) I was worried that I cannot finished the product before the expiration date and I doubt it that it will cure my scars problem before that expiration.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves the merderma. She uses it on her scars &amp; merchandise arrived on time....</li>
            <li> seems to be working, takes weeks just like it says</li>
            <li> works very well, almost got rid of my marks</li>
            <li> It working beautifully where applied.  Good for ME!!!</li>
            <li> If u buy this don&#x27;t forget it&#x27;s not a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;It will help a lot! With fade your acne scars! The more you apply at night the less are noticed  your acne scars...&lt;br /&gt;Used for 2 moths and saw the difference&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using it and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to buy first a good face wash and then on the clean skin apply this cream</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping with My sons scares</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen results yet.</li>
            <li> I started using this right after I had surgery once all the stitches were out and the incisions were healed over. I&#x27;m not sure how much it helped the scars fade. I had a rough time remembering to use daily. There was one incision that kind of split a part a little bit while it was healing. So I ended up with some nice ridges on the scar. The Mederma seemed to soften those ridges up and make it seem a little flatter. I will continue to use the cream as I remember until it&#x27;s gone. My scars are on my lower and upper abdominal due to a hysterectomy.</li>
            <li> I am and have used this on surgery incisions and it seems to help minimize the scar. It only takes a small amount so it lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Item did not meet my expectations. I was very disappointed, there were no improvement results.</li>
            <li> As with most medical products, I presume that each individual has to find out what works best for them. I had terrible scarring from vascular surgery (27 incisions on each leg — over 50 incisions total). The surgeon did not recommend a scar product, but I had used a different mederma with good results on an earlier surgery. The other scar products were too tedius to apply to each incision site. Finally, six months after the surgery, I used this product. It is easy to apply to the whole leg. I saw fabulous results after just two applications! From old, raised, red scars to flat white thin scar.</li>
            <li> Like it because it feels smoother than regular Mederma and more like a night cream, but I don&#x27;t think it works quite as fast as the regular Mederma.  It does work, just fades slower.</li>
            <li> I used to have a lot of acne scars on my back and I was very insecure about it so I&#x27;d never leave my house in a tank top. This cream is honestly a miracle. Your confidence shouldn&#x27;t be determined by how you look, but this really helped me feel like there was less of me to hide. Honestly, I would recommend it to anyone going through a similar situation.</li>
            <li> I wear high heels a lot and they are murder on a girl&#x27;s feet. The rubbing can cause calluses and blisters depending on the shoe. I also play racquetball competitively, and the constant stop n go action has made my feet a bit rough. I decided to try this product on my feet and IT DOES WONDERS! The balls of my feet that were developing calluses are now smooth and soft. The skin on my heels and toes is also baby soft after only 1 week of use twice a day. My feet look rejuvenated and healthy. I wish is taken a before and after pic. I&#x27;ve tried tons of foot creams and nothing works like Mederma PM.  I know this isn&#x27;t the use this cream is advertised for, but  I think the company needs to rethink that. I&#x27;d buy this stuff in bulk!</li>
            <li> Was recommended this product for post-thyroid surgery ...to lighten the scar... I am 5 months post-surgery...seems to be lightening a bit.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2-3 weeks and can definitely see a result on all my minor scars, especially the Acne scars I have on my chin. I bought it for my ACL scar originally, and have yet to see much difference in the physical appearance of the scar but the skin of the scar definitely feels much more pliant and not as tight as it was before. I think after six months of application the ACL scar will look better as well although I&#x27;m not really bothered by the look of that scar so much as how it feels!</li>
            <li> My scar is nearly gone!</li>
            <li> I think this cream is working its a very heavy cream. seems to help. one down size is obviously the price and the smell. for some reason i hate the smell of this cream its a weird smell but that could be just me idk</li>
            <li> I am finally feeling comfortable i&lt;br /&gt;I was in an accident a few scars that I find embarrassing. I&#x27;ve used coco butter and vitamin E oil. Nothing reallY happened. I started this and I see progress. Slowly but it&#x27;s working. I have some darker scars that are still fairly dark but it&#x27;s only been about a month. So don&#x27;t get discouraged people 😊</li>
            <li> Got this on time, &amp; I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now and I&#x27;ve seen a bit of fading on my newer scars. I had really bad back acne and all the scabs were driving me nuts! I bought this because it had good reviews and it&#x27;s only been a week and the scars are fading a little bit. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does after 3-4 months! It also makes your skin smooth (:</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It works so well that I can&#x27;t even think of what else to say about it except that you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Just be patient! Sometimes you&#x27;ll notice a difference overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something I don&#x27;t want to mention (but I will for the sake of customers sifting through the reviews for something substantial): I have an excoriation disorder associated with my anxiety (and/or the stimulant drugs I am prescribed). Even though I can&#x27;t help myself when I am stressed, I have comfort in knowing that no matter how many times I will damage my skin, this will help my skin come back together, good as new :)</li>
            <li> Have been religiously applying every night since having shoulder surgery. Great price with great results. Be sure you wash your hands after you apply, you don&#x27;t want this in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Just got it this week. Haven&#x27;t use it yet however I am very excited to get started.</li>
            <li> It help to clear my big scar.</li>
            <li> Very bad doesn&#x27;t remove the scars  at all. I been used it for 5 days now and the areas that I Used it gives  me scabies</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  I realize it&#x27;s not for everyone, and I knew that going into this purchase.  To Mederma&#x27;s credit, they will stand behind the product and offer a full refund if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply, and has a slight fragrance, which Mederma says is to cover up an onion smell in the &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; product.  I did not find the fragrance to be offensive.</li>
            <li> I had a surgery 5 months ago, and this product, with the Mederma Cream SPF 30, has been a miracle. I use both creams daily, combined is 3 times a day, and I have seen results in this 3 weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it. I am very happy I purchased this brand. It is better than gel, because it last long in the skin. I am going to keep using them until they are almost gone :P</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product on an old scar.  Initially, I had very low expectations.  But I would definitely recommend using this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, as directed, and while I still have a scar, it&#x27;s improved much more than I thought it would.  According to the directions, I need to continue to use it for another month or two for maximum benefits.  I wish I had started using this product years ago!</li>
            <li> excellent for acne scar</li>
            <li> As a general statement, I&#x27;m pretty skeptical of magic creams or similar treatments and in particular expensive ones.  This however has delivered exactly as advertised and I would spend the money again in a heartbeat.  I have been using it on a four inch scar on the front of my neck from anterior cervical fusion surgery in October and that scar has been dramatically reduced in lumpiness and notice-ability as a result.  In fact, the scar now looks almost like a pencil mark on my neck whereas prior to using the cream it looked more like an un-smoothed slightly squiggly line of caulk.  The color of my skin in that area has also blended together so discoloration is minimal as well.  I started the cream a couple weeks post op and as described on the jar have used it almost every night.  While it is certainly possible some or perhaps even all of the results would have occurred anyway through the healing process, I am very pleased with the results and like I said would absolutely spend the money again regardless of knowing for sure what the impact of the cream actually is.  What I do know is I wasn&#x27;t willing to wait and see and the before cream and after cream comparison of that scar is like night and day.  May not work as well for everyone, but it sure worked great for me and I am grateful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing some fading, but probably not enough to repurchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!! I&#x27;m a African American and I had back acne really bad and then had acne scars for the aftermath. It was terrible. Buuuttt Mederma has been clearing it up really well! I&#x27;ve been using for a good 3 months and love the results. Will continue to use!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Mederma PM!!!! I have multiple scars, such as: stretch marks, scratches, acne, etc., and I looked forever for a scar cream tat worked and didn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy. After 1 night my scars were much lighter and my stretch marks went from a bright red to an almost pale, dull red. I use it 1 night every week and it works. Based on the first couple of weeks, if I used it everyday for a week or two my scars would be gone. I absolutely recommend Mederma PM</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS AS ADVERTISED</li>
            <li> I have been using it &amp; I haven&#x27;t really seen results with it so I am not sure if the product really works</li>
            <li> The best thing ever made! I love it!</li>
            <li> I was attacked by my dog and received two bites to my face. I have been using this cream at night and the one with sunscreen in the daytime. The scars are fading, slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> bought for my son. he loves it, says it works great</li>
            <li> Works at night and not greasy like the gel. Don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting on your clothes. Can also use during the day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this the second time, it effectively remove my acne scars, only one disadvantage is it sometimes irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest. I have a facial scar, and this  has done wonders. You will not regret getting it. Expensive, but worthit.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for 10 weeks and it is making the scars very smooth and faded.  Will continue to use until gone.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t had time to work .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used nearly every Mederma scar-away product at some point, and almost every other scar-fading cream on the market, but this one works the best for me. I noticed my scars had faded almost immediately, diminishing in color as expected and even surpassing initial expectations. This is a thicker, creamier lotion and lasts a bit longer than the Advanced, which is a clear, runny liquid. This is applied once a day, instead of twice, which makes it easier to remember and to abide by.&lt;br /&gt;Thoroughly pleased with this purchase, though it is a bit pricy.</li>
            <li> This cream is working what better than I expected. I have been using it for two weeks and am already seeing noticeable results. This is great news since I was looking into plastic surgery to remove the scaring that this cream is fixing.</li>
            <li> Seeing small progress in less than a week. I&#x27;m super exited to see what happens when I continue using this product. #HappyCustomer</li>
            <li> WOW WOW WOW IS ALL THT I HAVE TO SAY. I BOUGHT THIS CREAM TWO NIGHTS AGO  MARKED DOWN TO $17 AT WALMART AND DECIDED THT I WILL GIVE IT A TRY AND TO MY SURPRISE AFTER TWO DAYS MY STRETCH MARKS OF 24 YRS HAS STARTED TO FADE AWAY, I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ANYTHING WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY HAVE WORKED BUT IT IS. SO I WENT BACK AND BOUGHT THE OTHER ONE THAT WAS ON CLEARANCE AS WELL. IM ALSO APPLYING NIVEA&#x27;S FIRMING AND TONING LOTION WITH IT BECAUSE I STARTED USING IT 2 DAYS PRIOR. I RATE THIS A 100000 SO FAR. IM WONDERING WHAT MY ABDOMEN WILL LOOK LIKE AFTER ITS TOTAL USAGE. IM AN AFRICAN FEMALE</li>
            <li> Daughters swear by this for sports scars</li>
            <li> I was in a motorcycle accident and have been using this product for a wee and the minor scars are already fading and the deeper scars are looking better!</li>
            <li> ugh, don&#x27;t waste time/money with this stuff. It&#x27;s basically just a lotion that moisturizes the skin but doesn&#x27;t help heal and/or treat scars.</li>
            <li> Removed some stretch marks on stomach. I only used it on and off for 6 months and they seem to have gone away.</li>
            <li> Ordered twice and will order this product again. It works wonders on scarab</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as it said it would. :(</li>
            <li> I have no undeniable proof that it&#x27;s working but I think it&#x27;s helped with my blemishes. Been using for several months. Very expensive and you don&#x27;t get very much. The bottle is very heavy with plastic, deceiving packaging.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seem any improvements in my surgical scars, I&#x27;ve been using it every night for a month or so.  I&#x27;m keep using it every night until the bottle is gone and then report back.</li>
            <li> is not intended to work overnight.</li>
            <li> Work as expected must use every night</li>
            <li> Work instantly! I notice my &amp;#34;keloid&amp;#34; scar slowly going away, and i also can feel movement in my scar when Mederma is working. I love this product and I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> product and delivery was good</li>
            <li> For I would like to thank Amazon for sending me my order After I didn&#x27;t receive it the 1st time. Also I am happy with this product I&#x27;m only going on week two of using this on my face and I&#x27;ve notice a little bit of lightness so far when I get further with using this I&#x27;ll make a update on what has happen.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very thick and creamy. I use it three times a day, instead of using regular mederma, unless I&#x27;m going out in the sun, because regular mederma has sunscreen in its formula. A lot more bang for your buck with this product, compared to a tiny tube of regular mederma for $20.</li>
