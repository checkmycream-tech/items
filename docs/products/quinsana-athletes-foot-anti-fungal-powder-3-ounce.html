            <li> If it can&#x27;t be bought in a store, it&#x27;s not worth the price you have to pay with shipping.  </li>

            <li> Would give it 5 stars, but it was a little pricey.</li>
            <li> IT is hard to find</li>
            <li> And less expensive than the Tinactin brand powder.</li>

            <li> I found Quinsana Plus to be ineffective compared to Tinactin with the same active ingredient (1% Tolnaftate). I used Quinsana Plus for several weeks without any improvement, but after purchasing Tinactin powder online I saw improvement within a few days. I&#x27;d found Tinactin powder to be effective previously, but it was no longer available locally.</li>
            <li> The main ingredient in this product is tolfanate, which is the active ingredient in Tinactin, the ONLY over the counter athletes foot remedy that works for me. Creams, unfortunately, are less effective as the moisture they create tends to promote fungal growth instead of combating it, so powders (or powder sprays) are the way to go for me. I squeeze a bit of this stuff into each shoe in the morning and it keeps my feet dry for hours. Just as effective as Gold Bond for keeping dry, with the added benefit of the tolfanate to fight the fungus causing athletes foot. And less expensive than the Tinactin brand powder. Solid product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I use it as an underarm powder.  Keeps the armpits from forming BO.</li>
            <li> Great powder that has NO fragrance which I like.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> The total price far exceeds the benefits.  If it can&#x27;t be bought in a store, it&#x27;s not worth the price you have to pay with shipping.  For the price I paid, I should have received a case of the product.</li>
            <li> This is what sets this powder apart from others there is NO SMELL! It does not clash with anything. Works fine too.</li>
            <li> Quinsana Plus is a great products that I have a hard time buying at my local pharmacy.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy this on line, but I feel that the shopping and handling cost was too high, almost equaling the purchase price of the product.</li>
            <li> No odor, but helps control odor and sweat. Seems to help reduce recurrence of athletes foot. Hard to tell, since you can&#x27;t be your own control subject. Like other products I&#x27;ve reviewed lately, this is getting harder to find at retail outlets.</li>
            <li> Husband got started on this while in the military.  IT is hard to find and I hope they keep making it.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> Nice product, it does not have a smell like Gold Bond.</li>
            <li> This item, was purchased by me, for a friend. Quinsana is probably the best, non prescription treatment available for persons suffering with foot fungus. Relief from itching and other discomfort is almost immediate and is exceptionally long lasting. If 5 stars is the top rating, he gives it 10 stars!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years to keep my feet dry and  order free.  This product keeps my feet happy in hot sneakers and shoes.  It completely stops sweaty feet - nothing else works like it.  Can&#x27;t  find it in the local stores, but so glad I finally found it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Look, it&#x27;s anti-fungal powder, fer chris&#x27;sake! It works. What more do you expect me to say? Rants, you get for free, advertisements, hell, no!</li>
            <li> Love it does not have any smell</li>
            <li> Good product and helps keep feet dry if you sprinkle it in socks.</li>
            <li> Want to eliminate atheletes foot freqency - try this product.  We&#x27;ve used it for years and highly recommend it.  Shake some in all your shoes for the whole family and fresh comfortable feet are yours.</li>
            <li> the best part is it doesent smell like most powders. I use it when running no rubbing, , under arm no rubbing. problem amazon price  is  $2.00 more each than Fred Meyer.</li>
            <li> The best multi-purpose powder around - in fact, nothing else will do. Would give it 5 stars, but it was a little pricey. Thanks for the quick response to my request.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years, nothing better in my opinion. Priced right, shipped promptly, I am pleased.</li>
