            <li> Brought this product for my auntie &amp; its the only soap she uses. I will be purchasing her some more and geting myself some too. she says its the best soap everrr, but its hard to find. I highly stand behind this product and was very happy with the comunacation with the seller. Five star experience *****</li>
            <li> These bars work great to use as shave soap if you have hard water. Typically I will place 1-2 in my shave mug and melt them down in the microwave to fill the mug and then let them cool. I had trouble getting proper lather with regular shave soap due to my water but these work great and a bar lasts about 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> This soap really left my skin soft and smooth. The only ingredients in this soap are Palm oils, Glycerine, Water and Natural fragrace. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Amazing soap at an amazing price! I will never buy the leading brands like Dove, Olay again...they carry tons of ingredients that just makes my skin dry...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for my exploration into the fine art of wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft, and I feel it helps a lot when I rinse my face with it and lather it up and put it on my facial hair prior to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started with 1 bar, and after liking it so much I have already ordered a couple more.</li>
            <li> Many glycerine soaps melt away, this one really does last. Glycerine soap tends to rinse clean and is nice and soft on the skin. I know a lot of guys who prefer this soap over many other kinds. The vitamin e seems to keep the skin softer than most soaps.</li>
            <li> Really loved this product.  Skin felt clean and soft after use, and it was everything it was advertised to be.</li>
            <li> This glycerine soap works wonders. I use it for a preshave wash - perfectly smooth skin and nice and easy to lather on top of.</li>
            <li> This bar did not last long</li>
            <li> I just &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; this soap, but do not love it.  It does work, but not as well as another glycerine soap I have&lt;br /&gt;rated that I love.  I really don&#x27;t know why the differences in the glycerine soaps, unless it&#x27;s more or less&lt;br /&gt;of important additives.</li>
            <li> This was a mother&#x27;s day gift, I didn&#x27;t get it before mother&#x27;s day though (because I was waiting for my Amazon e-gift card I earned online to come in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother has used this soap before, she has cracked dry skin hands (she works hard to keep the house clean!) and likes this soap, but she doesn&#x27;t usually buy it because it&#x27;s expensive for her and she&#x27;ll use alternative bar soaps. I earned an Amazon e-gift card online and used a bit of it on her! She was happy for this gift! It is definitely something she will use. She won&#x27;t just use it on her cracked dry skin hands, but in the shower so she can moisturize and heal her body too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, this is a good soap to consider. I haven&#x27;t tried it myself (or at least I don&#x27;t remember!) but my mother likes it. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never use a glycerine soap that gets used up as quickly as this did.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> So I bought this after reading Leisureguy mentioning and recommending this product a million times, and I gotta say...I&#x27;m hooked. It works extremely well getting the oil and dirt off your face without over-drying it, but I would still recommend using a moisturizer following using this. But it&#x27;s also a  perfect pre-shave soap also, that&#x27;s what I use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got great scent to it, it&#x27;s sweet almost like a light citrus or honey smell to it. Whatever it is it&#x27;ll foam/lather up very well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, everyone should buy this!</li>
            <li> This soap smells really good. Left my skin feeling fresh and clean. Doesn&#x27;t foam up a lot, but it definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have found.  what works for one may not work for another.  It rinses clean, and skin feels fresh. This is my go to soap from now on,</li>
            <li> Really nice soap that makes my skin super soft.  I was having trouble with flaking skin even though I use lotion and exfoliate in the shower.  I have tried lots of other products but no help.  My doctor advised glycerine soap with either aloe or vitamin E so I got the one with vitamin E.  I have not seen one with both aloe and vitamin E so it would be nice if I could find one.  Until then I will stick with this one because it stops the flaking.</li>
            <li> Apparently this soap is not made for long term storage.The plastic on several bars disintigrated,maybe there biodegradable too?It left everything else sticky because the wrappers are gone,Other than that It shld work fine.</li>
            <li> Very much satisfied with this soap, first time I have used glycerin soap.  I would recommend this to someone else.</li>
            <li> I Really do not like this Glycerine Soap i really didnt feel clean enough after using this ,however i know alot of people like this Soap,just not for me to each is own.</li>
            <li> I have IC and can&#x27;t wear underwear and have to wash clothes with unscented laundry soap or it will irritate me. If you have any sensitivities or IC, try this soap. I can wash with this soap without it burning or irritation.</li>
            <li> Product is great, but I found EXACTLY the same soap, the same size for less than $2.00 (not on sale) at t local health food store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is supposed to have low prices, but they blew it on this one.</li>
            <li> I love this soap..... my son had an acid rash that just would not go away!!!!  After using this soap for two days, my son&#x27;s rash has cleared up!</li>
            <li> Although, i liked that this soap made my skin feel soft afterwards and not dry or rough, it dissolves too quickly for my liking. Have used it for 1 week so far and it is already almost gone or completely dissolved. I guess it can&#x27;t be left in moist area or humid conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is it doesn&#x27;t leave residue on the washcloth.</li>
            <li> My local grocery store sells this exact same soap for $1.29. It sold for $.99 for years but everything has gone up including this product.&lt;br /&gt;To make any soap last longer keep it out of a damp or worse yet a wet soap dish. That softens the soap bottom to mush for next use. I solved this problem using a 2 piece plastic soap dish and drilled holes in the bottom corners to drain any water near the soap.</li>
            <li> I like this soap as it is mild, but cleans and removes makeup as well as any \\&quot;makeup remover\\&quot; and is not drying to the skin.  I also like that it is not perfumed.  On first opening the package it had a strong smell, but that dissipated quickly and now has a nice &amp; mild \\&quot;soap\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li> My mother bought these for me growing up since I had such sensitive skin not much else worked.  I still have sensitive skin but no longer use bar soap--instead, I use Dove body wash and that works for my adult skin.  However, my goddaughter has the same sensitive skin problem I had growing up so I bought her a bar of this soap to try.  It cleans without residue and does not itch.  Unfortunately, cannot find it locally (I live in Northern Virginia) so I ordered it online.  So far, no complaints.</li>
