            <li>I really love this comb , it doesn&#x27;t feel like it has anything in it , but it is a good comb for my curly hair !</li>

            <li>Nice comb</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it would have a healing affect on its own.</li>
            <li>Good comb, easy in use.</li>
            <li>Great for gently combing out tangles.</li>
            <li>You are way better off getting a Mason Pearson where you are guaranteed quality for this price...</li>
            <li>If the ends were rounded, it would be a better comb.  </li>
            <li>I always have a bit more tangles with a cleansing conditioner but being that this has the oil infused in it</li>
            <li>I have has much better luck working through them</li>
            <li>Love these combs.  </li>
            <li>For 53 cents, I got a great deal, but I&#x27;m not so sure about the current prices I&#x27;m seeing on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been one length, breaks easily and looks like a gigantic mascara brush when in a braid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought more as presents for friends.</li>
            <li>It came quick and free shipping!</li>
            <li>it feels and looks like a free conair one I got years ago.</li>
            <li>Good for thick hair and a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great wide toothed comb</li>
            <li>Unlike many Asians, I don&#x27;t have much of it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any decrease in breakage from this comb though, so I&#x27;m glad I used a gift certificate to pay for it.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect for fitting into a small pocketbook,or my back pocket.</li>
            <li>There are far better combs out</li>
            <li>Works like any other good comb.</li>
            <li>But right out of the shower, it feels like it&#x27;s ripping the hair</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower and right after and haven&#x27;t noticed any breakage.</li>
            <li>Love this comb and even getting through my daughters long hair leaving it smooth.</li>
            <li>Besides that part, it is a great wide tooth comb for me and my long hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>gets out tangles easily and the oil infusion leaves my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>However if you&#x27;re wanting to invest in something worthwhile from this line, just try the actual healing oil and stick with the Conair combs.</li>
            <li>Works pretty .good</li>
            <li>Guess I should have read the reviews before purchasing as most of the reviews say the same thing.</li>
            <li>Helps to not pull out any more hair out of my long hair as I&#x27;m losing some hair.</li>
            <li>The comb is great for my long, straight hair at getting knots and tangles out,especially when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li>The comb is the only product I use on my hair,and I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it and would HAVE to buy a new one, if I lost it.</li>
            <li>it really does it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li>This is a bit more flimsy that I expected.</li>
            <li>This is a comb, so not too much to say about it.</li>
            <li>I really cant tell the difference (with oil infused).</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;healing oil&amp;#34; supposedly infused in it doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference in smoothing/detangling my hair.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any oil infusion though.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $3 for this comb, as I tend to use it only as much, if not less than, my Conair combs from Walmart.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 out of 5 simply because I don&#x27;t notice any thing special with it having macadamia infused.</li>
            <li>It feels nice when I use it to work a deep conditioner through, or after my hair is already dry.  </li>
            <li>The wide teeth make it really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is very effective in distributing just a small amount of the oil on your hair and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Comb is great for tangles, but no different than any other pick or wide toothed comb.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shinier, less coarse/brittle and when I run my fingers through it, it doesn&#x27;t break as easily.  </li>
            <li>At first my product got lost, but the customer representive responded fast and sent me my item with few sample items FAST!  </li>
            <li>and it is never too much like when using the actual oil.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair but its not hurting anything either.</li>
            <li>It works ok, no better or worse than any other kind of comb--</li>
            <li>She has fine thin hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I comb my hair rather than brushing it, as it is long (a little past my bra strap) and fine.  </li>
            <li> This will last a relatively long time depending on how often you use this and the amount of hair you have.  </li>
            <li> (I have long hair--lower back long).</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I dare to comb my wet hair with.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a regular wide toothed comb.</li>
            <li> Works well in my long, straight thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I only paid 53 cents a piece at a salon going out of business, and I gave one away and still have the other two.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long the macadamia oil lasts, after the comb is used numerous times,and after cleaning/combing wet hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on wet hair after washing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with how fast the lettering wore off, though.</li>
            <li> Its just a wide tooth comb...</li>
            <li> Money well spent in my opinion!</li>
            <li> The comb seems just like any other pick or comb that you would use after a shower.</li>
            <li> The ends are a bit sharp</li>
            <li> I always use it with other macademia products</li>
            <li> Broke after 3 months of using it every other day.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thin so its not a big deal</li>
            <li> The teeth on the comb are VERY sharp.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the mascara wand thing was less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Also it did not ship in any packaging, which seemed odd.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this comb for a few weeks now I can see the difference.  </li>
            <li> so I have to be slow and careful when I comb my hair.  </li>
            <li> Its a basic comb with an expensive price...</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m worried it won&#x27;t hold up to thick hair.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I had curly or thick</li>
            <li> but each strand is very thick</li>
            <li> This comb is very thin.</li>
            <li> and it looks bad as I pull it through.</li>
            <li> the brand, hate this product, sorry!</li>
            <li> Rip off I think... seriously disappointed in this product.</li>

            <li> I like this comb a lot. The teeth are nicely spaced &amp; being infused with macadamia oil is an added bonus! Money well spent in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I really love this comb , it doesn&#x27;t feel like it has anything in it , but it is a good comb for my curly hair ! it really does it&#x27;s job well , I am very happy with it !</li>
            <li> I use this comb every day. Helps to not pull out any more hair out of my long hair as I&#x27;m losing some hair.</li>
            <li> I comb my hair rather than brushing it, as it is long (a little past my bra strap) and fine.  I will say these are nice combs, but the oil is nonexistent and I would not rave about these.  I only paid 53 cents a piece at a salon going out of business, and I gave one away and still have the other two.  For 53 cents, I got a great deal, but I&#x27;m not so sure about the current prices I&#x27;m seeing on Amazon.

However if you&#x27;re wanting to invest in something worthwhile from this line, just try the actual healing oil and stick with the Conair combs.</li>
            <li> Good comb, easy in use. I like it!</li>
            <li> Great for gently combing out tangles. This is the only thing I dare to comb my wet hair with. It&#x27;s not damaging my hair like nylon and plastic bristles do.</li>
            <li> The comb is great for my long, straight hair at getting knots and tangles out,especially when my hair is wet. I&#x27;m not sure how long the macadamia oil lasts, after the comb is used numerous times,and after cleaning/combing wet hair. After leaving the comb sitting on my table that sits in the sun, I could almost feel the oil on my fingers.The size is perfect for fitting into a small pocketbook,or my back pocket.The comb is the only product I use on my hair,and I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it and would HAVE to buy a new one, if I lost it.</li>
            <li> Its a basic comb with an expensive price...You are way better off getting a Mason Pearson where you are guaranteed quality for this price...I saw this model at the salon- it feels and looks like a free conair one I got years ago. The quality is not that great.</li>
            <li> Hurts my head when I try to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thrown this product away and would not suggest anyone buying it.  There are far better combs out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the brand, hate this product, sorry!</li>
            <li> It seems to be working.  I&#x27;m Southeast Asian with butt-length hair.  Unlike many Asians, I don&#x27;t have much of it but each strand is very thick so people often comment that I&#x27;ve got a lot.  My hair has never been one length, breaks easily and looks like a gigantic mascara brush when in a braid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this comb for a few weeks now I can see the difference.  It&#x27;s shinier, less coarse/brittle and when I run my fingers through it, it doesn&#x27;t break as easily.  Oh, and the mascara wand thing was less noticeable.  What a relief.</li>
            <li> The teeth on the comb are VERY sharp. I would not recommend this comb.</li>
            <li> it does my hair extra soft but the downside is that sometimes its just too oily and it gets on your hands and it can make ur hair greasy looking, so just be careful</li>
            <li> This is a bit more flimsy that I expected. I thought it was be thicker.  Also it did not ship in any packaging, which seemed odd.</li>
            <li> Works pretty .good with the shampoo y contioner from the seam brand o another</li>
            <li> Works great on everyones hair, even snarly. Love this comb and even getting through my daughters long hair leaving it smooth.</li>
            <li> The comb seems just like any other pick or comb that you would use after a shower. I put hair oil in, so that makes it easier anyway. Nice comb but I didn&#x27;t get any result that I thought were \\&quot;special\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I got this comb in the mail only to discover that it just seemed like a regular comb. I didn&#x27;t notice the oil infused part. Besides that part, it is a great wide tooth comb for me and my long hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I bought this comb.  I don&#x27;t understand the claim that it&#x27;s infused with oil; it seems like a regular comb to me.  It feels nice when I use it to work a deep conditioner through, or after my hair is already dry.  But right out of the shower, it feels like it&#x27;s ripping the hair and it looks bad as I pull it through.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a wooden comb as I mistakenly thought, and it still has seams. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any decrease in breakage from this comb though, so I&#x27;m glad I used a gift certificate to pay for it.</li>
            <li> This comb is infused with macadamia oil, however I do not see it or feel it.  The ends are a bit sharp so I have to be slow and careful when I comb my hair.  If the ends were rounded, it would be a better comb.  I would not purchase this item again, nor do I recommend it.</li>
            <li> At first my product got lost, but the customer representive responded fast and sent me my item with few sample items FAST!  I was happy and impressed they where so awesome. Now the comb itself works great.</li>
            <li> thankfully I only paid $5 for this... it&#x27;s just a regular wide toothed comb. I did not notice any &amp;#34;oil infused&amp;#34;. Rip off I think... seriously disappointed in this product. I would not recommend to family or friends. Guess I should have read the reviews before purchasing as most of the reviews say the same thing. :/</li>
            <li> gets out tangles easily and the oil infusion leaves my hair soft.  I use it on wet hair after washing. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this with the healing oil and the deep repair mask.  The wide teeth make it really easy to use.  I always use it with other macademia products so I don&#x27;t know if it would have a healing affect on its own.</li>
            <li> This is a comb, so not too much to say about it. I&#x27;ve had it for a while now, and the actual product is quite durable. I&#x27;m not happy with how fast the lettering wore off, though.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect comb to use with your cleansing conditioner in the shower or bath. I always have a bit more tangles with a cleansing conditioner but being that this has the oil infused in it I have has much better luck working through them (I have long hair--lower back long). I liked it so much I bought more as presents for friends.</li>
            <li> it is a good product for untangling the knots in the hair without causing a lot of damage to the hair</li>
            <li> This is very effective in distributing just a small amount of the oil on your hair and lasts a long time.  There is no muss or fuss about this and it is never too much like when using the actual oil.  This will last a relatively long time depending on how often you use this and the amount of hair you have.  We have purchased this multiple times for gift baskets and everyone loves the product.</li>
            <li> GREAT product. Arrived on time. Had one for a year &amp; broke it. Ordered 2 this time.</li>
            <li> This is a really good comb. It is good quality and sturdy. Good for thick hair and a good price on Amazon. It came quick and free shipping! Would buy again</li>
            <li> Comb is great for tangles, but no different than any other pick or wide toothed comb.  I really cant tell the difference (with oil infused).</li>
            <li> Works well in my long, straight thick hair.  I&#x27;m giving it 4 out of 5 simply because I don&#x27;t notice any thing special with it having macadamia infused. Works like any other good comb.</li>
            <li> It works ok, no better or worse than any other kind of comb-- the &amp;#34;healing oil&amp;#34; supposedly infused in it doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference in smoothing/detangling my hair.</li>
            <li> I have read that Macadamia oil is good for the hair and scalp so I bought this comb. I&#x27;ve been using this comb for a month and I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> This comb is very thin. I&#x27;m worried it won&#x27;t hold up to thick hair. My hair is long and thin so its not a big deal but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I had curly or thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the oil, the comb doesn&#x27;t look, smell, or feel any different that a regular plastic comb. So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair but its not hurting anything either.</li>
            <li> Macadamia comb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a comb with macadamia oil for my daughter.She has fine thin hair.This products works great .I think this is a totally awesome product.</li>
            <li> Its just a wide tooth comb...no oil infused</li>
            <li> The comb is great!  I use it in the shower and right after and haven&#x27;t noticed any breakage. It even smells good.</li>
            <li> Great wide toothed comb I don&#x27;t really notice any oil infusion though.</li>
            <li> Broke after 3 months of using it every other day.</li>
            <li> Love these combs.  This is the 3rd I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
