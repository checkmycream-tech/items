            <li>Surgical Adhesive is very easy to remove and comes off in a clean strip.</li>

            <li>I like to use it whether I&#x27;m applying MAC eyelashes or the cheap ones that you get at the drug store.</li>
            <li>fabulous.</li>
            <li>Dries good and clear.</li>
            <li>This product that I purchased as eyelash adhesive came in a box that said it was surgical adhesive, on one side a sticker that read eyelash adhesive had been placed over the original labeling that I guess turned it into eyelash adhesive.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find it, among other products I enjoy, on the Amazon.com website.</li>
            <li>would reccomend this product to anyone interested in a strong eyelash adhesive</li>
            <li>i call it a super miracle eye glue, without any irritation at all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for sure going to buy again</li>
            <li>, SO REALLY ITS A GREAT DEAL IN THE LONG RUN.</li>
            <li>Love the glue, it really holds very well.</li>
            <li>drys clear like magic.</li>
            <li>It does have a weird smell but works great holds your falsies great and last forever I wear mine from 10am-9pm and does not fall off.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the first eyelash adhesive i use</li>
            <li>Also, holds only slightly better than the &amp;#34;non-surgical&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used every other kind</li>
            <li>it really sticks and it dries very fast?</li>
            <li>ITS A LARGE SIZE</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The delivery was prompt, and the communication as to the status of the order was very helpful and timely.</li>
            <li>it sticks to you very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipper.</li>
            <li>people ask me if  my lashes real.</li>
            <li>i dont like to go through so much beauty troubles.</li>
            <li>like it because it works well and had a fast shipping time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say its good for at least 6 months</li>
            <li>definitely the best false eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>This product has a rather unpleasant smell, but it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The Duo Adhesive product I recently purchased was exactly as described on the seller&#x27;s listing.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t use any other kind of lash adhesive, but be careful,  </li>
            <li>I have only used it 3 times, I know it is a favorite with the Youtube people, also they have a waterproof one, and I haven&#x27;t used it enough to give a proper review, but I will say it is O.K. so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best adhesive for false eye lashes!!!  </li>
            <li>Duo adhesive is a great adhesive to apply artificial eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I hope they  come out that really clear..</li>
            <li>dries clear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only glue Ill ever use again and a great price.</li>
            <li>but it turns into a goop that takes awhile to completely wash off my face.</li>
            <li>The false eyelashes remained adhered to my eyelids the whole night (of partying), but were easy to remove at the end of the night.</li>
            <li>Comes out white and dries clear, but has a sheen to it.</li>
            <li>The label information on the box stated that it is ideal for adheraring small, neat, comforatable dressings to scalp and facial wounds, boils and other hard to dress areas.  </li>
            <li>It works great for me but it is a little bit difficult to take off because it sticks so well.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use a lot but it tends to come out a little to fast.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> You can&#x27;t use a lot but it tends to come out a little to fast.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy, I could have easily gone to the drugstore and bought this item for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Is not clear, its whiite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything else as far as eyelash glue goes (the small cheapo bottles of eyelash glue they put in those \\&quot;value pack\\</li>
            <li> I found out it turns white when wet so beware!!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so I would only buy one tube at a time.</li>
            <li> I got this item alot faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> This adhesive will hold your eyelash for 3 weeks or longer if you avoid carefully water contact with lashes.&lt;br /&gt;The only small inconvenience is its white color; but this is corrected by applying a black eye liner along contour of eyes after application of lashes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a veryyyy small bottle of glue at target for literally the same price as this</li>
            <li> So if your eyes tend to water from laughing or allergies, be careful!  </li>
            <li> So its so hard to use it becaits white.</li>
            <li> Works well though but can get a little crusty.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t Waste your Money .</li>
            <li> It has a firm hold and this seller got it to me in 2-3 days as promised.</li>
            <li> &quot; eyelash kits are so useless don&#x27;t even bother with those) and it lasts for months depending on how frequently you wear them.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to squeeze out a thin line versus a big thick blog of glue.</li>
            <li> Still small though...</li>
            <li> Those who sell these kinds of lashes usually offer this adhesive for application, as well as others.  </li>
            <li> Then i bought the same product @Wallmart and actually didn&#x27;t stink as bad as the one that i bought over here!  </li>
            <li> and i mean this from the bottom of my heart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really annoyed by that</li>
            <li> Beware of false advertising.</li>
            <li> This was not surgical eyelash glue, this is false advertisement.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years, however it is difficult to find a drugstore that carries the product.  </li>
            <li> would and I do recommend this to any one who wears fake lashes.</li>
            <li> It was advertised as Surgical, FALSE ADVERTISING!  :(</li>
            <li> and it stink really really bad.</li>
            <li> So i was disappointed...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Still small though...</li>
            <li> This product has a rather unpleasant smell, but it works wonderfully. The false eyelashes remained adhered to my eyelids the whole night (of partying), but were easy to remove at the end of the night. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The Duo Adhesive product I recently purchased was exactly as described on the seller&#x27;s listing. The delivery was prompt, and the communication as to the status of the order was very helpful and timely. I&#x27;d order from this seller again. Great transaction.</li>
            <li> This adhesive will hold your eyelash for 3 weeks or longer if you avoid carefully water contact with lashes.&lt;br /&gt;The only small inconvenience is its white color; but this is corrected by applying a black eye liner along contour of eyes after application of lashes.&lt;br /&gt;This is a surgical adhesive that will not itch or bring tears to your eyes during and after lashes application.</li>
            <li> I use it for cheeper eyelashes I buy will last longer. It does the job but it turns into a goop that takes awhile to completely wash off my face.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly, pergectly packed and in excellent condition. Have used this product for years, however it is difficult to find a drugstore that carries the product.  Thank God for the internet!</li>
            <li> I bought this product here and it stink really really bad. Then i bought the same product @Wallmart and actually didn&#x27;t stink as bad as the one that i bought over here!  So i was disappointed...</li>
            <li> I am on the fence with this one. I have only used it 3 times, I know it is a favorite with the Youtube people, also they have a waterproof one, and I haven&#x27;t used it enough to give a proper review, but I will say it is O.K. so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just Regular Duo Adhesive they are selling it as Surgical 👎🏼 They are Frauds Don&#x27;t Waste your Money .</li>
            <li> This product that I purchased as eyelash adhesive came in a box that said it was surgical adhesive, on one side a sticker that read eyelash adhesive had been placed over the original labeling that I guess turned it into eyelash adhesive.  The label information on the box stated that it is ideal for adheraring small, neat, comforatable dressings to scalp and facial wounds, boils and other hard to dress areas.  I am unsure how this product will function as an eyelash adhesive and may not even try to use it as such.</li>
            <li> WARNING: This is NOT surgical grade. This REGULAR DUO. It is a good product but go to Sally&#x27;s or Walgreens and save yourself the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> I love this glue. It takes a while to get tacky though. You can&#x27;t use a lot but it tends to come out a little to fast. Use proper removal cause it sticks to you very well. If you get in your eyes it does burn.All in all I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> There is no such thing as &amp;#34;surgical&amp;#34; eyelash adhesive. How many eyelash surgeries have you ever heard of? Also if a product was medical grade, it would be required by law to have an NDC (national drug code).&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product if you&#x27;re looking for semi-clear glue but there&#x27;s nothing surgical about it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best adhesive for false eye lashes!!!  I&#x27;ve used every other kind and this one still is the best.</li>
            <li> Duo adhesive is a great adhesive to apply artificial eyelashes.  Those who sell these kinds of lashes usually offer this adhesive for application, as well as others.  However, I&#x27;ve found from personal experience that this is the best.  I was happy to find it, among other products I enjoy, on the Amazon.com website.</li>
            <li> definitely the best false eyelash glue. I like to use it whether I&#x27;m applying MAC eyelashes or the cheap ones that you get at the drug store. It has a firm hold and this seller got it to me in 2-3 days as promised. highly recommend it. I&#x27;ve never used anything else as far as eyelash glue goes (the small cheapo bottles of eyelash glue they put in those \\&quot;value pack\\&quot; eyelash kits are so useless don&#x27;t even bother with those) and it lasts for months depending on how frequently you wear them. I&#x27;d say its good for at least 6 months or so if you use eyelashes every weekend when you go out.</li>
            <li> I got the item and it couldnt of worked better!!! I got this item alot faster than I expected. Used it the moment i opend it and it worked GREAT.</li>
            <li> Caused issues with my eyes, still waiting for two weeks to get better.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, doesn&#x27;t drip and holds well *The wife*</li>
            <li> Is not clear, its whiite. So its so hard to use it becaits white. I hope they  come out that really clear..</li>
            <li> this is the glue u want.  dries clear.  removes efficiently.  will not pull lashes or skin.  fabulous.</li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH ITS A BIT PRICEY FOR MY BUDGET, I WANTED TO GET A GLUE THAT HAD STAYING POWER, ESPECIALLY FOR&lt;br /&gt;FALSE LASHES. THIS DEFINITELY DOES THE JOB AND IS STILL EASY TO TAKE OFF AT NIGHT WITH NO RESIDUE LEFT ON SKIN. PLUS ITS A LARGE SIZE, SO REALLY ITS A GREAT DEAL IN THE LONG RUN.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to get this product in the mail forever. But when it got here it was regular duo eyelash glue and not surgical eyelash glue. I&#x27;m really annoyed by that</li>
            <li> It does have a weird smell but works great holds your falsies great and last forever I wear mine from 10am-9pm and does not fall off. Highly recommend it for sure going to buy again</li>
            <li> Love the glue, it really holds very well. Fast shipper. I will purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> when it arrived, it smelled rotten and toxic...</li>
            <li> Comes out white and dries clear, but has a sheen to it. You get a super good amount of glue for the price. I&#x27;ve bought a veryyyy small bottle of glue at target for literally the same price as this so this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Very secure hold. Exceptional product.</li>
            <li> Awesome and holds my lashes all day long. It&#x27;s the only glue Ill ever use again and a great price.</li>
            <li> This is NOT Duo Surgical Eyelash Adhesive. Beware of false advertising.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate or make your eyes itch. It stays on very well even when crying if you keep blotting the tears away. Dries good and clear. Will be buying this brand again and its a very good size I won&#x27;t need to buy another for a couple years you only need a tiny bit. Love love :-) would and I do recommend this to any one who wears fake lashes.</li>
            <li> people ask me if  my lashes real. lol i say it is all about the glue and i mean this from the bottom of my heart. drys clear like magic. i call it a super miracle eye glue, without any irritation at all. glue is good on the lashes as well as coming off for reuse every time.</li>
            <li> This Product was okay. I have heard lots of reviews and they all loved it. But for me I think I am allergic.</li>
            <li> It works great for me but it is a little bit difficult to take off because it sticks so well.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use any other kind of lash adhesive, but be careful,  I gave my second tube to a friend and she had to throw it away, because it made he eyelids itchy.  So test it out before using it.  If you are not allergic, it is an awesome product.  A little goes a long way, so I would only buy one tube at a time.</li>
            <li> This was not surgical eyelash glue, this is false advertisement. I am very unhappy, I could have easily gone to the drugstore and bought this item for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I rated it three stars because I don&#x27;t find the tube easy to use. It takes some practice to squeeze out a thin line versus a big thick blog of glue.</li>
            <li> no complains what so ever. it really sticks and it dries very fast? it&#x27;s the first eyelash adhesive i use and im glad it was! i dont like to go through so much beauty troubles. Also very cheap price. A+ dont give it a second thought.</li>
            <li> ADHESIVE IS VERY EASY TO TAKE OFF AT THE END OF THE DAY.  ALSO VERY EASY TO APPLY.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> The box containing the adhesive had been opened, and the directions were not included. Works well though but can get a little crusty.</li>
            <li> I choose this product because of the great reviews...after i tried it.....I rated it a 10! goes on smooth and dries quick!</li>
            <li> my rating is because I am happy with the product, I like how it works, and I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> This is probably an ok product for use on eyelashes.  I purchased it for another use.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because its a good brand.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it works well and had a fast shipping time&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend this product to anyone interested in a strong eyelash adhesive</li>
            <li> I love this, it works great!!!</li>
            <li> Worked great.  Ordered for an actress who is allergic to the regular eyelash adhesive.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!!!!! Lashes stayed on all day.no.visible glue I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I ordered Duo Surgical Adhesive but received Duo Eyelash Adhesive. They are Not the same. Surgical Adhesive is very easy to remove and comes off in a clean strip. It&#x27;s not Gooey And Sticky, The Eyelash Adhesive is.  Now I Have To Pay To Ship This Back. It was advertised as Surgical, FALSE ADVERTISING!  :(</li>
            <li> I found out it turns white when wet so beware!!  So if your eyes tend to water from laughing or allergies, be careful!  Also, holds only slightly better than the &amp;#34;non-surgical&amp;#34; tube.  By the way, nothing on the actual tube itself signifies that it is for surgical purposes.  Save your money.</li>
