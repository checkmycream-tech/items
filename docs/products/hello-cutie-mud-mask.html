            <li>Makes my skin feel amazing.</li>

            <li>I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;boars hair brush&amp;#34; is a nice addition, as it helps make the application even</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like a minty like smell.</li>
            <li>that thanks to the best products.</li>
            <li>feel nice and smell nice</li>
            <li>Nice stuff.</li>

            <li>Feels nice on face.</li>
            <li>It feels kind of tingly when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>It was nice addition to the mask to get a brush to help with application.</li>
            <li>There is a smell but a nice smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now a trick I do when I mask after you have used a warm cloth to remove the mask.</li>
            <li>So word of advice warm water always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now who could use this.</li>
            <li>The applicator brush that came with it came so handy</li>
            <li>That was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making a great product!</li>
            <li>It feels really nice on your face.</li>
            <li>I liked the the mask and so did my cousin.</li>
            <li>I &#x27;m have an effect I am grateful popular</li>
            <li>Honestly though, who can afford it these days?</li>
            <li>Regardless, all opinions expressed are still 100% my own.</li>
            <li>The face mask goes on very nice &amp; smooth with the included boars head brush.  </li>
            <li>very effective, clean</li>
            <li>I can however, say that the immediate results are pretty good!</li>
            <li>Of all the masks I bought, this by far is the best one</li>
            <li>So far I am impressed with how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>It’s okay though, when all was said and done, and I washed the mask off, my face felt amazing.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much!!!</li>
            <li>The best part is that it dries fast, doesn&#x27;t crack, and comes off easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, cool, smells good, and feels so good on my face.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so clean and bright.</li>
            <li>There are much better alternatives out there that are cheaper and more effective.</li>
            <li>I found this mask to be most effective mask I have tried for more acne and oily skin.  </li>
            <li>This mask is a life saver, I love how smooth and good looking it leaves my face.</li>
            <li>A deal helps, and this one offered a great one with free shipping- combined with the free brush applicator I had to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush it comes with makes for a very smooth and easy application as well!</li>
            <li>best  pore reducer I found is the white clay  mineral mask by Lancome, it is the best so far at producing visible change.</li>
            <li>It burned at first, but once it started drying it felt great.</li>
            <li>;-)This is a great clarifying mask</li>
            <li>My skin felt very smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on day five of using my hello cutie mud mask and so far the results are remarkable!</li>
            <li>The mask removed easily with no scrubbing and the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li>I just use warm water on a wash cloth and it comes off easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was also easy to rinse off with some warm water..</li>
            <li>and I was able to remove it easily with warm water and a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change in my skin tone as well as the softness of my face!</li>
            <li>I love love the smell of this mask</li>

            <li>I use it once a week and have noticed a tremendous difference in mmy skin.</li>
            <li>Product came rather quickly.  </li>

            <li>The best part you can actually see it go deep in your pores.</li>
            <li>It has been a great fit for me between my problem skin and busy lifestyle, and because I strive to find products without a lot of chemicals in them.for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because my skin is sensitive Im only using this once a week, so I can&#x27;t say if it helps with fine lines / wrinkles, but it is very nice</li>

            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: Complimentary product was received to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li>Great mask...similar, but half the cost as GlamGlow masks which are really pricey!</li>
            <li>Sometimes if you do use a super hot heat it can defeat the purpose.</li>
            <li>Received it and used it right</li>
            <li>but I felt the difference right away.</li>
            <li>Loving this mask, I use it right before my period and it quells my usual breakouts better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The mask washed off easily, and I was left with smaller pores and bright radiant skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and clean!</li>
            <li>It goes on your face so smooth and leaves it feeling amazing as if you had just come out from a professional place for a facial.</li>
            <li>The mask goes on extra smooth and washes off pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Unlike many masks I&#x27;ve used,  this one was not painful once it dried &amp; washing it off was really easy.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; the impurities or tightening that I&#x27;ve felt in the past, but it did clean my face pretty good</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something that would clean  good, and finally I found something actually works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so effective yet gentle enough for use 3x a week.</li>
            <li>Got it super fast</li>
            <li>The brush makes the mud application so easy and no messy.  </li>
            <li>Although the jar is kind of small, with the boar&#x27;s brush, I feel like this product will last a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>tried twice already, works so good, skin feels so tight after using.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and I can instantly feel a bit of tingling which to me feels like it is working.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>It helps to clear up your pores anf make your skin look fresh and clean.</li>

            <li>I will definitely be ordering more and so will my family😉</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time with a friend</li>

            <li>Really pulls out impurities and oils and leaves your skin fresh.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Which will be awhile because there is so much product!</li>
            <li>it does felt tingly at fist and then tighten the skin , refresh , soft , smooth .</li>
            <li>i wish it comes more larger size</li>
            <li>DO YOUR RESEARCH!!!!&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who has Rosacea, this will most likely turn your face redder than ever.</li>
            <li>I used this mask for the first time yesterday (and made my husband use it too).</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>I did not feel the tightness most people felt, but that may be because I did not put enough on.</li>
            <li>Could really see it working on my husband&#x27;s blackheads!</li>
            <li>used this on my face face for the first time as well as a spot treatment and it cleared up his whitehead over night.</li>
            <li>Like a spa ;)</li>
            <li>But until I have used it several times, then can write a better review.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels so much cleaner after use and looks refreshed!</li>
            <li>My face tingled and I can tell a difference after the first application.</li>
            <li>This facial mask is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this product and will definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time to use mud mask</li>
            <li>so the first time I used it</li>
            <li>My skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>You can see a difference first use</li>
            <li>Ok to use, but see no different after use.</li>
            <li>, it lasted me for a whole year!</li>
            <li>So being able to use Hello Cutie’s Mud Mask makes me feel like I am having a short visit to the spa for the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>went into the bathroom, turned the shower on hot</li>
            <li>skin did feel clean after using this - deep clean.</li>
            <li>It helps clear up problem skin, and when I use it I am able to easily scrub off dry skin in the shower after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps clear up problem skin, and when I use it I am able to easily scrub off dry skin in the shower after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It spreads the mask easily with no mess and rinses fast.  </li>
            <li>Now I would suggest to use a warm cloth not hot.</li>
            <li>My face is clean and clear.</li>
            <li>This natural facial mask is amazing.</li>
            <li>After using it my skin was so soft and clean feeling</li>
            <li>It felt like it sucked all the gunk from my pores and left my skin feeling fresh and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Well first I have acne prone skin, large oily pores and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>The mask feels very smooth- like a thin lotion and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I have used others in the past where if I laughed i would crack and hurt my face.</li>
            <li>This left my skin feeling so fresh and clean</li>
            <li>after using face mask, i really felt my face so clean , felt soft.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I have VERY sensitive skin and many masks leave my face red.</li>
            <li>So I would now have to consider my skin mild breakouts and sometimes sensitive.</li>
            <li>It leaves her face smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li>After cleansing my face, my face felt super soft.  </li>
            <li>It turns to a lighter shade of gray as it dries except for the areas that have blackheads and large pores</li>
            <li>My face gets a nice tight feeling.</li>
            <li>I use the Neutragena Alcohol-Free Toner after I use the mask and together this regiment is making a huge different.</li>
            <li>it is very soothing.</li>
            <li>but it left my skin feeling smooth and not irritated at all.</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>mud mask is a dark grey color and has a nice, smooth consistency.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use too much of the mask, as I&#x27;m prone to do.</li>
            <li>I did not see too much difference after using it.</li>
            <li>Also it really helped get rid of the acne on my face.  </li>
            <li>You never know if they are real or not.</li>
            <li>i am very impress with this product .</li>
            <li>This product did not help much, I do not recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really cleans your pores and firms your face.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone!  </li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this mask!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know much about this company but needed to try something to help my acne flare-ups.  </li>
            <li>This was a fantastic product at such an affordable price!  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend so much, but after using a bunch of cheaper masks with zero results</li>
            <li>It seemed to reduce the size of my pores and made my skin extra smooth.</li>
            <li>The mask is really works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>super,My wife really like,I bought it through a discount</li>
            <li>It really firms your face</li>
            <li>I appreciated the brush for applying this.</li>
            <li>and I recommend this highly if you need to get rid of impurities on your skin!</li>
            <li>There were very tan muscular men serving me drinks as I lounged on a comfy chase.</li>
            <li>The cooling effect of the mud drying is kind of cold in the winter, but will feel nice in the summer.  </li>
            <li>Being able to take a few minutes out of my day just for me rarely happens.</li>
            <li>The great thing is that you get a nice thin, even layer by using the brush (instead of using fingers), so it isn&#x27;t messy or lumpy, and dries faster and dries evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comes with a cute little fan brush to apply and makes my face feel clean but not tight and itchy!</li>
            <li>Once dry you can actually see it pulling the oil out of your pores - kind of gross and amazing at the same time!!  </li>
            <li>Love it - almost get a little bit of a tingly feeling when its first applied.</li>
            <li>I purchased two more for myself and other daughters.</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes of having the mask on it started drying light blue except where I&#x27;m normally oily.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel soft after the first use.</li>
            <li>Another cool thing about this mask is that you can also use it for spot treatment (I used it when I felt a potential breakout).</li>
            <li>it is much more convenient and less wasteful then using my hands to apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had an acne problem, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older</li>
            <li>Mainly, I apply it on my nose area to deal with blackheads.</li>
            <li>I have as I have gotten older</li>
            <li>I made sure that I cleansed my face before I used it again and low and behold 3 days later</li>
            <li>I also love that it came with the boars hair brush because with it a little goes a long way and it helps with providing a smooth application.  </li>
            <li>Then I turn on the cool water and that helps for me to calm my skin down.</li>
            <li>Highly comparable to &amp;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It looked high grade quality though</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>After just the short time I&#x27;ve been using this, my skin is clear and old blemish spots are clearing up very quickly.</li>
            <li>My days are long - but mud masks are easy enough for me to fit into my schedule, since I apply before showering (and I can actually get stuff done while I have it</li>
            <li>My days are long - but mud masks are easy enough for me to fit into my schedule, since I apply before showering (and I can actually get stuff done while I have it</li>
            <li>On the days I use the mask, I&#x27;ve noticed my T-zone feeling a little more oily by evening time, BUT I don&#x27;t have a feeling of build-up anymore.  </li>
            <li>It definitely removed 100% of my blackheads, for the first time ever!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll try this a few more times, and if any radical changes occur, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li>Cant wait to see the results after a few more treatments.</li>
            <li>I am a firm believer in masks and have tried many over the years.  </li>
            <li>My skin is oily but has a lot of dry patches &amp; this mask just made my skin so soft, smooth &amp; have the glow I had when I was in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually just the right thickness.</li>
            <li>remove, You simply run water over your face and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li>The brush is just stiff enough to be able to brush this on smoothly and evenly, but it is soft enough that it is gentle on your skin and glides around my nose or wherever I am trying to apply the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t  irritate my sensitive skin leave my face tight and smooth!</li>
            <li>feel clean after use and did not irritate my very dry skin</li>
            <li>I scrap off the extra and just run hot water over it to clean it and then let it hang off the shelf to dry.</li>
            <li>Live the way this feels when u put it on.</li>
            <li>For new users, there are thorough instructions on the box.  </li>
            <li>The directions say this can be used 2-3 times per week and will definitely be a new part of our skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>It makes it a mess free application and is easy to smooth that thin layer on.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>About 4 hours after the first time I used this I had a couple new bumps on my forehead and cheek, but after I used the mask the next day they were practically gone.  </li>
            <li>Normally when I use masks, it makes a huge mess</li>
            <li>My sister even complimented how clear and refreshed my face looked!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can see the effect clearly on my nose!</li>
            <li>Definitely shrink pores after first time use</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The boar&#x27;s hair brush was able to smooth out the mud mask in a thin layer all over my face, preventing wasting extra product as you would to apply with your hand.</li>
            <li>and I was able to see the mask soaked up oil on my nose and forehand (the usual oily zones).&lt;br</li>
            <li>After years of using proactive and other products claiming to deliver results, I&#x27;m glad to have finally found a product that works!</li>
            <li>Not harsh on my skin at all!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this mask!</li>
            <li>It is actually the first face mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am really careful about what I put on my skin so that I am not using products full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Also, it helped the fine lines that I was starting to see because of how dry my skin was.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the mud mask is a thin claylike mixture easy to apply amazing ingredients like pomegranate, chamomile, green tea, hyaluronic acid, aloe, peppermint, eucalyptus, activated charcoal, Vitamin B3, and DMAE&lt;</li>
            <li>It is a joy to put on, leave on (I just read for a few minutes or do a little cleaning) and taking it off is simple....</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this mask.  </li>
            <li>I should mention that I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>leave the mask on until it completely dries.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It contains natural ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;In spite of my sensitive skin, nothing was occured.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>I waited a really long time cause I am so funny about the reviews I read.</li>
            <li>Used twice and blackheads are nearly gone.</li>
            <li>It cools your skin and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It works like it should and never dried out my skin or caused any irritation</li>
            <li>I used it once so far &amp; my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had no problems with it.  </li>
            <li>make my skin sooooooo soft.</li>
            <li>but so far these are the things I notice.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product cleans out pores, made my skin soft, and did not irritate it at all.</li>
            <li>but it felt really oily the next day.</li>
            <li>Will keep using as directed and hope to see some changes to this old face.</li>
            <li>It was as if soft music began playing</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $27 if it was so tiny compare to the mud mask I brought last year.</li>
            <li>Mask is &amp;#34;stimulating&amp;#34; with an intense tingling sensation when first applied that becomes less noticeable as it drys.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling tight, moisturized, and clean.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it may be a little more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth buying a product that really works than spending money on products that don&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li>By using the applicator I am able to evenly apply the mask which of course will help the product go a long way without waste.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this product &amp; will be purchasing it again in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would be nice if the product could be ordered without the brush for a few bucks less.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used many masks, as I have VERY sensitive skin and have broken out with face rashes after using them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious to see if the results will hold up longer if I use this consistently for a while...</li>
            <li>It does have a little tingle to it which quickly subsides.  </li>
            <li>I have a new routine to my facial system now!  </li>
            <li>I love this mask so hard!</li>
            <li>It helps so much with taking out blackheads without leaving the skin dry.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this once so far, but would like to put in a review for all of those like myself who have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing missing was the free boars hair brush.</li>
            <li>I feel like it is so tight and fresh.</li>
            <li>The black color of product destroyed my white wash rag, if you decide to order make sure to use an old rag that can be thrown in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pores on my nose and cheeks are not as tight as I want them to be.</li>
            <li>My face is soft and smoother, and my pores have gotten smaller</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they advertise this for sensitive skin, I only used it one day</li>
            <li>Admittedly, it does seem as though my face goes back to normal by the next morning.</li>
            <li>I also have noticed that my pores have decreased in size, so I can say I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have been using it every other day for about two weeks now as I have oily skin and large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>At first you will look quite dark but the mask will later dry to a rather light green color.</li>
            <li>The other one works really well</li>
            <li>I actually have left this mask on far longer than the 5-15 minutes recommended, and it does not irritate my skin at all even if I leave it on for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am now in my early 30&#x27;s &amp; it has been a challenge to find products that actually do what they say but this one is definitely one of those.</li>
            <li>It clears up after a few seconds, but be aware of that.</li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it makes it so easy to apply &amp; you don&#x27;t waste or make a mess like you would if applied with your fingers.</li>
            <li>you first put the mask on, it tingles, but nothing painful, it&#x27;s refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Those spots were nearly black, so I guess it really does soak up any oil.</li>
            <li>The mask dries without flaking off, meaning no mess while waiting for it to dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is mud, and while the jar isn&#x27;t huge you only need a thin layer to cover your face</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I know there is nothing better than a day at the spa!</li>
            <li> and I love this mask!</li>
            <li> This mask is great and the brush that comes with it makes it sooo easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It does not have the best looking color, but I could not expect a mud mask to be a pretty or neon color and still think that it was healthy and good for my skin.</li>
            <li> very good item and useful for me</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I had to moisturize immediately afterwards, but once I did, my skin felt amazing.</li>
            <li> It went on amazingly with the boar hair brush.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> This product was amazing.</li>
            <li> the brush itself is amazing..</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;boars hair brush&amp;#34; is a nice addition, as it helps make the application even</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like a minty like smell.</li>
            <li> that thanks to the best products.</li>
            <li> feel nice and smell nice</li>
            <li> Nice stuff.</li>
            <li> in addition the mask has a nice minty smell to it.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on face.</li>
            <li> It feels kind of tingly when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> It was nice addition to the mask to get a brush to help with application.</li>
            <li> There is a smell but a nice smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now a trick I do when I mask after you have used a warm cloth to remove the mask.</li>
            <li> So word of advice warm water always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now who could use this.</li>
            <li> The applicator brush that came with it came so handy</li>
            <li> That was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making a great product!</li>
            <li> It feels really nice on your face.</li>
            <li> I liked the the mask and so did my cousin.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m have an effect I am grateful popular</li>
            <li> Honestly though, who can afford it these days?</li>
            <li> Regardless, all opinions expressed are still 100% my own.</li>
            <li> The face mask goes on very nice &amp; smooth with the included boars head brush.  </li>
            <li> very effective, clean</li>
            <li> I can however, say that the immediate results are pretty good!</li>
            <li> Of all the masks I bought, this by far is the best one</li>
            <li> So far I am impressed with how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> It’s okay though, when all was said and done, and I washed the mask off, my face felt amazing.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much!!!</li>
            <li> The best part is that it dries fast, doesn&#x27;t crack, and comes off easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, cool, smells good, and feels so good on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so clean and bright.</li>
            <li> There are much better alternatives out there that are cheaper and more effective.</li>
            <li> I found this mask to be most effective mask I have tried for more acne and oily skin.  </li>
            <li> This mask is a life saver, I love how smooth and good looking it leaves my face.</li>
            <li> A deal helps, and this one offered a great one with free shipping- combined with the free brush applicator I had to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush it comes with makes for a very smooth and easy application as well!</li>
            <li> best  pore reducer I found is the white clay  mineral mask by Lancome, it is the best so far at producing visible change.</li>
            <li> It burned at first, but once it started drying it felt great.</li>
            <li> ;-)This is a great clarifying mask</li>
            <li> My skin felt very smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on day five of using my hello cutie mud mask and so far the results are remarkable!</li>
            <li> The mask removed easily with no scrubbing and the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li> I just use warm water on a wash cloth and it comes off easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was also easy to rinse off with some warm water..</li>
            <li> and I was able to remove it easily with warm water and a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change in my skin tone as well as the softness of my face!</li>
            <li> I love love the smell of this mask</li>
            <li> And cute packaging :)</li>
            <li> I love the at this mask for at home spa nights with friends.</li>

            <li> love this product</li>

            <li> but I felt the difference right away.</li>

            <li> Unlike many masks I&#x27;ve used,  this one was not painful once it dried &amp; washing it off was really easy.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; the impurities or tightening that I&#x27;ve felt in the past, but it did clean my face pretty good</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something that would clean  good, and finally I found something actually works.</li>

            <li> tried twice already, works so good, skin feels so tight after using.</li>

            <li> it does felt tingly at fist and then tighten the skin , refresh , soft , smooth .</li>
            <li> i wish it comes more larger size</li>
            <li> DO YOUR RESEARCH!!!!&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who has Rosacea, this will most likely turn your face redder than ever.</li>
            <li> I used this mask for the first time yesterday (and made my husband use it too).</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> I did not feel the tightness most people felt, but that may be because I did not put enough on.</li>
            <li> Could really see it working on my husband&#x27;s blackheads!</li>
            <li> used this on my face face for the first time as well as a spot treatment and it cleared up his whitehead over night.</li>
            <li> Like a spa ;)</li>
            <li> But until I have used it several times, then can write a better review.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels so much cleaner after use and looks refreshed!</li>
            <li> My face tingled and I can tell a difference after the first application.</li>
            <li> This facial mask is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love this product and will definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use mud mask</li>
            <li> so the first time I used it</li>
            <li> My skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> You can see a difference first use</li>
            <li> Ok to use, but see no different after use.</li>
            <li> , it lasted me for a whole year!</li>
            <li> So being able to use Hello Cutie’s Mud Mask makes me feel like I am having a short visit to the spa for the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> went into the bathroom, turned the shower on hot</li>
            <li> skin did feel clean after using this - deep clean.</li>
            <li> It helps clear up problem skin, and when I use it I am able to easily scrub off dry skin in the shower after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps clear up problem skin, and when I use it I am able to easily scrub off dry skin in the shower after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It spreads the mask easily with no mess and rinses fast.  </li>
            <li> Now I would suggest to use a warm cloth not hot.</li>
            <li> My face is clean and clear.</li>
            <li> This natural facial mask is amazing.</li>
            <li> After using it my skin was so soft and clean feeling</li>
            <li> It felt like it sucked all the gunk from my pores and left my skin feeling fresh and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Well first I have acne prone skin, large oily pores and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> The mask feels very smooth- like a thin lotion and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I have used others in the past where if I laughed i would crack and hurt my face.</li>
            <li> This left my skin feeling so fresh and clean</li>
            <li> after using face mask, i really felt my face so clean , felt soft.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have VERY sensitive skin and many masks leave my face red.</li>
            <li> So I would now have to consider my skin mild breakouts and sometimes sensitive.</li>
            <li> It leaves her face smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li> After cleansing my face, my face felt super soft.  </li>
            <li> It turns to a lighter shade of gray as it dries except for the areas that have blackheads and large pores</li>
            <li> My face gets a nice tight feeling.</li>
            <li> I use the Neutragena Alcohol-Free Toner after I use the mask and together this regiment is making a huge different.</li>
            <li> it is very soothing.</li>
            <li> but it left my skin feeling smooth and not irritated at all.</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> mud mask is a dark grey color and has a nice, smooth consistency.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use too much of the mask, as I&#x27;m prone to do.</li>
            <li> I did not see too much difference after using it.</li>
            <li> Also it really helped get rid of the acne on my face.  </li>
            <li> You never know if they are real or not.</li>
            <li> i am very impress with this product .</li>
            <li> This product did not help much, I do not recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really cleans your pores and firms your face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone!  </li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this mask!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know much about this company but needed to try something to help my acne flare-ups.  </li>
            <li> This was a fantastic product at such an affordable price!  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend so much, but after using a bunch of cheaper masks with zero results</li>
            <li> It seemed to reduce the size of my pores and made my skin extra smooth.</li>
            <li> The mask is really works.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> super,My wife really like,I bought it through a discount</li>
            <li> It really firms your face</li>
            <li> I appreciated the brush for applying this.</li>
            <li> and I recommend this highly if you need to get rid of impurities on your skin!</li>
            <li> There were very tan muscular men serving me drinks as I lounged on a comfy chase.</li>
            <li> The cooling effect of the mud drying is kind of cold in the winter, but will feel nice in the summer.  </li>
            <li> Being able to take a few minutes out of my day just for me rarely happens.</li>
            <li> The great thing is that you get a nice thin, even layer by using the brush (instead of using fingers), so it isn&#x27;t messy or lumpy, and dries faster and dries evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comes with a cute little fan brush to apply and makes my face feel clean but not tight and itchy!</li>
            <li> Once dry you can actually see it pulling the oil out of your pores - kind of gross and amazing at the same time!!  </li>
            <li> Love it - almost get a little bit of a tingly feeling when its first applied.</li>
            <li> I purchased two more for myself and other daughters.</li>
            <li> After 5 minutes of having the mask on it started drying light blue except where I&#x27;m normally oily.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel soft after the first use.</li>
            <li> Another cool thing about this mask is that you can also use it for spot treatment (I used it when I felt a potential breakout).</li>
            <li> it is much more convenient and less wasteful then using my hands to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an acne problem, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older</li>
            <li> Mainly, I apply it on my nose area to deal with blackheads.</li>
            <li> I have as I have gotten older</li>
            <li> I made sure that I cleansed my face before I used it again and low and behold 3 days later</li>
            <li> I also love that it came with the boars hair brush because with it a little goes a long way and it helps with providing a smooth application.  </li>
            <li> Then I turn on the cool water and that helps for me to calm my skin down.</li>
            <li> Highly comparable to &amp;</li>

            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After just the short time I&#x27;ve been using this, my skin is clear and old blemish spots are clearing up very quickly.</li>
            <li> My days are long - but mud masks are easy enough for me to fit into my schedule, since I apply before showering (and I can actually get stuff done while I have it</li>
            <li> My days are long - but mud masks are easy enough for me to fit into my schedule, since I apply before showering (and I can actually get stuff done while I have it</li>
            <li> On the days I use the mask, I&#x27;ve noticed my T-zone feeling a little more oily by evening time, BUT I don&#x27;t have a feeling of build-up anymore.  </li>
            <li> It definitely removed 100% of my blackheads, for the first time ever!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll try this a few more times, and if any radical changes occur, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> Cant wait to see the results after a few more treatments.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in masks and have tried many over the years.  </li>
            <li> My skin is oily but has a lot of dry patches &amp; this mask just made my skin so soft, smooth &amp; have the glow I had when I was in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually just the right thickness.</li>
            <li> remove, You simply run water over your face and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li> The brush is just stiff enough to be able to brush this on smoothly and evenly, but it is soft enough that it is gentle on your skin and glides around my nose or wherever I am trying to apply the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t  irritate my sensitive skin leave my face tight and smooth!</li>
            <li> feel clean after use and did not irritate my very dry skin</li>
            <li> I scrap off the extra and just run hot water over it to clean it and then let it hang off the shelf to dry.</li>
            <li> Live the way this feels when u put it on.</li>
            <li> For new users, there are thorough instructions on the box.  </li>
            <li> The directions say this can be used 2-3 times per week and will definitely be a new part of our skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> It makes it a mess free application and is easy to smooth that thin layer on.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> About 4 hours after the first time I used this I had a couple new bumps on my forehead and cheek, but after I used the mask the next day they were practically gone.  </li>
            <li> Normally when I use masks, it makes a huge mess</li>
            <li> My sister even complimented how clear and refreshed my face looked!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can see the effect clearly on my nose!</li>
            <li> Definitely shrink pores after first time use</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The boar&#x27;s hair brush was able to smooth out the mud mask in a thin layer all over my face, preventing wasting extra product as you would to apply with your hand.</li>
            <li> and I was able to see the mask soaked up oil on my nose and forehand (the usual oily zones).&lt;br</li>
            <li> After years of using proactive and other products claiming to deliver results, I&#x27;m glad to have finally found a product that works!</li>
            <li> Not harsh on my skin at all!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this mask!</li>
            <li> It is actually the first face mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am really careful about what I put on my skin so that I am not using products full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Also, it helped the fine lines that I was starting to see because of how dry my skin was.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the mud mask is a thin claylike mixture easy to apply amazing ingredients like pomegranate, chamomile, green tea, hyaluronic acid, aloe, peppermint, eucalyptus, activated charcoal, Vitamin B3, and DMAE&lt;</li>
            <li> It is a joy to put on, leave on (I just read for a few minutes or do a little cleaning) and taking it off is simple....</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this mask.  </li>
            <li> I should mention that I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> leave the mask on until it completely dries.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It contains natural ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;In spite of my sensitive skin, nothing was occured.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I waited a really long time cause I am so funny about the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> Used twice and blackheads are nearly gone.</li>
            <li> It cools your skin and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It works like it should and never dried out my skin or caused any irritation</li>
            <li> I used it once so far &amp; my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had no problems with it.  </li>
            <li> make my skin sooooooo soft.</li>
            <li> but so far these are the things I notice.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product cleans out pores, made my skin soft, and did not irritate it at all.</li>
            <li> but it felt really oily the next day.</li>
            <li> Will keep using as directed and hope to see some changes to this old face.</li>
            <li> It was as if soft music began playing</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $27 if it was so tiny compare to the mud mask I brought last year.</li>
            <li> Mask is &amp;#34;stimulating&amp;#34; with an intense tingling sensation when first applied that becomes less noticeable as it drys.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling tight, moisturized, and clean.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it may be a little more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth buying a product that really works than spending money on products that don&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li> By using the applicator I am able to evenly apply the mask which of course will help the product go a long way without waste.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend this product &amp; will be purchasing it again in the future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would be nice if the product could be ordered without the brush for a few bucks less.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many masks, as I have VERY sensitive skin and have broken out with face rashes after using them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see if the results will hold up longer if I use this consistently for a while...</li>
            <li> It does have a little tingle to it which quickly subsides.  </li>
            <li> I have a new routine to my facial system now!  </li>
            <li> I love this mask so hard!</li>
            <li> It helps so much with taking out blackheads without leaving the skin dry.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this once so far, but would like to put in a review for all of those like myself who have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing missing was the free boars hair brush.</li>
            <li> I feel like it is so tight and fresh.</li>
            <li> The black color of product destroyed my white wash rag, if you decide to order make sure to use an old rag that can be thrown in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pores on my nose and cheeks are not as tight as I want them to be.</li>
            <li> My face is soft and smoother, and my pores have gotten smaller</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they advertise this for sensitive skin, I only used it one day</li>
            <li> Admittedly, it does seem as though my face goes back to normal by the next morning.</li>
            <li> I also have noticed that my pores have decreased in size, so I can say I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using it every other day for about two weeks now as I have oily skin and large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> At first you will look quite dark but the mask will later dry to a rather light green color.</li>
            <li> The other one works really well</li>
            <li> I actually have left this mask on far longer than the 5-15 minutes recommended, and it does not irritate my skin at all even if I leave it on for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am now in my early 30&#x27;s &amp; it has been a challenge to find products that actually do what they say but this one is definitely one of those.</li>
            <li> It clears up after a few seconds, but be aware of that.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it makes it so easy to apply &amp; you don&#x27;t waste or make a mess like you would if applied with your fingers.</li>
            <li> you first put the mask on, it tingles, but nothing painful, it&#x27;s refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Those spots were nearly black, so I guess it really does soak up any oil.</li>
            <li> The mask dries without flaking off, meaning no mess while waiting for it to dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is mud, and while the jar isn&#x27;t huge you only need a thin layer to cover your face</li>
            <li> /&gt;After it fully dried and no more oil spots were appearing, I dabbed the mask with some water to moisten it for easy removal.</li>
            <li> It did not have any weird smell to it and left my skin felling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Skin feels so soft when I&#x27;m done, far less dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> I have used other masks in the past that I could not keep on for the full time because of the odor.  </li>
            <li> There was a slight tingling when applied &amp; it dried fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> used the handle fan brush that was included and applied a thin layer onto my clean face.</li>
            <li> Since I now have the brush already and it&#x27;ll likely last as long as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I buy new ones all the time, but only like a few.</li>
            <li> The result of using this product is limited, not much visible action going on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for about two weeks, so I can&#x27;t say what the long term results will be.</li>
            <li> the jar will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The mask looks greenish- grey and gives an instant cooling effect (because of the included peppermint and eucalyptus).</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and tight after I take off the mask, and my pores are noticeably smaller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s, live in a dry climate, and have been dealing with one or two little blemishes here and there for years.  </li>
            <li> are clear and my skin is much less oily.</li>
            <li> My friend and I have very different skin types (mine is dry and hers is acne prone)</li>
            <li> I wanted it to dry enough on me.</li>
            <li> While she has only used it a few times, her skin is almost completely cleared.  </li>
            <li> Very similar to the very expensive other mask that I love!</li>
            <li> , that didn’t last long, I opened my eyes to realize that I was sitting on my toilet (don’t worry, it was closed),</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shaped so that it efficiently spreads a thin  coat of mask, rinses clean easily, and I don&#x27;t have to get my hands dirty.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with problem skin for a long time, and it takes a lot of work to maintain it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about the long term effect, but I think this product is desirable.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with problem skin for a long time, and it takes a lot of work to maintain it.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to wait long .I</li>
            <li> The mid applies evenly &amp; dries add expected.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be the same size</li>
            <li> If you have combination skin, use it in the evening the first few times since it will take your skin a few uses to get accustomed to the product.  </li>
            <li> With the Hello Cutie Mud Mask, you will not find harmful chemicals such as parabens, petroleums, sulfites or other harmful ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again and look into other products that they may have.</li>
            <li> too dry-</li>
            <li> I have an unbalanced skin type,  bouncing around from overly dry to oily @ times.  </li>
            <li> After it began to dry, I started to feel a tightening of my skin.</li>
            <li> After 5 minutes it was dry</li>
            <li> The jar it comes in is teeny tiny, but once I applied the mask I realized that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product is not a &amp;#34;premium product&amp;#34; and is inferior to department store brands that actually cost less.</li>
            <li> I saw smaller pores and some of my black heads were pulled out.</li>
            <li> Even though it is only 2 oz you really only use a small amount each time.</li>
            <li> and I definitely have less blackheads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27; have only had this product for a little while</li>
            <li> It even came with a little facial brush for application.</li>
            <li> It should last at least the next 6 months if I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> My boss even complimented my skin recently...  coming from a man who wouldn&#x27;t notice if I dyed my hair neon green.</li>
            <li> it is very efficiently i apply on a thin layer</li>
            <li> I have spent quite a bit of money trying to find something that would work for me without me having an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on expected date.</li>
            <li> My skin is tightened, pores are smaller and acne gets dried out.</li>
            <li> The mask then tries to get the talc out of your pores.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much less dry</li>
            <li> this mask will last longer since I can use a thin layer, and the brush rinses out without a problem, and I set it out to dry for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way .</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and</li>
            <li> Though it was still messy with the mud all over my sink, next time I&#x27;ll apply the mask before shower, should be less</li>
            <li> It did leave my face feeling tight and yes, a bit dry (nothing my moisturizer couldn&#x27;t fix though!)&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Will definitely be using a few times a week and repurchasing!  </li>
            <li> I have nothing to say that other reviews have not covered.</li>
            <li> No sensitivity issues or other problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not buying it again if it&#x27;s the same small size.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s nose was covered in those little black dots, not sure if they were blackheads or just dirt in her pores, but they were completely gone after using this mask.  </li>
            <li> That means no more wet patches while majority of the mask is dry.</li>
            <li> , I was at first a little skeptical, but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Not worth the expense for a &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The jar is small but it goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> The mask isn&#x27;t too watery that it keep slinging down your face</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that it is not loaded down with perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other mud mask before!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it to get reduce the black marks on my face from acne scars</li>
            <li> I did notice less breakouts.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4.5 stars ( I didn&#x27;t know how to make the half star</li>
            <li> like I have a little &amp;#34;Me&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so it did  burn a little</li>
            <li> and I notice  the wrinkle on my face has diminished a little.  </li>
            <li> It also washes off easier than some of the other clay masks I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I used the brush to put little lighter amount than I usually do with other masks.</li>
            <li> I did feel a little itchy after washing off the clay, but that&#x27;s par for the course for my skin</li>
            <li> I would like to see the little bit of hormonal acne that have on my chin go away, so I will give it some time.</li>
            <li> The product is not runny like some other mask that I have seen in the past.</li>
            <li> I was concerned it might be to harsh</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have a ton of time to devote to my skin between being a busy mom and working.  </li>
            <li> and I think a lot goes to waste because I have to dip my fingers in a mask</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> my skin is uneven in color.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have a ton of time to devote to my skin between being a busy mom and working.</li>
            <li> You can see small dark spots where your problem pores are.</li>
            <li> I like that it has Pomegranate and green tea.</li>
            <li> And I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> The mask detects all those impurities and black heads in your skin!</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty bad</li>
            <li> At the first glance I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wait a little after the mask dries on your face (before rinsing off) and you will beginning to see dots appear where the mask is drawing what I assume to be oil and dirt out of the pores!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the ancient indian clay one in the past, and that one gets a lot of hype.</li>
            <li> I have always had very sensitive skin &amp; in the past few months my skin has just gone from bad to worse.</li>
            <li> I have terrible cystic acne and this has been a huge help in keeping that under control.</li>
            <li> , at least they look that way to me.</li>
            <li> This has eucalyptus and peppermint which is recognized in the Rosacea website as a common irritant ingredient.</li>
            <li> Will keep use it at least once a week！</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been at least a decade since I&#x27;ve tried one.</li>
            <li> I have used other expensive masks but this one beats them all.  </li>
            <li> Bought this mask for my daughter who has had a problem with bad acne for the last three years.  </li>
            <li> so I just rounded it) because it was suppose to come with a brush at least that&#x27;s what the packaging said, but I never got it!</li>
            <li> Idk if this is just south my skin or what tough.</li>
            <li> This mask is a thin one</li>
            <li> This brush helps you put on a thin layer of mask.</li>
            <li> I could of went thicker with the brush, but I went for a thin layer.</li>
            <li> The brush it comes with allows you to use a thin layer as is suggested.</li>
            <li> applied a thin layer to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to apply a thin layer which I did, then leave on for 5 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Like the consistency; thin but not drippy.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad clogged pores on my nose but after using this product they were visibly less.</li>
            <li> Mask has very subtle non-objectionable odor.  </li>
            <li> WEIRD.</li>
            <li> Then it hardens but not to an uncomfortable point.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> My pores didn&#x27;t shrink at all, my skin wasn&#x27;t glowy or anything :(</li>

            <li> I love love the smell of this mask it is very soothing. I have only used it once but loved the way my face felt afterwards. My pores looked tighter than before. I will continue to use this mask as it treated my sensitive skin nicely. I was concerned it might be to harsh but it left my skin feeling smooth and not irritated at all.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect mud mask. It felt great going on and my skin felt great afterwards. And cute packaging :)</li>
            <li> My skin feels great. I will definitely be ordering more and so will my family😉</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Feels great on my skin. ☺</li>
            <li> I love the at this mask for at home spa nights with friends.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this mask.  If you have combination skin, use it in the evening the first few times since it will take your skin a few uses to get accustomed to the product.  About 4 hours after the first time I used this I had a couple new bumps on my forehead and cheek, but after I used the mask the next day they were practically gone.  At the time of this review, I&#x27;ve used the mask 5 different times.  My skin looks great and feels great.  On the days I use the mask, I&#x27;ve noticed my T-zone feeling a little more oily by evening time, BUT I don&#x27;t have a feeling of build-up anymore.  And, the next day leaves me feeling perfectly balanced and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s, live in a dry climate, and have been dealing with one or two little blemishes here and there for years.  After just the short time I&#x27;ve been using this, my skin is clear and old blemish spots are clearing up very quickly.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff! It feels so great and cleans well. I especially like that it came with the application brush. I use it about once a week for 20 minutes. It makes me a like I have a little &amp;#34;Me&amp;#34; time even if I&#x27;m doing housework while wearing it. The best part is that it dries fast, doesn&#x27;t crack, and comes off easily. **I should mention that I have sensitive skin. I rash and break out easily. This product has not caused any sort of reaction. It doesn&#x27;t make it oily or too dry- it just makes it feel fresh!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I actually loved this! I tried it for the first time with a friend and we both felt softer skin immediately after use. It was easy to apply and easy to remove. I had to moisturize immediately afterwards, but once I did, my skin felt amazing. My friend and I have very different skin types (mine is dry and hers is acne prone) and we both loved the results. She said she&#x27;d be buying her own container of this right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing was that this product does tingle upon application. It clears up after a few seconds, but be aware of that.</li>
            <li> I just used this face mask!!! I loved it.  It went on amazingly with the boar hair brush.  My skin felt AMAZING after!  Will definitely be using a few times a week and repurchasing!  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Love this product. My face feels awesome after using this product.</li>
            <li> Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;I used easily.</li>
            <li> I love this product .. Would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product, will buy it again</li>
            <li> Love it! I have been using it every other day for about two weeks now as I have oily skin and large pores on my nose. Do use the boars hair fan brush that comes with. It helped me spread the product more evenly than with my fingers. That means no more wet patches while majority of the mask is dry. Using the fan brush also made it feel as if someone else was doing this for me at a spa. Wait a little after the mask dries on your face (before rinsing off) and you will beginning to see dots appear where the mask is drawing what I assume to be oil and dirt out of the pores!  With this mask I can see that my pores of my nose aren&#x27;t as noticeable as before.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Highly comparable to &amp;#34;Glam Glow&amp;#34; sold at Sephora but at a much better price. Really pulls out impurities and oils and leaves your skin fresh. Use once a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  She love this product and I tried it.  It works really well.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have struggled with problem skin for a long time, and it takes a lot of work to maintain it.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have a ton of time to devote to my skin between being a busy mom and working.  My days are long - but mud masks are easy enough for me to fit into my schedule, since I apply before showering (and I can actually get stuff done while I have it on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hello Cutie Mud Mask is packed with lots of great ingredients, like charcoal, pomegranate, green tea, and so much more.  I am really careful about what I put on my skin so that I am not using products full of chemicals.  With the Hello Cutie Mud Mask, you will not find harmful chemicals such as parabens, petroleums, sulfites or other harmful ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mud mask is a dark grey color and has a nice, smooth consistency.  It has a light minty, pleasant smell, but it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin like some other masks I have used.  It does have a little tingle to it which quickly subsides.  I actually have left this mask on far longer than the 5-15 minutes recommended, and it does not irritate my skin at all even if I leave it on for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product comes with a brush for application!  Normally when I use masks, it makes a huge mess and I think a lot goes to waste because I have to dip my fingers in a mask, it goes on in globs, gets in my hairline, it drips.  The brush is just stiff enough to be able to brush this on smoothly and evenly, but it is soft enough that it is gentle on your skin and glides around my nose or wherever I am trying to apply the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave the mask on until it completely dries.  My face gets a nice tight feeling. The great thing is that you get a nice thin, even layer by using the brush (instead of using fingers), so it isn&#x27;t messy or lumpy, and dries faster and dries evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus this mask will last longer since I can use a thin layer, and the brush rinses out without a problem, and I set it out to dry for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Hello Cutie Mud Mask before showering, and it washes off easily, leaving my skin feeling refreshed.  It helps clear up problem skin, and when I use it I am able to easily scrub off dry skin in the shower after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.  It has been a great fit for me between my problem skin and busy lifestyle, and because I strive to find products without a lot of chemicals in them.for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Hello Cutie Mud Mask before showering, and it washes off easily, leaving my skin feeling refreshed.

            <li> I love this mask!!~ The scent is very pleasing and goes on easily with the included brush. By using the applicator I am able to evenly apply the mask which of course will help the product go a long way without waste. The mask dries without flaking off, meaning no mess while waiting for it to dry.Try it and I bet you will love it too!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent. The smell is light and citrusy, and it tingles in the most lovely way when I put it on. The &amp;#34;boars hair brush&amp;#34; is a nice addition, as it helps make the application even and I don&#x27;t use too much of the mask, as I&#x27;m prone to do. My skin feels soft and tight after I take off the mask, and my pores are noticeably smaller. I use the Neutragena Alcohol-Free Toner after I use the mask and together this regiment is making a huge different. My boss even complimented my skin recently...  coming from a man who wouldn&#x27;t notice if I dyed my hair neon green. WIN!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this mask so you better never discontinue it!</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few weeks. It is good product, but overpriced. I would not spend $35 on it. There are much better alternatives out there that are cheaper and more effective. I did not see too much difference after using it.</li>
            <li> Definitely shrink pores after first time use</li>
            <li> Bought this mask for my daughter who has had a problem with bad acne for the last three years.  While she has only used it a few times, her skin is almost completely cleared.  I was so impressed I started to use it too.  I love the results we are both seeing.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on day five of using my hello cutie mud mask and so far the results are remarkable! It comes with a brush to apply it on your face with. The fragrance is pleasurable  to smell while the mud mask is on your face. It&#x27;s kind of like a minty like smell. The mask isn&#x27;t too watery that it keep slinging down your face it&#x27;s actually just the right thickness. It stays wherever you apply it to. I&#x27;m using it to get reduce the black marks on my face from acne scars and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change in my skin tone as well as the softness of my face! This is a discounted item used for review purposes. Definetly a must have!!</li>
            <li> Best face mask ever! After using it my skin was so soft and clean feeling and it definitely felt like it tightened my skin. I am happy to have found my new go to product!</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  I loved the outcome of my skin after just one application.  My skin felt so clean and bright. I also love that it came with the boars hair brush because with it a little goes a long way and it helps with providing a smooth application.  I have dry, sensitive skin so it did  burn a little but it was definitely bearable.  I highly recommend this product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Feels like a day at the spa.</li>
            <li> I really love it. After using it, my skin looks more heathier.&lt;br /&gt;It contains natural ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;In spite of my sensitive skin, nothing was occured.</li>
            <li> I love this mud mask. I use it once a week and have noticed a tremendous difference in mmy skin. It helps to clear up your pores anf make your skin look fresh and clean. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I is a trade where there is a 5-star fully receive qualification of the product that was used.  I think I want to share with everyone such information.  Always grateful, it is felt that thanks to the best products.</li>
            <li> feel nice and smell nice</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve used it for about a week and I notice  the wrinkle on my face has diminished a little.  Also it really helped get rid of the acne on my face.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Not worth the expense for a &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; name.  This product is not a &amp;#34;premium product&amp;#34; and is inferior to department store brands that actually cost less.</li>
            <li> I got this to try. I loved this face mask.  It did not have any weird smell to it and left my skin felling clean and soft. It was a lighter mask so it was very easy to blend into my skin and washed off great.  If you have sensitive skin this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!!! I waited a really long time cause I am so funny about the reviews I read. You never know if they are real or not. I searched and compared products for months.I finally went ahead and ordered it. I got it on time, and I used it the next morning. Actually I scared my family when I came out with my face covered because they had no clue what I ordered. lol It&#x27;s smooth, cool, smells good, and feels so good on my face. I like the brush. I scrap off the extra and just run hot water over it to clean it and then let it hang off the shelf to dry. My face is soft and smoother, and my pores have gotten smaller, at least they look that way to me. I&#x27;ve never had an acne problem, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older my skin is uneven in color. I would recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s looking for a mud mask that actually works. Yes, it may be a little more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth buying a product that really works than spending money on products that don&#x27;t!! Just do it, you wont regret it, and if you do, they say you can send it back!</li>
            <li> This mask is super! You can see the difference immediately after using it. My face is clean and clear. My husband loves it too!</li>
            <li> Great! I can definitely feel my skin gets smoother and tighter.</li>
            <li> Great price!!! Very similar to the very expensive other mask that I love!</li>
            <li> after using face mask, i really felt my face so clean , felt soft.</li>
            <li> Great mask...similar, but half the cost as GlamGlow masks which are really pricey!</li>
            <li> Wow! I purchased this for my mother and used it once and fell in love! We will be buying this again once we are out of this one. Which will be awhile because there is so much product! Made my skin feel feel like a babys bottom and the next day I swear I looked 5 Years younger! Very impressed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other mud mask before! This one is OK. Didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; the impurities or tightening that I&#x27;ve felt in the past, but it did clean my face pretty good</li>
            <li> i received on 2/24 and used on 2/25 . this is my own home spa facial mask ( Treatment) it does what it describes. i like ( the boar hair brush) it is very efficiently i apply on a thin layer a little goes a long way . it does felt tingly at fist and then tighten the skin , refresh , soft , smooth . the best ingredients all in one! ! i am very impress with this product . i wish it comes more larger size</li>
            <li> This made my face feel really GOOD.....only had the chance to use it once, but I am looking forward to next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural pore reducer and ordered many. The result of using this product is limited, not much visible action going on. The black color of product destroyed my white wash rag, if you decide to order make sure to use an old rag that can be thrown in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pores on my nose and cheeks are not as tight as I want them to be. Not a big problem, just annoyance. This product did not help much, I do not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best  pore reducer I found is the white clay  mineral mask by Lancome, it is the best so far at producing visible change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. I used it weekly for a month and saw no improvements so I stopped using it. However, it didn&#x27;t break me out so I figure it&#x27;s not bad. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Improved my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and applicator.  Makes my skin feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel rejuvenated!</li>
            <li> This mask has been used twice already and I love the feeling of smooth skin after use.  The minty smell is also great - much better then other mask smells.  The mask is easy to apply with the brush and has a tingling feeling on but doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn the skin.  I would recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> DO YOUR RESEARCH!!!!&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who has Rosacea, this will most likely turn your face redder than ever. This has eucalyptus and peppermint which is recognized in the Rosacea website as a common irritant ingredient. I don&#x27;t know why they advertise this for sensitive skin, I only used it one day and now I don&#x27;t know when my redness will fade. You probably want to stick with a mask that has 1 or 2 ingredients, not 20. Link to the info is below...&lt;br /&gt;http://www.rosacea.org/patients/faq.php</li>
            <li> This Mud Mask fit my skin well. I love how it works after my first try ! My skin looks bright right after first use. Will keep use it at least once a week！</li>
            <li> very good item and useful for me</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product!! Simple to use and in 10 minutes your face is flawless and smooth! I have never had a product work so well!! Plan on using it forever!! A product that does what it says and then some!!! Super! Try it and you will be hooked!! A+++++++++</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this product.  Mask is &amp;#34;stimulating&amp;#34; with an intense tingling sensation when first applied that becomes less noticeable as it drys.  Once dry you can actually see it pulling the oil out of your pores - kind of gross and amazing at the same time!!  My daughter is loving it and has been very pleased with how it has helped reduce blackheads on her nose and chin.  That said it definitely tightens your skin.  After washing you &#x27;ll want to use some moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used this mask for the first time yesterday (and made my husband use it too). I loved it so much!!! I&#x27;ve used the ancient indian clay one in the past, and that one gets a lot of hype. this one is so much better!!! It&#x27;s not thick, which i really liked. it glides on smoothly. My face actually felt smoother afterwards! I love trying masks. I buy new ones all the time, but only like a few. I loved this one! and will be getting it again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Love.  Used twice and blackheads are nearly gone.</li>
            <li> So far so good! The product is creamy and substantial. I love that you can put on layers to your preferred thickness. My skin definitely feels more smooth. It also washes off easier than some of the other clay masks I&#x27;ve used in the past. Consider me smitten!</li>
            <li> Great price and great service. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have nothing to say that other reviews have not covered. Buy this masque -the very best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff. My wife likes it alot. Says she feels like shes at a spa.&lt;br /&gt;Received this at a reduced cost to try and then give a review.</li>
            <li> love it you can really feel the difference after</li>
            <li> I have used it twice for now. I can&#x27;t say anything about the long term effect, but I think this product is desirable. It doesn&#x27;t have much smell and easy to wash out. Mainly, I apply it on my nose area to deal with blackheads. I feel my skin tightened after application. This is the effect I was looking for, because I need to remove blackheads leading to enlarged pore. I will keep using it and wait to see the final effect.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something that would clean  good, and finally I found something actually works. My skin feels smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Doesn&#x27;t  irritate my sensitive skin leave my face tight and smooth!</li>
            <li> Nothing life altering, but seems to tighten pores.</li>
            <li> Awesome mask!!! Skin felt and looked great afterwards.</li>
            <li> MADE MY FACE BREAK OUT! WEIRD.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this product has improved this aspect and created smoother skin.  Works great.</li>
            <li> This is a different kind of mask that you apply with a brush. I used the brush to put little lighter amount than I usually do with other masks. I found this mask to be most effective mask I have tried for more acne and oily skin.  I have use it 3 times now and I can see a difference. I  in addition the mask has a nice minty smell to it. It cools your skin and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once so far, but would like to put in a review for all of those like myself who have extremely sensitive skin. I did not feel the tightness most people felt, but that may be because I did not put enough on. The product says it comes with a brush, but mine did not so I may not have put on enough.&lt;br /&gt;It did not make my skin break out, however, which is a huge plus for me. I did feel a little itchy after washing off the clay, but that&#x27;s par for the course for my skin and I just try not to scratch.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try this a few more times, and if any radical changes occur, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and my new go-to when my skin is acting up. It&#x27;s so effective yet gentle enough for use 3x a week. I struggle with acne prone skin and I&#x27;m combination normal-oily and this stuff takes care of it all! The brush it comes with makes for a very smooth and easy application as well!</li>
            <li> Love it - almost get a little bit of a tingly feeling when its first applied. Could really see it working on my husband&#x27;s blackheads! Can&#x27;t wait to keep using it!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with problem skin for a long time, and it takes a lot of work to maintain it. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have a ton of time to devote to my skin between being a busy mom and working. My days are long - but mud masks are easy enough for me to fit into my schedule, since I apply before showering (and I can actually get stuff done while I have it on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product already!&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my face face for the first time as well as a spot treatment and it cleared up his whitehead over night. I shrunk the size of the pimple within 15 minutes and had it gone by the next morning!</li>
            <li> I have an acne prone skin, I&#x27;m 29 and still break out. This mask is a life saver, I love how smooth and good looking it leaves my face. I did notice less breakouts. I give it a 4.5 stars ( I didn&#x27;t know how to make the half star so I just rounded it) because it was suppose to come with a brush at least that&#x27;s what the packaging said, but I never got it!</li>
            <li> feel clean after use and did not irritate my very dry skin</li>
            <li> This mask smells great, and feels great on your skin.  You can feel it tighten as it dries.  It leaves your skin feeling tight, moisturized, and clean.  There is a peppermint/menthol smell to it, that feels similar to an astringent on your skin - it is relaxing, and a great stress reducing mask!</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product, all great ingredients and you can feel it doing the job of deep cleansing and then leaving you with smoother, enriched and HEALTHY SKIN!</li>
            <li> What a great mud mask!! I&#x27;ve used it three times now and I love the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> Ok smell and feel really refresh after washing it off</li>
            <li> I love it. It makes my skin clean,tight and feel fresh. I will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> I love the mask and it dries fast so you don&#x27;t have to wait long .I did notice a difference on my pores and after I use this after 1 week I love the feeling on my face after I washed my face.. I will buy this again whenever it will go on one of the good deal again.</li>
            <li> I like the combination of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;  My skin seems smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Need to use longer to really give a more detailed review.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel absolutely amazing. Love the brush that came with it too.</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells great! Comes with a cute little fan brush to apply and makes my face feel clean but not tight and itchy! Like a spa ;)</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It works like it should and never dried out my skin or caused any irritation</li>
            <li> At the first glance I was a little disappointed. The jar it comes in is teeny tiny, but once I applied the mask I realized that a little goes a long way. I like the fan brush that it comes with. You get the perfect thin application you need, and the brush is super easy to clean. As for the mask, its kind of fun to see it work its magic. I had applied it immediately after double cleansing (remove my makeup with oil, then use a foaming face wash), so I didn&#x27;t think I had any oil on my face. After 5 minutes of having the mask on it started drying light blue except where I&#x27;m normally oily. Those spots were nearly black, so I guess it really does soak up any oil. The mask washed off easily, and I was left with smaller pores and bright radiant skin. I will definitely will be adding this into my routine 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Have on use this one time and it does make my skin feel great.  But until I have used it several times, then can write a better review.  However, did not receive a brush in the order.</li>
            <li> I have always had very sensitive skin &amp; in the past few months my skin has just gone from bad to worse. I have spent quite a bit of money trying to find something that would work for me without me having an allergic reaction to it. I am thankful I decided to give this mask a try because it turned out to be amazing! After just one use my skin drastically improved. My skin is oily but has a lot of dry patches &amp; this mask just made my skin so soft, smooth &amp; have the glow I had when I was in my 20&#x27;s. I am now in my early 30&#x27;s &amp; it has been a challenge to find products that actually do what they say but this one is definitely one of those. Also, it helped the fine lines that I was starting to see because of how dry my skin was. I absolutely love it &amp; will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have really bad clogged pores on my nose but after using this product they were visibly less. The mask goes on extra smooth and washes off pretty easily. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
            <li> Great gift for my wife</li>
            <li> I love this mask. I used it once so far &amp; my skin feels so soft. I would highly recommend it to anyone. The only thing missing was the free boars hair brush. I would love to have one.</li>
            <li> I was kind of scared to buy this at first because iv never heard of it but I decided to give it a try after I read all the reviews. Well guess what? I got it and I looovvee it:)!!!! Even my boyfriend noticed the difference in my skin and that&#x27;s alot coming from a guy because you know they never know when we do anything haha!! Definitely give it a chance!</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel! Skin feels so much cleaner after use and looks refreshed!</li>
            <li> Love this mask! Got it super fast and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Leaves skin very smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Feels nice on face. Love the applicator it comes with too!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I purchased this for my sister and she hasn&#x27;t said anything about the results of the product.  It looked high grade quality though and I love that it comes with the brush.  I told her she has to invite me over to try it out.</li>
            <li> Loved it. My face tingled and I can tell a difference after the first application. Cant wait to see the results after a few more treatments.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! I bought as a special offer to test this product and let me tell you it feels like am at a spa. I will be buying again! Am very happy</li>
            <li> This facial mask is fantastic!  I have sensitive skin and had no problems with it.  It feels kind of tingly when you put it on.  It really cleans your pores and firms your face. The brush that came with it is very good. It spreads the mask easily with no mess and rinses fast.  I would highly recommend this product.  This is a keeper.</li>
            <li> This works as said and cleans up the face. Wouldn&#x27;t hestitate to buy again after mine is finished!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Product came rather quickly.  I received a followup email from the seller to verify that i received my shipment which I thought was very nice.  The package came with an application fan brush. The brush is durable &amp; it is smooth across your face.  The mid applies evenly &amp; dries add expected. I have an unbalanced skin type,  bouncing around from overly dry to oily @ times.  I have used it all over &amp; only on problem areas depending on my skin type @ the time.  I will highly recommend this product &amp; will be purchasing it again in the future.</li>
            <li> Live the way this feels when u put it on.</li>
            <li> First of all I love that this comes with the brush. It makes it a mess free application and is easy to smooth that thin layer on. It dries in about 5 minutes and feels like it is warming as well as tightening my skin. It doesn&#x27;t really smell which is nice and it definitely cleans and detoxifies pores. I can see a big difference each time I use it. It comes off super easy and I would totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Received it and used it right away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boar&#x27;s hair brush was able to smooth out the mud mask in a thin layer all over my face, preventing wasting extra product as you would to apply with your hand. Only used a bit of the mask to cover my entire face. Although the jar is kind of small, with the boar&#x27;s brush, I feel like this product will last a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask had a minty scent to it and had a cooling effect on my skin. Felt like I was in a spa!&lt;br /&gt;Dried fairly quickly and I was able to see the mask soaked up oil on my nose and forehand (the usual oily zones).&lt;br /&gt;After it fully dried and no more oil spots were appearing, I dabbed the mask with some water to moisten it for easy removal. Though it was still messy with the mud all over my sink, next time I&#x27;ll apply the mask before shower, should be less messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed my skin was brighter and my complexion a bit more even. My sister even complimented how clear and refreshed my face looked! No sensitivity issues or other problems.&lt;br /&gt;This is based on an one-time use, can&#x27;t wait to use again (2-3 times per week as per instruction) and see how my face will turn out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this product and will definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I used it twice a week, feel my face is super clean after washed it out. It&#x27;s my first time to use mud mask and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Received at discounted rate</li>
            <li> I love this mask. make my skin sooooooo soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for about two weeks, so I can&#x27;t say what the long term results will be. I can however, say that the immediate results are pretty good! My pores look smaller, my skin looks smoother and brighter. Admittedly, it does seem as though my face goes back to normal by the next morning. I&#x27;m curious to see if the results will hold up longer if I use this consistently for a while... I hope they do! Will probably update this review later.</li>
            <li> This is the only face and body mask I have gotten with a brush. It was nice addition to the mask to get a brush to help with application. This mask is a thin one so you can dip your brush in the mask. This brush helps you put on a thin layer of mask. There is a smell but a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s talk about how it applied to the skin. I could of went thicker with the brush, but I went for a thin layer. I wanted it to dry enough on me. I have used others in the past where if I laughed i would crack and hurt my face. This mask did not do that at all. I enjoyed the smell which it was doing it&#x27;s job on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when the 15 mins was over I went to wash this off. Now I would suggest to use a warm cloth not hot. You will feel your pores more opened after you take this off your face. So after I took it off. I looked at my face I saw smaller pores and some of my black heads were pulled out. Now a trick I do when I mask after you have used a warm cloth to remove the mask. I go back and rinse off the cloth. Then I turn on the cool water and that helps for me to calm my skin down. Sometimes if you do use a super hot heat it can defeat the purpose. It actually can damage your skin. So word of advice warm water always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now who could use this. I think men and women both can use this. I have as I have gotten older gotten my break outs in my skin. So I would now have to consider my skin mild breakouts and sometimes sensitive. I had no problems with this at all. Once it was off it stopped working. Take advantage of the sale and the companies guarantee.  I&#x27; have only had this product for a little while but so far these are the things I notice.  I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!</li>
            <li> feels great after using it</li>
            <li> Product arrived on expected date. Looking forward to product usage.</li>
            <li> It feels really good on the face and does not take much to coat the face.  The cooling effect of the mud drying is kind of cold in the winter, but will feel nice in the summer.  I also appreciate that it is not loaded down with perfumes.  I can&#x27;t speak yet to how well it works long-term the improvement in my skin, but I will revise the review if I see an improvement.</li>
            <li> My daughter is using this mask and loving it!  It helps so much with taking out blackheads without leaving the skin dry.  She uses it right before showering!  She loves it!  I purchased two more for myself and other daughters.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice, about a week in between each use. I have to say that I love it! The brush is so much fun and a great addition to the product!! I have sensitive skin and it did not irritate or bother it. My pores look great! Even though it is only 2 oz you really only use a small amount each time. It should last at least the next 6 months if I use it once a week. Great mask!</li>
            <li> Well first I have acne prone skin, large oily pores and hyperpigmentation. My skin is pretty bad lol Okay so the first time I used it I didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference in my skin. My pores didn&#x27;t shrink at all, my skin wasn&#x27;t glowy or anything :( I was beginning to think the product didn&#x27;t work for me. But then I tried it again for 3 days! I made sure that I cleansed my face before I used it again and low and behold 3 days later my pores have shrunk noticeably! My skin is sooooo glowy and my acne scars are disappearing! I&#x27;m glad that I bought this mask, it really does work! After years of using proactive and other products claiming to deliver results, I&#x27;m glad to have finally found a product that works!</li>
            <li> I have a new routine to my facial system now!  I LOVE how this mask feels when it is on and the smell is fresh and clean smelling!!  It is a joy to put on, leave on (I just read for a few minutes or do a little cleaning) and taking it off is simple....I just use warm water on a wash cloth and it comes off easily.  It makes my skin feel revived!  I highly recommend this to everyone!  Treat yourself and give this a try!</li>
            <li> I got a coupon so I decided to trt this mask. First let me say that I have VERY sensitive skin and many masks leave my face red. This product was amazing. Using the brush to apply it puts a smooth thin layer evenly on your face. I left it on for 15 minutes. You can see small dark spots where your problem pores are. This product cleans out pores, made my skin soft, and did not irritate it at all. I highly reccomend this mask! The jar is small but it goes a LONG way. I estimate I will get 30 or more applications! This is am item I will keep buying!</li>
            <li> This product is superb. It works!!! It definitely firms your face. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know much about this company but needed to try something to help my acne flare-ups.  This was a fantastic product at such an affordable price!  I have used other expensive masks but this one beats them all.  It felt like it sucked all the gunk from my pores and left my skin feeling fresh and smooth.  The applicator brush that came with it came so handy, I didn&#x27;t get the product all over my hands.  Can&#x27;t say enough about this.  Will definitely buy again and look into other products that they may have.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! I have very sensitive skin and when I applied this mask, it did not irritate! A little goes a long way and the glow after its washed off is gorgeous ! I am recommending this to everyone! The boar brush helps the mask spread evenly and smoothly. Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> I have ressasea, and it is working for me. Great product.</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference immediately after using it. I now use it 3 times a week as suggested. my skin feel softer and more smooth, love it !!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Leaves skin feeling soft and clean!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask. I was hesitant to spend so much, but after using a bunch of cheaper masks with zero results I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve used it 4 times in 10 days and my skin is already so much better! The white heads and clogged pores I&#x27;d given up on are clear and my skin is much less oily. I definitely will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. It seemed to reduce the size of my pores and made my skin extra smooth.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and worked well</li>
            <li> The face mask goes on very nice &amp; smooth with the included boars head brush.  That was a nice bonus. There was a slight tingling when applied &amp; it dried fairly quickly.  Unlike many masks I&#x27;ve used,  this one was not painful once it dried &amp; washing it off was really easy.  My skin felt very smooth afterwards.  Kept wanting to feel my fave.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This mask is great and the brush that comes with it makes it sooo easy to apply.  I also love the way my skin feels after!</li>
            <li> Good! Good! Very Good!</li>
            <li> This was awesome on my face and neck. I loved the applicator brush that comes with it. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it a lot so I hope to see more positive results after using it more. The fragrance was light and nice, barely noticeable. It washed off easily as well. Also, it looks like there are many, many applications in one jar. My guess would be 15-20.</li>
            <li> Not harsh on my skin at all!</li>
            <li> I received my mask much faster then anticipated and have used it a few times since. It goes on very smoothly and I can instantly feel a bit of tingling which to me feels like it is working. My skin feels much less dry then it had and I definitely have less blackheads. I will continue to use the Hello Cutie mask and cannot wait to see what other great results come from it! I love the boars hair brush too it is much more convenient and less wasteful then using my hands to apply.</li>
            <li> Hands down this is the best mask I have tried.  I used to spend a fortune on another brand and it didnt do anything like this one. My skin was so smooth and radiant after using it.  I could not believe I could get such results without a medical grade peel.  Best mud mask ever.</li>
            <li> Love it! Of all the masks I bought, this by far is the best one</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product. The brush it comes with allows you to use a thin layer as is suggested. It smells good, and it tingles when you use it. I love it. Yes I&#x27;ll be purchasing more. Very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> tried twice already, works so good, skin feels so tight after using. No wired smell either, that was something I worried about before purchase.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is a great mask.. the brush itself is amazing..&lt;br /&gt;the mud mask is a thin claylike mixture easy to apply amazing ingredients like pomegranate, chamomile, green tea, hyaluronic acid, aloe, peppermint, eucalyptus, activated charcoal, Vitamin B3, and DMAE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied a thin layer to my face and neck. While I was applying the mask and while I waited for it to dry, I felt a very pleasant cooling sensation. It felt very nice. After it began to dry, I started to feel a tightening of my skin. That feeling was also pleasant and not at all uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was also easy to rinse off with some warm water.. I followed up with my favorite moisturizer and my skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I really liked this mask! Very smooth. Easy application. Made skin feel great!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! The seller was awesome! Will purchase again! This left my skin feeling so fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mask!</li>
            <li> My skin felt great the day I did this but it felt really oily the next day. Idk if this is just south my skin or what tough.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a mud mask, and this product did not disappoint!  My skin felt tighter and glowing the moment I rinsed the mask off. The next morning, I was still seeing and feeling the effects of the mask. For new users, there are thorough instructions on the box.  Thanks for making a great product!</li>
            <li> I love this mask! I have terrible cystic acne and this has been a huge help in keeping that under control. I&#x27;m using this 3 times a week and leaving it on for longer than the instructions say. It&#x27;s working! Clearer skin&#x3D;HUGE WIN WIN!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask! The brush that comes with it makes it so easy to apply &amp; you don&#x27;t waste or make a mess like you would if applied with your fingers. The mask itself is tingly on the skin, I leave on for about  15 minutes each time &amp; I literally can see the oil this mask is drawing out of my pores &amp; the gunk from my blackheads. . My skin feels &amp; looks better.  My face is more hydrated &amp; smooth.  This one is a keeper!!</li>
            <li> Previously, these products were also found.&lt;br /&gt;The youth also the best.&lt;br /&gt;Applying also comfortable, including brushes have been a great help.</li>
            <li> The brush is cute. The mask is really works. My skin feel smooth and soft. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> works well with my skin made my large pores smaller happy with this product .</li>
            <li> super,My wife really like,I bought it through a discount</li>
            <li> When I first received this product I was so excited to try it. I love masks, they always make my skin feel refreshed after however I did not feel this way after using the hello cutie mud mask. The instructions say to apply a thin layer which I did, then leave on for 5 to 15 minutes. After 10 minutes, I tried peeling it off but the directions were to take off in a circular motion, I could not do either of the two, it was literally stuck to my skin and I had to wash it off with soap water and a washcloth. It still didn&#x27;t feel like it was all off so I had to wash it again. I did not like it at all and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> The mask is wonderful, it tightens the poors , I had acne as a teenager and my scars are always open so when I used the mask it actually pulled my skin tighter to give the appearence of smaller poors.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! My skin is glowing after use!!!! You can see a difference first use</li>
            <li> Have only used it once but I felt the difference right away. Will keep using as directed and hope to see some changes to this old face.</li>
            <li> I think it works great!</li>
            <li> Skin feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> I ordered this hello cutie mud mask and have been using it for about a week. So far I am impressed with how it makes my skin feel. I feel like it is so tight and fresh. I also have noticed that my pores have decreased in size, so I can say I am satisfied. I would like to see the little bit of hormonal acne that have on my chin go away, so I will give it some time. Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I got this product to review. The product smells like mint. It feels really nice on your face. It really firms your face and I couldn’t talk when I used it. I used it on my cousin and myself and we both liked it and was happy to review it. The jar is a good size to use for than just a couple times. I like that it has Pomegranate and green tea. https://amberbambpuckett.wordpress.com/2015/08/11/hello-cutie-mud-mask/I though it would be great to review since I have never used a face mask before. I would buy this product. The product is not runny like some other mask that I have seen in the past. I like the product and I wouldn’t change anything about it. I liked the the mask and so did my cousin.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it! It leaves her face smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li> I love this mask, it went on smooth..after about a minute, I could feel the mask drying up.  After cleansing my face, my face felt super soft.  I will continue to use this mask about 3 times a week as it seems to be helping to make my skin smoother!</li>
            <li> As a mask junkie, I have tried many kinds with varied results so there are certain things I look for when purchasing one. A deal helps, and this one offered a great one with free shipping- combined with the free brush applicator I had to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but my whole mindset changed when I began to apply this. It was as if soft music began playing and I was transported to a luxury salon. It feels absolutely amazing going on, and the brush is the perfect applicator to smooth it while avoiding delicate areas like the eyes and lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great feel while on, and has a nice cooling effect to shrink pores. I love that it has  such great ingredients like charcoal, which is lovely for the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be on the lookout for more products from this brand!</li>
            <li> Ok to use, but see no different after use.</li>
            <li> very effective, clean</li>
            <li> I love this mask..i love the way it made my skin feel I&#x27;ve used it twice so far.. thank you</li>
            <li> great quality! good price!!</li>
            <li> Just received it an only used it once; very impressed so far.  Like the consistency; thin but not drippy.  Looks like the jar will last a long time.  Good thing &#x27;cause it aint cheap.  Love the brush.  It&#x27;s shaped so that it efficiently spreads a thin  coat of mask, rinses clean easily, and I don&#x27;t have to get my hands dirty.  Mask has very subtle non-objectionable odor.  Kinda refreshing.  Briefly feels tingly after application.  Then it hardens but not to an uncomfortable point.  Washes off easily.  I used my favorite moisturizer after as instructed.  Skin feels so soft when I&#x27;m done, far less dry and flaky.  Even the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the detailed instructions the company provides via email after purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice if the product could be ordered without the brush for a few bucks less.  Since I now have the brush already and it&#x27;ll likely last as long as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used a lot of masks to compare with this one.  I&#x27;m a relative newbie to masks, but I&#x27;m a fan of this one!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this mask! it didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin. It did leave my face feeling tight and yes, a bit dry (nothing my moisturizer couldn&#x27;t fix though!)&lt;br /&gt;My skin did feel clean after using this - deep clean. Because my skin is sensitive Im only using this once a week, so I can&#x27;t say if it helps with fine lines / wrinkles, but it is very nice and I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again.&lt;br /&gt;It is mud, and while the jar isn&#x27;t huge you only need a thin layer to cover your face so I imagine it&#x27;ll last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;I used the handle fan brush that was included and applied a thin layer onto my clean face. After 5 minutes it was dry and I was able to remove it easily with warm water and a wash cloth. I really liked that it felt cool and refreshing while it was wet.</li>
            <li> I really love how this mask is working, my skin is so soft and clean, you can feel it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!! I appreciated the brush for applying this. It went on cool and I could feel it tightening. The best part you can actually see it go deep in your pores. Definitely a good product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many masks, as I have VERY sensitive skin and have broken out with face rashes after using them. It&#x27;s been at least a decade since I&#x27;ve tried one. I have been on a mission to treat my skin better, now that my age is getting up there (36 :P) and so I wanted to find something to help with tightening as well as hormonal acne. I always wanted something that may help with reducing fine lines. This natural facial mask is amazing. Not only does it not irritate my skin, it makes it look so much better! My skin is tightened, pores are smaller and acne gets dried out. I use this about once a week, sometimes twice. I love it and will continue to use it :)</li>
            <li> As soon as I got my package I put it on. It works well, it even comes with the brush. The only problem is the size! I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $27 if it was so tiny compare to the mud mask I brought last year. I expected them to be the same size but I was wrong. The other one works really well, it lasted me for a whole year! And I used it everyday. It only cost me $20. I just hope this product comes in bigger size. I&#x27;m not buying it again if it&#x27;s the same small size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed, this stuff actually works! The brush it comes with is really cool and allows for easy application of the mask. It definitely removed 100% of my blackheads, for the first time ever! I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:dd1ba83c6932e371c658b520cad1cde4]] I love this mask so hard! I demonstrate it&#x27;s use in the video review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for review purposes, but as you can see in the video, I truly do love it!</li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels afterwards</li>
            <li> With just one use, my face feels smooth and feels wonderful! It has a great minty smell which I find relaxing, and it feels refreshing going on. Super easy application.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried a lot of masks and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It burned at first, but once it started drying it felt great. It wiped off easily and left my face glowing and feeling great!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite product so far. I love that it comes with a brush. It goes on your face so smooth and leaves it feeling amazing as if you had just come out from a professional place for a facial. Easy to put on and rince off.</li>
            <li> The brighter the vitamin mask face I &#x27;m have an effect I am grateful popular</li>
            <li> The mask looks greenish- grey and gives an instant cooling effect (because of the included peppermint and eucalyptus). The mask feels very smooth- like a thin lotion and is very easy to apply. At first you will look quite dark but the mask will later dry to a rather light green color. So while the mask dries on your skin, the magic is happening. The mask detects all those impurities and black heads in your skin! You can see them peeking out as darker color. The mask then tries to get the talc out of your pores. MAGIC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see the effect clearly on my nose! I certainly did not look cute while having the mask on- but hey: after washing the mask: HELLO CUTIE SKIN! ;-)This is a great clarifying mask and I recommend this highly if you need to get rid of impurities on your skin! (FYI: I got this for free for testing purposes. Nevertheless: this is only my own experience and opinion!)</li>
            <li> Love this product.  The brush makes the mud application so easy and no messy.  After a few application, I feel my skin is much softer and cleaner.  Immediately after the mask cleansed, I&#x27;ll apply vitamin c serum to my face.  With use of both mud mask and serum, I see the shine and glamor on my face.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is amazing! It made my skin feel soft after the first use. I have to admit, I was at first a little skeptical, but decided to give it a try. And I was not disappointed. It even came with a little facial brush for application. Another cool thing about this mask is that you can also use it for spot treatment (I used it when I felt a potential breakout).</li>
            <li> I know there is nothing better than a day at the spa! Honestly though, who can afford it these days? On top of how pricey it can be who has the time? Between running the kids to their activities, cooking, cleaning, and if you have a job too, FORGET IT! Being able to take a few minutes out of my day just for me rarely happens. So being able to use Hello Cutie’s Mud Mask makes me feel like I am having a short visit to the spa for the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went into the bathroom, turned the shower on hot, no I had no plans at that point of getting a shower, but I wanted it to feel like I was sitting in a steam room! I covered my face with the amazing cool mud and allowed myself to be swept away to a luxurious spa. There were very tan muscular men serving me drinks as I lounged on a comfy chase. Smells of pomegranate swept through the air as I sipped my wine. It was really a great experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BANG! BANG! BANG!!! “MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that didn’t last long, I opened my eyes to realize that I was sitting on my toilet (don’t worry, it was closed), imagining that I was somewhere else, but my daughter took care of that for me! It’s okay though, when all was said and done, and I washed the mask off, my face felt amazing. My skin was softer than ever and I felt refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Complimentary product was received to facilitate this review. Regardless, all opinions expressed are still 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Loving this mask, I use it right before my period and it quells my usual breakouts better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in masks and have tried many over the years.  I have to say, this is one of my favorites.  First of all, it comes with a brush which makes application extremely easy.  Second, even though it is a mud mask, the added ingredients do not make it smell like mud.  I have used other masks in the past that I could not keep on for the full time because of the odor.  That will not happen with the Hello Cutie Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first put the mask on, it tingles, but nothing painful, it&#x27;s refreshing.  As the mask dries, you can feel the tightening of your skin.  It turns to a lighter shade of gray as it dries except for the areas that have blackheads and large pores, the nose area on my daughter and me, it stays a darker gray.  You can leave the mask on for 5-15 minutes, My 13 year old daughter and I did the full 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove, You simply run water over your face and it comes right off.  I did mine in the shower, my daughter did hers over the sink.  The mask removed easily with no scrubbing and the results were amazing.  My daughter&#x27;s nose was covered in those little black dots, not sure if they were blackheads or just dirt in her pores, but they were completely gone after using this mask.  The directions say this can be used 2-3 times per week and will definitely be a new part of our skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:38d6b01a693c321600b65b90400ef2c9]]This product is great! It is actually the first face mask I have ever used. I noticed results right after the very first use- my skin immediately seemed more even and soft. The feel of this on my skin is so comforting. It does not have the best looking color, but I could not expect a mud mask to be a pretty or neon color and still think that it was healthy and good for my skin. I love that my older teen can use this and get great results. I would not use on my younger children, but I do not think it would harm them that is just my personal choice. I would recommend it.to anyone! So to get you some ! also i did notice it help me with my Acne and my son&#x27;s blackheads will buy this product aging</li>
            <li> After I turned 30 I really started to take better care of my skin and I love this mask!</li>
