            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>Great for kids and adults.</li>
            <li>This stuff tastes like mint chocolate, in a really great way.</li>
            <li>It tasted great</li>
            <li>It was great.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>and I can say that is not something I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li>But as for teeth cleaning it works great.</li>
            <li>I would have been so happy with this toothpaste except after use, my tongue feels like it was burned;  </li>
            <li>This was a great idea</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is amazing!</li>
            <li>The most delicious toothpaste!!!</li>
            <li>lime one, however, is MUCH more delicious.</li>
            <li>If you have a gag reflex issue with Mint, this is a great alternative and an awesome Chocolate taste with just a hint of light mint.</li>
            <li>The taste is great, the kids, my husband and I love the flavor!  </li>
            <li>I loved the Vanilla Mint flavor, so I bought this.</li>
            <li>So, not as good as the Vanilla Mint, but I&#x27;ll probably keep a tube around until it&#x27;s discontinued, which hopefully isn&#x27;t too soon.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>It is SO good.  </li>
            <li>It had to be good, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>vanilla is good too, I think it&#x27;s a repackaging of the vanilla mint I used to buy years ago.  </li>
            <li>It was good to try</li>
            <li>It might be a good way to encourage kids to brush their teeth or for somebody who is dieting.</li>
            <li>This dissipation is actually good, because we found the chocolate taste unnerving.</li>
            <li>They loved it</li>
            <li>It does taste of minty chocolate, and it does do a good job cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li>I really loved the flavor of this toothpaste and wish it didn&#x27;t make my mouth hurt.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>chocolate-y, minty, all around good flavor.</li>
            <li>The chocolate flavor is a nice addition, too, for those of use who think chocolate should be in its own stand alone food group!)</li>
            <li>There was nothing on it that said mild, but I hoped for the best that the chocolate part might mellow out the mint.  </li>
            <li>This flavor was enjoyable!</li>
            <li>I love chocolate and this toothpaste is chocolate flavored!</li>
            <li>Would also love to see these flavors in the restoration toothpastes too!  </li>
            <li>My FAVORITE toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>When I decided to use this toothpaste I was very excited I thought brush my teeth with chocolate!</li>
            <li>Nice feeling after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>Actually a nice change of pace from the \\&quot;frozen ice mint wintermint arctic blast\\&quot; everyflavors that seem to dominate now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one tastes kind of like chocolate mint ice cream.</li>
            <li>As toothpastes go, it&#x27;s a nice change.</li>
            <li>Nice, kinda like licking the ice cream off a spoon.</li>
            <li>Saw these advertised and thought I&#x27;d give them a go as they looked nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so yummy that I&#x27;m planning on stocking up on it just in case they stop making it (as seems to happen with most good</li>
            <li>Honestly, its not.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t make you wonder what kind of cancer you&#x27;re putting in your mouth.</li>
            <li>this is my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A nice change of flavor to freshen my breath in mid-afternoon or before bed.</li>
            <li>This may be good for kids, but be warned they may be more inclined to eat the paste because of the taste.</li>
            <li>The absolute best.</li>
            <li>I imagine it&#x27;s as effective in cleaning your teeth,  </li>
            <li>I liked the taste</li>
            <li>It does taste great, and my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>Very good and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Honestly, I find myself brushing more often.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect toothpaste flavor to transition from toddler toothpaste to adult toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Out of all three Crest Be toothpastes, this was probably the one I liked the most.</li>
            <li>Too good to be true, I thought.</li>
            <li>I love the vanilla mint toothpaste from this line and decided to try this chocolate mint flavor, but like some others, I had a reaction to the product.</li>
            <li>but I have a severe contact allergy to most metals, and a sensitivity to latex and wool.</li>
            <li>Interesting flavor, still more mint than chocolate, and the chocolate taste doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I had some room left on an Amazon gift card and figured I&#x27;d use it up with more of this wonderful stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this flavor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it lathers and it doesn&#x27;t burn, either.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see it in the grocery stores anymore, but I&#x27;m glad to see that Amazon still carries it.</li>
            <li>the flavor sure delivers.  </li>
            <li>It is my husband&#x27;s favorite toothpaste - it is his morning treat</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t taste too minty</li>
            <li>There is nothing more to say.  </li>
            <li>This truly is like mint chocolate chip ice cream in the best possible (and refreshing) way.  </li>
            <li>take a chance on an interesting flavor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all of the Crest Be Adventurous toothpastes, and while I still love my Marvis toothpaste flavors, these are a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>bought 5 more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a gag gift than a toothpaste</li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I love mint chocolate chip ice-cream and this toothpaste tastes just like the ice-cream.</li>
            <li>I had to come on to review this item, because although I LOVE the flavor, it is almost as if I had an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li>One of the only reasons I love it is because of nostalgia, but I also think it would be perfect for kids because 1.:That bubblegum fruit s</li>
            <li>: I know too many kids will be thinking yay chocolate and be encouraged to brush more often because they like chocolate candy.</li>
            <li>it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me that they are on the verge if discontinuing it. :)</li>
            <li>I have any burning I&#x27;ll be sure to update the review.</li>
            <li>It really has a nice bright taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be Adventurous Mint Chocolate Trek Flavor Toothpaste 4.5</li>
            <li>Per ounce, the Be Dynamic/Adventurous cost more than the Cinnamon Expressions (and</li>
            <li>Thought it would be interesting</li>
            <li>Give that one a try if you haven&#x27;t -- it&#x27;s like having mojitos before bed and then again for breakfast, except not sad :p</li>
            <li>Then I bought more when that tube was gone.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>If there was no burning I would love it</li>
            <li>it was more minty than chocolate.</li>
            <li>So I love chocolate mint ice cream,but this toothpaste is not for me.</li>
            <li>Life couldn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li>The kids love this flavor :)  </li>
            <li>My daughters favorite.</li>
            <li>creamy and very sweet, Mint Chocolate Trek (aptly names Be Adventurous) had a strong chocolate bean flavor, like powered chocolate, hits you just as you start to brush with the mint.</li>
            <li>So I was very excited to see this one.</li>
            <li>but I think it needs more work if it wants to be successful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased I did because they are super nice.</li>
            <li>Vanilla Mint was good, I got the impression of icing when I first smelled it.</li>
            <li>I think these new flavors are a great way to entice children to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li>Mostly this toothpaste seemed to be just a strong spearmint flavor.</li>
            <li>The problem is that when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth - and maybe this is just me - I expect to feel clean not like I just ate very strong tapioca pudding.</li>
            <li>The chocolate keeps the mint from being overpowering, though it still leaves your mouth feeling clean!</li>
            <li>My daughter is a huge chocolate mint fan :)  If your kids don&#x27;t like mint (my son)</li>
            <li>If you like the flavor to begin with it starts out fantastic, but I have noticed that it becomes more &#x27;astringent&#x27; as you continue to brush.  </li>
            <li>its really damn good.</li>
            <li>Also, would love to see more flavors, as I really can&#x27;t stand the mint that is used in most toothpastes and it is so nice to be able to have fun flavors for adults and teens.  </li>
            <li>is a unique flavor for toothpaste , I got a bit more chocolate upfront with&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need to put more on to get that clean feeling to my teeth.</li>
            <li>the flavour is not to strong</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lime flavoring might give a bit of a boost to the mint taste, but we didn&#x27;t find the citrus taste to be strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit of a weirdo, since I don&#x27;t like mint, cinnamon, or bubble gum flavors (which pretty much makes up about 99% of the toothpaste on the market lol).</li>
            <li>If the mint was a bit more mild, I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
            <li>Super bummed!</li>
            <li>chocolate aroma is more pronounced than the mint, so mint lovers might not feel that familiar tingly clean</li>
            <li>which is a rather huge accomplishment.</li>
            <li>but I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>it tastes like a light chocolate mint.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll be at work, and I&#x27;ll just be in the mood, and pull out my toothpaste and toothbrush and enjoy the explosion of flavor in my mouth; just to brighten up my day.</li>
            <li>They said it was amazing how much it really tasted like chocolate then</li>
            <li>I was actually really impressed with how &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; the chocolate flavor tasted and just had to double check the box to see that they didn&#x27;t put real chocolate in there</li>
            <li>feeling.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very nice to see a big company with a familiar brand like Crest</li>
            <li>This my new favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I bought the vanilla mint flavor first and really enjoyed it</li>
            <li>Other than that, good product!  </li>
            <li>I get excited to brush my teeth now</li>
            <li>Strange though it may seem, this is a great tasting toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so nice to veer off the path of the normal peppermint flavored</li>
            <li>I had originally bought Vanilla Mint Spark, and so I&#x27;m gonna go ahead and review that one and the Lime Spearmint one too in my \\&quot;adventurous\\&quot; review.    </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I&#x27;ve ever actually enjoyed the taste of a toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My original impression was mint frosted brownies.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I thought it was unique.  </li>
            <li>but nothing worth having comes easy.</li>
            <li>I like this toothpaste leaves my teeth feeling clean also</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend for those who want a squeaky clean mint arctic frozen mouth.</li>
            <li>I just want a clean mouth, and this does the trick for me.</li>
            <li>To clean teeth and leave your mouth refreshed over time.  </li>
            <li>I know what I want in a toothpaste.. a clean mouth that lasts till morning..</li>
            <li>The fact that it also tastes like candy tells my brain that my teeth that they aren&#x27;t clean (minty toothpaste makes me feel clean, these do not).</li>
            <li>Mkaes mouth feel clean without being overpowering</li>
            <li>It left a pleasant aftertaste of</li>
            <li>So far it is working, it tastes good and leaves a sweet, fresh taste in my mouth</li>
            <li>Normally I just brush with Arm N Hammer for the strong baking soda effect as I&#x27;m not a fan of most toothpaste&#x27;s minty flavors.</li>
            <li>I probably would&#x27;ve been more excited about brushing, because the mint really made my mouth burn</li>
            <li>I used to slip a slice of chocolate cake in my mouth before going to sleep to ensure that I had sweet dreams.</li>
            <li>This would probably be good for a mid afternoon pick me up..or maybe it&#x27;ll help you cut the chocolate cravings if you&#x27;re dieting or something...4 stars.</li>
            <li>but if you do not like sweet things or mint chocolate, this is probably not the toothpaste for you as it truly does taste like mint chocolate chip ice-cream.</li>
            <li>Smells like sweet vanilla, tastes like a dinner mint.</li>
            <li>Leaves a wonderfully minty flavor in my mouth as opposed to some of the icky toothpaste flavors.  </li>
            <li>It sounds like a dream come true and it is -  until it literally feels like your tongue is on fire afterwards.</li>
            <li>Well, the taste is really nice and reminds me kind of mint chocolate ice cream - just less overpowering.</li>
            <li>I also tried the Vanilla Mint and that&#x27;s much better but not as good as the original Vanilla Mint that Crest discontinued a few years ago.</li>
            <li>The chocolate is kind of a nice little treat at night before bed.</li>
            <li>It is a fun flavor and it does get the teeth and breath clean.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super yummy and tastes like an andes mint.</li>
            <li>And who doesn&#x27;t love the soft chocolatey mint flavor of Andes Mints, the closest thing I can think of for sharing the flavor with you!?!</li>
            <li>, we just tried two new Crest flavors, this Be Adventurous Mint Chocolate&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the taste, and definitely minty sweet, like a dinner mint.</li>
            <li>Love it, especially before bed when you don&#x27;t want the strong flavor you might be looking for in the morning.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I took a chance, not really expecting it to taste that good</li>
            <li>I imagine if you have kids who neglect to brush, this would be a powerful motivating tool.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY toothpaste my 5 yr old will use happily.</li>
            <li>It cleans well and leaves the mouth feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li>I save the Chocolate Mint for my last brushing of the day--like being in a nice hotel that has a &amp;#34;turn-down service&amp;#34; and leaves a chocolate mint on your pillow.  </li>
            <li>have used Crest for years and even had success with Vanilla Mint.</li>
            <li>just didn&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling fresh..  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite flavor.  </li>
            <li>Minty fresh.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is a nice departure from the traditional minty flavored pastes.</li>
            <li>The tooth paste is kind of gritty</li>
            <li>While I did feel like my teeth were nice and cleaned, in the back of my mind I did wonder if I really did just clean my teeth or eat a bowl of ice-cream or had some mint chocolate candy of some sort.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It def left a clean, refreshing feeling after brushing without sending me into mint-induced convulsions.</li>
            <li>It tastes really good but honestly is a little too sweet for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the other reviewers have not had good mint chocolate in a while or what, but they should partner with Bear Grylls and call it Bear Grylls:</li>
            <li>I thought if I could find a chocolate toothpaste and brush my teeth right after eating, maybe I wouldn&#x27;t get the cravings.</li>
            <li>Right after brushing, I get this needles pain all over my tongue, like it is swelling up.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of zing to it and it doesn&#x27;t taste like you are brushing your teeth with food.</li>
            <li>guess it was worth the couple bucks I paid to have my first allergic experience.</li>
            <li>knocks are this was hard to find (resorting to Amazon for toothpaste - I am sure they are thrilled</li>
            <li>I dislike the taste of traditional mint, so I was happy to find a toothpaste that had a different flavor.</li>
            <li>someone that really enjoys interesting and unexpected flavor</li>
            <li>I think having intriguing flavors such as this one will inspire some&lt;br /&gt;people to brush more often.</li>
            <li>It tastes pretty good, just not worth it.</li>
            <li>Fine by me, just didn&#x27;t like the overly soft mushy foam coming from my faux rabied mouth.    </li>
            <li>so I was pretty excited to try all these new Crest Be toothpaste flavors.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t use the paste more than 3 or 4 times before realizing this was going to be a regular thing and not just a &amp;</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is actually pretty tasty, however my mouth doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling after I&#x27;m done brushing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Someone willing to pay that price for the rest of my life</li>
            <li>I bought a tube of this from a local store, because I love mint chocolate chip ice cream.</li>
            <li>I would like to preface this with the fact that I love mint, chocolate, Blue Bell mint chocolate chip ice cream, you name it, if it is mint and chocolate, I am there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have wondered for years why there was no chocolate mint toothpaste, glad someone finally made</li>
            <li>and, though the flavor of it was ok, I was left underwhelmed at having used it.  </li>
            <li>First you have to consider the product you&#x27;re using and its purpose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really missed the Vanilla Expressions toothpaste and this makes up for it!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li>all three of them cost more than standard mint gels).</li>
            <li>I bought this for my ten and eight year olds today to encourage them to brush more.  </li>
            <li>It has a really funny aftertaste.</li>
            <li>I might not like the flavors I listed above, but I sure do like chocolate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t satisfied with regular, plain-old mint toothpaste, this product is for you.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what advice I&#x27;d offer someone interested in buying this product.</li>
            <li>So I just tried this toothpaste out, and it was pretty tasty-</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste so much like mint chocolate chip ice cream to me- more like one of those little after dinner mints that is more of a real fresh peppermint flavor mixed with a bit of chocolate.</li>
            <li>In our family of four, two like plain old mint gel toothpaste, but two of us LOVE more unusual flavors, with the current favorite being Crest Cinnamon Expressions.</li>
            <li>this is like those overly sweet chocolate lipsmackers I got as a 7 year old for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Another angle to consider, my older kids have just graduated to regular toothpaste, and this keeps them brushing, and brushing well. :)</li>
            <li>In my search for a mild mint adult toothpaste (since the one that worked so well for me was discontinued) I found this.  </li>
            <li>However that excitement has left and now all I feel is a strong burning sensation in my mouth and a swollen tongue.</li>
            <li>Chocolate toothpaste may sound a little gross, but it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Now I have a full tube of back up toothpaste in my cabinet that will not be used until the zombi apocalypse strikes and no other toothpaste is available.</li>
            <li>, I tried the other two flavors and to me they left an aftertaste that wasn&#x27;t pleasant..</li>
            <li>The chocolate tastes like real chocolate</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s got flouride which means it&#x27;s really toothpaste and not some candy in the form of a tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I am really picky about my toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>and it burns my mouth too much.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a real tease when you&#x27;re dieting.</li>
            <li>It feels like the Crest chemists were developing the taste, getting really close, but time/funding/patience ran out and they had to ship.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a hint of chocolate and a touch of mint... but not so much that my eyes water and my nose runs.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really like it at all.  </li>
            <li>Very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really, really hope they never discontinue this product.</li>
            <li>I really like the taste of the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I alternate between this and Colgate Total when I brush, nice change of pace.    </li>
            <li>First time I used it, it tingled a little (ok, burned)</li>
            <li>The chocolate taste is similar to a Tootsie Roll...not quite like &#x27;real&#x27; chocolate, but not unpleasant either.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Our new fave!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only mildly chocolatey</li>
            <li>Got my first tube in Walmart, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in my place ( a small college town:).</li>
            <li>main ingredient is sorbitol.</li>
            <li>Wow!!  </li>
            <li>#34;there&#x27;s no way this is going to leave my mouth feeling clean when I&#x27;m done&amp;#34; but I was pleasantly surprised that I was left with only the fresh minty aftertaste and none of the chocolate taste</li>
            <li>I try to use mostly natural and organic ingredients, this is pretty far from that</li>
            <li>This definitely tastes exactly like what it says and it tastes really well.</li>
            <li>Actually, it is probably a burst of smell, not taste, because as you start your brushing, the chocolate taste dissipates very quickly, leaving you with generic mint taste.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really taste of anything - if you closed your eyes you would think it was mild mint flavor.  </li>
            <li>About 10 minutes later I got a rash on my jaw under my right ear.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this toothpaste and a couple other BE flavors.  </li>
            <li>this is new</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new Chocolate mint toothpaste since the one I used by Fructodent was discontinued.</li>
            <li>the interest of exploring new things</li>
            <li>Honestly these names are ridiculous, but its just whatever.</li>
            <li>I mean who wants to brush their teeth with chocolate, but then my love for all things chocolate mint won out</li>
            <li>This was a little more expensive with mostly good reviews with one reviewer even feeling like a kid again, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li>Only you don&#x27;t get to have the bowl first.</li>
            <li>It sounded too interesting to pass up, so I bought my usual Sensitivity and the Chocolate Mint.  </li>
            <li>*** is actually pretty gross after a while and 2.</li>
            <li>My 4.5 year old loves it!</li>
            <li>Would love to try vanilla mint but not sure about lime spearmint.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is exactly like mint chocolate chip ice cream, and the first time I used it I actually swallowed it because it tasted so similar.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth as well as other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a strong mint, but not as bad as regular mint toothpaste and the flavor is really good.  </li>
            <li>So far I have only tried this one and it went straight into the trash after I tried it.  </li>
            <li>next time I go, I&#x27;m stocking up because I don&#x27;t often find toothpaste I like this much.  </li>
            <li>--I was really pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I have a knack of wondering what stuff smells like anyways, so sticking my nose near the tube is just sort of habit to me.</li>
            <li>Now, my baby is 5 months old and mint has lost its grotesqueness, but I still prefer this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It causes pain where it touches the soft tissues in my mouth.</li>
            <li>B001G7PLM8 Crest Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening Expressions</li>
            <li>This product has changed my life completely.</li>
            <li>The chocolate-mint combination is subtle and adult, with the chocolate more pronounced.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive mouth and adult mint toothpastes (as 99% of toothpaste is, or cinnamon which has the same effect) burn my mouth.  </li>
            <li>even more interesingly that my fiancee does not, but it ruins what is otherwise a very pleasant experience and change in pace in the boring toothpaste world .</li>
            <li>one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes pretty much as I expected, an even mix of coco and mint flavor.  </li>
            <li>I could even live with the gritty feeling if it wasn&#x27;t for the burning and sore feeling in my mouth after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m open to trying new stuff</li>
            <li>A hit of major nostalgia.</li>
            <li>A little more expensive than other Crest varieties, it is a nice change of pace.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like the apparent pain it caused me.</li>
            <li>The Lime Spearmint seems so average that it isn&#x27;t worth the extra expense for</li>
            <li>the novelty of the flavor was there, but it didn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling fresh for very long, as long as regular toothpaste does..</li>
            <li>The only other negative thing about this is it does not leave that clean, super minty taste that a standard toothpaste does.</li>
            <li>Hope this is not a limited time run.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time it was a little like brushing with minty frosting</li>
            <li>However, the paste has somewhat a gritty feel to it that I would describe kind of as the same feeling you get when you put a small amount of baking soda mixed with some plain ole&#x27; toothpaste.</li>
            <li>And like any other decent human being, I get bored pretty quickly with the routine.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this toothpaste, but unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t possible unless I had developed some self-harming tendencies :/</li>
            <li>But I saw these new flavors by Crest the other night at the store.</li>
            <li>But considering I had used the \\&quot;Hello\\&quot; brand not long before and thought the mint was waaay overpowering and the product way too expensive(5 dollars for less than a normal amount of toothpaste?</li>

            <li> It was great.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> and I can say that is not something I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li> But as for teeth cleaning it works great.</li>

            <li> This toothpaste is amazing!</li>
            <li> The most delicious toothpaste!!!</li>
            <li> lime one, however, is MUCH more delicious.</li>
            <li> If you have a gag reflex issue with Mint, this is a great alternative and an awesome Chocolate taste with just a hint of light mint.</li>
            <li> The taste is great, the kids, my husband and I love the flavor!  </li>
            <li> I loved the Vanilla Mint flavor, so I bought this.</li>
            <li> So, not as good as the Vanilla Mint, but I&#x27;ll probably keep a tube around until it&#x27;s discontinued, which hopefully isn&#x27;t too soon.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> It is SO good.  </li>
            <li> It had to be good, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> vanilla is good too, I think it&#x27;s a repackaging of the vanilla mint I used to buy years ago.  </li>
            <li> It was good to try</li>
            <li> It might be a good way to encourage kids to brush their teeth or for somebody who is dieting.</li>
            <li> This dissipation is actually good, because we found the chocolate taste unnerving.</li>
            <li> They loved it</li>
            <li> It does taste of minty chocolate, and it does do a good job cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li> I really loved the flavor of this toothpaste and wish it didn&#x27;t make my mouth hurt.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> chocolate-y, minty, all around good flavor.</li>
            <li> The chocolate flavor is a nice addition, too, for those of use who think chocolate should be in its own stand alone food group!)</li>
            <li> There was nothing on it that said mild, but I hoped for the best that the chocolate part might mellow out the mint.  </li>
            <li> This flavor was enjoyable!</li>
            <li> I love chocolate and this toothpaste is chocolate flavored!</li>
            <li> Would also love to see these flavors in the restoration toothpastes too!  </li>
            <li> My FAVORITE toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> When I decided to use this toothpaste I was very excited I thought brush my teeth with chocolate!</li>
            <li> Nice feeling after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> Actually a nice change of pace from the \\&quot;frozen ice mint wintermint arctic blast\\&quot; everyflavors that seem to dominate now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one tastes kind of like chocolate mint ice cream.</li>
            <li> As toothpastes go, it&#x27;s a nice change.</li>
            <li> Nice, kinda like licking the ice cream off a spoon.</li>
            <li> Saw these advertised and thought I&#x27;d give them a go as they looked nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so yummy that I&#x27;m planning on stocking up on it just in case they stop making it (as seems to happen with most good</li>
            <li> Honestly, its not.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t make you wonder what kind of cancer you&#x27;re putting in your mouth.</li>
            <li> this is my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A nice change of flavor to freshen my breath in mid-afternoon or before bed.</li>
            <li> This may be good for kids, but be warned they may be more inclined to eat the paste because of the taste.</li>
            <li> The absolute best.</li>
            <li> I imagine it&#x27;s as effective in cleaning your teeth,  </li>
            <li> I liked the taste</li>
            <li> It does taste great, and my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Very good and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Honestly, I find myself brushing more often.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect toothpaste flavor to transition from toddler toothpaste to adult toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Out of all three Crest Be toothpastes, this was probably the one I liked the most.</li>
            <li> Too good to be true, I thought.</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla mint toothpaste from this line and decided to try this chocolate mint flavor, but like some others, I had a reaction to the product.</li>
            <li> but I have a severe contact allergy to most metals, and a sensitivity to latex and wool.</li>
            <li> Interesting flavor, still more mint than chocolate, and the chocolate taste doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I had some room left on an Amazon gift card and figured I&#x27;d use it up with more of this wonderful stuff!  </li>
            <li> I love this flavor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it lathers and it doesn&#x27;t burn, either.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it in the grocery stores anymore, but I&#x27;m glad to see that Amazon still carries it.</li>
            <li> the flavor sure delivers.  </li>
            <li> It is my husband&#x27;s favorite toothpaste - it is his morning treat</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t taste too minty</li>
            <li> There is nothing more to say.  </li>
            <li> This truly is like mint chocolate chip ice cream in the best possible (and refreshing) way.  </li>
            <li> take a chance on an interesting flavor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all of the Crest Be Adventurous toothpastes, and while I still love my Marvis toothpaste flavors, these are a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> bought 5 more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a gag gift than a toothpaste</li>
            <li> Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love mint chocolate chip ice-cream and this toothpaste tastes just like the ice-cream.</li>
            <li> I had to come on to review this item, because although I LOVE the flavor, it is almost as if I had an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> One of the only reasons I love it is because of nostalgia, but I also think it would be perfect for kids because 1.:That bubblegum fruit s</li>
            <li> : I know too many kids will be thinking yay chocolate and be encouraged to brush more often because they like chocolate candy.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me that they are on the verge if discontinuing it. :)</li>
            <li> I have any burning I&#x27;ll be sure to update the review.</li>
            <li> It really has a nice bright taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be Adventurous Mint Chocolate Trek Flavor Toothpaste 4.5</li>
            <li> Per ounce, the Be Dynamic/Adventurous cost more than the Cinnamon Expressions (and</li>
            <li> Thought it would be interesting</li>
            <li> Give that one a try if you haven&#x27;t -- it&#x27;s like having mojitos before bed and then again for breakfast, except not sad :p</li>
            <li> Then I bought more when that tube was gone.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> If there was no burning I would love it</li>
            <li> it was more minty than chocolate.</li>
            <li> So I love chocolate mint ice cream,but this toothpaste is not for me.</li>
            <li> Life couldn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li> The kids love this flavor :)  </li>
            <li> My daughters favorite.</li>
            <li> creamy and very sweet, Mint Chocolate Trek (aptly names Be Adventurous) had a strong chocolate bean flavor, like powered chocolate, hits you just as you start to brush with the mint.</li>
            <li> So I was very excited to see this one.</li>
            <li> but I think it needs more work if it wants to be successful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased I did because they are super nice.</li>
            <li> Vanilla Mint was good, I got the impression of icing when I first smelled it.</li>
            <li> I think these new flavors are a great way to entice children to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> Mostly this toothpaste seemed to be just a strong spearmint flavor.</li>
            <li> The problem is that when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth - and maybe this is just me - I expect to feel clean not like I just ate very strong tapioca pudding.</li>
            <li> The chocolate keeps the mint from being overpowering, though it still leaves your mouth feeling clean!</li>
            <li> My daughter is a huge chocolate mint fan :)  If your kids don&#x27;t like mint (my son)</li>
            <li> If you like the flavor to begin with it starts out fantastic, but I have noticed that it becomes more &#x27;astringent&#x27; as you continue to brush.  </li>
            <li> its really damn good.</li>
            <li> Also, would love to see more flavors, as I really can&#x27;t stand the mint that is used in most toothpastes and it is so nice to be able to have fun flavors for adults and teens.  </li>
            <li> is a unique flavor for toothpaste , I got a bit more chocolate upfront with&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need to put more on to get that clean feeling to my teeth.</li>
            <li> the flavour is not to strong</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lime flavoring might give a bit of a boost to the mint taste, but we didn&#x27;t find the citrus taste to be strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a weirdo, since I don&#x27;t like mint, cinnamon, or bubble gum flavors (which pretty much makes up about 99% of the toothpaste on the market lol).</li>
            <li> If the mint was a bit more mild, I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
            <li> Super bummed!</li>
            <li> chocolate aroma is more pronounced than the mint, so mint lovers might not feel that familiar tingly clean</li>
            <li> which is a rather huge accomplishment.</li>
            <li> but I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> it tastes like a light chocolate mint.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll be at work, and I&#x27;ll just be in the mood, and pull out my toothpaste and toothbrush and enjoy the explosion of flavor in my mouth; just to brighten up my day.</li>
            <li> They said it was amazing how much it really tasted like chocolate then</li>
            <li> I was actually really impressed with how &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; the chocolate flavor tasted and just had to double check the box to see that they didn&#x27;t put real chocolate in there</li>
            <li> feeling.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very nice to see a big company with a familiar brand like Crest</li>
            <li> This my new favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I bought the vanilla mint flavor first and really enjoyed it</li>
            <li> Other than that, good product!  </li>
            <li> I get excited to brush my teeth now</li>
            <li> Strange though it may seem, this is a great tasting toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so nice to veer off the path of the normal peppermint flavored</li>
            <li> I had originally bought Vanilla Mint Spark, and so I&#x27;m gonna go ahead and review that one and the Lime Spearmint one too in my \\&quot;adventurous\\&quot; review.    </li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve ever actually enjoyed the taste of a toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My original impression was mint frosted brownies.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I thought it was unique.  </li>
            <li> but nothing worth having comes easy.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste leaves my teeth feeling clean also</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend for those who want a squeaky clean mint arctic frozen mouth.</li>
            <li> I just want a clean mouth, and this does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> To clean teeth and leave your mouth refreshed over time.  </li>
            <li> I know what I want in a toothpaste.. a clean mouth that lasts till morning..</li>
            <li> The fact that it also tastes like candy tells my brain that my teeth that they aren&#x27;t clean (minty toothpaste makes me feel clean, these do not).</li>
            <li> Mkaes mouth feel clean without being overpowering</li>
            <li> It left a pleasant aftertaste of</li>
            <li> So far it is working, it tastes good and leaves a sweet, fresh taste in my mouth</li>
            <li> Normally I just brush with Arm N Hammer for the strong baking soda effect as I&#x27;m not a fan of most toothpaste&#x27;s minty flavors.</li>
            <li> I probably would&#x27;ve been more excited about brushing, because the mint really made my mouth burn</li>
            <li> I used to slip a slice of chocolate cake in my mouth before going to sleep to ensure that I had sweet dreams.</li>
            <li> This would probably be good for a mid afternoon pick me up..or maybe it&#x27;ll help you cut the chocolate cravings if you&#x27;re dieting or something...4 stars.</li>
            <li> but if you do not like sweet things or mint chocolate, this is probably not the toothpaste for you as it truly does taste like mint chocolate chip ice-cream.</li>
            <li> Smells like sweet vanilla, tastes like a dinner mint.</li>
            <li> Leaves a wonderfully minty flavor in my mouth as opposed to some of the icky toothpaste flavors.  </li>
            <li> It sounds like a dream come true and it is -  until it literally feels like your tongue is on fire afterwards.</li>
            <li> Well, the taste is really nice and reminds me kind of mint chocolate ice cream - just less overpowering.</li>
            <li> I also tried the Vanilla Mint and that&#x27;s much better but not as good as the original Vanilla Mint that Crest discontinued a few years ago.</li>
            <li> The chocolate is kind of a nice little treat at night before bed.</li>
            <li> It is a fun flavor and it does get the teeth and breath clean.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super yummy and tastes like an andes mint.</li>
            <li> And who doesn&#x27;t love the soft chocolatey mint flavor of Andes Mints, the closest thing I can think of for sharing the flavor with you!?!</li>
            <li> , we just tried two new Crest flavors, this Be Adventurous Mint Chocolate&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked the taste, and definitely minty sweet, like a dinner mint.</li>
            <li> Love it, especially before bed when you don&#x27;t want the strong flavor you might be looking for in the morning.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I took a chance, not really expecting it to taste that good</li>
            <li> I imagine if you have kids who neglect to brush, this would be a powerful motivating tool.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY toothpaste my 5 yr old will use happily.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and leaves the mouth feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li> I save the Chocolate Mint for my last brushing of the day--like being in a nice hotel that has a &amp;#34;turn-down service&amp;#34; and leaves a chocolate mint on your pillow.  </li>
            <li> have used Crest for years and even had success with Vanilla Mint.</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling fresh..  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite flavor.  </li>
            <li> Minty fresh.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a nice departure from the traditional minty flavored pastes.</li>
            <li> The tooth paste is kind of gritty</li>
            <li> While I did feel like my teeth were nice and cleaned, in the back of my mind I did wonder if I really did just clean my teeth or eat a bowl of ice-cream or had some mint chocolate candy of some sort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It def left a clean, refreshing feeling after brushing without sending me into mint-induced convulsions.</li>
            <li> It tastes really good but honestly is a little too sweet for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the other reviewers have not had good mint chocolate in a while or what, but they should partner with Bear Grylls and call it Bear Grylls:</li>
            <li> I thought if I could find a chocolate toothpaste and brush my teeth right after eating, maybe I wouldn&#x27;t get the cravings.</li>
            <li> Right after brushing, I get this needles pain all over my tongue, like it is swelling up.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of zing to it and it doesn&#x27;t taste like you are brushing your teeth with food.</li>
            <li> guess it was worth the couple bucks I paid to have my first allergic experience.</li>
            <li> knocks are this was hard to find (resorting to Amazon for toothpaste - I am sure they are thrilled</li>
            <li> I dislike the taste of traditional mint, so I was happy to find a toothpaste that had a different flavor.</li>
            <li> someone that really enjoys interesting and unexpected flavor</li>
            <li> I think having intriguing flavors such as this one will inspire some&lt;br /&gt;people to brush more often.</li>
            <li> It tastes pretty good, just not worth it.</li>
            <li> Fine by me, just didn&#x27;t like the overly soft mushy foam coming from my faux rabied mouth.    </li>
            <li> so I was pretty excited to try all these new Crest Be toothpaste flavors.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t use the paste more than 3 or 4 times before realizing this was going to be a regular thing and not just a &amp;</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is actually pretty tasty, however my mouth doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling after I&#x27;m done brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Someone willing to pay that price for the rest of my life</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of this from a local store, because I love mint chocolate chip ice cream.</li>
            <li> I would like to preface this with the fact that I love mint, chocolate, Blue Bell mint chocolate chip ice cream, you name it, if it is mint and chocolate, I am there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have wondered for years why there was no chocolate mint toothpaste, glad someone finally made</li>
            <li> and, though the flavor of it was ok, I was left underwhelmed at having used it.  </li>
            <li> First you have to consider the product you&#x27;re using and its purpose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really missed the Vanilla Expressions toothpaste and this makes up for it!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> all three of them cost more than standard mint gels).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my ten and eight year olds today to encourage them to brush more.  </li>
            <li> It has a really funny aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I might not like the flavors I listed above, but I sure do like chocolate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t satisfied with regular, plain-old mint toothpaste, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what advice I&#x27;d offer someone interested in buying this product.</li>
            <li> So I just tried this toothpaste out, and it was pretty tasty-</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste so much like mint chocolate chip ice cream to me- more like one of those little after dinner mints that is more of a real fresh peppermint flavor mixed with a bit of chocolate.</li>
            <li> In our family of four, two like plain old mint gel toothpaste, but two of us LOVE more unusual flavors, with the current favorite being Crest Cinnamon Expressions.</li>
            <li> this is like those overly sweet chocolate lipsmackers I got as a 7 year old for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Another angle to consider, my older kids have just graduated to regular toothpaste, and this keeps them brushing, and brushing well. :)</li>
            <li> In my search for a mild mint adult toothpaste (since the one that worked so well for me was discontinued) I found this.  </li>
            <li> However that excitement has left and now all I feel is a strong burning sensation in my mouth and a swollen tongue.</li>
            <li> Chocolate toothpaste may sound a little gross, but it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Now I have a full tube of back up toothpaste in my cabinet that will not be used until the zombi apocalypse strikes and no other toothpaste is available.</li>
            <li> , I tried the other two flavors and to me they left an aftertaste that wasn&#x27;t pleasant..</li>
            <li> The chocolate tastes like real chocolate</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s got flouride which means it&#x27;s really toothpaste and not some candy in the form of a tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I am really picky about my toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> and it burns my mouth too much.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a real tease when you&#x27;re dieting.</li>
            <li> It feels like the Crest chemists were developing the taste, getting really close, but time/funding/patience ran out and they had to ship.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a hint of chocolate and a touch of mint... but not so much that my eyes water and my nose runs.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really like it at all.  </li>
            <li> Very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really, really hope they never discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the taste of the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I alternate between this and Colgate Total when I brush, nice change of pace.    </li>
            <li> First time I used it, it tingled a little (ok, burned)</li>
            <li> The chocolate taste is similar to a Tootsie Roll...not quite like &#x27;real&#x27; chocolate, but not unpleasant either.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Our new fave!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only mildly chocolatey</li>
            <li> Got my first tube in Walmart, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in my place ( a small college town:).</li>
            <li> main ingredient is sorbitol.</li>
            <li> Wow!!  </li>
            <li> #34;there&#x27;s no way this is going to leave my mouth feeling clean when I&#x27;m done&amp;#34; but I was pleasantly surprised that I was left with only the fresh minty aftertaste and none of the chocolate taste</li>
            <li> I try to use mostly natural and organic ingredients, this is pretty far from that</li>
            <li> This definitely tastes exactly like what it says and it tastes really well.</li>
            <li> Actually, it is probably a burst of smell, not taste, because as you start your brushing, the chocolate taste dissipates very quickly, leaving you with generic mint taste.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really taste of anything - if you closed your eyes you would think it was mild mint flavor.  </li>
            <li> About 10 minutes later I got a rash on my jaw under my right ear.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this toothpaste and a couple other BE flavors.  </li>
            <li> this is new</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new Chocolate mint toothpaste since the one I used by Fructodent was discontinued.</li>
            <li> the interest of exploring new things</li>
            <li> Honestly these names are ridiculous, but its just whatever.</li>
            <li> I mean who wants to brush their teeth with chocolate, but then my love for all things chocolate mint won out</li>
            <li> This was a little more expensive with mostly good reviews with one reviewer even feeling like a kid again, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> Only you don&#x27;t get to have the bowl first.</li>
            <li> It sounded too interesting to pass up, so I bought my usual Sensitivity and the Chocolate Mint.  </li>
            <li> *** is actually pretty gross after a while and 2.</li>
            <li> My 4.5 year old loves it!</li>
            <li> Would love to try vanilla mint but not sure about lime spearmint.  </li>
            <li> The flavor is exactly like mint chocolate chip ice cream, and the first time I used it I actually swallowed it because it tasted so similar.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth as well as other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a strong mint, but not as bad as regular mint toothpaste and the flavor is really good.  </li>
            <li> So far I have only tried this one and it went straight into the trash after I tried it.  </li>
            <li> next time I go, I&#x27;m stocking up because I don&#x27;t often find toothpaste I like this much.  </li>
            <li> --I was really pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have a knack of wondering what stuff smells like anyways, so sticking my nose near the tube is just sort of habit to me.</li>
            <li> Now, my baby is 5 months old and mint has lost its grotesqueness, but I still prefer this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It causes pain where it touches the soft tissues in my mouth.</li>
            <li> B001G7PLM8 Crest Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening Expressions</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life completely.</li>
            <li> The chocolate-mint combination is subtle and adult, with the chocolate more pronounced.  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive mouth and adult mint toothpastes (as 99% of toothpaste is, or cinnamon which has the same effect) burn my mouth.  </li>
            <li> even more interesingly that my fiancee does not, but it ruins what is otherwise a very pleasant experience and change in pace in the boring toothpaste world .</li>
            <li> one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes pretty much as I expected, an even mix of coco and mint flavor.  </li>
            <li> I could even live with the gritty feeling if it wasn&#x27;t for the burning and sore feeling in my mouth after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m open to trying new stuff</li>
            <li> A hit of major nostalgia.</li>
            <li> A little more expensive than other Crest varieties, it is a nice change of pace.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like the apparent pain it caused me.</li>
            <li> The Lime Spearmint seems so average that it isn&#x27;t worth the extra expense for</li>
            <li> the novelty of the flavor was there, but it didn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling fresh for very long, as long as regular toothpaste does..</li>
            <li> The only other negative thing about this is it does not leave that clean, super minty taste that a standard toothpaste does.</li>
            <li> Hope this is not a limited time run.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time it was a little like brushing with minty frosting</li>
            <li> However, the paste has somewhat a gritty feel to it that I would describe kind of as the same feeling you get when you put a small amount of baking soda mixed with some plain ole&#x27; toothpaste.</li>
            <li> And like any other decent human being, I get bored pretty quickly with the routine.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this toothpaste, but unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t possible unless I had developed some self-harming tendencies :/</li>
            <li> But I saw these new flavors by Crest the other night at the store.</li>
            <li> But considering I had used the \\&quot;Hello\\&quot; brand not long before and thought the mint was waaay overpowering and the product way too expensive(5 dollars for less than a normal amount of toothpaste?</li>
            <li> It has fluoride and all the other usual stuff and leaves my teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is that Crest should use a little less mint to get less of a mint taste and more of the flavor taste.  </li>
            <li> the two new Crest flavors, Lime Spearmint and Mint Chocolate are not a fit for our family.</li>
            <li> As compared to other brand toothpastes, it is more expensive.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t bad, but note that the Be Dynamic and Be Adventurous tubes are only 4.5 ounces each, compared to the 6.0 ounces for the Cinnamon Expressions.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for - lately, I have been craving sweets and eating too much leftover Easter candy.</li>
            <li> So, it may sound weird, but give it a try.</li>
            <li> so it might feel and taste a lil strange at first&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> However, it is sort of fun, like brushing your mouth with Thin Mints Girl Scout cookies</li>
            <li> We constantly try each other&#x27;s hygiene products and she said it tasted like a mojito.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ve never been particularly excited about brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> Like any other decent human being, I brush my teeth at least two times a day.</li>
            <li> I get the feeling they aren&#x27;t going to be around for very long, so</li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s only affecting some people) or if it&#x27;s having this effect on a lot of people, but there only seem to be a few commenting on it.</li>
            <li> The feeling lingers for a good 5-15 minutes depending if you rinse with a lot of water or not, but it is very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It is the only slightly minty toothpaste she will use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please save your money and buy regular mint toothpaste for half the price.</li>
            <li> Couple that with the numerous artificial colors (yellow 5 lake, yellow 5, red 40 lake, blue 1 lake, blue 1) and ingredients (sacchrin, sulfate, etc)</li>
            <li> marketing campaign is weird, they shoulda just made a box that said CHOCOLATE MINT, instead of making the Crest BE all huge, and the flavor in teeeny little letters.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I actually got this as a stocking stuffer but wanted to write a review anyways, because I feel like not very many people know about this line of toothpaste from Crest.</li>
            <li> This made it burn, but the only thing to get rid of that pins and needles, harsh feeling.</li>
            <li> It does taste like a mojito without the guilt of maybe slipping into a drunken slur.</li>
            <li> Now 63, I&#x27;ve spent a lifetime brushing because I had to; now I WANT to.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to be brown in color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I can no longer purchase it locally and hope Amazon keeps it in stock for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I now brush my teeth at least 5-10 times a day now, which I&#x27;m pretty sure is bad for the enamel, but the flavor is just so addicting!</li>
            <li> At the same time we switched to a sonicare toothbrush, so I&#x27;m not sure which one is doing it, but my teeth of gotten wider in the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> Only big complaint is that my mouth started burning about half way through brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to try the other flavors in this line.</li>
            <li> the other 2 Crest Be flavors</li>
            <li> and that I get from my other toothpaste, not this.</li>
            <li> I came on here to see if any other people had the &amp;#34;allergic reaction&amp;#34; to this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> When I used it for the first time I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it would have lasted, but I applied my steroid solution for eczema</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much too  expensive in the store.  </li>
            <li> and it tasted like watered down chocolate and mint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s something caustic and awful in this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I found this nearly half off on Amazon, so I stocked up.</li>
            <li> at the end went slightly minty.</li>
            <li> almost comparable to that numb, painful feeling after you were too hasty not letting your Hot Pocket cool down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of plain old mint every day.</li>
            <li> This tastes nothing like ice cream, it is not sweet.  </li>
            <li> So why not shake things up a little in the morning and after meals?</li>
            <li> I am anxious to try a couple of the other flavors--the one with vanilla and the one with lime.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> If you truly want comparison go to Wallyworld and go to the lipgloss section to look for chocolate flavored chapstick for little girls.</li>
            <li> The underside of my tongue felt like pins and needles for a few seconds at the end of my brushing.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the toothpaste is an off-whitish green.</li>
            <li> I noticed though that it is green....</li>
            <li> The flavor reminds my a bit of those Andes chocolate mints in the shiny green wrapping.</li>
            <li> I knew something was wrong with this, toothpaste on sale and its experimental?</li>
            <li> I had actually first saw it in Walmart like last year, and thought this had to be the most disgusting sounding crap to be ever put into a mouth.</li>
            <li> I would rate this the same as KY warming lube, it gives the same painful burning experience.</li>
            <li> I usually get children&#x27;s toothpaste in order to get another flavor.  </li>
            <li> So I guess i&#x27;m not adventurous, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m paranoid now that Crest will quit making this, though, since when I find a product I like, it usually gets discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Oh, it&#x27;s so much fun to shake up something as boring and mundane as your toothbrushing routine.</li>
            <li> It tasted like those hard candy mint chocolate chip ice cream candies.</li>
            <li> At least I hope so.</li>
            <li> but we had to stop using it when I realized the toothpaste was the common thing we were all using when the problems arose.</li>
            <li> The first week I used this, I hated it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like fake chocolate on steroids, with mint to keep it down</li>
            <li> Adventurous\\&quot; name is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I look forward to brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> When I stated brushing though the inside of my mouth starting burning really bad</li>
            <li> After brushing, and for about five minutes afterwards, there&#x27;s a painful sensation on my gums, inner cheek and tongue, as if I had just rinsed my mouth with</li>
            <li> I thought at first I would be brushing with nasty s</li>
            <li> Pregnancy is weird, and traditional mint basically became the worst taste on the planet that would instantly send me gagging.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I had to log into Amazon to read all the funny reviews as to how awful it was and am utterly shocked by the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> This is a defective product of poor design.</li>
            <li> I seriously felt like I was brushing my teeth with liquid candy!</li>
            <li> I heard recently read about how flouride was bad and yadda yadda, but have found out hey I need flouride for my badly inherited crappy teeth.</li>
            <li> She says and I have to agree, that it tastes like thin mint girl scout cookies!</li>
            <li> What I wasn&#x27;t expecting was how wrong they tasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was an offbeat flavor for toothpaste and my interest was piqued.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> WTF?)</li>
            <li> in my mouth, but once again I&#x27;m wrong.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical going into this testing</li>
            <li> It leaves the worst chalky, textured residue on your tongue that numerous rinsings won&#x27;t get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> It just feels weird to have a chocolate taste in your mouth that you aren&#x27;t going to swallow.</li>
            <li> Expensive on amazon though.</li>
            <li> I think I had an allergic reaction because I had a weird sensation across my mouth and a pain underneath my tongue.</li>
            <li> Too unpleasant to overlook unfortunately</li>
            <li> /&gt;It just tastes artificial, neither mint nor chocolate.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> It looks not so bad...</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be sickening, but I wanted to try it anyway.</li>
            <li> It hurts terribly!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like mint flavor because I think it&#x27;s boring</li>
            <li> When my girlfriend said she bought this, I was absolutely disgusted.</li>

            <li> If you have a gag reflex issue with Mint, this is a great alternative and an awesome Chocolate taste with just a hint of light mint.</li>
            <li> This is really good!  The flavor is what you might expect for chocolate mint.  I have a very sensitive mouth and adult mint toothpastes (as 99% of toothpaste is, or cinnamon which has the same effect) burn my mouth.  It hurts terribly! SO, I use kids toothpaste.  In my search for a mild mint adult toothpaste (since the one that worked so well for me was discontinued) I found this.  There was nothing on it that said mild, but I hoped for the best that the chocolate part might mellow out the mint.  It does and it doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s still a strong mint, but not as bad as regular mint toothpaste and the flavor is really good.  The chocolate tastes like real chocolate so I say give it a try!  If the mint was a bit more mild, I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla mint toothpaste from this line and decided to try this chocolate mint flavor, but like some others, I had a reaction to the product. The underside of my tongue felt like pins and needles for a few seconds at the end of my brushing. About 10 minutes later I got a rash on my jaw under my right ear. Not sure how long it would have lasted, but I applied my steroid solution for eczema so it went away in a couple hours. Super bummed! If it helps anyone, I have no known food allergies but I have a severe contact allergy to most metals, and a sensitivity to latex and wool. I called Crest and let them know--I suggest anyone else who had this reaction do the same. They&#x27;ll give you a coupon for a different toothpaste replacement, too.</li>
            <li> I loved the Vanilla Mint flavor, so I bought this. Interesting flavor, still more mint than chocolate, and the chocolate taste doesn&#x27;t linger. I had no allergic reactions, myself. I alternate between this and Colgate Total when I brush, nice change of pace.    So, not as good as the Vanilla Mint, but I&#x27;ll probably keep a tube around until it&#x27;s discontinued, which hopefully isn&#x27;t too soon. Oh, and the toothpaste is an off-whitish green. Just throwing that out there, since brown toothpaste would just be....weird.</li>
            <li> I bought the vanilla mint flavor first and really enjoyed it so I figured I would venture out and try the chocolate mint. Well, the taste is really nice and reminds me kind of mint chocolate ice cream - just less overpowering. I was actually really impressed with how &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; the chocolate flavor tasted and just had to double check the box to see that they didn&#x27;t put real chocolate in there lol! However, the paste has somewhat a gritty feel to it that I would describe kind of as the same feeling you get when you put a small amount of baking soda mixed with some plain ole&#x27; toothpaste. I could even live with the gritty feeling if it wasn&#x27;t for the burning and sore feeling in my mouth after using it. The feeling lingers for a good 5-15 minutes depending if you rinse with a lot of water or not, but it is very unpleasant. Too unpleasant to overlook unfortunately and I couldn&#x27;t use the paste more than 3 or 4 times before realizing this was going to be a regular thing and not just a &amp;#34;hey this is new so it might feel and taste a lil strange at first&amp;#34; type thing ... Now I have a full tube of back up toothpaste in my cabinet that will not be used until the zombi apocalypse strikes and no other toothpaste is available. You might not get the burning sensation though, an if that&#x27;s the case I do recommend it. I really wanted to love this toothpaste, but unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t possible unless I had developed some self-harming tendencies :/</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but it&#x27;s much too  expensive in the store.  I had some room left on an Amazon gift card and figured I&#x27;d use it up with more of this wonderful stuff!  I think I actually brush longer, lol.  It&#x27;s only mildly chocolatey but I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Finally a toothpaste the kids and I can share! Works well. Tastes great. Not overly chocolate or mint flavoured. Our new fave!</li>
            <li> I used to slip a slice of chocolate cake in my mouth before going to sleep to ensure that I had sweet dreams. Now I just brush with the Crest Chocolate toothpaste and I get the same effect plus I avoid waking in the middle of the night, choking on sprinkles. And it&#x27;s got flouride which means it&#x27;s really toothpaste and not some candy in the form of a tube of toothpaste. Which I might also buy but wouldn&#x27;t brush my teeth with it. I suspect that this is just regular mint toothpaste with chocolate flavor in it. At least I hope so.</li>
            <li> I love this flavor. Got my first tube in Walmart, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in my place ( a small college town:). So, I decide to grab one in Amazon. Good price. Nice feeling after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I am really picky about my toothpastes.  I don&#x27;t like mint flavor because I think it&#x27;s boring and it burns my mouth too much.  I usually get children&#x27;s toothpaste in order to get another flavor.  But I saw these new flavors by Crest the other night at the store. I almost passed it up, but I was too intrigued by the idea of brushing with a chocolate flavor.  I&#x27;m glad I got it.  I LOVE it.  It is SO good.  It tastes and smells surprisingly delicious.  I love the way it lathers and it doesn&#x27;t burn, either.  I get the feeling they aren&#x27;t going to be around for very long, so next time I go, I&#x27;m stocking up because I don&#x27;t often find toothpaste I like this much.  Delicious!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new Chocolate mint toothpaste since the one I used by Fructodent was discontinued. So I was very excited to see this one. However that excitement has left and now all I feel is a strong burning sensation in my mouth and a swollen tongue. If you are feeling &amp;#34;adventurous&amp;#34; as it says on the box and into S&amp;M you might like this toothpaste. I would rate this the same as KY warming lube, it gives the same painful burning experience.</li>
            <li> Love it, especially before bed when you don&#x27;t want the strong flavor you might be looking for in the morning.</li>
            <li> Great flavor....I thought it would be sickening, but I wanted to try it anyway. Boy was I wrong! This is great stuff. I don&#x27;t see it in the grocery stores anymore, but I&#x27;m glad to see that Amazon still carries it.</li>
            <li> This flavor was enjoyable!</li>
            <li> Well...I guess if you don&#x27;t like mint chocolate chip ice cream you might not want to get this.  But I do and I did and the flavor sure delivers.  It is not especially minty or chocolatey.  I think the ice cream comparison nails it.  It is a fun flavor and it does get the teeth and breath clean.  Actually a nice change of pace from the \\&quot;frozen ice mint wintermint arctic blast\\&quot; everyflavors that seem to dominate now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only knocks are this was hard to find (resorting to Amazon for toothpaste - I am sure they are thrilled but I&#x27;m left to wonder what the world is coming to) and the \\&quot;Be Adventurous\\&quot; name is ridiculous.  Other than that, good product!  I got all three flavors so I&#x27;ll try and review the others soon.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes great! I dislike the taste of traditional mint, so I was happy to find a toothpaste that had a different flavor. I recommend this to anyone who likes chocolate!</li>
            <li> It is my husband&#x27;s favorite toothpaste - it is his morning treat</li>
            <li> Tastes just like an after-dinner mint.</li>
            <li> You must try this toothpaste! it&#x27;s super yummy and tastes like an andes mint. . I get excited to brush my teeth now lol  By far my favorite toothpaste. You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is actually pretty tasty, however my mouth doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling after I&#x27;m done brushing. This would probably be good for a mid afternoon pick me up..or maybe it&#x27;ll help you cut the chocolate cravings if you&#x27;re dieting or something...4 stars.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC! It&#x27;s like candy. First time I used it, it tingled a little (ok, burned) but nothing worth having comes easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for two days, and I&#x27;m brushing twice as often. I took a chance, not really expecting it to taste that good--I was really pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste makes my morning. It&#x27;s tasty, like eating ice cream for breakfast. I imagine if you have kids who neglect to brush, this would be a powerful motivating tool.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t taste too minty and I like the texture</li>
            <li> What a great idea for toothpaste! Who says all toothpaste has to taste the same? I&#x27;m tired of plain old mint every day. This one tastes kind of like chocolate mint ice cream. And it&#x27;s a real tease when you&#x27;re dieting. It has fluoride and all the other usual stuff and leaves my teeth feeling clean. So why not shake things up a little in the morning and after meals? I&#x27;ll have to try the other flavors in this line.</li>
            <li> As toothpastes go, it&#x27;s a nice change. It&#x27;s the standard mint with a chocolate aftertaste. Nice, kinda like licking the ice cream off a spoon. Only you don&#x27;t get to have the bowl first.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY toothpaste my 5 yr old will use happily. If you have a kid that cries when he has to brush his teeth...buy this.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for - lately, I have been craving sweets and eating too much leftover Easter candy. I thought if I could find a chocolate toothpaste and brush my teeth right after eating, maybe I wouldn&#x27;t get the cravings. So far it is working, it tastes good and leaves a sweet, fresh taste in my mouth so I am not tempted to eat a piece of chocolate.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more to say.  This truly is like mint chocolate chip ice cream in the best possible (and refreshing) way.  Please never take this toothpaste off the market!&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Someone willing to pay that price for the rest of my life</li>
            <li> Strange though it may seem, this is a great tasting toothpaste.  The chocolate-mint combination is subtle and adult, with the chocolate more pronounced.  It cleans well and leaves the mouth feeling fresh.  A little more expensive than other Crest varieties, it is a nice change of pace.</li>
            <li> The chocolate taste is similar to a Tootsie Roll...not quite like &#x27;real&#x27; chocolate, but not unpleasant either.&lt;br /&gt;As someone that really enjoys interesting and unexpected flavor, Crest Mint Chocolate is a mouthful of foamy fun.&lt;br /&gt;The chocolate aroma is more pronounced than the mint, so mint lovers might not feel that familiar tingly clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very nice to see a big company with a familiar brand like Crest take a chance on an interesting flavor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all of the Crest Be Adventurous toothpastes, and while I still love my Marvis toothpaste flavors, these are a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> it tastes like a light chocolate mint. its really damn good. main ingredient is sorbitol.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favourite toothpaste.  It is the only slightly minty toothpaste she will use.  She says and I have to agree, that it tastes like thin mint girl scout cookies!</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste leaves my teeth feeling clean also the flavour is not to strong</li>
            <li> The most delicious toothpaste!!! I bought it on a whim, it was different, I was intrigued. When it arrived I tried it instantly...DELISIOUS!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought 5 more ❤️ My husband also loves it.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is amazing!</li>
            <li> I spotted this toothpaste by accident at the pharmacy when I was looking for my regular Crest Sensitivity toothpaste.  Chocolate Mint?  It sounded too interesting to pass up, so I bought my usual Sensitivity and the Chocolate Mint.  I agree with the reviewers who say it tastes like an Andes mint.  I save the Chocolate Mint for my last brushing of the day--like being in a nice hotel that has a &amp;#34;turn-down service&amp;#34; and leaves a chocolate mint on your pillow.  I use the regular Sensitivity toothpaste for the rest of the day (braces--I brush my teeth several times a day).  I think these new flavors are a great way to entice children to brush their teeth. I am anxious to try a couple of the other flavors--the one with vanilla and the one with lime.&lt;br /&gt;Good job, Crest!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m open to trying new stuff so I was pretty excited to try all these new Crest Be toothpaste flavors. Like licking the wall at Willy Wonka&#x27;s I gleefully brushed my teeth over and over to give them all a shot. What I wasn&#x27;t expecting was how wrong they tasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very creamy and very sweet, Mint Chocolate Trek (aptly names Be Adventurous) had a strong chocolate bean flavor, like powered chocolate, hits you just as you start to brush with the mint. The problem is that when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth - and maybe this is just me - I expect to feel clean not like I just ate very strong tapioca pudding. I felt I was supposed to swallow because it tasted like dessert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just not a fan of these flavors. Couple that with the numerous artificial colors (yellow 5 lake, yellow 5, red 40 lake, blue 1 lake, blue 1) and ingredients (sacchrin, sulfate, etc) and I just don&#x27;t see how I would recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s more like a gag gift than a toothpaste and I think we will likely see these come and go on the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was provided by Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Saw these advertised and thought I&#x27;d give them a go as they looked nice. I&#x27;m really pleased I did because they are super nice. The flavours are delicious and I&#x27;m real pleased I tried them. Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love mint chocolate chip ice-cream and this toothpaste tastes just like the ice-cream. It tastes really good but honestly is a little too sweet for me. While I did feel like my teeth were nice and cleaned, in the back of my mind I did wonder if I really did just clean my teeth or eat a bowl of ice-cream or had some mint chocolate candy of some sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would still recommend the toothpaste but if you do not like sweet things or mint chocolate, this is probably not the toothpaste for you as it truly does taste like mint chocolate chip ice-cream.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Mint Chocolate Trek Crest Be toothpaste from BzzAgent.  It was an offbeat flavor for toothpaste and my interest was piqued.&lt;br /&gt;This is a unique flavor for toothpaste , I got a bit more chocolate upfront with&lt;br /&gt;a back note of mint.&lt;br /&gt;The texture seemed a bit grittier than the other 2 Crest Be flavors I received,&lt;br /&gt;(Lime Spearmint Zest &amp; Vanilla Mint Spark).  It left a pleasant aftertaste of&lt;br /&gt;chocolate mint in my mouth after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;It is so nice to veer off the path of the normal peppermint flavored&lt;br /&gt;toothpaste.  I think having intriguing flavors such as this one will inspire some&lt;br /&gt;people to brush more often.</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of this from a local store, because I love mint chocolate chip ice cream. I had to come on to review this item, because although I LOVE the flavor, it is almost as if I had an allergic reaction to it. Right after brushing, I get this needles pain all over my tongue, like it is swelling up. The only thing to get rid of this was to wash my mouth out with Listerine afterwards, and hold it on my tongue. This made it burn, but the only thing to get rid of that pins and needles, harsh feeling. I felt like I needed to come on and warn people about this!</li>
            <li> The adults in the house did not like the taste, but it was a hit with the kids.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest tasting toothpaste, ever. It doesn&#x27;t taste so much like mint chocolate chip ice cream to me- more like one of those little after dinner mints that is more of a real fresh peppermint flavor mixed with a bit of chocolate. It&#x27;s so yummy that I&#x27;m planning on stocking up on it just in case they stop making it (as seems to happen with most good things.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it for the first time it was a little like brushing with minty frosting and I was thinking &amp;#34;there&#x27;s no way this is going to leave my mouth feeling clean when I&#x27;m done&amp;#34; but I was pleasantly surprised that I was left with only the fresh minty aftertaste and none of the chocolate taste stuck around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s tasty and it does its job and its actually something different for a change.</li>
            <li> So I actually got this as a stocking stuffer but wanted to write a review anyways, because I feel like not very many people know about this line of toothpaste from Crest. I had actually first saw it in Walmart like last year, and thought this had to be the most disgusting sounding crap to be ever put into a mouth. I heard recently read about how flouride was bad and yadda yadda, but have found out hey I need flouride for my badly inherited crappy teeth. I had originally bought Vanilla Mint Spark, and so I&#x27;m gonna go ahead and review that one and the Lime Spearmint one too in my \\&quot;adventurous\\&quot; review.    Vanilla Mint was good, I got the impression of icing when I first smelled it. I have a knack of wondering what stuff smells like anyways, so sticking my nose near the tube is just sort of habit to me. Honestly these names are ridiculous, but its just whatever. I liked the taste, and definitely minty sweet, like a dinner mint. Smells like sweet vanilla, tastes like a dinner mint. Fine by me, just didn&#x27;t like the overly soft mushy foam coming from my faux rabied mouth.    I just tried the lime spearmint one only because my sister had received it as a stocking stuffer. We constantly try each other&#x27;s hygiene products and she said it tasted like a mojito. Too good to be true, I thought. But considering I had used the \\&quot;Hello\\&quot; brand not long before and thought the mint was waaay overpowering and the product way too expensive(5 dollars for less than a normal amount of toothpaste? WTF?), this s*** is awesome.It does taste like a mojito without the guilt of maybe slipping into a drunken slur. It isn&#x27;t a solid color like the others, its like a gel but oh well. It sparkles and catches my attention.    Annnd finally the chocolate mintiness of triumph. Again, I stuck my nose to the opened tube and was like holy hell this is like those overly sweet chocolate lipsmackers I got as a 7 year old for Christmas. A hit of major nostalgia. I noticed though that it is green....with poop stains it looks like. I thought at first I would be brushing with nasty s*** in my mouth, but once again I&#x27;m wrong. Others have said its comparable to a mint chocolate chip icecream. Honestly, its not. If you truly want comparison go to Wallyworld and go to the lipgloss section to look for chocolate flavored chapstick for little girls. Open that booger up and then you will have comparison. This stuff is like fake chocolate on steroids, with mint to keep it down so it doesn&#x27;t make you wonder what kind of cancer you&#x27;re putting in your mouth. One of the only reasons I love it is because of nostalgia, but I also think it would be perfect for kids because 1.:That bubblegum fruit s*** is actually pretty gross after a while and 2.: I know too many kids will be thinking yay chocolate and be encouraged to brush more often because they like chocolate candy. I know that if this would&#x27;ve been in my household when I was younger I probably would&#x27;ve been more excited about brushing, because the mint really made my mouth burn and I always ended up eating the bubblegum alligator toothpaste my parents got. I recommend this if you don&#x27;t like mint. I don&#x27;t recommend for those who want a squeaky clean mint arctic frozen mouth. I just want a clean mouth, and this does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I would like to preface this with the fact that I love mint, chocolate, Blue Bell mint chocolate chip ice cream, you name it, if it is mint and chocolate, I am there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Crest for years and even had success with Vanilla Mint. This was a little more expensive with mostly good reviews with one reviewer even feeling like a kid again, so I thought I&#x27;d try it. It had to be good, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never have I been so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just tastes artificial, neither mint nor chocolate. It feels like the Crest chemists were developing the taste, getting really close, but time/funding/patience ran out and they had to ship. I had to add some of my regular mint to make it tolerable. I don&#x27;t know if the other reviewers have not had good mint chocolate in a while or what, but they should partner with Bear Grylls and call it Bear Grylls: Be Adveturous Chooclate Limpet toothpaste. It looks not so bad...oh yes...yes it is. So bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please save your money and buy regular mint toothpaste for half the price.</li>
            <li> I have wondered for years why there was no chocolate mint toothpaste, glad someone finally made one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes pretty much as I expected, an even mix of coco and mint flavor.  Tastes like a chocolate mint Velamint if you remember those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The marketing campaign is weird, they shoulda just made a box that said CHOCOLATE MINT, instead of making the Crest BE all huge, and the flavor in teeeny little letters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vanilla is good too, I think it&#x27;s a repackaging of the vanilla mint I used to buy years ago.  Reminds me of Tic Tacs.</li>
            <li> When my girlfriend said she bought this, I was absolutely disgusted. I told her there was no way I was going to brush my teeth with that. It just sounded gross. Then she talked me into trying it.. Man it&#x27;s good! The flavor reminds my a bit of those Andes chocolate mints in the shiny green wrapping. Seriously, I look forward to brushing my teeth. The chocolate is kind of a nice little treat at night before bed. Honestly, I find myself brushing more often. At the same time we switched to a sonicare toothbrush, so I&#x27;m not sure which one is doing it, but my teeth of gotten wider in the last few weeks. I try to use mostly natural and organic ingredients, this is pretty far from that but damn it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> I received this Mint Chocolate Trek toothpaste from Crest to try in a campaign seeking feedback from consumers.  I have to admit I was skeptical going into this testing and, though the flavor of it was ok, I was left underwhelmed at having used it.  First you have to consider the product you&#x27;re using and its purpose.  To clean teeth and leave your mouth refreshed over time.  This is why we use toothpaste and count on it to perform.  Using this flavored toothpaste left me feeling I was brushing with leftover chocolate in my mouth.. the novelty of the flavor was there, but it didn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling fresh for very long, as long as regular toothpaste does.. and it didn&#x27;t pass the overnight test..  so what&#x27;s the deal?  To me, I need to have a lasting toothpaste that freshens the mouth.. i&#x27;m not seeking a flavor experience when I use it.  That&#x27;s what candy is for.  It was good to try but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it personally.. this is my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I tried the other two flavors and to me they left an aftertaste that wasn&#x27;t pleasant.. just didn&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling fresh..  So I guess i&#x27;m not adventurous, but I know what I want in a toothpaste.. a clean mouth that lasts till morning.. and that I get from my other toothpaste, not this.</li>
            <li> I love chocolate and this toothpaste is chocolate flavored! Great for kids and adults. Have already purchased&lt;br /&gt;A second tube. Hope this is not a limited time run.</li>
            <li> I think I just brushed my teeth with mint chocolate ice cream.  Absolutely delicious.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has me looking for excuses to brush my teeth!  Now 63, I&#x27;ve spent a lifetime brushing because I had to; now I WANT to.  And who doesn&#x27;t love the soft chocolatey mint flavor of Andes Mints, the closest thing I can think of for sharing the flavor with you!?!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is DELICIOUS! It makes me want to brush my teeth all the time. Chocolate toothpaste may sound a little gross, but it&#x27;s amazing. Try it!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this toothpaste and a couple other BE flavors.  So far I have only tried this one and it went straight into the trash after I tried it.  This tastes nothing like ice cream, it is not sweet.  It is gross.  It leaves the worst chalky, textured residue on your tongue that numerous rinsings won&#x27;t get rid of it.  It was so bad that I had to log into Amazon to read all the funny reviews as to how awful it was and am utterly shocked by the positive reviews.  There is no way all the prior reviewers used the same toothpaste and I used tonight.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like brushing my teeth because I don&#x27;t like the burning sensation I get from mint. Even &amp;#34;cool mint&amp;#34; bothers me at times. Therefore, I&#x27;ve tried children&#x27;s toothpaste, brushing with just water, brushing with baking soda (yuck!), and even orange-mint toothpaste, I&#x27;ll try anything that is different, including non-foaming toothpaste (which I can&#x27;t recommend).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Crest came out with the &amp;#34;Be&amp;#34; series, I tried them all.  This is by far my favorite flavor.  There&#x27;s a hint of chocolate and a touch of mint... but not so much that my eyes water and my nose runs.  I&#x27;m paranoid now that Crest will quit making this, though, since when I find a product I like, it usually gets discontinued.  I found this nearly half off on Amazon, so I stocked up.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is like a delicious, chocolate covered mint at the end of the meal, but it has no calories and it cleans your teeth. I think Walmart sells it, and probably not for the price Amazon sellers are asking, but not every state has a Wally World in it. Shop around for the price, but definitely give this a shot if you&#x27;re a chocolate fan. It might be a good way to encourage kids to brush their teeth or for somebody who is dieting. I&#x27;m using it after dinner and will buy this product again. Wish it came in a larger tube than 4.5 oz. though.</li>
            <li> The taste is great, the kids, my husband and I love the flavor!  The only thing I can say is that Crest should use a little less mint to get less of a mint taste and more of the flavor taste.  Also, would love to see more flavors, as I really can&#x27;t stand the mint that is used in most toothpastes and it is so nice to be able to have fun flavors for adults and teens.  Would also love to see these flavors in the restoration toothpastes too!  I&#x27;ve really missed the Vanilla Expressions toothpaste and this makes up for it!  Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes like mint chocolate, in a really great way. This is the first time that I&#x27;ve ever actually enjoyed the taste of a toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect toothpaste flavor to transition from toddler toothpaste to adult toothpaste.  My 4.5 year old loves it!</li>
            <li> This flavor was a life saver. Pregnancy is weird, and traditional mint basically became the worst taste on the planet that would instantly send me gagging. This toothpaste saved me. My original impression was mint frosted brownies. It def left a clean, refreshing feeling after brushing without sending me into mint-induced convulsions. Now, my baby is 5 months old and mint has lost its grotesqueness, but I still prefer this toothpaste. So, it may sound weird, but give it a try. Another angle to consider, my older kids have just graduated to regular toothpaste, and this keeps them brushing, and brushing well. :)</li>
            <li> Very good and fast shipping</li>
            <li> This toothpaste caused sore gums for me and canker sores on both my kids. It tasted great but we had to stop using it when I realized the toothpaste was the common thing we were all using when the problems arose. We stopped using it and this went away. I am a dental hygienist and I would conclude that we all had an allergic reaction to something in it. We used the spearmint lime flavor prior to this one and had no problems.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE toothpaste!  Leaves a wonderfully minty flavor in my mouth as opposed to some of the icky toothpaste flavors.  I&#x27;m not sure why I can no longer purchase it locally and hope Amazon keeps it in stock for a very long time.  (Oh.  The chocolate flavor is a nice addition, too, for those of use who think chocolate should be in its own stand alone food group!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s something caustic and awful in this toothpaste. It causes pain where it touches the soft tissues in my mouth. After brushing, and for about five minutes afterwards, there&#x27;s a painful sensation on my gums, inner cheek and tongue, as if I had just rinsed my mouth with acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> Normally I just brush with Arm N Hammer for the strong baking soda effect as I&#x27;m not a fan of most toothpaste&#x27;s minty flavors. However this tastes like an Ande&#x27;s mint and I could see myself buying it regularly.. however being I got it at wally world for a dollar in the clearance section it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me that they are on the verge if discontinuing it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have any burning I&#x27;ll be sure to update the review.</li>
            <li> In our family of four, two like plain old mint gel toothpaste, but two of us LOVE more unusual flavors, with the current favorite being Crest Cinnamon Expressions. It has just the right amount of zing to it and it doesn&#x27;t taste like you are brushing your teeth with food. It really has a nice bright taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the interest of exploring new things, we just tried two new Crest flavors, this Be Adventurous Mint Chocolate&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00HB2JPP6 Crest Be Adventurous Mint Chocolate Trek Flavor Toothpaste 4.5 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;and the Crest Be Dynamic Lime Spearmint&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00HB2JPOW Crest Be Dynamic Lime Spearmint Zest Flavor Toothpaste 4.5 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mint Chocolate&lt;br /&gt;The minute you begin brushing your teeth, you get a burst of chocolate taste. Actually, it is probably a burst of smell, not taste, because as you start your brushing, the chocolate taste dissipates very quickly, leaving you with generic mint taste. This dissipation is actually good, because we found the chocolate taste unnerving. It just feels weird to have a chocolate taste in your mouth that you aren&#x27;t going to swallow. So we won&#x27;t be buying this toothpaste again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lime Spearmint&lt;br /&gt;The lime flavoring might give a bit of a boost to the mint taste, but we didn&#x27;t find the citrus taste to be strong. Mostly this toothpaste seemed to be just a strong spearmint flavor. This isn&#x27;t bad, but note that the Be Dynamic and Be Adventurous tubes are only 4.5 ounces each, compared to the 6.0 ounces for the Cinnamon Expressions. Per ounce, the Be Dynamic/Adventurous cost more than the Cinnamon Expressions (and all three of them cost more than standard mint gels). The Lime Spearmint seems so average that it isn&#x27;t worth the extra expense for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the two new Crest flavors, Lime Spearmint and Mint Chocolate are not a fit for our family. We&#x27;ll be sticking with regular mint gels and Cinnamon Expressions:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001G7PLM8 Crest Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening Expressions Cinnamon Rush Flavor Toothpaste 6 Oz (Pack of 6)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy ReaderReader</li>
            <li> This my new favorite toothpaste! It actually tastes like mint chocolate chip ice cream!</li>
            <li> I felt like I was brushing my teeth with Andes candy. A nice change of flavor to freshen my breath in mid-afternoon or before bed. But I couldn&#x27;t handle it for morning when I want my breath to be extra-minty-fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t approve of using saccharin and sorbitol on a regular basis. But since you don&#x27;t swallow toothpaste, I guess this is acceptable. (and obviously necessary that they use something besides sugar to give the chocolate a &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; flavor) Only big complaint is that my mouth started burning about half way through brushing.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be brown in color but it wasn&#x27;t.  You could actually taste the chocolate though.  I bought it because I thought it was unique.  As compared to other brand toothpastes, it is more expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my ten and eight year olds today to encourage them to brush more.  They loved it so I tried it.  Wow!!  It was great.  Chocolate mint toothpaste?!  It made me want to keep brushing.  Would love to try vanilla mint but not sure about lime spearmint.  This stuff is great.  Expensive on amazon though.</li>
            <li> If you like the flavor to begin with it starts out fantastic, but I have noticed that it becomes more &#x27;astringent&#x27; as you continue to brush.  But that could be me.  I recall that someone was describing a feeling of having chocolate &#x27;bits&#x27; or something between their teeth after using this and I can say that is not something I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim.  Thought it would be interesting but I don&#x27;t really like it at all.  I also tried the Vanilla Mint and that&#x27;s much better but not as good as the original Vanilla Mint that Crest discontinued a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Be prepared for something totally different. . The first week I used this, I hated it. It has a really funny aftertaste. However, it is sort of fun, like brushing your mouth with Thin Mints Girl Scout cookies</li>
            <li> Out of all three Crest Be toothpastes, this was probably the one I liked the most. It tasted like those hard candy mint chocolate chip ice cream candies. I seriously felt like I was brushing my teeth with liquid candy! The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth as well as other toothpastes. I need to put more on to get that clean feeling to my teeth. The fact that it also tastes like candy tells my brain that my teeth that they aren&#x27;t clean (minty toothpaste makes me feel clean, these do not). Overall, I prefer a minty toothpaste. This may be good for kids, but be warned they may be more inclined to eat the paste because of the taste. I got this as part of a BZZAgent program but I don&#x27;t know if I will be buying it soon.</li>
            <li> Oh, it&#x27;s so much fun to shake up something as boring and mundane as your toothbrushing routine. This toothpaste does just that! It does taste of minty chocolate, and it does do a good job cleaning your teeth. The mint flavor is the one that lingers. Very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lime one, however, is MUCH more delicious. Give that one a try if you haven&#x27;t -- it&#x27;s like having mojitos before bed and then again for breakfast, except not sad :p</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a weirdo, since I don&#x27;t like mint, cinnamon, or bubble gum flavors (which pretty much makes up about 99% of the toothpaste on the market lol). Needless to say, I&#x27;ve never been particularly excited about brushing my teeth (though, I still do it, of course!). So when I saw &amp;#34;Mint Chocolate&amp;#34; toothpaste, I had to try it. I might not like the flavors I listed above, but I sure do like chocolate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste did NOT disappoint. It is soooo yummy! It&#x27;s like brushing your teeth with an Andes mint! The chocolate keeps the mint from being overpowering, though it still leaves your mouth feeling clean! I actually look forward to brushing my teeth now... which is a rather huge accomplishment. I really, really hope they never discontinue this product. Well done, Crest!</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life completely. Before I bought Crest Mint Chocolate Trek, I never brushed my teeth, and now I just can&#x27;t stop brushing. The flavor is exactly like mint chocolate chip ice cream, and the first time I used it I actually swallowed it because it tasted so similar. It&#x27;s so good I just can&#x27;t stop brushing. Sometimes I&#x27;ll be at work, and I&#x27;ll just be in the mood, and pull out my toothpaste and toothbrush and enjoy the explosion of flavor in my mouth; just to brighten up my day. I now brush my teeth at least 5-10 times a day now, which I&#x27;m pretty sure is bad for the enamel, but the flavor is just so addicting! If you aren&#x27;t satisfied with regular, plain-old mint toothpaste, this product is for you. HAPPY BRUSHING!!!</li>
            <li> I was afraid of this stuff. I mean who wants to brush their teeth with chocolate, but then my love for all things chocolate mint won out and I bought some. Then I bought more when that tube was gone. It does taste great, and my teeth feel clean. You&#x27;re not getting a rush of minty freshness from it though, so if you want that, you&#x27;ll need to follow it with some mouth wash. But as for teeth cleaning it works great.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend and sent it to Australia. They said it was amazing how much it really tasted like chocolate then at the end went slightly minty. I might just have to buy some for myself to try.</li>
            <li> I came on here to see if any other people had the &amp;#34;allergic reaction&amp;#34; to this toothpaste. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what it is (and it&#x27;s only affecting some people) or if it&#x27;s having this effect on a lot of people, but there only seem to be a few commenting on it. I really loved the flavor of this toothpaste and wish it didn&#x27;t make my mouth hurt. I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to a product like this before, so I don&#x27;t know what advice I&#x27;d offer someone interested in buying this product. I guess it&#x27;s a gamble - either you&#x27;ll have a reaction, like those of us in the &amp;#34;one star&amp;#34; section, or you won&#x27;t like I&#x27;m assuming those in the &amp;#34;five star&amp;#34; section didn&#x27;t. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I really like the taste of the toothpaste. Mkaes mouth feel clean without being overpowering</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really taste of anything - if you closed your eyes you would think it was mild mint flavor.  I&#x27;d rather have zesty orange or something.</li>
            <li> Minty fresh.  Love it</li>
            <li> The taste is very good</li>
            <li> This definitely tastes exactly like what it says and it tastes really well. When I stated brushing though the inside of my mouth starting burning really bad and I think I had an allergic reaction as well. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an ingredient in there that&#x27;s making everyone get reactions but this needs to be improved. If there was no burning I would love it</li>
            <li> Hi, I bought this at Kroger in the back shelf discount section. I knew something was wrong with this, toothpaste on sale and its experimental? I do not recommend this product for anyone because it stings the tongue while your brushing your teeth, not even brushing your tongue. This is a defective product of poor design. It tastes pretty good, just not worth it. Went online to see if anyone else was having this same problem. Turns out they are as you can see. You were warned. Maybe another flavor though?</li>
            <li> So I just tried this toothpaste out, and it was pretty tasty- chocolate-y, minty, all around good flavor. I would have been so happy with this toothpaste except after use, my tongue feels like it was burned;  almost comparable to that numb, painful feeling after you were too hasty not letting your Hot Pocket cool down.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a nice departure from the traditional minty flavored pastes. It was not chocolately enough for me though...it was more minty than chocolate. And it did not foam/lather enough for me.</li>
            <li> So I love chocolate mint ice cream,but this toothpaste is not for me. When I decided to use this toothpaste I was very excited I thought brush my teeth with chocolate! Life couldn&#x27;t get any better. When I used it for the first time I was not impressed. The tooth paste is kind of gritty and it tasted like watered down chocolate and mint. This was a great idea but I think it needs more work if it wants to be successful.</li>
            <li> The absolute best. Idk what i will do if crest stops making this.</li>
            <li> Like any other decent human being, I brush my teeth at least two times a day. And like any other decent human being, I get bored pretty quickly with the routine. Enter chocolate flavored toothpaste. It sounds like a dream come true and it is -  until it literally feels like your tongue is on fire afterwards. A thousand piercing needles dancing on your tongue is one way for me to describe it. I don&#x27;t know yet why I experience this, and even more interesingly that my fiancee does not, but it ruins what is otherwise a very pleasant experience and change in pace in the boring toothpaste world . The only other negative thing about this is it does not leave that clean, super minty taste that a standard toothpaste does. I imagine it&#x27;s as effective in cleaning your teeth,  but in terms of after brushing freshness, it seems this does not provide that.</li>
            <li> I liked the taste but I didn&#x27;t like the apparent pain it caused me. I think I had an allergic reaction because I had a weird sensation across my mouth and a pain underneath my tongue. Had to rinse my mouth out to make it stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it was worth the couple bucks I paid to have my first allergic experience.</li>
            <li> The kids love this flavor :)  My daughter is a huge chocolate mint fan :)  If your kids don&#x27;t like mint (my son) this is not the flavored paste for you.</li>
            <li> My daughters favorite.</li>
