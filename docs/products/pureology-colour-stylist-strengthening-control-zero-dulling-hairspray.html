            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  It does not create build up on my hair.  It is easily washed out.  My hair is manageable, yet the product does an excellent job at maintaining the style.  I will definitely continue using this hair spray.</li>

            <li> Highly recommended by well known hair stylist&#x27;s. Great product.</li>
            <li> Hairspray was really really old and my Grandaughter was by me when I sprayed the first spray on my hair and she said&amp;#34;What is that bad smell Oma? I said bad old hair spray. The same thing they wanted me to send this back and they new they have to know that their buying old product. What a shame it was a lot when you add the two together 40 some dollars I could not afford they are in the garbadge.</li>
            <li> This product holds well and does not seem sticky. Great stuff. This product is not like all the hair sprays on the shelves of the stores. I believe all pureology products are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Another effective Pureology product that delivers with one, \\&quot;SPSHHHHHHHHHH\\&quot;/spray.

            <li> I have been using Pureology products for more than eight years and swear by them! However, I do not like this product - it smells bad and the stench lingers for several hours after using the product.</li>
            <li> I have used Pureology shampoo and conditioner and really like the product. Had not tried the hairspray before, but found it to be gentle, yet firm on fine hair. I really like it and plan to continue to use it. It is not sticky, either.</li>

            <li> Shame on you Pureology!  This is the worst hairspray I have ever used.  The smell is horrible... not a perfume... just something gone bad.  Not only did this spray not hold my hairstyle, within an hour, the curl was flat!  Later, I could not comb it through without breakage.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. ( I use other Pureology products with good results.  This one is a miss.)</li>
            <li> Hair still looks clean and fresh after using.  Doesn&#x27;t yellow my white hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a very long time and is thrilled to be able to pay less on amazon. com</li>

            <li> Love this hairspray.  Keeps my hair soft yet in place.  And it doesn&#x27;t fade my hair color!  Lasts forever as well!  Will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> Great spray---holds well and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; your hair all up with residue.  It may be a little more pricy than other brands but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love Pureology products.  This hairspray gives great control without being sticky.  It has a very nice scent.  Best hairspray ever!</li>
            <li> Has great light hold and a great smell.  My hair actually moves with this spray.  I also get many compliments on the smell.</li>
            <li> This hairspray has a nice smell to it and doesn&#x27;t go on too heavy.  As long as you spray it far away from your head, it won&#x27;t leave white residue like many hairsprays when it dries.</li>

            <li> Never stiff or sticky it is a great product  I have been using for nine months and I love it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the produce I ordered. What I got was a knock off, and the top was broken. Life and learn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no different than any other hairspray product....although it doesn&#x27;t have a very pleasant smell. Someone told me this spray was good for your hair, but I don&#x27;t know about that.</li>
            <li> I know it is just a strengthening control spray, but I was hoping it would hold my hair style in the humidity and also a little in the wind.  After all I live in Kansas..  It is a very easy to use hair spray and I don&#x27;t know about the strengthening yet, but hope it helps with split ends from the wind.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and its not to sticky you can put your fingers through your hair yet it holds your hair</li>
