            <li>nice minty scent use it all yr around</li>
            <li>Sometimes you get that nice, tingly feeling, but not all the time.</li>
            <li>Your scalp has a nice tingling when using it from the mint.</li>
            <li>Now he specifically requests that I get him this kind of shampoo.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Better alternative is the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile liquid soaps.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and it feels like it is cleaning your scalp very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a cheap shampoo kind of guy, because, well, I&#x27;m a guy.</li>

            <li>The shampoo is refreshing.</li>

            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally love peppermint, if you don&#x27;t you may not like this.</li>

            <li>Also everyone&#x27;s head varies).One of my favorite things about this shampoo though is that tingling</li>

            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make me 20 again or sexy or create flowing locks of hair.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m 99% sure that Paul Mitchell doesn&#x27;t test on animals or use ingredients that have been tested on animals.</li>
            <li>Your girl will like your hair smelling all nice and clean too.</li>
            <li>If you like a nice minty/lavenderish stimulating shampoo that eliminates scalp irritation, use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Special Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Higher priced but good quality</li>
            <li>This brand is becoming my favorite.</li>
            <li>Absolutely perfect for combination dry scalp/oily hair.</li>
            <li>The tea tree acts as a mild disinfectant and has a nice tingle to it.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old son uses this shampoo to fight dandruff and to keep his hair smelling great.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more readily available in stores.</li>
            <li>Buy full price!</li>
            <li>Smells very good and keeps hair soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>Makes my scalp feel clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>and I love how clean my scalp feels after.  </li>
            <li>Strong smell.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest this to anyone that is looking for a strong shampoo that will make your scalp tingle.</li>
            <li>But not too strong....</li>
            <li>Hands down the best shampoo ever.</li>
            <li>it seems fine and doesn&#x27;t strip my hair but does cleanse it thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I really dislike the way it smells, it is very medicinal (and not in a pleasant way).  </li>
            <li>You will get a huge bottle if you buy where you get your hair cut.</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for several years and it works great.</li>
            <li>A great shampoo, especially for scalp issues.</li>
            <li>It did clean my hair fine, and I like the cooling feel of Tea Tree.</li>
            <li>Package does not seem original.</li>
            <li>My hair feels really clean after use.</li>
            <li>The shampoo tingles your scalp leaving it feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This is great for a dry scalp.</li>
            <li>and I really fell in love.</li>
            <li>Check out info on Good Guide or Skin Deep.</li>
            <li>You will get a kind of cool burn with you use it, and you really don&#x27;t have to use much at all.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It leaves your scalp feeling fresh and tingly from the mint.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this has completely resolved the issue, but it seems to work better than anything else he has tried.  </li>
            <li>These are certainly minty and even our older boys love using it.  </li>
            <li>I never really felt the need to have good quality shampoo, and I&#x27;m pretty darn frugal with stuff like that.</li>
            <li>Hair smells good and remains nice and soft after a hard days work.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a cool tingling feeling and makes your hair very soft and full.</li>
            <li>Excellent, expensive but worth the money.</li>
            <li>literally the day of my first use</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a larger bottle (my fault for not noticing), but I noticed that Hair Cuttery had a much better price yesterday when I took kids for cuts.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has oily hair and this really helps!</li>
            <li>Think it losts its luster after the first week of using the product.</li>
            <li>It also seems my hair shines more,people like around you often will more than likely</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s safe to say for me personally that I will resuming purchasing this shampoo from now on.</li>
            <li>Very invigorating first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos to stop flaky from my dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>It is very minty and when you leave it on your hair for a few minutes it feels cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>What if this really is the real deal?  </li>
            <li>I have ordered it three times from amazon so as you can see I am not overly concerned with whether this is real or not.  </li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m very prone to breakouts)</li>
            <li>I use the conditioner as well and really like both of them.</li>
            <li>Quality is avg-good, expected much better product and effect.</li>
            <li>The price is too darn high though!</li>
            <li>Doesnt really help with dandruff</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like paying so much for shampoo</li>
            <li>Works really well in summer when insects are out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite pricey, so I expected more from it.</li>
            <li>This Paul Mitchell product is very pricy...</li>
            <li>It also contains many other harmful petrochemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair feels extra clean</li>
            <li>Super awesome shampoo, especially the smell and cold chills on your skin</li>
            <li>But if you enjoy a revitalizing shampoo session, and have no major scalp issues, then this is the product for you!</li>
            <li>If you have dry, blistery, itchy, scalp check the fine print on your shampoo ingredients.</li>
            <li>but your hair will feel fantastic in the long run</li>
            <li>This size bottle lasts me (full head of hair and big beard) about 5 months.</li>
            <li>My old barber/hairstylist first used this on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years and would not consider using any other!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really define it,but I suppose I feel fresh like a giant mint on my hair.lol.</li>
            <li>i enjoy the smell of tea tree, just be careful as this will burn your eyes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s Paul Mitchell, it&#x27;s great quality, it&#x27;s also just too expensive for the size</li>
            <li>I love the tingle when I lather up my head and let it sit for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>hair is very soft and shiny now.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and residue-free!</li>
            <li>Also the bottle was clearly used and filled with some other product.</li>
            <li>scent is not bad as expected.</li>
            <li>I typically pick up generic shampoo, but wanted something a bit more invigorating.  </li>
            <li>There are many different kinds of sulfates - no matter, they all do the same thing, dry your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I like the sent, My scalp feels cleaner not dried out .</li>
            <li>I mean I love the smell</li>
            <li>earthy scent takes a little getting used to but not a chemical smell or a sweet cover-up smell.</li>
            <li>The packaging was a little off, the lid had leaks some shampoo out but all in all it was still full.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and my scalp gets itchy and this shampoo is really soothing and cooling to my skin.</li>
            <li>really well without leaving my hair too dry and frizzy (even without conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tingling feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mint consistent calms down itches of my scalp</li>
            <li>It will further dry you hair and scalp, If you keep asking yourself \\&quot;I wonder why I have to use so much cream rinse after I wash my hair\\&quot; ???</li>

            <li> The tea tree acts as a mild disinfectant and has a nice tingle to it.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old son uses this shampoo to fight dandruff and to keep his hair smelling great.</li>
            <li> I wish it was more readily available in stores.</li>

            <li> Hands down the best shampoo ever.</li>
            <li> it seems fine and doesn&#x27;t strip my hair but does cleanse it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I really dislike the way it smells, it is very medicinal (and not in a pleasant way).  </li>
            <li> You will get a huge bottle if you buy where you get your hair cut.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for several years and it works great.</li>

            <li> You will get a kind of cool burn with you use it, and you really don&#x27;t have to use much at all.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It leaves your scalp feeling fresh and tingly from the mint.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this has completely resolved the issue, but it seems to work better than anything else he has tried.  </li>
            <li> These are certainly minty and even our older boys love using it.  </li>
            <li> I never really felt the need to have good quality shampoo, and I&#x27;m pretty darn frugal with stuff like that.</li>
            <li> Hair smells good and remains nice and soft after a hard days work.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a cool tingling feeling and makes your hair very soft and full.</li>
            <li> Excellent, expensive but worth the money.</li>
            <li> literally the day of my first use</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a larger bottle (my fault for not noticing), but I noticed that Hair Cuttery had a much better price yesterday when I took kids for cuts.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has oily hair and this really helps!</li>
            <li> Think it losts its luster after the first week of using the product.</li>
            <li> It also seems my hair shines more,people like around you often will more than likely</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s safe to say for me personally that I will resuming purchasing this shampoo from now on.</li>
            <li> Very invigorating first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos to stop flaky from my dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> It is very minty and when you leave it on your hair for a few minutes it feels cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li> What if this really is the real deal?  </li>
            <li> I have ordered it three times from amazon so as you can see I am not overly concerned with whether this is real or not.  </li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m very prone to breakouts)</li>
            <li> I use the conditioner as well and really like both of them.</li>
            <li> Quality is avg-good, expected much better product and effect.</li>
            <li> The price is too darn high though!</li>
            <li> Doesnt really help with dandruff</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like paying so much for shampoo</li>
            <li> Works really well in summer when insects are out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite pricey, so I expected more from it.</li>
            <li> This Paul Mitchell product is very pricy...</li>
            <li> It also contains many other harmful petrochemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair feels extra clean</li>
            <li> Super awesome shampoo, especially the smell and cold chills on your skin</li>
            <li> But if you enjoy a revitalizing shampoo session, and have no major scalp issues, then this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> If you have dry, blistery, itchy, scalp check the fine print on your shampoo ingredients.</li>
            <li> but your hair will feel fantastic in the long run</li>
            <li> This size bottle lasts me (full head of hair and big beard) about 5 months.</li>
            <li> My old barber/hairstylist first used this on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and would not consider using any other!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really define it,but I suppose I feel fresh like a giant mint on my hair.lol.</li>
            <li> i enjoy the smell of tea tree, just be careful as this will burn your eyes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s Paul Mitchell, it&#x27;s great quality, it&#x27;s also just too expensive for the size</li>
            <li> I love the tingle when I lather up my head and let it sit for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> hair is very soft and shiny now.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and residue-free!</li>
            <li> Also the bottle was clearly used and filled with some other product.</li>
            <li> scent is not bad as expected.</li>
            <li> I typically pick up generic shampoo, but wanted something a bit more invigorating.  </li>
            <li> There are many different kinds of sulfates - no matter, they all do the same thing, dry your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I like the sent, My scalp feels cleaner not dried out .</li>
            <li> I mean I love the smell</li>
            <li> earthy scent takes a little getting used to but not a chemical smell or a sweet cover-up smell.</li>
            <li> The packaging was a little off, the lid had leaks some shampoo out but all in all it was still full.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and my scalp gets itchy and this shampoo is really soothing and cooling to my skin.</li>
            <li> really well without leaving my hair too dry and frizzy (even without conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tingling feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This mint consistent calms down itches of my scalp</li>
            <li> It will further dry you hair and scalp, If you keep asking yourself \\&quot;I wonder why I have to use so much cream rinse after I wash my hair\\&quot; ???</li>
            <li> My husband normally couldn&#x27;t care less about what type of shampoo we had in the house.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a long lasting tingling effect though, but I do believe this will help someone with oily hair, if you have dandruff, or just an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> dandruff problems Dandruff and dry scalp are significantly different problems.</li>
            <li> REMEMBER Dandriff and DRY Scalp are two vastly different problems.</li>
            <li> If you have very dry hair and your scalp isn&#x27;t itchy, I recommend you don&#x27;t use it as a daily shampoo.</li>
            <li> O will continue to use it as long as it is working for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was concerned it might be too drying for my hair type, but as long as I do a pre-poo</li>
            <li> In other words, no long term effects.</li>
            <li> My scalp doesn&#x27;t feel any different, or any less itchy, the very next day after washing.</li>
            <li> I alternate between using clearasil ultra and this every other day as a face wash and haven&#x27;t had a break out in months</li>
            <li> Helps my dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it, but my son does for dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> Also leaves your hair really dry, but I didn&#x27;t buy the conditioner (didn&#x27;t feel like paying another $25-30)</li>
            <li> Oily scalp that is also dry?</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the effects of this shampoo seem only to last as long as you&#x27;re actively washing your hair.</li>
            <li> Three weeks later I have minimal flaking and no longer am concerned about wearing dark colored shirts.</li>
            <li> Only need a little</li>
            <li> I only use the shampoo since I prefer using a heavy mask as conditioner and detangler.</li>
            <li> I had been introduced to this product a few years back</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s not really this shampoo&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> It does not matter what other ingredients are in the shampoo, if #2 is sulfate, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Prior to this,I would sometimes use Head &amp; Shoulders,that was never consistant or hardly worked(I&#x27;m not implying this is</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and if I end up having an Herbal Essences moment in the shower, I will update my review and assume this amazon version is either watered down or not legitimate.</li>
            <li> Discounted brand name shampoo equals watered down product.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I saw less flaking.  </li>
            <li> Received the package and could smell the tea tree scent before opening the box and when opened half of the contents had leaked into a plastic bag the product was wrapped in.</li>
            <li> So in my estimation, this isn&#x27;t the shampoo to buy if you have serious scalp issues as it doesn&#x27;t have a lasting effect</li>
            <li> I am angry at these shampoo companies that add these cheap ingredients and then make false claims.</li>
            <li> but I am still a little apprehensive about its authenticity.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing amazing but nothing horrible either.</li>
            <li> Just apply and let it sit for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I got my money back because of his false advertising.</li>
            <li> Sulfates treat dandruff by drying out the excessive oil on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Manliest shampoo ever, feels like a thousand tiny cold fairy hands on your head and smells like a baby angels breath.</li>
            <li> Very expensive, but for occasional use, it leaves your scalp feeling so refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a minty feeling, gets cold when it&#x27;s cold outside</li>
            <li> Not a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li> my hair looks thin and shine</li>
            <li> Packaged poorly and didn&#x27;t make the trip.</li>
            <li> think it might make worse,</li>
            <li> Keeps scalp from getting dry and prevents those annoying flakes too.  </li>
            <li> Product was too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was slightly skeptical about purchasing a shampoo product at this price.</li>
            <li> This was a bad deal...</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in shipping, the bottle was leaking.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and dissatisfied</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not a great shampoo.  Strong smell.  Not the same shampoo PM was selling back when they sold through salons.  Better alternative is the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile liquid soaps.  They make a tea tree which is great for hair .. earthy scent takes a little getting used to but not a chemical smell or a sweet cover-up smell.</li>
            <li> Very good cleansing and refreshing shampoo. Smells great and it&#x27;s all I want to use.</li>
            <li> It always helps me refresh my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and almost all of my head itching is gone, I also don&#x27;t see any flakes coming off my head now. O will continue to use it as long as it is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very soft and shiny now.</li>
            <li> These are certainly minty and even our older boys love using it.  Smells great and it feels like it is cleaning your scalp very well. Only shampoo for my hubby.</li>
            <li> If you like a nice minty/lavenderish stimulating shampoo that eliminates scalp irritation, use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Special Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a cheap shampoo kind of guy, because, well, I&#x27;m a guy. I never really felt the need to have good quality shampoo, and I&#x27;m pretty darn frugal with stuff like that. Someone bought it for me as a gift and I really fell in love. You will get a kind of cool burn with you use it, and you really don&#x27;t have to use much at all. This size bottle lasts me (full head of hair and big beard) about 5 months. I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love the tingle when I lather up my head and let it sit for a few minutes.  I only use the shampoo since I prefer using a heavy mask as conditioner and detangler.</li>
            <li> my hair looks thin and shine</li>
            <li> Smells nice. My hair feels good. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this shampoo and I just love it.  I have dry skin and my scalp gets itchy and this shampoo is really soothing and cooling to my skin.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was leaking when I received it. Is there anything that can be done?</li>
            <li> This is a very refreshing shampoo.  I typically pick up generic shampoo, but wanted something a bit more invigorating.  This hits that mark 100% and then some.  It leaves your scalp feeling fresh and tingly from the mint.  It is especially refreshing when using it in the shower after sitting in the sauna for a while.</li>
            <li> My old barber/hairstylist first used this on my hair.  Ever since than I&#x27;ve kept using it.  Hair smells good and remains nice and soft after a hard days work.  Keeps scalp from getting dry and prevents those annoying flakes too.  Your girl will like your hair smelling all nice and clean too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Tea Tree oil tingles and smells great.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Makes my scalp feel clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect for combination dry scalp/oily hair. My daughter was allergic to almost everything we tried until this. I hope we are never without it.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best shampoo ever. I don&#x27;t need any scalp fix or whatever the tea tree oil is supposed to do, I bought it because my barber uses it during shampoos after a haircut and it feels incredible (tingly and invigorating) on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos to stop flaky from my dry scalp.  Neem oil shampoo was my last attempt and it helped, but didn&#x27;t fix the problem.  I saw immediate results with this shampoo...literally the day of my first use I saw less flaking.  Three weeks later I have minimal flaking and no longer am concerned about wearing dark colored shirts.</li>
            <li> i enjoy the smell of tea tree, just be careful as this will burn your eyes.  Only need a little</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo - it&#x27;s so invigorating - just love the feel of it.&lt;br /&gt;I regularly use it with the their Hair and Scalp Treatment.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Manliest shampoo ever, feels like a thousand tiny cold fairy hands on your head and smells like a baby angels breath.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but it did not help my scalp. Also it was not packaged well and some had leaked into the box.</li>
            <li> My fianc√© and I both LOVE this shampoo! The tea tree acts as a mild disinfectant and has a nice tingle to it. It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and residue-free!</li>
            <li> Product was too expensive.  This was a bad deal... I thought I was getting a larger bottle (my fault for not noticing), but I noticed that Hair Cuttery had a much better price yesterday when I took kids for cuts.  Shucks!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Minty. tingly. Cleans well!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo but I am still a little apprehensive about its authenticity.  Paul Mitchell states in order to prevent counterfit products, buy this product only at an authorized salon.  But then I pay more?  What if this really is the real deal?  I mean I love the smell and I love how clean my scalp feels after.  I have ordered it three times from amazon so as you can see I am not overly concerned with whether this is real or not.  It does what it is supposed to do.  But someday, I am going to buy it from the salon and if I end up having an Herbal Essences moment in the shower, I will update my review and assume this amazon version is either watered down or not legitimate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and would not consider using any other!</li>
            <li> Higher priced but good quality</li>
            <li> BEWARE! This shampoo contains Cocamide DEA. Cocamide DEA is linked to cancer! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It also contains many other harmful petrochemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: [...]</li>
            <li> Amazing product... Cleans and refreshes hair and scalp... Even helps with acne a bit...</li>
            <li> product is great, been using it for years. two stars off for the shipping.. it arrived in a wedge shaped box with no protection and was leaking all over the place. probably lost about a 1/8 of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo daily and I rub my eyelashes after I do my hair. Helps to keep tear ducts flowing. Smells good.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is refreshing. The fragrance is delightful. My hair feels really clean after use. But I think one outstanding bonus that has not seen mentioned, is when I take a shower. After massaging the Tea Tree special  in my hair, I spread the foam onto my face, and I get an excellent shave! I don&#x27;t use shaving cream anymore ‚Äì the shave I get is just as good as any shave cream I have used. The great thing is the convenience and the time I save.</li>
            <li> Received the package and could smell the tea tree scent before opening the box and when opened half of the contents had leaked into a plastic bag the product was wrapped in.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this.  He has psoriasis and this is the only shampoo he&#x27;ll use.  Seems too work well.  A bottle this size will last him a while since he doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair...ha,ha!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo. It leaves a cool tingling feeling and makes your hair very soft and full. Believe it or not, it makes a great face cleanser also. I alternate between using clearasil ultra and this every other day as a face wash and haven&#x27;t had a break out in months (and I&#x27;m very prone to breakouts)</li>
            <li> I feels like a spa treatment. For one moment in my hectic day I get some moment of relaxation. It kind of tingles too, love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally love peppermint, if you don&#x27;t you may not like this.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for several years and it works great. I use the conditioner as well and really like both of them.</li>
            <li> Packaged poorly and didn&#x27;t make the trip.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my son and it took care of his itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Package does not seem original. Quality is avg-good, expected much better product and effect.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! My daughter has oily hair and this really helps! I was disappointed in shipping, the bottle was leaking.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo. The price is too darn high though!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Very invigorating first thing in the morning. You only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> hair feels extra clean</li>
            <li> The shampoo works great, but it&#x27;s very hazardous and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it. Check out info on Good Guide or Skin Deep.</li>
            <li> For reference I have relaxed african american hair. I bought this to soothe my scalp and that it does! I was concerned it might be too drying for my hair type, but as long as I do a pre-poo it seems fine and doesn&#x27;t strip my hair but does cleanse it thoroughly. It feels amazing on my scalp! A nice, cooling sensation. My only complaint is that the effects of this shampoo seem only to last as long as you&#x27;re actively washing your hair. In other words, no long term effects. My scalp doesn&#x27;t feel any different, or any less itchy, the very next day after washing. Sometimes, it itches the very same day of washing. So in my estimation, this isn&#x27;t the shampoo to buy if you have serious scalp issues as it doesn&#x27;t have a lasting effect (honestly, the product is not marketed to be medicated). But if you enjoy a revitalizing shampoo session, and have no major scalp issues, then this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> Helps my dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Arrived just as described. Would buy again...for sure!</li>
            <li> Super awesome shampoo, especially the smell and cold chills on your skin</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smells great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cleans really well without leaving my hair too dry and frizzy (even without conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tingling feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Paul Mitchell, it&#x27;s great quality, it&#x27;s also just too expensive for the size</li>
            <li> I like the sent, My scalp feels cleaner not dried out .</li>
            <li> A great shampoo, especially for scalp issues.</li>
            <li> Tingles , cleans well. Think it losts its luster after the first week of using the product. Doesnt really help with dandruff think it might make worse,</li>
            <li> Best clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy again. Works great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it, but my son does for dry scalp.  I can&#x27;t say this has completely resolved the issue, but it seems to work better than anything else he has tried.  And it smells really good.</li>
            <li> fast delivery and great results</li>
            <li> Works well. My daughter love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite I have been using this for years..</li>
            <li> I was slightly skeptical about purchasing a shampoo product at this price.However,I was told it&#x27;s cheaper online compared to the salon counter.After reading several reviews I finally gave in.I must say I&#x27;m glad I invested in this Paul Mitchell product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I can&#x27;t speak for everyone,one of the things I notice is it removed my dandruff on my scalp and haven&#x27;t had dandruff since.Prior to this,I would sometimes use Head &amp; Shoulders,that was never consistant or hardly worked(I&#x27;m not implying this is a dandruff treatment btw just something I noticed.Also everyone&#x27;s head varies).One of my favorite things about this shampoo though is that tingling/cool feeling it leaves on your hair.I can&#x27;t really define it,but I suppose I feel fresh like a giant mint on my hair.lol.It also seems my hair shines more,people like around you often will more than likely notice.haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s safe to say for me personally that I will resuming purchasing this shampoo from now on.</li>
            <li> I had been introduced to this product a few years back and it is a great shampoo. I would suggest this to anyone that is looking for a strong shampoo that will make your scalp tingle.</li>
            <li> The shampoo tingles your scalp leaving it feeling clean and refreshed. I don&#x27;t like paying so much for shampoo but I like the results.</li>
            <li> Works really well in summer when insects are out. Don&#x27;t like the smell so stay away. But not too strong....nice minty scent use it all yr around</li>
            <li> You will get a huge bottle if you buy where you get your hair cut. This is not worth the money. The product is awesome though.</li>
            <li> Very Very Nice product. I like it. I will buy them again. Very comfortable. This brand is becoming my favorite.</li>
            <li> The shampoo&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s nothing amazing but nothing horrible either. Sometimes you get that nice, tingly feeling, but not all the time. Also leaves your hair really dry, but I didn&#x27;t buy the conditioner (didn&#x27;t feel like paying another $25-30) so that&#x27;s not really this shampoo&#x27;s fault. Good for what it is, but I made the switch to Head and Shoulder&#x27;s &amp;#34;Refresh&amp;#34; shampoo and it&#x27;s just as good but for about 1/5th of the price of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This mint consistent calms down itches of my scalp and I feel it cleans more!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not bad as expected.</li>
            <li> It was a good item, and a good decision to buy. I recommend this for people who are on a budget.</li>
            <li> Good bottle, amazing smell , and keeps the scalp clean.&lt;br /&gt; I used it now for two weeks , the itch and the dandruff are reducing.</li>
            <li> My friend initially recommended I try this shampoo.  Very expensive, but for occasional use, it leaves your scalp feeling so refreshed.  Just apply and let it sit for a few minutes and you will understand.</li>
            <li> Discounted brand name shampoo equals watered down product. Buy full price!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Tea Tree is the best.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo. Smells very good and keeps hair soft and fresh. Love the smell of it, feels great!</li>
            <li> My 13 year old son uses this shampoo to fight dandruff and to keep his hair smelling great. Good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I really dislike the way it smells, it is very medicinal (and not in a pleasant way).  It&#x27;s quite pricey, so I expected more from it. A bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Regular shampoo dries my scalp and makes it itch. This does not.</li>
            <li> Came with 75% of the product. Also the bottle was clearly used and filled with some other product. I am very disappointed and dissatisfied</li>
            <li> Works great for my son&#x27;s oily hair. We can&#x27;t always buy Paul Mitchell products, so those times we can&#x27;t he relies on Regis DESIGNLINE Tea Tree shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t compare though to Paul Mitchell products. It will tingle a lot. It doesn&#x27;t have a long lasting tingling effect though, but I do believe this will help someone with oily hair, if you have dandruff, or just an itchy scalp. My son uses this with the conditioner that goes with it, and soon we are going to try to get him the Tea Tree treatment. If you have very dry hair and your scalp isn&#x27;t itchy, I recommend you don&#x27;t use it as a daily shampoo.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Does the job. Didn&#x27;t make me 20 again or sexy or create flowing locks of hair. It did clean my hair fine, and I like the cooling feel of Tea Tree.</li>
            <li> This product claims to be nourishing to the hair and scalp, It&#x27;s second ingredient is SULFATE. Sulfate dries the hair and the scalp. Sulfates are used to treat dandruff problems Dandruff and dry scalp are significantly different problems. I am angry at these shampoo companies that add these cheap ingredients and then make false claims. THIS PRODUCT WILL NOT NURISH YOUR SCALP. It will further dry you hair and scalp, If you keep asking yourself \\&quot;I wonder why I have to use so much cream rinse after I wash my hair\\&quot; ??? I&#x27;ll bet you your shampoo has sulfates. There are many different kinds of sulfates - no matter, they all do the same thing, dry your hair and scalp. It does not matter what other ingredients are in the shampoo, if #2 is sulfate, don&#x27;t buy it. This Paul Mitchell product is very pricy... I got my money back because of his false advertising. REMEMBER Dandriff and DRY Scalp are two vastly different problems. Sulfates treat dandruff by drying out the excessive oil on your scalp.If you have dry, blistery, itchy, scalp check the fine print on your shampoo ingredients. ALSO, it is speculated that the build up of sulfates on the pours or root of the hair shaft on the head causes hair loss. Buyer beware of sulfates in shampoo and the harm they cause.</li>
            <li> Oily scalp that is also dry? Try this. I wish it was more readily available in stores. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product. I will use nothing else.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great shampoo to use for oily skin.  Leaves a minty feeling, gets cold when it&#x27;s cold outside but your hair will feel fantastic in the long run</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Paul Mitchell and this shampoo doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It&#x27;s cleansing and refreshing- great for men and women. And I&#x27;m 99% sure that Paul Mitchell doesn&#x27;t test on animals or use ingredients that have been tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Excellent, expensive but worth the money.</li>
            <li> Product is amazing, works great. The packaging was a little off, the lid had leaks some shampoo out but all in all it was still full.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo. It is very minty and when you leave it on your hair for a few minutes it feels cool and refreshing. Your scalp has a nice tingling when using it from the mint. This is great for a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My husband normally couldn&#x27;t care less about what type of shampoo we had in the house.  Then, his mom got him this as a gift.  He LOVES the tingle/mint of this shampoo.  Now he specifically requests that I get him this kind of shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great shampoo. It&#x27;s all about that tingle. It took care of my dandruff problem too. A bit too pricey for the size, but the product is very good.</li>
